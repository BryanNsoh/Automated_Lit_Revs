  description: Assessing the effectiveness of vegetation restoration along the Yangtze
    River shoreline and exploring its relationship with land use changes are imperative
    for providing recommendations for sustainable management and environmental protection.
    However, the impact of vegetation restoration post-implementation of the Yangtze
    River Conservation Project remains uncertain. In this study, utilizing Sentinel-2
    satellite imagery and Dynamic World land use data from pre- (2016) and post- (2022)
    Yangtze River Conservation Project periods, pixel-based binary models, transition
    matrices, and geographically weighted regression models were employed to analyze
    the status and evolution of vegetation coverage along the Yangtze River shoreline.
    The results indicated that there had been an increase in the area covered by high
    and high-medium vegetation levels. The proportion of vegetation cover shifting
    to better was 4201.87 km2 (35.68%). Hotspots of vegetation coverage improvement
    were predominantly located along the Yangtze River. Moreover, areas witnessing
    enhanced vegetation coverage experienced notable land use changes, notably the
    conversion of water to crops (126.93 km2, 22.79%), trees to crops (59.93 km2,
    10.76%), and crops to built area (59.93 km2, 10.76%). Notably, the conversion
    between crops and built area emerged as a significant factor influencing vegetation
    coverage improvement, with average regression coefficients of 0.68 and 0.50, respectively.
    These outcomes underscore the significance of this study in guiding ecological
    environmental protection and sustainable management along the Yangtze River shoreline.

    Yangtze River, pivotal for national strategic development, possesses significant
    geographical advantages, abundant resources, thriving industries, a robust labor
    force, and a vast market1,2. It plays paramount role in fostering high-quality
    economic development, promoting green principles, constructing to China''s beauty,
    and advancing ecological civilization3,4. However, economic growth pressures have
    severely degraded the Yangtze River Basin''s environment5. The 20th National Congress
    emphasized ecological civilization construction, advocating green development
    and harmonious human-nature coexistence6. Since 2016, the Yangtze River Conservation
    proposal has made restoring the river''s ecology crucial7. Anhui Province, as
    the link to the Yangtze River Economic Belt, has placed the restoration of the
    Yangtze River''s ecological environment in a prominent position, focusing on greening
    the shoreline. It has delineated the \"1515\" shoreline classification and control
    red line (1 km, 5 km, and 15 km along the river), and has undertaken large-scale
    greening along both banks of the Yangtze River main stream8,9,10. Therefore, we
    evaluated the effectiveness of vegetation restoration within the 15 km defense
    line of the Yangtze River basin (Anhui section) and explored its response to changes
    in land use. This is of great significance for the in-depth implementation of
    the Yangtze River Conservation strategy and for safeguarding the ecological security
    along the Yangtze River in Anhui. Vegetation plays a vital role in Earth''s ecosystem,
    acting as a crucial link between humans and the environment, and maintaining ecological
    balance11. Vegetation cover serves as a primary indicator for assessing ecological
    equilibrium within a region12. Researchers have extensively investigated the correlation
    between vegetation cover and natural factors such as extreme weather, precipitation,
    and temperature13,14,15, alongside examining the impacts of human activities such
    as land use, urbanization, and ecological engineering on vegetation cover16,17,18.
    Scholars have particularly focused on studying the relationship between vegetation
    cover and ecosystem restoration in arid and semi-arid regions of China19, as well
    as in the Yellow-Huai-Hai and Yangtze River basins20, and the Loess Plateau21.
    They explore vegetation''s role in geological disaster prevention and water conservation22,23,24,25,
    with studies indicating that enhancing vegetation cover contributes to improving
    natural environmental protection26. While researchers typically use remote sensing
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and statistical methods to analyze
    vegetation cover dynamics27,28,29,30,31, most studies have focused on overall
    trends and climate factors, neglecting detailed examinations of vegetation changes
    in different land types. The relationship between vegetation cover changes and
    land use evolution, as well as the spatiotemporal response of vegetation cover
    to land use changes, requires further investigation. It is of great significance
    to scientifically grasp the effectiveness of vegetation restoration after the
    implementation of Yangtze River conservation for the restoration and protection
    of ecological environment and the promotion of high-quality development of the
    Yangtze River basin. However, in the six years since the implementation of the
    Yangtze River conservation strategy, a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness
    of shoreline vegetation restoration was needed. Therefore, this study initially
    utilized Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery in 2016 and 2022 to analyze the spatiotemporal
    variations in vegetation cover along the Yangtze River shoreline (15km) in Anhui
    province. Secondly, combined with Dynamic World land use data, the characteristics
    of land use changes in key vegetation change areas along the Yangtze River shoreline
    was explored. Thirdly, the geographical weighted regression model was used to
    reveal the spatiotemporal response of vegetation cover along the Yangtze River
    shoreline to land use change. Materials and methods Study area and data The study
    area comprises a 15-kilometer buffer zone along the Yangtze River, encompassing
    Anqing City (Susong County, Wangjiang County, Huaining County, Daguang District,
    Yixiu District, Yingjiang District), Chizhou City (Dongzhi County, Guichi District,
    Qingyang County), Tongling City (Zongyang County, Tongguan District, Yi''an District),
    Wuhu City (Wuwei City, Fanchang County, Sanshan District, Jiujiang District, Yijiang
    District, Jinghu District, Nanling County, Wuhu County), and Ma''anshan City (He
    County, Dangtu County, Yushan District, Huashan District, Bowang District) within
    the geographical coordinates of 115°45'' to 118°53''E and 29°21'' to 32°04''N
    (Figure 1). The study area experiences a transition zone between warm temperate
    and subtropical climates, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, with
    distinct seasons and an average annual temperature ranging from 14-17°C. Precipitation,
    primarily concentrated in the summer, includes the plum rain season from late
    June to mid-July. The region features rivers, numerous lakes, and low hills on
    both riverbanks, with an elevation rising from south to north and a lower central
    portion32. Natural vegetation transitions from mixed forests of evergreen and
    deciduous broadleaf trees, with deciduous broadleaf trees in the north to predominantly
    evergreen broadleaf forests in the south of the Yangtze River plain. To assess
    vegetation restoration effectiveness in Anhui Province, this study focused on
    a 15 km buffer zone on both riverbanks, divided into 3 km × 3 km grid cells33,
    resulting in 1487 study units. Figure 1 Overview of the study area. Full size
    image The vegetation data are in the form of the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI), obtained from the Google Earth Engine cloud platform (https://earthengine.google.com).
    Initially, based on Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data from 2016 and 2022,
    considering that extreme weather may cause changes in vegetation along the Yangtze
    River shoreline, this study selected cloud-free composite images with a 10-meter
    resolution during the long-term vegetation growth period (June to September).
    This was to avoid interference from floods, droughts, and other factors34. Subsequently,
    the NDVI for 2016 and 2022 was calculated. Finally, using a pixel-based binary
    model, the vegetation coverage for both periods was computed to characterize the
    vegetation status at different times. Land use data were sourced from the Dynamic
    World 10-meter resolution global land use dataset, also acquired through the Google
    Earth Engine cloud platform, which were derived from Sentinel-2 imagery with 10-meter
    resolution using deep learning methods. This study utilized land use data in 2016
    and 2022, categorized into land use types including water, trees, grass, flooded
    vegetation, crops, shrubs, built areas, and bare ground35. Research methods Pixel-based
    binary model To evaluate the efficacy of vegetation restoration along the Yangtze
    River, and examine spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation changes in relation to
    shifts in land use patterns, a pixel-based binary model was employed in this study
    to estimate vegetation coverage using NDVI data36. The calculation is as follows:
    $${\\text{FC}}=\\frac{{\\text{NDVI}}-{{\\text{NDVI}}}_{{\\text{soil}}}}{{{\\text{NDVI}}}_{{\\text{veg}}}-{{\\text{NDVI}}}_{{\\text{soil}}}}$$
    (1) In Equation (1), FC denotes the pixel vegetation coverage, NDVI represents
    the pixel normalized difference vegetation index, NDVIveg signifies the NDVI value
    of pure vegetation pixels, and NDVIsoil indicates the NDVI value of pure bare
    soil pixels. Subsequently, vegetation coverage was determined using the pixel-based
    binary model, which partitioned the study area into non-vegetated and vegetated
    parts based on 95% and 5% thresholds, respectively, and assessed the contributions
    of these two components. Drawing upon the \"Soil Erosion Classification and Grading
    Standard\" promulgated by the Ministry of Water Resources in 2008 and relevant
    research24 , which considered the specific conditions in the Yangtze River region
    of Anhui Province, vegetation coverage was stratified into six levels: non-vegetated
    area, <30% (low coverage), 30%~45% (medium-low coverage), 45%~60% (medium coverage),
    60%~75% (medium-high coverage), and >75% (high coverage). This study employed
    the pixel binary model to monitor vegetation restoration37. Hotspot analysis The
    Getis-Ord Gi* method was employed to assess the clustering intensity of high or
    low values among the study objects within the neighborhood grid, thereby providing
    insight into the spatial correlation of each study object38. The calculation is
    as follows: $${G}_{i}^{*}(d)=\\frac{{\\sum }_{j=1}^{n}{\\omega }_{ij}{x}_{j}-\\overline{X}{\\sum
    }_{j=1}^{n}{\\omega }_{ij}}{S\\sqrt{\\frac{[n{\\sum }_{j=1}^{n}{\\omega }_{ij}^{2}-{({\\sum
    }_{j=1}^{n}{\\omega }_{ij})}^{2}]}{n-1}}}$$ (2) In the formula, \\({x}_{j}\\)
    represents the area of the study object in grid j; \\({\\omega }_{ij}\\) is the
    spatial weight matrix; \\(\\overline{X }\\) isthe average area of study objects
    in grid; n is the number of grid cells in the study area, and \\(S\\) is the standard
    deviation. The \\({G}_{i}^{*}\\) calculation result is the Z-value, indicating
    cold spots if \\({G}_{i}^{*}\\) is a negative and significant value, and hot spots
    if \\({G}_{i}^{*}\\) is a positive and significant value. This study utilized
    hotspot analysis to investigate the characteristics of vegetation cover change
    and land use type change39. Geographically weighted regression model In this research,
    we applied a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model to elucidate the relationship
    between changes in land use types and the restoration of vegetation cover, taking
    into account spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity40. The formula
    is presented below: $$ y_{i} = \\beta_{0} \\left( {u_{i} ,v_{i} } \\right) + \\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{k = 1}^{p} \\beta_{k} \\left( {u_{i} ,v_{i} } \\right)x_{ik} +
    \\varepsilon_{i} \\qquad {\\text{i}} = 1,2 \\ldots \\ldots ,{\\text{n}} $$ (3)
    In the formula, (\\({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\\)) is the coordinate of the i-th grid cell
    (e.g., latitude and longitude), \\({\\beta }_{k}\\) (\\({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\\)) represents
    the k-th regression parameter at the i-th grid cell, which is a function of geographical
    location, \\({\\varepsilon }_{I}\\sim N(0,{\\sigma }^{2})\\), \\({\\text{Cov}}({\\upvarepsilon
    }_{{\\text{i}}},{\\upvarepsilon }_{{\\text{j}}})\\)=\\(0\\) (i ≠ j). In this investigation,
    the focal point revolves around the transition of vegetation cover within a grid
    from favorable to unfavorable conditions, or vice versa, constituting the dependent
    variable. Simultaneously, the independent variable comprises the transition of
    land use types within the corresponding grid. This study employed geographically
    weighted regression models to delineate the response dynamics of vegetation cover
    alterations in response to changes in land use types41. To comprehensively assess
    the impact of alterations in land use types on the enhancement or degradation
    of vegetation cover along the Yangtze River shoreline, the transfer area of vegetation
    cover alterations within grid cells served as the dependent variable. The independent
    variable encompassed the area of land transformation types within the grid cells
    of vegetation cover alteration transfer zones. Utilizing the GWR model facilitated
    the computation of regression coefficients, where higher absolute values of these
    coefficients signify a more pronounced influence on vegetation alteration. Preliminary
    to executing the GWR model analysis, employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is
    imperative to scrutinize multicollinearity issues among the independent variables.
    Results Temporal and spatial change analysis of vegetation cover The study examined
    the temporal and spatial dynamics of vegetation cover pre- and post-implementation
    of the Yangtze River protection project. In 2016, the study area predominantly
    exhibited three vegetation coverage tiers: medium-high, medium, and low. Notably,
    medium-high-level coverage accounted for 2725.72 km2 (23.1%), medium-level for
    2438.05 km2 (20.7%), and low-level for 2350.11 km2 (20%). By 2022, vegetation
    coverage levels remained dominant in the medium-high, medium, and low categories,
    with 3182.88 km2 (27%), 2251.81 km2 (19.1%), and 2284.49 km2 (19.4%), respectively.
    The most significant changes occurred in the high and medium-high categories,
    witnessing increases of 515.77 km2 (4.4%) and 457.16 km2 (3.9%), respectively,
    compared to 2016. Additionally, a transition of 726.77 km2 (6.2%) transition from
    non-vegetated areas to vegetated areas was observed (Figure 2). Figure 2 Spatial
    distribution of vegetation coverage levels before and after vegetation restoration.
    Full size image Analysis of vegetation coverage transitions revealed that 48.68%
    remained unchanged, while 6043.73 km2 (51.32%) underwent alterations. Improved
    vegetation coverage transitions accounted for 4201.87 km2 (35.68%), primarily
    involving transitions from medium-level (M) to medium-high-level (M-h), medium-low-level
    (M-l) to medium-level, low-level (L) to medium-low-level, medium-high-level to
    high-level (H), low-level to medium-level, and non-vegetated (N-v) to low-level,
    with 980.99 km2 (8.33%), 509.92 km2 (4.33%), 446.33 km2 (3.79%), 425.13 km2 (3.61%),
    339.16 km2 (2.88%) and 339.16 km2 (2.88%), respectively. Decreased vegetation
    coverage accounted for 1841.85 km2 (15.64%), primarily transitioning from medium-high-level
    to medium-level, medium-level to medium-low-level, and medium-low-level to low-level,
    with 421.6 km2 (3.58%), 346.23 km2 (2.94%), and 308.55 km2 (2.62%), respectively
    (Figure 3). Figure 3 Proportion of changes in vegetation coverage levels. Full
    size image Within 15km along the Yangtze River shoreline, vegetation coverage
    levels in 2016 and 2022 were predominantly classified into three levels: medium-high,
    medium, and low. The respective areas were 7513.88 km2 (63.8%) and 7719.18 km2
    (65.5%). Following the implementation of the Yangtze River conservation strategy,
    there was a notable improvement in vegetation coverage, with 4201.87 km2 (35.68%)
    transitioning positively and 1841.85 km2 (15.64%) transitioning negatively. This
    indicates a significant enhancement in vegetation restoration effectiveness. Regarding
    the spatial distribution of vegetation coverage transitions, areas with increased
    vegetation coverage exhibited a hotspot pattern, primarily located along the Yangtze
    River in areas such as Wangjiang County, Dongzhi County, Guichi District, Zongyang
    County, Yixiu District, and Wuwei City (Figure 4a). In contrast, areas with a
    decreased vegetation coverage displayed a pattern of hot in the north and cold
    in the south with hotspots in regions like He County, Yushan District, Dangtu
    County, Jiujiang District, Wuwei City and parts of Zongyang County and Yi''an
    District in Tongling City (Figure 4b). Figure 4 Spatial distribution of transition
    hot spots (improvement) and cold spots (deterioration) in vegetation coverage
    along the Yangtze River Shoreline. Full size image Characteristics of land use
    changes in key vegetation change areas In regions experiencing positive shifts
    in vegetation coverage, land use transformations primarily involved conversions
    from water to crops, trees to crops, crops to built area, crops to trees, and
    built area to crops. These transitions accounted for 126.93 km2 (22.79%), 59.93
    km2 (10.76%), 59.93 km2 (10.76%), 54.48 km2 (9.78%), and 39.12 km2 (7.02%) of
    the total area undergoing positive vegetation coverage transitions, respectively
    (Figure 5a). Conversely, areas with negative vegetation coverage transitions,
    witnessed changes primarily from crops to built area, trees to crops, crops to
    water, and trees to built area, accounting for 66.84 km2 (24.14%), 54.28 km2 (19.61%),
    50.73 km2 (18.32%), and 29.14 km2 (10.53%) of the entire area of negative vegetation
    coverage transitions, respectively (Figure 5b). It is evident that land use type
    transitions primarily involved crops, built area, water, and trees. Figure 5 Proportion
    of land use type transitions in key vegetation change areas along the Yangtze
    River Shoreline. Full size image Spatially, the distribution of improved vegetation
    coverage: hotspots in the conversion of water to crops conversions along both
    sides of the Yangtze River''s periphery, particularly in Susong County, the northwestern
    parts of Dongzhi County, the bordering areas of Guichi District and Zongyang County,
    and certain areas within Wuhu City and Ma''anshan City (Figure 6a). Concentrated
    hotspots for trees to crops conversions are observed in the bordering areas of
    Anqing City, Chizhou City, and Tongling City, as well as in the bordering regions
    of Wuhu City and Tongling City (Figure 6b). The transition from crops-to-built
    areas exhibits a pattern of hotspots in the northern region particularly in Wuhu
    City and Ma''anshan City, with coldspots in the southern region (Figure 6c). Hotspots
    for transitions crops-to-trees transitions, hotspots were distributed along the
    Yangtze River shoreline, particularly in the southern parts of Wangjiang County,
    Dongzhi County, the bordering area of Yingjiang District, Guichi District, and
    Zongyang County, as well as in certain parts of Wuhu City''s Sanshan District
    and Ma''anshan City''s Yushan District (Figure 6d). Hotspots in crops-to-water
    transitions were located along both sides of the Yangtze River, especially in
    the areas of Wangjiang County, Guichi District, Zongyang County, Yi''an District,
    Jiujiang District, and Huashan District (Figure 6e). Figure 6 Spatial distribution
    of hotspots and coldspots of the main land use type transition in key vegetation
    change areas along the Yangtze River Shoreline. Full size image In areas with
    negative vegetation coverage transitions, hotspots in crops-to-built area were
    mainly found in large parts of Wuhu City and Ma''anshan City (Figure 6f). For
    trees-to-crops transitions, hotspots were concentrated in the northern parts of
    Guichi District and the southern parts of Zongyang County (Figure 6g). In the
    case of crops-to-water transitions, hotspots were primarily located at the junction
    of Sanshan District and Wuwei City (Figure 6h). For trees-to-built area transitions,
    hotspots were mainly observed in large parts of the bordering regions of Anqing
    City, Chizhou City, and Tongling City, as well as in some areas along the border
    of Wuhu City and Ma''anshan City (Figure 6i). Spatiotemporal response of vegetation
    coverage to land use changes In terms of vegetation cover improvement, the GWR
    goodness of fit (R2) was 0.55, and Akaike''s Information Criterion corrected (AICC)
    was 44293.79. Land use transfer types exhibited a positive influence on vegetation
    cover improvement overall. The average regression coefficients for the conversion
    of crops to trees, water to crops, built area to crops, trees to crops, and crops
    to built area increased sequentially, which were 0.06, 0.38, 0.45, 0.50, and 0.68,
    respectively. Notably, the conversions of crops to built area and trees to crops
    had a significant impact (Figure 7a). Figure 7 Regression coefficients of land
    use transition types on vegetation coverage changes. Full size image Regarding
    the deterioration of vegetation cover, the GWR goodness of fit (R2) was 0.63,
    and AICC was 43040.13. Conversions of crops to built area and trees to crops demonstrated
    a positive effect on the deterioration of vegetation cover, with average regression
    coefficients of 1.07 and 0.57, respectively. Conversely, conversions of trees
    to built area and crops to water exhibited a negative impact on the deterioration
    of vegetation cover, with average regression coefficients of -1.52 and -0.12,
    respectively (Figure 7b). In terms of spatial pattern differences, the regression
    coefficients for vegetation cover improvement associated with conversions from
    water to crops, trees to crops, crops to built area, crops to trees, and built
    area to crops ranged from -4.24 to 8.43 (Figure 8a), -10.92 to 13.52 (Figure 8b),
    -19.12 to 17.78 (Figure 8c), 39.15 to 16.92 (Figure 8d), and -41.12 to 19.21 (Figure
    8e), respectively. Positive high-value areas for crops to built area were observed
    in southern Susong County, western Dongzhi County, and parts of Wuhu and Ma''anshan,
    while negative low-value areas appeared at the border of Chizhou and Tongling
    cities. Similarly, positive high-value areas for trees to crops were found in
    southern Susong County, large parts of Tongling City, and some areas of Ma''anshan,
    while negative low-value areas occurred in parts of Chizhou and Wuhu cities. It''s
    evident that changes in crops to built area and trees to crops are significant
    factors influencing the improvement of vegetation cover. Figure 8 Spatial Distribution
    of the Impact of Land Use Type Transitions along the Yangtze River Shoreline on
    Vegetation Coverage Improvement (Deterioration). Full size image Regarding the
    deterioration of vegetation cover, the regression coefficients for crops to built
    area, trees to crops, crops to water, and trees to built area ranged from -11.65
    to 12.47 (Figure 8f), -9.15 to 17.45 (Figure 8g), -8.36 to 10.95 (Figure 8h),
    and -30.65 to 18.76 (Figure 8i), respectively. Positive high-value regions were
    observed in the western part of Dongzhi County to the northwest of Chizhou City,
    at the border of Tongling City with Wuhu City, among others. Specifically, positive
    high-value areas for trees to built area occurred in large parts of the border
    between Dongzhi County and Wangjiang County, along the Yangtze River in Dongzhi
    County and Guichi District, and in some areas of Wuhu City, while negative low-value
    areas were present at the junction of Ma''anshan City with Wuhu City and Tongling
    City with Wuhu City. Positive high-value areas for crops to built area were observed
    in the western part of Dongzhi County to the northwest of Chizhou City, at the
    border of Tongling City with Wuhu City, among others, while negative low-value
    areas were found in large parts of Wuhu City and Guichi District. Thus, conversions
    from trees to built area and crops to built area are significant influencing factors
    leading to the deterioration of vegetation cover. Discussion The influence factor
    of vegetation cover changes Large-scale and long-term vegetation cover changes
    are influenced by natural environmental factors such as topography, geomorphology,
    and climate change, while small-scale and short-term vegetation cover changes
    are significantly impacted by human activities such as ecological engineering
    and urbanization42. Over the long term, 81.5% of vegetation shows a significant
    positive correlation with precipitation, and 82.2% exhibits a significant positive
    correlation with temperature43. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
    River, human activities have a greater impact on vegetation compared to climate
    change44. Although climate change has a greater impact on the area of vegetation
    than human activities, its significance is not as pronounced. The influence of
    human activities on vegetation change is closely related to local ecological policies
    45. For example, the implementation of ecological afforestation projects in the
    Yangtze River Basin has achieved significant results in vegetation restoration.
    By 2013, the forest area reached 6.85 × 105 km2, and vegetation cover increased
    by 15.86% over 12 years 46. Under the background of the Yangtze River Protection,
    Anhui Province has actively implemented ecological greening policies to restore
    the ecological environment along the Yangtze River, improving the vegetation cover.
    Our study found that 4201.87 km2 of vegetation cover levels have shifted towards
    improvement, mainly reflected in the transition from medium-level to medium-high-level,
    medium-low-level to medium-level. Land use changes related to ecological restoration
    projects are the main driving force for vegetation improvement in the Yangtze
    River Basin47. The conversion of land use types to trees, crops, and grassland
    is the primary reason for increasing vegetation cover, with contributions rates
    of 60.66%, 20.93%, and 18.41% respectively48. The conversion of land use types
    to trees plays a crucial role in vegetation restoration and protection. It was
    noteworthy that 39.12 km2 of built area has been converted into crops, leading
    to an increase in vegetation cover along the Yangtze River in Anhui. This was
    mainly due to urbanization promoting the migration of rural populations to cities,
    releasing built area, which was then reclaimed or restored for crops through land
    consolidation or reclamation49. The implementation of ecological projects such
    as returning farmland to forests and afforestation of millions of hectares in
    Anhui Province has increased forest area. For instance, between 2000 and 2020,
    the greening areas of Anqing and Chizhou increased by 169.30 km2 and 75.98 km2
    respectively, contributing significantly to vegetation restoration50. The conversion
    of other land use types to construction land is the most important driver of vegetation
    change caused by human activities51. After the implementation of the Yangtze River
    Protection in the 15km buffer zone along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province,
    with the development of urbanization, 126.77 km2 of crops was converted to built
    area, of which 59.93 km2 contributed to the improvement of vegetation, and 66.84
    km2 contributed to the deterioration of vegetation52. Under the policy drive of
    farmland reclamation,114.21 km2 of trees was converted to crops, of which 59.93
    km2 contributed to the improvement of vegetation, and 54.28 km2 contributed to
    the deterioration of vegetation. When land use types shift from crops to built
    area, vegetation cover usually decreases due to land development, deforestation,
    land surface hardening, and construction activities, all of which lead to vegetation
    destruction and reduction53. However, in this study, vegetation cover may increase,
    as research indicated that the number of urban green spaces in almost all Chinese
    cities has increased54. This increase is more significant in cities with better
    economic development and larger urban areas, as there is an increase in green
    space, parks, green belts, as well as trees and shrubs55. Limitations The paper
    research still has some shortcomings. Extreme weather events such as floods and
    droughts in the Yangtze River Basin may affect vegetation monitoring56,57. Fortunately,
    hydraulic engineering projects like the Three Gorges Dam can mitigate extreme
    floods and regulate downstream flow during the dry season, to some extent avoiding
    damage to vegetation cover58,59. Additionally, this study focused on monitoring
    vegetation during the long growing season. Short-term vegetation changes caused
    by floods and droughts can be eliminated through the maximum vegetation index
    value processing60. Continuous monitoring of vegetation cover along the Yangtze
    River at an annual scale is limited due to the cloudy and rainy conditions in
    the Anhui Province along the river, restricting the acquisition of high-quality
    annual-scale Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. Therefore, this study opted to evaluate
    the vegetation cover using remote sensing data from before (2016) and after (2022)
    the implementation of the Yangtze River Protection Program. Regarding land use
    data selection, the study utilized nearly real-time updated Dynamic World data,
    but the confusion between wetlands, grasslands, and bare land may introduce some
    errors into the research results. In terms of vegetation cover spatiotemporal
    monitoring methods, the paper solely employed the transition matrix method. In
    future research, the use of spatiotemporal change intensity analysis could be
    considered to analyze the transition trends and their impacts between different
    levels of vegetation cover from relative and absolute perspectives. Conclusions
    After the implementation of the Yangtze River protection strategy, the vegetation
    coverage along the Anhui section exhibited three dominant levels: medium-high,
    medium, and low. Nevertheless, there was a noteworthy increase in vegetation coverage
    proportions at the high and medium-high levels, indicating enhancement in overall
    vegetation coverage. The shift from non-vegetated to vegetated land likely stems
    from the successful execution of vegetation protection policies. In regions experiencing
    positive transitions in vegetation coverage, notable shifts in land use types
    included conversions from water to crops, trees to crops, crops to built areas,
    crops to trees, and built areas to crops. Conversely, areas with negative transitions
    in vegetation coverage, witnessed major land use changes involving conversions
    from crops to built areas, trees to crops, crops to water, and trees to built
    areas. These alterations in land use types underscore the intricate interplay
    between vegetation coverage and land use changes, particularly their impact on
    positive and negative vegetation transitions. Land use categories such as crops,
    trees, and built areas significantly influenced vegetation coverage changes. Transitions
    from crops to built areas and from trees to crops were pivotal factors driving
    positive vegetation transitions, while transitions from trees to built areas and
    from crops to built areas were primary contributors to negative vegetation transitions.

  description: Efficiently managing agricultural irrigation is vital for food security
    today and into the future under climate change. Yet, evaluating agriculture’s
    hydrological impacts and strategies to reduce them remains challenging due to
    a lack of field-scale data on crop water consumption. Here, we develop a method
    to fill this gap using remote sensing and machine learning, and leverage it to
    assess water saving strategies in California’s Central Valley. We find that switching
    to lower water intensity crops can reduce consumption by up to 93%, but this requires
    adopting uncommon crop types. Northern counties have substantially lower irrigation
    efficiencies than southern counties, suggesting another potential source of water
    savings. Other practices that do not alter land cover can save up to 11% of water
    consumption. These results reveal diverse approaches for achieving sustainable
    water use, emphasizing the potential of sub-field scale crop water consumption
    maps to guide water management in California and beyond.

    Abstract Efficiently managing agricultural irrigation is vital for food security
    today and into the future under climate change. Yet, evaluating agriculture’s
    hydrological impacts and strategies to reduce them remains challenging due to
    a lack of field-scale data on crop water consumption. Here, we develop a method
    to fill this gap using remote sensing and machine learning, and leverage it to
    assess water saving strategies in California’s Central Valley. We find that switching
    to lower water intensity crops can reduce consumption by up to 93%, but this requires
    adopting uncommon crop types. Northern counties have substantially lower irrigation
    efficiencies than southern counties, suggesting another potential source of water
    savings. Other practices that do not alter land cover can save up to 11% of water
    consumption. These results reveal diverse approaches for achieving sustainable
    water use, emphasizing the potential of sub-field scale crop water consumption

    and crop water use of 175 individual crops for 1990–2019 simulated with a global
    crop model Article Open access 14 February 2024 Introduction Climate change, drought,
    and the overexploitation of water resources have led to declines in freshwater
    storage in many vital agricultural regions1, raising concerns surrounding the
    future of food and water security2,3. Irrigation constitutes the largest use of
    freshwater globally4,5, and many regions will need to decrease their agricultural
    water use while maintaining high levels of production to ensure a sustainable
    food and water supply as the population grows6. Proposed options for reducing
    water use include leaving lands fallow, switching to less water-intensive crops,
    adopting water-saving farming practices such as deficit irrigation, and improving
    irrigation efficiency7,8. However, any approach to reducing agricultural water
    use depends on the challenging task of characterizing the amount of water crops
    consume9. While it is possible to monitor volumes of water withdrawn for irrigation,
    this is a poor proxy for the amount of water crops consume through evapotranspiration
    (ET)10. Only some irrigation water results in ET: the rest remains in the system
    as runoff or recharge, though this proportion can vary widely depending on topography,
    climate, soil type, and farming practices11. Agricultural ET, or the increase
    in ET that irrigated agriculture brings, is therefore a critical measure in that
    it represents the amount of water that is actually “consumed” by agriculture.
    This water leaves the watershed entirely as it is evaporated from the soil and
    transpired by crops4. Since agricultural ET represents agricultural water consumption,
    it is key for gauging the potential of fallowing, crop switching, or other farming
    practices to save water12. When compared to total irrigation amounts, agricultural
    ET can also be used to highlight the fraction of irrigation withdrawals that do
    not effectively result in consumptive use13. While this water stays in the system
    and therefore may continue to provide beneficial uses14, it also does not achieve
    its original purpose of contributing to crop growth. Therefore, agricultural ET
    can help calculate irrigation efficiency and identify unnecessary irrigation water
    withdrawals from surface or groundwater reservoirs13. Two methodological challenges
    prevent agricultural ET from being monitored at scale. First, simply measuring
    total ET at scale is a challenge. Second, even when measures of ET are available,
    it is difficult to separate agricultural ET from the total10,15. To measure total
    ET, eddy covariance flux towers are highly accurate for monitoring ET at a single
    location16. However, they are expensive and thus sparse, and they are designed
    to measure ET over uniform vegetation, which is not reflective of complex agricultural
    landscapes17. In the absence of ET measurements, theoretical water demand can
    be simulated based on climate and crop type18,19. Although such tools are helpful
    for water demand planning20, theoretical water demand represents the ET of a crop
    whose water demands are fully met. Therefore, these are likely to overestimate
    actual ET. Additionally, these simulated estimates exclusively reflect variations
    in water demand influenced by factors incorporated into the model, which are often
    limited to crop type and climate21. Therefore, analyses based on these models
    are constrained to examining these specific factors, neglecting other critical
    drivers of ET such as farming practices. Given the scarcity of in situ data and
    the inherent constraints of simulated estimates, accurately gauging total ET at
    scale remains a significant challenge. Addressing the second challenge, even when
    accurate ET measurements are available, isolating agricultural ET from total ET
    is difficult. This step is key for water management, since the resulting metric
    represents the increase in ET attributable to agriculture. To do so, one must
    estimate the naturally-occurring ET that would occur in the absence of irrigated
    agriculture (for example, if the land were left fallow). Most often, this naturally-occurring
    ET is assumed to be equal to precipitation19,22. However, there may be temporal
    lags between precipitation and resulting ET, some precipitation may not result
    in ET at all, and ET may also be supplemented by other sources of water, such
    as near surface groundwater. Together, these challenges leave us with limited
    measurements of ET and no empirical estimates of agricultural ET at large scales,
    inhibiting our ability to form evidence-based water management policies that accurately
    reflect crop water use and potential water savings in agriculture. Recent advances
    in the remote sensing of ET unlock new avenues for research into agricultural
    water consumption. Numerous algorithms for estimating ET using land surface temperature
    and other remote sensing inputs have been validated specifically for use in agricultural
    settings23,24. These advancements have allowed researchers to empirically study
    total ET in agricultural settings25,26. However, despite high-resolution maps
    of ET in agricultural landscapes25,27, the challenge of isolating agricultural
    ET from total ET has been limited to studies in extremely arid regions where irrigation
    is the only source of water available to plants28. Here, we develop a framework
    for measuring agricultural ET at sub-field scales. We use remote sensing to determine
    total ET and combine it with machine learning to estimate naturally-occurring
    ET. First, we retrieve satellite-based remotely sensed total ET estimates from
    the 30m, monthly OpenET ensemble data24 available in the western United States
    starting in 2016. Second, since we can use these same OpenET estimates to directly
    observe naturally-occurring ET over fallow lands, we train a gradient boosting
    algorithm to predict ET over fallow lands. We use information on topography, soil
    quality, climate, and spatial and temporal coordinates as predictors. We then
    use the model to retrieve naturally-occurring ET over all active agricultural
    fields, which we subtract from the remotely-sensed ET to calculate agricultural
    ET. We apply this methodology to calculate agricultural ET across California’s
    Central Valley, one of the world’s most water-stressed and agriculturally productive
    regions29. We use these maps of agricultural ET to calculate the water consumption
    of different crop types, as well as to calculate variability in agricultural ET
    within crop types. These insights allow us to evaluate different strategies that
    have been proposed to save water under the Sustainable Groundwater Management
    Act (SGMA)7, which mandates that all water basins in California reduce groundwater
    pumping to sustainable levels by 204030. Specifically, we compare the ability
    of fallowing, crop switching, and other farming practices to save water by reducing
    agricultural ET. Additionally, we calculate irrigation efficiency to assess the
    potential to reduce irrigation withdrawals without decreasing agricultural ET.
    In the wake of groundwater pumping cutbacks of 20–50% under SGMA7, this work will
    guide water managers in enacting water savings and help predict which land use
    changes are likely to ensue. Results Estimating agricultural ET We calculate agricultural
    ET by retrieving the total ET observed over agricultural areas and subtracting
    naturally-occurring ET (Fig. 1). While total ET estimates are retrieved directly
    from OpenET, we simulate naturally-occurring ET by training a gradient boosting
    regressor to predict the ET observed by OpenET over fallow lands. Our model simulating
    naturally-occurring ET achieves an R2 of .87 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of
    35.5 mm per year (Supplementary Fig. 1). We use a test set made up of 2 km2 held-out
    areas (about four times the area of a large agricultural field in the Central
    Valley). We do not find that error is structured across either space (Supplementary
    Figs. 2 and 3) or time (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 1: Estimates of annual agricultural
    evapotranspiration (ET) over active agricultural lands in California’s Central
    Valley. a Total ET is remotely sensed and is retrieved from OpenET. b Naturally-occurring
    ET is an estimate of the ET that would be present if the agricultural lands were
    fallow, and is predicted using machine learning. c Agricultural ET is the difference
    between total and naturally-occurring ET, and represents our estimate of the ET
    caused by agriculture, and therefore the water that would be conserved if the
    land were fallow instead of cropped. The variations in agricultural ET across
    the landscape suggest that different fields can have vastly different abilities
    to conserve water. OpenET provides ET data at the scale of 30 m; all figure panels
    here show ET resampled to 70 m resolution for computational efficiency and to
    better match average field size. Full size image Variation in agricultural ET
    within and across crop types We leverage the significant variability in agricultural
    ET observed across the Central Valley (Fig. 1) to analyze the factors driving
    these variations. Crop type, which is commonly cited as an important variable
    explaining differences in agricultural ET19, explains 34% of the variation in
    estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (4), Supplementary Fig. 5). In Fig. 2, we show
    the water intensity of different crop groups (Supplementary Note 7). Deciduous
    fruits and nuts are some of the highest consumers at 625 mm per year (582–668
    95% CI) (Fig. 2), particularly almonds at 715 mm per year (651–778 95% CI) (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Conversely, grain and hay crops consume only 141 mm per year (111–171
    95% CI). These broad variations in the water consumption of different crop types
    align with previous work estimating crop water demands (Supplementary Note 1,
    Supplementary Fig. 6) and suggest that substantial water savings may be possible
    with crop switching. Fig. 2: Variations in annual agricultural evapotranspiration
    (ET) across and within crop groups. Mean agricultural ET by crop group (blue fill
    and 95% CI) is the average difference between total ET (black outline) and naturally-occurring
    ET (cream fill). All measures are summed across the year, leading to naturally-occurring
    and total ET estimates that include water consumption occurring outside of the
    growing season. While we find significant differences in mean agricultural ET
    across crop groups, the gray box plots also show a broad spread in agricultural
    ET within crop groups (box plots show 0.5, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles).
    Full size image However, the majority of the variation remains unexplained by
    crop type (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 5). This within-crop variability is not
    uniform for different crops: crops such as deciduous fruits and nuts tend to have
    large variances, whereas rice has a very small variance. For example, pistachios
    have the most variability with an interquartile range (IQR) of 664 mm per year
    over the whole state. Conversely, rice has an IQR of only 122 mm per year (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Part of the large variability in agricultural ET for deciduous fruits
    and nuts can be explained by orchard age: young orchards consume significantly
    less water than more mature ones (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).
    Climate, topography, and soil quality explain an additional 6% of within-crop
    variation. However, substantial within-crop variation remains, indicating that
    some of these differences may be due to variations in farming practices. This
    would suggest that reducing water consumption without switching crops may be feasible,
    which we explore in the next section. The water-saving potential of different
    management strategies The variability of agricultural ET both within and between
    crops allows us to evaluate the water saving-potential of different management
    strategies. Here, we compare the effect of three scenarios on reducing agricultural
    ET in groundwater sub-basins across the Central Valley: 1. Crop switching: Substitute
    high-ET crops for the median water-consuming crop (Eq. (6)). 2. Farming practices:
    Keep the same spatial allocation of crops, but reduce agricultural ET of high
    consumers to the median, crop-specific, consumption level (Eq. (7)). 3. Fallowing:
    Fallow the 5% of lands with the highest estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (8)). Because
    it would not be realistic to prescribe farmers in different contexts to consume
    similar amounts of water, we calculate crop-specific agricultural ET and within-crop
    variation at the level of groundwater sub-basins. We additionally control for
    differences in climate, topography, and soil type before conducting the scenarios.
    To account for the effects of orchard age, we remove orchards that have been bearing
    fruit for 5 years or less or that are in their last year of production (Supplementary
    Fig. 7). We find that each of these scenarios return similar reductions in overall
    water consumption of around 10% (Fig. 3). Since crops with high agricultural ET
    are heavily favored in most sub-basins and therefore the median crop usually has
    a high agricultural ET, crop switching only results in a 9.9% reduction in agricultural
    ET. In order to achieve greater water savings, crops would need to be switched
    to less popular crops with lesser water demands: switching all crops to the lowest
    consuming crop in a sub-basin results in a 93.8% reduction in agricultural ET.
    While strategies that do not require a change in land cover type are less commonly
    cited as a water management approach, we find that reducing high consumers to
    their crops’s median consumption level yields similar water savings of up to 11.3%.
    Fallowing does, however, remain the most effective way to reduce agricultural
    ET. We find that leaving a mere 5% of land fallow results in a 9.3% consumption
    reduction, comparable to the savings afforded by crop switching and within-crop
    scenarios which by definition affect up to 50% of lands. Fig. 3: The percent reduction
    in agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) driven by various management scenarios.
    a Savings accrued by substituting high-ET crops for the median water-consuming
    crop in a sub-basin. b Water savings without changing land cover by reducing agricultural
    ET of high consumers to the median, crop- and sub-basin-specific, consumption
    level. c Water savings from fallowing the 5% of lands with the highest estimated
    agricultural ET. Full size image Irrigation efficiency While fallowing, crop switching,
    and other farming practices highlight opportunities to decrease agricultural ET,
    we also find opportunities to diminish runoff and deep percolation during conveyance,
    on-farm management, or application (Fig. 4). On average, we find that irrigation
    in the Central Valley is 61.8% (54.0–69.7%) efficient, similar in magnitude to
    what theoretical estimates predict (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 8).
    The large disparity in efficiency between northern and southern counties is, however,
    more pronounced than theoretical estimates (Supplementary Fig. 8). As a result,
    there may be limited potential to decrease water withdrawn for irrigation in the
    south which achieves efficiencies as high as 80%. The particularly low efficiencies
    in the northern counties, however, suggest a large potential to decrease irrigation
    water withdrawals without affecting agricultural ET. Fig. 4: Irrigation efficiency
    across the counties of the Central Valley. a Irrigation efficiency is calculated
    by dividing agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) (gridded data) by USGS county-level
    reports of irrigation amounts (blue polygons). For the calculation, agricultural
    ET is averaged to the county level to match the spatial scale of the irrigation
    data. Additionally, irrigation is displayed in volumetric units (teragrams), but
    is divided by county-level cropland area to be in units consistent with agricultural
    ET prior to the calculation. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted
    at the point of use, rather than the water’s point of origin. b The resulting
    county-level irrigation efficiency estimates vary widely across the Central Valley,
    with particularly low efficiencies in the northern counties. Full size image Discussion
    By empirically quantifying crop water consumption at sub-field scales, we contribute
    to characterizing agriculture’s hydrological effects and evaluate the ability
    of different management strategies to mitigate this impact. To overcome the methodological
    challenges associated with estimating agricultural ET, we leverage recent advances
    in remotely sensed ET and use machine learning to generate a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual. The fine scale variability in agricultural ET we uncover allows
    us to analyze the drivers of these differences and simulate the potential for
    different management practices to save water, including under-explored ones like
    adjusting farming practices. Additionally, when comparing agricultural ET to total
    water withdrawn for irrigation, we find substantial opportunities for improvements
    in irrigation efficiency in the northern counties of the Central Valley. High-resolution
    maps of agricultural ET can therefore guide our understanding of how agriculture
    and management can affect water resources in California and other water stressed
    agricultural regions globally. Accurate agricultural ET measures are crucial to
    characterize anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological cycle31 and enact effective
    water management18,32. Previously, agricultural ET has been estimated by (i) simulating
    crop water demand based on crop type and climate and (ii) removing naturally available
    water by subtracting precipitation19,22. However, both of these steps embed assumptions
    that can lead to significant biases. For (i), simulated crop water demand may
    not adequately represent the field characteristics or farming practices of a given
    location13. For example, water demands are not necessarily always met, meaning
    water consumption may be overestimated33,34,35. In line with this, while we generally
    find good agreement with crop water demand simulated by the CalSIMETAW model21,
    we do find that agricultural ET estimates are significantly smaller (Supplementary
    Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 6). For (ii), using precipitation to proxy for naturally-occurring
    ET fails to account for precipitation being lost as runoff, temporal lags in when
    precipitation is transpired, and alternative natural sources of water such as
    shallow groundwater. We find that the bias between our estimates and CalSIMETAW
    estimates increases when precipitation, rather than naturally-occurring ET, is
    used to represent baseline amounts of available water. This can be explained by
    the seasonal mismatch between precipitation and naturally-occurring ET: although
    annually there is more precipitation than naturally-occurring ET, precipitation
    mainly occurs in the winter when it is unavailable to most crops. Because using
    precipitation as a proxy for naturally-occurring ET does not account for moisture
    that remains in the soil by the time the growing season begins, this inflates
    simulated estimates of crop water demand. Our use of remotely sensed ET estimates
    and our ability to estimate naturally-occurring ET therefore allows us to more
    accurately characterize agricultural ET. High-resolution, empirical estimates
    of agricultural ET additionally open up the possibility to investigate differences
    in agricultural ET beyond what is attributable to crop type, which we find only
    accounts for 34% of the variation. These within-crop variations can be substantial
    for many crops: the difference in agricultural ET of a pistachio field from the
    75th to the 25th percentile is the same as the water that could be saved from
    fallowing an alfalfa field. Such broad variability is consistent with findings
    from studies comparing total ET across crops during the growing season25,26. Even
    after adjusting for variability attributable to field characteristics, orchard
    age, and climate, we find that these variations could translate to substantial
    water savings without requiring a change in crop type. Unfortunately, a lack of
    high-resolution data on field-scale farming practices and yields inhibits further
    analysis of specific practices driving agricultural ET variation and their economic
    implications. However, prior literature from experimental plots or particular
    locations suggests that mulching36, conservation tillage37, deficit irrigation33,34,35,
    and improved irrigation scheduling and technologies38 all have potential to limit
    agricultural ET. These practices may prove advantageous relative to costly strategies
    like crop-switching or fallowing, though more detailed cost-benefit analyses are
    necessary to determine the suitability of various interventions in specific contexts39.
    Such water saving farming practices are not mentioned in the plans drafted by
    SGMA water managers7. This is possibly due to a lack of conclusive research on
    the potential of such strategies to effectively decrease agricultural ET without
    significant effects on yield or operation cost. Spatial data on the use of these
    different practices would allow researchers to take full advantage of our high-resolution
    agricultural ET estimates and study their water-saving and economic benefits.
    In situ assessments of crop-specific water consumption and other variations in
    agricultural ET enable us to model potential water savings across diverse management
    scenarios. In addition to previously mentioned scenarios based on farming practices,
    we also investigate more traditionally studied strategies, such as crop switching
    and fallowing. Consistent with prior studies relying on crop water demand simulations,
    our research suggests that transitioning to crops with lower water requirements
    is an effective conservation strategy. However, accruing substantial water savings
    requires embracing less popular crops like grains and hay20. The feasibility of
    increasing production of these crops in the Central Valley is uncertain due to
    high labor and operational costs20. Furthermore, any form of crop switching entails
    expenses related to the adoption of new knowledge, technologies, and market adjustments40,41.
    Consequently, the viability of a significant shift towards less water-demanding
    crops, and its alignment with market expansion, remains uncertain20. Therefore,
    our findings support the notion that extensive fallowing or land retirement may
    be essential to achieve substantial reduction targets in areas with severe overdrafts42,43.
    Considering the risk of increased dust from unused land, repurposing such areas
    for habitat restoration, flood water capture for groundwater replenishment44,
    solar energy production, or sustainable industrial development45 could mitigate
    the economic impacts of land retirement for both farmers and local communities.
    Detailed agricultural ET maps like the ones generated for this study can help
    determine the scale of land repurposing needed and identify priority areas for
    such initiatives under different constraints, including existing water rights46.
    Finally, we find a significant opportunity to improve irrigation efficiency, especially
    in the northern part of the Central Valley where we find lower irrigation efficiency
    than previously expected (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7). This implies
    that farmers in these areas could potentially reduce their irrigation water usage
    without negatively impacting agricultural ET and, consequently, crop growth. Although
    this finding is consistent with management strategies that focus on boosting irrigation
    efficiency7, it is important to recognize that such improvements may not automatically
    lead to water savings at the watershed level14. This is because water not consumed
    in irrigation processes does not always exit the watershed but can instead be
    reabsorbed into groundwater reservoirs or surface water bodies for later reuse.
    Conversely, water that is evapotranspired, which constitutes the ‘efficient’ part
    of irrigation, is completely removed from the watershed14. Hence, paradoxically,
    increasing irrigation efficiency could reduce water availability if it is not
    matched by a decrease in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation. To prevent
    an unintended increase in water consumption, managers could use agricultural ET
    maps to monitor and control water use as improvements in irrigation efficiency
    are implemented. This study has some important limitations. Most notably, due
    to a lack of data on farming practices, it is difficult to ascertain whether the
    variation in within-crop agricultural ET that we estimate is indeed due to farming
    practices. When conducting our management scenarios, we account for the effects
    of climate, soil quality, topography, and orchard age. We additionally conduct
    the scenarios at the level of small groundwater sub-basins rather than across
    the entire valley to account for any additional regional environmental differences
    we are unable to otherwise account for. However, variance stemming from error
    in our agricultural ET estimates or from mislabeled crop types could contribute
    to observed within-crop variation in agricultural ET. We minimize error from mislabeled
    crop types by using the most accurate crop data available in California which
    boasts an accuracy of 97.6%47. Additionally, the OpenET ensemble model has been
    extensively validated24,48, and our machine learning model has an R2 of .87. We
    estimate that these sources of error are responsible for only 11% of the variance
    in our yearly agricultural ET estimates (Supplementary Note 4). Nevertheless,
    the water-saving potentials we calculate for both the fallowing and farmers practice
    scenarios should be interpreted as upper bound estimates. Another important limitation
    of this study stems from the limited data available on water withdrawn for irrigation
    which is needed to calculate irrigation efficiency. Since irrigation data are
    not available over the same years as agricultural ET, we use the average of the
    two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, a drought year and non-drought year, to
    calculate irrigation efficiency. To ensure that our results are robust to year-to-year
    variations in agricultural ET and irrigation use, we calculate irrigation efficiency
    using all the possible combinations of years (Supplementary Fig. 9). Though we
    do find significant variations based on the irrigation year used in some counties,
    we consistently find low irrigation efficiencies in the north and higher ones
    in the south. Irrigation data with better spatial and temporal resolution would
    improve estimates of irrigation efficiency calculated using this method. We have
    shown how highly resolved agricultural ET estimates can improve our understanding
    of anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic cycle and guide water management by
    quantifying the potential of different water-saving strategies. In California,
    our findings suggest that irrigated agriculture increases ET less than previously
    estimated, and we find that managers may not need to rely as heavily on changes
    in land cover as currently proposed to achieve significant water savings. Because
    our method for estimating agricultural ET is based entirely on remote sensing
    and machine learning, it remains cost effective and has the potential to be used
    globally, especially as global ET datasets become increasingly available49. This
    work can help refine our understanding of agriculture’s effect on water resources
    and help managers achieve water-saving goals in water-stressed agricultural landscapes
    across the globe. Methods Agricultural ET We define agricultural ET as the difference
    between total ET over an agricultural parcel and the ET that would have been,
    had that parcel been fallow land instead (Eq. (1)). This definition recognizes
    that not all ET over agricultural lands, during the growing season or otherwise,
    can necessarily be attributed to agriculture. Such a definition is particularly
    useful from a management perspective, since it denotes the decrease in ET, or
    water savings, that one might expect if agriculture were to cease. $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{tot}}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{nat}}}}}}}}}\\end{array}$$
    (1) where ETag is agricultural ET, ETtot is the total ET over an agricultural
    parcel, and ETnat is the counterfactual ET that would occur naturally, were the
    same land fallow. We note that another, theoretically distinct counterfactual
    could be constructed to represent ETnat: ET if the land were undisturbed, natural
    land rather than fallow. We elect to simulate ET over fallow lands since it allows
    us to predict the potential water savings from fallowing, which has a management
    relevant interpretation. Total ET estimates We construct ETtot from OpenET ensemble
    data, available at a monthly time step from 2016-2021. This data is calculated
    as the average output of six different ET models estimated using Landsat data24.
    The data have been corrected for biases in ET resulting from data only being available
    during cloudless overpasses and have been extensively evaluated over a broad variety
    of land covers48. While they are published at a 30m scale, we resample to 70m
    to improve computational efficiency since this is well below the average size
    of an agricultural field in the Central Valley. Calculation of a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual using machine learning We estimate naturally-occurring ET for
    all agricultural pixels using a gradient boosting regressor trained on data from
    fallow lands. We choose a gradient boosting regressor due to its high flexibility
    in learning non-linear relationships and proven performance on tabular datasets
    relative to other regressors50. We retrieve the locations of fallow fields in
    the Central Valley from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) statewide crop
    mapping dataset over available years: 2016, 2018, and 2019. Pixels that are within
    the top 5% ET during July-September are removed due to some implausibly high numbers
    during these months that suggest mislabeling of an active agricultural pixel as
    fallow. While we believe that this data cleaning step is important to ensure an
    unbiased training set, omitting this step does not significantly change our main
    findings (Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Figs. 10–12). We additionally find
    that our findings do not change when training our model on data that are marked
    fallow by both the DWR dataset and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) (Supplementary
    Note 6, Supplementary Figs. 13–15). We predict naturally-occurring ET based on
    latitude and longitude, the month and year, as well as a broad set of additional
    variables describing topography (elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness
    index), soil quality (California Storie Index), and climate (Potential ET). The
    latitude, longitude, and month and year indicators are included to capture the
    spatial and temporal patterns in ET underlying the densely distributed fallow
    fields in our dataset. However, the inclusion of an indicator variable for each
    year in our model limits our analysis to 2016, 2018, and 2019, as these are the
    only years for which we have available land cover data. Nevertheless, given that
    ‘year’ contributes a mere 3% to our model’s predictive capability (see Supplementary
    Fig. 17), it may be considered non-essential for future research in this area.
    Including additional predictors in our model presents two benefits. First, they
    can improve the model’s predictive power. For example, we find that Potential
    ET contributes greatly to the model’s final predictions (Supplementary Fig. 17).
    Other variables are important to include because they can help correct for systematic
    differences between the fallow lands used to train our model and the active agricultural
    lands we apply the model to. Such differences could arise from farmers selecting
    lands to be fallowed due to their inherently lower productivity, which would negatively
    bias our estimates of counterfactual naturally-occurring ET in locations actively
    being cropped today. To assemble these predictor variables, we retrieve topographic
    information from the USGS National Elevations Database, soil quality information
    from the California Storie Index in the the USDA’s gSSURGO and STATSGO2 datasets,
    and Potential ET from the hPET global dataset51. To validate our naturally-occurring
    ET model, we split our dataset, reserving 60% for training, 10% for validation,
    and 30% for testing. In order to ensure that nearby and therefore very similar
    pixels are not present across multiple splits, we group our splits by 2 km2 squares,
    four times the size of a large agricultural field in the Central Valley. The entire
    dataset is made up of over 16 million pixels populating 8180 distinct 2 km2 regions.
    We set aside 4908 of these 2 km2 clusters for training, amounting to nearly 10
    million pixels. The testing split is composed of 2454 clusters. We tune hyperparameters
    using 100 iterations of a threefold randomized search cross-validation on an unclustered
    subset of our dataset. Randomized search cross-validation is similar to grid search
    cross-validation, but only reaches a random subset of the possible hyperparameter
    combinations to improve computational efficiency. We manually set the minimum
    number of samples required to split a node to 200 and the minimum number of samples
    required at each leaf node to 100 to account for the large size and spatial clustering
    of the dataset. Because we carry out our analyses using yearly estimates of agricultural
    ET, we validate our model on yearly estimates of naturally-occurring ET. Only
    fallow lands from the test data split are used in any subsequent analyses on fallow
    lands. Analysis After computing agricultural ET for all fields across the Central
    Valley following Eq. (1), we report a variety of statistical summaries and conduct
    scenarios manipulating the spatial distribution of agricultural ET. In order to
    ensure our analyses only capture variations across space, we aggregate our observations
    of agricultural ET to a yearly timestep and control for variation across years
    before beginning this analysis. To do so, we calculate an “adjusted” agricultural
    ET for each pixel by removing the difference between the mean agricultural ET
    for that year and the overall sample mean agricultural ET from the original agricultural
    ET calculation, as follows: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}-(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}-\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}})$$
    (2) where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) is the agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, ETp,y is the original
    agricultural ET, \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}\\) is the mean agricultural
    ET in year y across all pixels and \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}\\) is
    the mean agricultural ET across all pixels and years. Regressions To calculate
    point estimates and confidence intervals for the overall mean agricultural ET
    (Eq. (3)), the mean agricultural ET by crop group or crop type (Supplementary
    Note 7), or the mean agricultural ET by county (used to calculate irrigation efficiency)
    (Eq. (4)), we conduct a series of regressions with the following format: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\epsilon
    }_{p,y}$$ (3) $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={\\beta }_{p,y}\\times
    {{{{{{{{\\rm{Group}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p,y}}}}}}}}}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}$$ (4)
    where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) represents agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, α is a coefficient
    indicating the mean agricultural ET across all samples, Groupp,y represents a
    vector of dummy variables indicating which crop (for crop comparisons shown in
    Figs. 2 and S5) or county (for irrigation efficiency calculations shown in Fig.
    4; county does not vary by year) observation p, y falls into, βp,y is a corresponding
    vector of coefficients indicating the average agricultural ETs for each crop or
    county group, and ϵp,y is an error term. Standard errors are calculated using
    75 km clusters, as determined by plotting a variogram of the spatial autocorrelation
    in agricultural ET (Supplementary Fig. 16). The aggregate crop group (Fig. 2)
    and detailed crop type (Supplementary Fig. 5) are each assigned using the same
    DWR land cover data used to determine fallow status. In addition to using regression
    to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals, regression allows us to
    calculate the proportion of variation that is explained by a set of variables.
    This is because the R2 corresponds to the fraction of variation explained by the
    regression. We use this to assess the % variation explained by crop type, using
    Eq. (4), as well as that explained by climate, topography, and soil quality: $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\beta
    }_{p,y}\\times {X}_{p,y}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}\\end{array}$$ (5) where α is the intercept,
    Xp,y is a vector of variables including PET, elevation, aspect, slope, TWI, and
    soil quality, βp,y is a vector of coefficients for each variable in Xp,y, and
    ϵp,y is an error term. Management scenarios We conduct three scenarios in which
    we manipulate agricultural ET to mimic land management changes and report the
    decrease in overall agricultural ET within groundwater sub-basins across the Central
    Valley. Eq. (6) is a crop switching scenario (cs) where pixels with agricultural
    ET values above those of the median crop in a given sub-basin are replaced with
    that median crop. Eq. (7) is a farming practice scenario (fp) where pixels with
    agricultural ET values above crop and sub-basin-specific mean values are replaced
    with that crop and sub-basin mean. Finally, Eq. (8) is a fallowing scenario (fal)
    which replaces all pixels with agricultural ET values above the sub-basin-specific
    95th percentile with a value of zero agricultural ET. $${{{{{{{{\\rm{Savings}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{cs}}}}}}}}}=1-\\frac{\\mathop{\\sum
    }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}\\min ({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b},{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b})\\left.\\right)}{\\mathop{\\sum

    0,\\quad &\\,{{\\mbox{otherwise}}}\\,\\end{array}\\right.}{\\mathop{\\sum }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{i}}$$
    (8) where ETi is the adjusted agricultural ET for observation i, ETc,b is the
    average agricultural ET for crop type c in groundwater sub-basin \\(b,{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b}\\)
    is the median ETc,b in sub-basin b, and ET.95,b is the 95th percentile of agricultural
    ET in sub-basin b. To ensure that the water savings identified in our scenarios
    result from factors that can be influenced by management interventions, we account
    for orchard age, climate, and other physical characteristics of the land. To account
    for orchard age, we remove young orchards that are have been bearing fruit for
    5 or less years, or old orchards that are going to be removed within the next
    year (Supplementary Note 2). Because we are only able to label orchard age in
    this way for all orchards in year 2019 (the DWR crop type data we use are only
    available starting 2014), we exclusively use 2019 for this part of the analysis.
    Since we are only using one year, we do not adjust the water use according to
    the year like we do for the other analyses. To account for differences in climate
    and other characteristics inherent to the land, we control for potential ET, soil
    quality, topographic wetness index, elevation, aspect and slope using linear regression
    (Eq. (5)). Irrigation efficiency We define irrigation efficiency as the proportion
    of irrigation water that results in agricultural ET, and is thus consumed by agriculture
    (Eq. (9)). To determine amounts of water withdrawn for irrigation, we retrieve
    county level irrigation water use data from the USGS National Water Information
    System. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted at the point of use,
    rather than the water’s point of origin. These data are gathered every five years
    with the most recently available data from 2015. Because there is no match for
    the years of available irrigation data and our agricultural ET estimates from
    2016, 2018, and 2019, we use the two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, which represent
    a non-drought year and a drought year, respectively. $${{{{{{{\\rm{IRRIGATION}}}}}}}}\\,{{{{{{{\\rm{EFFICIENCY}}}}}}}}=\\frac{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\rm{Irrigation}}}}}}}}}$$
    (9) where ETag is agricultural ET (Eq. (1)) and Irrigation is the water withdrawn
    for irrigation. ETag and Irrigation must be in matching units, either volumetric
    or depth. We calculate both in mm per year. We assume all active agricultural
    lands in the Central Valley are irrigated and calculate the average agricultural
    ET in mm per year over active agricultural lands in each county. To also retrieve
    average irrigation amount across irrigated lands in a county in mm per year, we
    divide the volume of irrigation water by the average area of irrigated land in
    each county. Because some counties are not fully encompassed within the Central
    Valley, we assume that irrigation in a given county is evenly distributed over
    irrigated lands within and outside of the Central Valley. Data availability The

    rice plants. Introduction Rice is an important staple food worldwide. Rice is
    the largest water-consuming crop in the central rice production regions in the
    world, and water scarcity is bound to threaten rice production [1]. Additionally,
    the water consumption in paddy fields would increase significantly due to global
    climate change in the future. The unfavorable factors must aggravate the water
    crisis in rice fields [2, 3]. Leaf water content (LWC) is an important evaluation
    index for crop water demand status [4]. Monitoring LWC effectively achieves precise
    irrigation, improves water utilization, and alleviates the water crisis. Hyperspectral
    remote sensing technology has recently been widely used in agricultural production
    due to its rapid, nondestructive, and real-time monitoring of crop physiological
    and biochemical characteristics [5,6,7]. Early LWC spectral modeling studies improved
    prediction accuracy by constructing various types of vegetation indices from sensitive
    spectral bands, such as the moisture stress index (MSI) and water index (WI) [8,
    9]. Previous spectral monitoring studies have initially focused on vegetation
    indices derived from spectral bands. Researchers construct different vegetation
    indices by spectrally sensitive bands to improve the prediction accuracy of LWC
    [10, 11]. Vegetation indices are frequently screened by selecting spectral information
    and have a good correlation with LWC at multiple points over many years [12, 13],
    but the established models usually ignore the effects of the growing environment
    and growth characteristics on LWC of the crops. Climate characteristics and physiological
    status of the plants are important factors affecting LWC [14, 15]. The neglected
    information could be the primary reason for the poor generalizability of existing
    vegetation index models in practical applications. Therefore, integrating the
    actors into the spectral monitoring models of LWC would be more high precision
    due to considering the potential effects of the growing environment and growth
    characteristics on LWC [16, 17]. Qin et al. [18] have recently improved crop nitrogen
    content prediction accuracy using a spectral model that combines image feature
    parameters and fluorescence parameters. These results supported our inferences
    that introducing multi-source data may be important means to improve the monitoring
    accuracy of LWC spectral modeling in rice plants. Choosing modeling methods are
    one of key steps in building monitoring models. Vegetation index monitoring models
    have been usually established using linear and nonlinear functions [19, 20]. These
    traditional monitoring models do not represent the complex relationship between
    various indicators. Machine learning algorithms with sophisticated functionality
    and the ability to handle complex relationships between predictors and target
    variables can be a good solution to this problem [21, 22]. The accuracy and stability
    of models have significantly improved with the rapid development of machine learning
    algorithms, and these are widely adopted when establishing rice nitrogen nutrition
    monitoring models [23,24,25]. Moreover, machine learning algorithms allow the
    use of different classes of sample data as input variables, allowing multiple
    sources of data (physiological and ecological indicators and spectral information)
    to be effectively coupled and can effectively discriminate between differences
    in the contributions of the input variables, allowing the model’s parameters can
    be fully utilized. Therefore, we speculated that the monitoring capacities of
    vegetation index models integrating with multi-source data would also have significant
    advantages using machine learning algorithms when predicting the LWC of rice plants
    based on the results previous studies [16, 26]. Three irrigation regimes and four
    varieties with different drought tolerance capacities were established LWC difference
    populations in field experiments. This study’s objectives are to (1) select spectrally
    sensitive bands with high correlation with LWC at multiple growth stages; (2)
    build a new vegetation index model of LWC integrating multi-source data parameters
    after selecting key physiological and ecological indicators; and (3) use a machine
    learning algorithm to optimize the coupling model and select the optimal algorithm
    to monitor the LWC. Materials and methods Site and treatment description Three
    irrigation regimes, including two water-saving irrigation regimes named mild alternate
    dry and wet irrigation (MADW), severe alternate dry and wet irrigation (SADW)
    and traditional irrigation regime (CK), were conducted with four rice cultivars
    in Anhui province of China in 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 1). The planting and sampling
    plan details and soil characteristics are presented in Table 1. The climate conditions
    are displayed in Fig. 2. The irrigation regimes were conducted when rice seedlings
    were planted in plots. The irrigation criterion referenced the classical definition
    for the MADW and SADW treatments [27]. The supplementary irrigation with 2–3 cm
    water layer was carried out when the soil water potential at 20 cm soil layer
    reached − 15 KPa and − 30 KPa in the MADW and SADW treatments during whole growth
    stages of rice plants, respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. The
    soil water potential of each plot was monitored by a tensiometer (Watermark, Irrometer
    Company Riverside, CA, USA). Moreover, 2–3 cm water later was always maintained
    for the CK treatment during whole growth stages. Generally, 9–14, 5–8, and 18–24
    times irrigated practices were applied for the MADW, SADW, and CK treatments,
    respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. Fig. 1 Sketch of field experiments

    divided into three applications for each treatment: 40% as a basal fertilizer,
    30% at the early tiller stage, and 30% at the panicle differentiation stage. The
    nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the rate of 240 kg ha−1. Phosphorus and potassium
    fertilizers (P2O5 75 kg ha−1 and K2O 225 kg ha−1) were also applied as basal fertilizers.
    Plot sizes for each experiment were 12 m2 and 40 m2 in Hefei and Fuyang, respectively.
    All experimental rows were spaced 30.0 cm apart, and plants in a row were spaced
    13.3 cm apart. Measurements Hyperspectral and vegetation index Canopy reflectance
    spectra of rice plants were collected for the booting, flowering, initial grain
    filling, and middle grain filling stages using spectral scanning equipment (ASD
    Field Spec 4, Boulder, CO, USA). The band amplitude of the device ranged from
    350 to 2500 nm. The measurements were conducted under clear and cloudless sky
    conditions between 10:00 and 14:00 [16]. After measuring 10 times for each sample,
    the average value was calculated, and the reference plate was used to correct
    the instrument every 15 min. The representative hills were monitored in each plot
    for all treatments at each observed time. Numerous vegetation indices have been
    applied to monitoring crop water content. The normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) has been widely utilized in monitoring plant water using remote sensing
    methods due to its simple construction and effective improvement of spectral monitoring
    accuracy with multi-band analysis compared with other vegetation indices. Thus,
    this study used canopy spectral data to construct the normalized difference index
    (ND) and five traditional vegetation indices. The calculation equations were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2 List of vegetation indices used in this study Full size table
    SPAD value and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters SPAD value of rice leaves was
    monitored using a chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Company, SPAD-520 plus, Japan).
    The average value of the top three fully expanded leaves was defined as the SPAD
    value of the whole plant. The five independent plants were measured in each plot
    across cultivars, water treatments, and observed periods. The leaves used to measure
    SPAD value were chosen, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of rice leaves
    were determined using a portable pulse-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ
    Company, PAM-2500, Germany). These leaves were used to determine the minimum fluorescence
    level (Fo) and the maximum fluorescence level (Fm) of dark-adapted leaves at dawn
    for all cultivars and treatments. The steady-state Fo was measured using far-red
    light with illumination less than 1 mol m−2 s−1. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse
    with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was supplied to determine the Fm. Moreover, the steady-state
    fluorescence yield (Fs) was recorded at the forenoon with clear and cloudless
    sky conditions. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was
    stimulated to obtain the maximal fluorescence level (Fm''). Finally, the maximum
    photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency (Y(II)) were
    calculated: (1) (2) Leaf water content (LWC) The fresh leaf mass (FW) was determined
    by weighing the top three fully expanded leaves immediately. Five hills were sampled
    in each plot for four cultivars and three water treatments during each observed
    period. Fresh leaves were weighed and dried at 80 ℃ to constant weight at each
    sampling. The weight was marked as dry mass (DW). The LWC was calculated as follows:
    (3) Crop water stress index (CWSI) CWSI was calculated as follows [31, 32]: (4)
    (5) (6) (7) where Tc is the crop canopy temperature (℃), and Ta is the air temperature
    (℃). Tmin is the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃),
    Tmax is the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃), and
    VPD is the air saturation water vapor pressure deficit (KPa). VPG is the difference
    between the air saturation water vapor pressure and VPD when the air temperature
    is Ta and (Ta + A), respectively. A and B are linear regression coefficients.
    RH is the relative humidity of air (%). In this study, a HOBO UX100-003 temperature
    and humidity recorder (Onset, USA) was placed in each plot to automatically record
    rice canopy temperature and humidity every 1 h interval throughout the day. Leaf
    area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (Biomass), and Grain yield Five representative
    hills, which plants in the hills had uniform growth capacities, were randomly
    selected from each plot at each sampling time across all cultivars and irrigation
    treatments. The hills with excessively vigorous or weak plants were not sampled
    to minimize sampling error. All green leaves per hill were scanned using a portable
    leaf area meter (CI-203, CID Inc., USA). The averaged leaf area in a each plot
    was then calculated from the five hills and marked with D (cm2). Finally, the
    scanned green leaf, remaining yellow leaves, stem, and panicle organs were dried
    at 80 ℃ to constant weight to assess the biomass of each plot. (8) where ρ is
    the planting density per square meter (hill m−2). Plants from a 2 m2 area were
    harvested at maturity to calculate the actual grain yield with 13.5% moisture
    content in each plot across cultivars and water treatments. Regression models
    Some common and classic machine learning algorithms were preliminary assessed
    to select elite algorithms with high monitoring abilities to LWC of rice plants.
    Finally, the four machine learning algorithms named decision tree regression (DT),
    random forest regression (RF), K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), and gradient
    boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) were adopted in this study. The four
    selected methods were successfully applied on estimating various ecological parameters
    such as water content of wheat plants and soil moisture of wheat fields [16, 33].
    In addition, the scikit-learn packages of the four algorithms were from Python
    3.8 software (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) MLR is the most basic and commonly used method for combining two or more
    independent variables that jointly predict or estimate the dependent variable
    [34]. The y is the dependent variable. The x1, x2… xk are the independent variables.
    The multiple linear regression was calculated as follows: (9) where b0 is the
    constant term, e is the error term, and b1, b2… bk are the regression coefficients.
    When x1, x2…, and xk are fixed, b1(k) represents the effect of increase or decrease
    in x1(k) on y for each unit or named the partial regression coefficient of x1(k)
    on y. Decision tree regression (DT) DT is a way to infer classification rules
    as a decision tree from a set of unordered and irregular data, using a top-down
    recursive approach to compare attribute values of nodes inside the decision tree
    [35]. Each internal node is a splitting problem in a decision tree. A test for
    some instance attribute is specified, and it splits the samples arriving at that
    node according to a particular attribute. Each subsequent branch of the node corresponds
    to one of the possible values of that attribute. The prediction results are the
    average values of the output variables in the samples contained in the leaf nodes
    of the regression tree. In this study, the maximum depth of the tree was set as
    10, and the number of trees was 100. Random forest regression (RF) RF resulted
    from random sampling from sample observations and feature variables of the modeled
    data among many decision trees; each sampling result is a tree [36]. Meanwhile,
    each tree generated rules and judgment values that match its properties. Finally,
    the forest algorithm integrated the rules and judgment values of all decision
    trees to achieve random forest regression. K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN)
    KNN was predicted by computing the spatial similarity relationship between the
    k nearest neighbors and the predictor. The algorithm was frequently used for classification
    problems in the early stage and gradually applied to parameter estimation [37].
    The primary principle of the KNN algorithm is that a prediction sample has K nearest
    neighbors in the feature space. Then, the class of the prediction sample was usually
    determined by the majority class of the K nearest neighbors. The K data set value
    was chosen appropriately according to the samples. The model was simplified, and
    useful information was lost if the data set was too large. Oppositely, the model
    would be over-fitted if the data set is too small. The K data set was defined
    as 3 in this study. Gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) GBDT is
    an improved algorithm based on the booting algorithm [38]. The booting algorithm
    assigned the same weight to each training sample in the initial training and then
    increased the weights of the error points after each training session to generate
    multiple base learners. Finally, these base learners were combined, and the model
    was formed using weighting or voting approaches. The difference between gradient
    boosting tree regression and classification algorithms was that the input training
    data was residual. The previous prediction was incorporated into the residual
    to find the training data for the current round instead of the gradient of the
    loss function. Data analysis and model verification The Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) helps to measure the linear correlation between variables [39]. In this
    study, PCC was simply regarded as supplementary means to eliminate unimportant
    indicators with low correlation coefficient and to obtain eigenvalues with high
    correlation coefficient. This meant that indicators closely related to LWC were
    used to build models to improve performance. After removing invalid samples from
    the two-year experiments from 2021 to 2022, 91 sample data for each growth stage
    were obtained. In multiple linear regression (MLR), 2022 data were used for modeling
    (55), whereas 2021 data were used for validation (36). The measured data were
    randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets in the machine learning
    regression algorithm. The regression model''s accuracy was evaluated using the
    determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The overall
    model was evaluated in the graph, including linear regression and a 1:1 dash-line,
    to determine the relationship between the predicted and measured values. The calculation
    equations are presented in (9)–(10): (10) (11) where is the measured value of
    LWC, is the measured mean value of LWC, is the predicted value of the model, and
    n is the sample size. The larger the R2 value, the better the accuracy of the
    model. The RMSE reflects the degree of dispersion and deviation between the model’s
    predicted and true values. The smaller the value, the better the prediction of
    the model. The workflow of the LWC prediction procedures is illustrated in Fig.
    3. Data preprocessing included the following processes: (1) normal distribution
    test and scatter plots were performed for the original data such as vegetation
    index parameters, leaf water content, and physiological and ecological indexes
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S1–S4). (2) Outliers detection of all parameters were
    shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. (3) The multicollinearity test between ND
    and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI at whole observed stages were
    also adopted by variance inflation factor and tolerance values (Additional file
    1: Table S2). Fig. 3 Flow chart of this study Full size image Results The classical
    and new vegetation index for monitoring LWC The sensitive bands of LWC were analyzed
    and tested using the normalized difference vegetation index formula at the booting,
    flowering, initial grain filling, and middle grain filling stages to improve the
    accuracy of the hyperspectral monitoring model for LWC. The classical vegetation
    indices, such as NDII and MSI, had a significant positive correlation with LWC
    and high predictive abilities (Table 3). The vegetation index ND constructed by
    the screened sensitive bands (1287 and 1673 mm) also had a significant positive
    correlation with LWC (Fig. 4). The R2 in the ND(1287,1673) model was higher than
    that in NDII and MSI vegetation indices at each growth stage. These results indicated
    that vegetation index ND was an optimal predicted model at each growth stage of
    rice plants. The R2 of the linear equation between LWC (y) and ND(1287,1673) (x)
    was 0.48, 0.64, 0.57, and 0.53, and the corresponding prediction R2 was 0.36,
    0.67, 0.64, and 0.52 at the booting, flowering, initial grain filling, and middle
    grain filling stages, respectively (Fig. 5). Table 3 Coefficient of determination

    physiological-ecological indicators had obvious effects on LWC at each growth
    stage and yield (Fig. 6). The LWC had the highest correlation with grain yield
    at the booting, flowering, and initial grain filling stages. The LWC is the most
    important parameter that regulates grain yield, especially for different irrigation

    at each observed stage, followed by the Fv/Fm (0.56–0.71) and SPAD (0.53–0.67).
    Therefore, CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD can be considered reliable multi-source data
    to improve the detection accuracy of LWC using the vegetation index model. Fig.

    functions between LWC and ND(1287,1673) at different growth stages (Fig. 5) were
    systematically analyzed using multi-source data, such as SPAD, Fv/Fm, and CWSI
    (Fig. 7). Both a and b have significantly quadratic curve relations with CWSI,
    SPAD, and Fv/Fm. For a parameter, the determination coefficient (R2) of the curves
    reached the highest for the CWSI (R2 = 0.92), followed by the SPAD and Fv/Fm.
    In contrast, Fv/Fm had the greatest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.99), while CWSI
    had the lowest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.37). The results illustrate that SPAD,
    Fv/Fm, and CWSI can be regarded as useful multi-source data to improve the prediction
    capacities of LWC. Fig. 7 The SPAD value (a), Fv/Fm (b), and CWSI (c) at different

    performance of LWC by coupling multi-source data There were no multicollinearity
    between ND and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI based on the tolerance
    and variance inflation factor values (Additional file 1: Table S2). Also, Durbin
    Watson test indicated that the established multivariate linear regressed models
    in this study were basically meet the requirements of linear model (Additional
    file 1: Table S2). The indicators CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD were introduced into the
    ND(1287,1673) model to improve the prediction model accuracy of LWC further (Table
    4). The results demonstrated that the ND(1287,1673) model integrating with multi-source
    data enhanced predictive power than the conventional ND(1287,1673) model (Fig.
    5 and Table 4). The coupled models of ND(1287,1673) and CWSI had the best monitoring
    capacity to LWC at the booting and flowering stages (Fig. 8). The R2 improved
    from 0.48–0.64 in conventional ND(1287,1673) models to 0.69–0.75 in the coupled
    models. Prediction R2 also improved from 0.36–0.67 in conventional ND(1287,1673)
    models to 0.65–0.69 in the coupled models at the booting and flowering stages.
    Moreover, the coupling models of ND(1287,1673) and Fv/Fm were optimal at the initial
    and middle grain filling. The R2 and the corresponding prediction R2 improved
    in the coupling models than in conventional ND(1287,1673) models at the initial
    and middle grain filling. Table 4 The ND(1287,1673) models predicting LWC after

    Full size image Discussion Relationship between multi-source data and LWC A suitable
    vegetation index is important to construct an LWC spectral monitoring model in
    smart agriculture. The first important step is to screen the sensitive band. However,
    there are some differences on the selected water-sensitive bands for different
    crops. Thomas et al. [40] discovered a significant correlation between the relative
    water content of cotton leaves and the reflectance values in the near-infrared
    (NIR) bands (1450 and 1930 nm). Yang et al. [41] suggest that the sensitive band
    range of LWC in wheat plants is located in the visible (400–780 nm) and NIR bands
    (1400–2500 nm). This study selected different spectral indices from previous studies
    to establish relationships with rice LWC. However, the correlation was not optimal.
    The ND constructed by the NIR band at 1287 and 1673 nm was instead optimal (Table
    3). This study’s results were inconsistent with those of previous studies. One
    of the important reasons could be that vegetation index models for monitoring
    LWC in our study considered the multiple growth stages of rice plants, rather
    than focusing on a specific growth stage in previous studies. Additionally, the
    spectral data obtained from different ecological sites, climates, and varieties.
    In this study, the varieties were selected for their commonality bands, considering
    the universality of the varieties from which the four rice varieties with a large
    span of validation years and large differences in drought resistance were selected.
    Recently, multi-source data related to environmental factors coupled with the
    spectral monitoring model of LWC has been successfully established in wheat plants
    to reduce the errors caused by environmental and physiological factors during
    the spectral monitoring process [16]. This study used the Pearson correlation
    coefficient method to analyze the physiological and ecological indicators related
    to LWC. Our results displayed that CWSI, Fv/Fm and SPAD would be considered as
    optimized multi-source data because the parameters had a higher correlation with
    LWC compared to other physiological and agronomic indices during whole observed
    periods (Fig. 6). These findings were also consistent with the basic physiological
    laws of plants that the three parameters would be changed with the change of LWC.
    First, the transpiration rate quickly reduces with declining LWC in rice plants
    [42, 43]. A low transpiration rate increases canopy temperature for a short time
    and then fleetly regulates CWSI in the canopy of plants [44, 45]. Second, H2O
    is insufficient to maintain its physiological activities when LWC is low in rice
    plants; the phenomenon quickly downregulates photosynthetic performance, such
    as declining Fv/Fm [46,47,48]. Third, SPAD biosynthesis would be hindered, and
    decomposition could be accelerated if LWC remains low for a long time, resulting
    in the yellowing of leaves [49]. Finally, the fluctuant sensitive parameters lead
    to significant changes in population characteristics, such as leaf area, biomass,
    and yield, presenting different degrees of decline [50]. Therefore, we deduce
    that CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD should be introduced into the spectral monitoring model
    to improve the R2 for monitoring LWC in whole growth stages of rice plants. Coupling
    multi-source data for monitoring rice LWC The canopy structure and growth environment
    of rice have been changing throughout the whole growth period, resulting in different
    spectral reflectance data, making it difficult to accurately build a water prediction
    model for the whole growth period with a single vegetation index model [51]. A
    good relationship between physiological and ecological indicators and spectral
    information is the key to rapid and non-destructive monitoring of coupled multi-source
    data. The relationships between CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD and the slope (a) and intercept
    (b) of the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models were systematically analyzed
    at each observed period to achieve accurate prediction of LWC (Fig. 7). The parameter
    a had the closest relationship with CWSI with R2 of 0.92. However, the parameter
    b had the closest relationship with Fv/Fm with R2 of 0.99. These results indicate
    that the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models could be largely influenced
    by physiological and ecological factors when LWC was monitored using spectroscopic
    equipment. Therefore, slope and intercept could be defined as ecological and physiological
    factors in conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models, especially for monitoring
    LWC in rice plants. This evidence confirms the necessity of incorporating physiological
    parameters into the conventional ND(1287,1673) model to improve LWC monitoring
    accuracy in rice plants. Currently, multi-source data are widely used in hyperspectral
    monitoring. However, most studies have utilized a single type of multi-source
    numbers to construct models independently or in combination, and few studies have
    discussed the effect of coupled multi-source data on the monitoring performance
    of rice LWC models. This study uses a commonly used multiple linear regression
    algorithm to estimate rice LWC based on coupled multi-source data and compare
    its monitoring performance. The results revealed that the monitoring capacities
    in ND(1287,1673) models coupled with physiological and ecological factors were
    significantly increased than conventional ND(1287,1673) models across all observed
    stages (Tables 3 and 4). The coupled model of ND + CWSI and ND + Fv/Fm had the
    best monitoring capacities at the booting to flowering and initial to middle grain
    filling stages, respectively. The different coupled parameters at different growth
    stages may related to the differences in rice growth characteristics. Previous
    studies have demonstrated that the canopy structure is unstable and that leaf
    area and biomass are in a state of constant growth during the booting and flowering
    stages in rice plants [52]. Irrigation regimes directly regulate canopy growth
    and development [53]. Therefore, the canopy micro-ecological factors, such as
    photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and humidity, constantly fluctuate
    [54], especially for different water treatments. Finally, CWSI is a sensitive
    index at this stage because CWSI is mainly regulated by the micro-ecological factor
    [31, 32]. However, rice plants are in the senescence stage after flowering. Leaf
    photosynthetic capacity significantly declines during the grain-filling stage
    compared to pre-flowering in rice plants [43, 55]. Additionally, photosynthetic
    performances are susceptive to different irrigation regimes during senescence
    processes [56]. Fv/Fm is an important index evaluating photosynthetic performance.
    Therefore, photosynthetic performance could be a better multi-source parameter
    to predict LWC during the rice-filling stage. Comparison of machine learning algorithms
    Machine learning algorithms have recently been widely used in model monitoring
    research and have become popular tools in precision agricultural production research.
    In this study, four machine learning algorithms, DT, RF, KNN, and GBDT were used
    to perform operations based on coupled models using rice flowering data as an
    example (Table 5). The results indicated that the R2 for the simulation and validation
    sets of DT, RF, KNN and GBDT were 0.80–0.93 and 0.75–0.86, respectively, which
    the R2 of machine learning algorithms were 1.16–1.35 times higher for the simulation
    sets and 1.09–1.25 times higher for the validation sets compared with MLR (Fig.
    10). Among them, GBDT has the highest R2 with low and stable RMSE. Therefore,
    the GBDT model would be considered as the best machine learning algorithm for
    monitoring LWC in this study’s simulating and verification data sets. Previous
    research supports our results that the GBDT algorithm has higher prediction accuracy
    for leaf area in maize plants among the aforementioned algorithms [57]. GBDT can
    improve prediction accuracy by constructing a weak learner to correct the original
    model error via residuals and resultant iterations when the sample size is small
    [58]. The same weights are assigned for each input factor for the other algorithms;
    the algorithm would fail to determine the primary contributing factor in the input
    factor if the training data are insufficient [57]. This may be the primary reason
    the GBDT algorithm has significant advantages to improve LWC monitoring capabilities
    in this study because our sample size could not be abundant enough to support
    the data requirements of other algorithms. In summary, machine learning positively
    improves the monitoring abilities of LWC in rice plants. Future perspectives Factors
    such as fertility period and rice LWC changes lead to parameter differences between
    relevant indicators extracted from various data sources. Current crop monitoring
    models are mostly single-factor statistical models that are difficult to consider
    crop growth and development, yield formation and its interactions with climate
    and soil environment, and lack universality and dynamics. Therefore, coupling
    spectral remote sensing information with multivariate data can construct a spectral
    monitoring model with high accuracy and stable reliability of crop growth, moisture
    content, and other indicators, providing an effective solution to the spectral
    monitoring problem. In this study, only four rice cultivars were considered after
    the booting stage, and the early growth of rice has yet to be monitored. Establishing
    a standardized water stress detection and diagnosis system based on water critical
    thresholds at various growth stages of rice will require the accumulation of data
    from multi-year, multi-point, continuous trials based on different rice variety
    types. This can accurately monitor the LWC to ensure high rice yield, improving
    water resource utilization efficiency and providing a basis for implementing precision
    agriculture. Conclusion In this study, the LWC of rice with different cultivars,
    years, and water treatments was monitored based on multi-source data (physiological
    and ecological indicators and spectral information) with machine learning, explored
    the performance of single and combined multi-source data in LWC monitoring, and
    utilized different physiological indicators to establish two monitoring models
    for the growth differences of rice in the initial and middle stages. The results
    displayed that ND + CWSI had better monitoring performance in the early stage
    (booting to flowering stage), while ND + Fv/Fm was better in the late stage (initial
    to middle grain filling stage). Additionally, this study''s newly constructed
    vegetation index ND(1287,1673) also has good monitoring capacities for LWC in
    rice. Meanwhile, the machine learning algorithm (GBDT) further improves the monitoring
    performance of the model. In summary, this study confirms that using multi-source
    data and machine learning can improve the performance of hyperspectral prediction
    of rice LWC. Availability of data and materials The datasets used and/or analyzed

    Open access 21 March 2024 Introduction The Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) have the
    highest population density and growth rate in India. Fog formation in the IGP
    is very common during wintertime – every other day in Delhi – adversely affecting
    society and the economy through transport and health impacts1,2,3,4. Numerous
    studies have examined fog prediction over the IGP region using a variety of techniques
    including statistical methods5, numerical weather prediction (NWP)6,7,8,9,10 and
    diagnostic approaches11,12. However, reliably accurate operational forecasts of
    fog events remain elusive. The majority of fog events over the IGP of northern
    India are seen in wintertime. A 71% increase in the number of fog days in winter
    has been observed in Delhi over the last three decades, from 38 fog days in the
    1980s to 65 in recent years13,14, the cause of which is unclear. Located within
    the IGP, the Indian capital city Delhi is the second most populated (22.7 million)
    and fastest-growing megacity in the world15. Delhi has been suffering severely
    from deteriorated air quality, with PM2.5 concentrations often far exceeding the
    safe limits set by the World Health Organisation as well as the national ambient
    air quality standards of India16,17, and this is associated with low visibility
    during wintertime13,14,18,19. Aerosols also play a role as cloud condensation
    nuclei and high aerosol concentrations can alter the fog’s microphysical and radiative
    properties. However, while aerosol induced haze is undoubtedly a common phenomenon
    in Delhi (and in the IGP in general), air pollution alone does not fully explain
    the observed trends in fog frequency20. An important alternative driver may be
    the rapid parallel increase in observed low-level humidity21, as evidenced for
    example at Safdarjung airport in Delhi where the December and January average
    dewpoint temperature increased from 7 °C in 1980 to 10.5 °C in 201922. We hypothesise
    that this dramatic increase in wintertime humidity is linked to the increased
    use of irrigation for agriculture in winter in the IGP region. Accurate prediction
    of fog using NWP models is a major challenge due to the complex feedbacks between
    many processes involving the land surface, boundary-layer mixing, cloud microphysics
    and cloud-aerosol interactions. These small-scale processes are parameterised
    in NWP and fog simulation is highly sensitive to these physical parameterisations8,9,23,24,25,26.
    In particular, the land surface and boundary-layer schemes are critical for accurately
    simulating fog onset24,27; while the microphysics scheme is pivotal for simulating
    fog development and dissipation23,24,28,29,30. Soil moisture is a key surface
    property. Higher soil moisture leads to greater evaporation and a moister boundary
    layer; while it also affects soil thermal conductivity, surface temperature and
    surface heat fluxes, all impacting on fog development25,27,31 and dissipation32.
    Multiple NWP models have systematic near-surface dry biases over the IGP during
    winter11,33,34. For example, there were dry biases over Delhi in an operational
    version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, resulting in missed
    fog events in the winters of 2016/17 and 2017/1833. This humidity bias was also
    present on days when fog events were simulated and contributed to errors in the
    onset time. Similarly, in the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), dry biases are
    consistently present in wintertime simulations for Delhi on both clear and foggy
    days34. An initial soil moisture model bias could theoretically be corrected through
    improved data assimilation of satellite-derived soil moisture35,36. Such a correction
    could be achieved by taking a fraction of the satellite derived soil moisture
    anomaly from the monthly climatology and adding it to the model climatology37.
    However, model climatologies are currently too dry in the IGP, as they don’t include
    irrigation, and thus even after adjustment biases remain35. We hypothesise that
    the cause of this dry bias is a lack of irrigation being represented in these
    NWP models. Since the 1960s, India has seen the impact of the Green Revolution38
    partly through the adoption of modern crop varieties leading to enhanced yields39,40.
    The production of foodgrains, such as rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses,
    increased at an average rate of 2.5% per year between 1950 and 2007. Foodgrain
    production reached a record of 285.2 million tons in 2018-19 (Supplementary Fig.
    1); with India now the second largest producer of wheat worldwide41. This increase
    in agricultural production has not come from any major change in production area
    (Supplementary Fig. 1), but instead from the widespread adoption of a double-cropping
    system42, adding a winter season (Rabi; Nov-Feb) of primarily wheat to the traditional
    summer season (Kharif; Jun-Sep) of primarily rice. Winter is a very dry season
    in the northern plains of India43 (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e, f), so this has required
    a major expansion in irrigation (Fig. 1a, b), using groundwater and water canals,
    increasing from less than 20% of cropland in the 1960s to more than 45% in recent
    years44 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Zaveri and Lobell41 estimate that national Indian
    wheat yields in the 2000s were 13% higher than they would have been without this
    expansion in irrigation. Since the 1970s water use has increased in the winter
    months by 10 mm/month/decade or more in the north-western IGP (Fig. 1b shows January;
    Supplementary Fig. 2g, h, i show each winter month). Fig. 1: Irrigation and rainfall

    shown in black. Full size image The recent growth in extensive irrigation over
    the IGP has resulted in important changes in surface soil moisture, with noticeable
    increases over the north-western region45. Over India, additional soil moisture
    has been linked to an increase in evaporation (latent heat flux) and decreases
    in sensible heat fluxes and surface temperature, with consequent impacts on heat46,
    moist heat stress47,48 and precipitation49,50,51,52,53. As an example, Barton
    et al.54. found that a dry and warm bias exists in the Indian operational model
    during the monsoon period over the IGP which is collocated with the areas equipped
    for irrigation, concluding that an irrigation scheme is urgently needed. Nevertheless,
    all the above studies only consider the summer season. Wey et al.55 discussed
    the effects of wintertime irrigation in Northern India on monsoonal circulation.
    However, to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous assessments
    of the impacts of winter irrigation in India on fog. Given the dramatic increases
    in wintertime irrigation and fog frequency in northern India over recent decades,
    we hypothesise that irrigation practices in winter have decisively contributed
    to the observed increased fog frequency and thus need to be accounted for in NWP
    models in a realistic way. To examine this hypothesis we present, for the first
    time, simulations of fog events with and without irrigation represented in a state-of-the-art
    NWP model (the Met Office Unified Model, MetUM) in its configuration for the IGP
    region (the Delhi Research Unified Model, DRUM) and compare against observations.
    Irrigation is represented realistically - with an appropriate amount of water
    added to the model’s soil moisture in areas that we know are irrigated in the
    winter season (Fig. 1d); experimental details and data sets are described in the
    Methods section. Results Observed trends To demonstrate the increasing importance
    of irrigation, we examine the trends in irrigation and rainfall over the IGP in
    January over the 1972–2010 period (Fig. 1b, c). There is a large and significant
    positive trend in irrigation water use over the north-west region, especially
    over central and eastern Punjab, northern Rajasthan, and western Haryana (Fig.
    1b). This area represents a heavily irrigated region for the Rabi crop season
    during winter (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). In contrast, the magnitudes
    of winter season rainfall (Supplementary Fig. 2d–f) and rainfall trends (Fig.
    1c) are relatively small for this dry season. Model results To investigate the
    impact of irrigation effects on fog formation over the Delhi region, a comparison
    of model sensitivity experiments is presented. Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution
    of deep fog obtained from the INSAT-3D satellite fog/low cloud product and from
    irrigated and non-irrigated model simulations respectively for the first fog event:
    at 18Z 21st January 2016 (development stage), and 00Z (mature stage) and 06Z (dissipation
    stage) on 22nd January 2016. Observations indicate widespread optically thick
    (deep) fog occurrence during the development (Fig. 2a) and mature stages (Fig.
    2b), with the fog beginning to dissipate in the south-east during the dissipation
    stage (Fig. 2c). The irrigated simulation captures the deep fog distribution well
    (Fig. 2d, e); in contrast to the non-irrigated simulation which only simulates
    less widespread shallow fog which dissipates too early (Fig. 2g–i). The irrigated
    simulation is successful in simulating the occurrence, extent and depth of the
    fog over the central and north-western parts of the domain, but not over the south-eastern
    region of the IGP. Fig. 2: Spatial distribution of fog during the first fog event.
    Panels show shallow fog, deep fog and low cloud at the development stage 18Z 21
    January (left), mature stage 00Z 22 January (centre) and dissipation stage 06Z
    22 January 2016. The rows show observations from INSAT-3D (a–c); then irrigated
    (d–f) and non-irrigated (g–i) model output. Full size image To examine how irrigation-effects
    are manifest, we analyse maps of specific humidity and wind for the same stages
    of this fog event to ascertain the impact of moisture advection from irrigated
    to non-irrigated regions (Fig. 3). The near-surface atmosphere is more humid,
    by typically 1 g/kg, across the majority of the IGP region. The winds are generally
    light (<5 m/s) and north-westerly over Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi,
    (typical at this time of year as a result of the subtropical westerly jet over
    northern India and channelling by the Himalayas to the north) so advect moisture
    from areas of irrigation in the NW of the domain (see Fig. 1d) over the partly
    non-irrigated region of Uttar Pradesh, resulting in an increase in humidity there
    too. The increase in specific humidity in the irrigated compared to non-irrigated
    simulation is evident in all fog stages (development, mature and dissipation);
    i.e., after 18, 24 and 30 h of simulation time. The increased near-surface humidity
    is driven by increased latent heat flux over the irrigated area (not shown) resulting
    from the increase in available soil moisture to evaporate. The increase in latent
    heat flux is balanced by a decrease in the sensible heat flux compared to simulations
    without irrigation. The marked increase in moisture downstream of the irrigated
    area demonstrates a clear non-local impact, illustrating that non-irrigated urban
    areas such as Delhi can be affected by the advection of additional moisture from
    irrigated areas. Fig. 3: Spatial distribution of near-surface moisture and winds.
    Panels show 5 m specific humidity (g/kg, shaded) and 10 m winds (m/s, vectors)
    from the irrigated (a–c) and non-irrigated (d–f) model experiments at 18Z 21 January,
    and 00Z, and 06Z on 22nd January 2016 over the IGP region. The time steps represent
    the developing (18Z), mature (00Z) and dissipation stages (06Z) as Fig. 2. The
    scale arrow is 5 m/s. Full size image We have also compared model output against
    WiFEX (Winter Fog Experiment) measurements recorded at IGI-Airport, Delhi14,56(Fig.
    4). The irrigated simulation captures the observed diurnal changes in visibility,
    relative humidity, and downwelling long-wave (LWD) radiation considerably better
    than the non-irrigated simulation, implying that more accurately capturing the
    near-surface humidity is leading to a denser and optically thicker fog that is
    more consistent with the visibility and LWD observations. This pattern is also
    broadly reproduced for the two subsequent fog events of the 23rd and 24th January
    2016; the visibility and relative humidity are notably more accurate, and the
    LWD is more accurate on the 24th. However, deficiencies in the simulations remain,
    with neither configuration able to reproduce the rapid reduction in visibility
    after sunset. We hypothesise that this is, in part, due to the simple urban land
    surface parameterisation used here, resulting in a ~1 K night-time temperature
    bias (not shown). Anurose et al.34 discuss urban parameterisations and fog. It
    is important to note that visibility is a derived diagnostic (rather than a prognostic
    model variable) and depends on an assumed aerosol size and mass appropriate for
    Delhi as well as on humidity. Improvements to the visibility diagnostic from the
    MetUM are currently being trialled and this could potentially further improve
    the relationship between aerosol, fog, and visibility in the MetUM. Fig. 4: Evolution
    of three fog events in Delhi. The time series show visibility (Vis, m; a), relative
    humidity (RH, %; b) and downwelling long-wave radiation (LWD, Wm−2; c) observations
    (black) and model output from non-irrigated (solid lines), and irrigated (dashed
    lines) configurations during 22-24 January 2016 at IGI-Airport, Delhi. The blue,
    red, and aqua colours denote simulations starting at 00 UTC on the 21, 22 and
    23 January respectively. Full size image We have also compared model output to
    meteorological observations at various locations within the model domain (shown
    in Fig. 1d). Generally, the irrigated simulations have a higher relative humidity
    than the non-irrigated simulations that is in better agreement with the observations
    (Fig. 5). The impact is largest at the BRL, HSR, PTL and DEL sites, locations
    close to or within the irrigated area; and is smaller at GWL and DHD, further
    away from the irrigated area. Although, these locations can also be impacted by
    the additional moisture advection, e.g., DHD on the 22nd January 2016 (Fig. 5),
    leading to fog (Fig. 2). These improvements in relative humidity in the irrigated
    model simulations translate to improvements in visibility (Supplementary Fig.
    3). However model deficiencies remain, for example at GWL and BRL, located to
    the east of the domain, and the improvement in relative humidity is insufficient
    to reach saturation and produce fog (Fig. 2). Fig. 5: Evolution of three fog events
    at other locations. The time series show relative humidity (RH, %) from observations
    (black) and model output from non-irrigated (solid lines) and irrigated (dashed
    lines) configurations during 22-24 January 2016 (as Fig. 4). Results are shown
    for (a) Bareilly (BRL), (b) Dehradun (DHD), (c) Hissar (HSR), (d) Delhi (DEL),
    (e) Patiala (PTL) and (f) Gwalior (GWL). Full size image In short, we have shown
    that adding soil moisture due to irrigation into an NWP model improves the simulated
    near-surface humidity, resulting in improvements to the spatial distribution,
    evolution and optical depth of fog and, consequently, visibility. Discussion We
    have demonstrated that additional soil moisture due to irrigation has a major
    impact on the simulation of dense fog events over northern India (including Delhi).
    Winter season irrigation of the IGP increased between 1972 and 2010 (Fig. 1b)
    and continues to increase57. This irrigation increase has been accompanied by
    an increase in humidity and fog frequency13,21,22. In our irrigated simulations,
    we have observed an improved representation of fog development in comparison to
    satellite and in situ observations. These experiments highlight important processes
    driving widespread fog in northern India and point to the importance of representing
    irrigation in models. Although our work has focused on a three-day period, these
    fog events are representative of other fog events in terms of density and duration
    at the WiFEX site14 and spatial extent as observed by INSAT-3D56. Additionally,
    the model’s dry bias over this period is consistent with other events, both foggy
    and clear days34. Our conclusions regarding the model performance and the impact
    of representing irrigation can thus be likely extended to other wintertime fog
    events. Most of the northern plains of India (IGP region) are irrigated cropland.
    When irrigated, the additional moisture, and consequent changes to the surface
    energy budget, result in the advection of moisture into Delhi and beyond and cause
    widespread dense fog to develop earlier and be more persistent in these cases.
    Representing irrigation leads to improved simulations of relative humidity, countering
    a dry bias typically seen in model simulations for this region34, and consequently
    improves the simulation of fog, low cloud and visibility; it leads to a better
    spatial distribution of fog across the IGP when compared to INSAT-3D satellite
    observations and surface visibility observations. These events clearly show that
    irrigation can be highly important for the formation of dense fog. Previous studies
    have speculated that irrigation could play a role in the observed increased frequency
    of fog in the IGP18,58 but without evidencing a clear cause and effect. We have
    demonstrated the decisive role irrigation may play in the frequent and increasing
    occurrence of widespread fog events over the IGP. Further work is needed to develop
    a methodology which can realistically simulate the irrigation process in operational
    NWP models. This could involve an improved soil moisture data assimilation system
    (overcoming existing challenges35,37,51), a smart irrigation parameterisation
    which includes spatial and temporal variations in irrigation practice or a hybrid
    approach. While inclusion of wintertime irrigation in our simulations leads to
    a substantial improvement in fog prediction, it does not solve all of the problems.
    Fog forms as a result of complex interactions between the land surface, the meteorology,
    and the aerosol and cloud microphysics. Further work is still needed to address
    deficiencies in representing these processes including the accurate representation
    of urban areas34,59, aerosol sources and chemistry8 and aerosol microphysics30.
    Nonetheless, including irrigation in NWP models offers the potential for a step
    change improvement in fog forecasting accuracy over northern India in winter.
    Methods Environmental data WiFEX data The Winter Fog Experiment (WiFEX) took place
    over consecutive winters between 2015 and 2020 at the Indira Gandhi International
    Airport (IGI-Airport, Palam) in New Delhi14,56. WiFEX has included measurement
    campaigns of more than 90 dense fog events, using a wide array of instrumentation,
    supporting fog characterisation and modelling studies. Here we use the WiFEX automatic
    weather station and radiation flux measurements in the evaluation of our model
    experiments of a dense fog case study which occurred over the period 21st–24th
    January 2016. Each day the fog dissipated and reformed overnight. The number of
    hours with visibility below 1 km ranged from 15 to 18 h and below 50 m ranged
    from 3 to 8 h, typical of the duration of fog events during WiFEX. Gridded rainfall
    dataset The daily gridded rainfall dataset for India described by Pai et al.43
    has a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and is based on observations from 6955
    rain-gauge stations. It is used for the climatological and event assessment of
    wintertime rainfall. Satellite Fog/low cloud product We use the Fog/low-cloud
    satellite (INSAT-3D) product available from the Meteorological and Oceanographic
    Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) which is a Data Centre of the Space Applications
    Centre for satellite data under the Indian Space Research Organisation. The INSAT
    product has been successfully verified against surface observations60,61 and provides
    a powerful tool for model validation with high temporal (30 min) and spatial resolution
    (4 km). Each pixel is tagged as either fog or no fog. The night time fog/low-cloud
    product uses a commonly used algorithm62,63 based on a threshold of the brightness
    temperature difference between two spectral channels (mid wave infrared and thermal
    infrared). The night-time method has difficulty detecting optically thin fogs62,64
    and thus we refer to the satellite as measuring deep fog and compare it to the
    model’s simulation of deep fog. The daytime product uses the visible channel reflectance
    and thermal infrared brightness temperature65 and so has better sensitivity to
    optically thin fog. Note the night-time product is used at 18Z and 00Z and the
    daytime for 06Z. We use the ‘Very Low Cloud’ (cloud below 111 m) and ‘Low Cloud’
    (cloud between 111 m and 1949 m) output of our model experiments to identify where
    fog occurs and compare against the Fog/low-cloud satellite (INSAT-3D) product.
    We refer to a modelled ‘Very Low Cloud’ fraction above 0 alone as shallow fog,
    both a ‘Very Low Cloud’ fraction and a ‘Low Cloud’ fraction above 0 as deep fog
    and a ‘Low Cloud’ fraction above 0 without any ‘Very Low Cloud’ as low cloud.
    Meteorological (SYNOP) measurements We compare the spatial variation of our modelled
    visibility and relative humidity against surface measurement data recorded at
    the following airports in the northern India surface synoptic (SYNOP) network:
    Delhi Safdarjung (DEL), Bareilly (BRL), Dehradun (DHD), Patiala (PTL), Gwalior
    (GWL) and Hisar (HSR) (see Fig. 1d for locations). Irrigation water use datasets
    We base the design of our model experiments with irrigation represented on the
    global irrigation water use dataset (0.5° × 0.5°) described by Huang et al.66.
    derived using the Hanasaki et al. 67 method. We use the most recent January data
    from this dataset, from January 2010. Data for 1972–2010 were also used to assess
    trends in winter irrigation over the IGP. This dataset was based on the Food and
    Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations global information system on water
    and agriculture, United States Geological Survey estimates and simulated global
    hydrological models. These data are used to give the seasonality in irrigation
    which is unavailable in other more recent datasets. Land cover data In order to
    realistically simulate the spatial distribution of irrigation we use the European
    Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover project’s land cover data
    at 300 m spatial resolution for 2016 to restrict irrigation to the ‘irrigated
    cropland’ land cover class (Supplementary Fig. 4). Modelled irrigation sensitivity
    experiments To investigate the impact that irrigation has on fog formation, intensity
    and persistence, a set of irrigated and non-irrigated model sensitivity experiments
    were performed for the 21st–24th January 2016 events using the recently developed
    Delhi Research Unified Model (DRUM). DRUM is a regional research version of the
    Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), that uses the regional atmosphere tropical configuration
    version 2 (RA2T)68, and the same domains as the Delhi model developed for operational
    fog forecasts at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF)69.
    The DRUM is a limited area model (with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km in this
    study), nested in a global 17 km resolution model using the Global Atmosphere
    6.1 (GA6.1) configuration70, with a domain covering the IGP region including the
    highly irrigated areas to the NW of Delhi (Fig. 1a). Each simulation is initialised
    at 00Z and runs for 36 h consistent with the operational version of the model69.
    The initial conditions are derived from the global model’s analysis, which includes
    soil moisture data assimilation37. To determine the irrigated area, we combine
    the irrigation water use and land cover datasets. While the land cover dataset
    has high spatial resolution (300 m), it does not provide any seasonal irrigation
    information. On the other hand, the global irrigation water use dataset is monthly
    but at a lower spatial resolution (0.5° × 0.5°). We define a realistic agricultural
    irrigation area for the winter months (Fig. 1d) by convoluting land areas classed
    as “irrigated cropland” (Supplementary Fig. 4) with areas with irrigated water
    use of over 5 mm in January (Fig. 1a). For these irrigated areas, the initial
    soil moisture in the MetUM is increased to become the saturated soil moisture
    content for sand (38.3 kg m−2) following a similar approach to Fletcher et al.52.
    This corresponds to an additional 20–25 mm of water, which is consistent with
    flood irrigation practice in the region (Prof B Lankford 2023, personal communication,
    16 May). The soil moisture is then left to evolve normally during the simulation.
    In short, we believe our representation of irrigation, by saturating the model’s
    soil moisture initial conditions, is a physically reasonable approach that introduces
    a realistic amount of moisture into the model simulation (~25% of the monthly
    irrigation total; Fig. 1a) in the known irrigated cropland areas (Fig. 1d). In
    this study, we use this relatively simple approach to assess the potential impact
    of irrigation and justify the need to include it in model simulations of fog events.
    The development of a more sophisticated approach to irrigation, which could be
    used operationally, is underway. Data availability WiFEX campaign data are stored

  description: In this study, a data-driven approach employed by utilizing the product
    called JRC-Global surface water mapping layers V1.4 on the Google Earth Engine
    (GEE) to map and monitor the effects of climate change on surface water resources.
    Key climatic variables affecting water bodies, including air temperature (AT),
    actual evapotranspiration (ETa), and total precipitation, were analyzed from 2000
    to 2021 using the temperature-vegetation index (TVX) and Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The findings demonstrate a clear association
    between global warming and the shrinking of surface water resources in the LUB.
    According to the results, an increase in AT corresponded to a decrease in water
    surface area, highlighting the significant influence of AT and ETa on controlling
    the water surface in the LUB (partial rho of − 0.65 and − 0.68, respectively).
    Conversely, no significant relationship was found with precipitation and water
    surface area (partial rho of + 0.25). Notably, the results of the study indicate
    that over the past four decades, approximately 40% of the water bodies in the
    LUB remained permanent. This suggests a loss of around 30% of the permanent water
    resources, which have transitioned into seasonal water bodies, accounting for
    nearly 13% of the total. This research provides a comprehensive framework for
    monitoring surface water resource variations and assessing the impact of climate
    change on water resources. It aids in the development of sustainable water management
    strategies and plans, supporting the preservation and effective use of water resources.

    change, and globalization are the main factors affecting water resources1. Among
    the main controlling factors, climate changes play a serious role when researchers
    evaluate both the quality and quantity of water resources2,3. Climate change is
    already affecting water access for people around the world, causing more severe
    droughts and floods. It impacts the water cycle by influencing when, where, and
    how much precipitation falls4,5. Climate change also profoundly effects water
    resources by shifting rainfall patterns, enhancing temperatures, and altering
    the timing of glacier melt and snowfall, leading to changes in the seasonality
    of drainage flows6,7. Therefore, identifying various predisposing climatic variables
    is a crucial issue for determining the impacts of climate change on water resources8,9.
    Meteorological datasets are the most common way to monitor the effects of climate
    change. However, traditional mapping based on meteorological stations is labor-intensive,
    slower, and more expensive. Additionally, the problems with sensors placed there
    can increase the error in the obtained data10. In this regard, during the last
    decades, remote sensing technology has been exhibiting high potential for monitoring
    the impacts of climate change at large scales11,12,13. One of the main benefits
    of remote sensing lies in its non-intrusive nature14. Passive sensors capture
    electromagnetic energy without disrupting the object or area under observation.
    This enables researchers to monitor natural phenomena without requiring changes
    to their methods or behaviors15. Remote sensing also offers valuable data on critical
    climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and vegetation dynamics.
    By conducting ongoing monitoring, scientists can analyze patterns, simulate climate
    scenarios, and assess the effects of climate change on ecosystems and susceptible
    regions16. In recent decades, Lake Urmia (LU) has experienced significant desiccation,
    primarily due to inadequate water management. The construction of numerous upstream
    dam reservoirs, which has led to the expansion of irrigated agriculture, is the
    main culprit behind this imposed disaster. Irrigated agriculture stands out as
    the largest water user in the region17,18. LU has been shrinking at an alarming
    rate. Between 1996 and 2016, its water level dropped by approximately 8 m19. This
    drastic reduction in the lake''s size has not only posed a threat to its valuable
    ecosystem and the local economy but has also resulted in severe problems such
    as dust storms and skin and respiratory diseases20,21. Efforts have been made
    to identify the factors contributing to this alarming shrinkage of the LU. During
    the period of the lake''s decline, there has been an increasing trend in temperature
    and a decreasing trend in precipitation within the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB)22,23,24,25.
    Additionally, agricultural land has expanded by 98% from 1987 to 201619, leading
    to a significant increase in water withdrawal from rivers and groundwater resources
    during the same period22. Consequently, the inflow of water into the lake has
    decreased26. Thus, the alarming shrinkage of the lake can be attributed to a combination
    of climatic extremes and anthropogenic activities, along with unsustainable water
    management27. To address the environmental tragedy of the LU, the Lake Urmia Restoration
    Program (ULRP) was initiated in 2013 as a ten-year program. The ULRP is divided
    into three phases: (i) stabilizing the current status (2014–2016), (ii) restoration
    (2016–2020), and (iii) sustainable restoration (2020–2024). Several studies have
    assessed the progress of the ULRP, highlighting various challenges. Danesh-Yazdi
    and Ataie-Ashtiani28 have raised concerns about the underestimation of data and
    the importance of data-driven modeling in the ULRP. Sima et al.29 noted that the
    ecological level set by the ULRP (1274.1 m above sea level) falls short of achieving
    the target salinity of 240 g/l. Saemian et al.30 concluded that 80% of the increase
    in the lake''s water volume is attributed to increased inflow from rivers and
    reservoirs, and recovery may be compromised during prolonged drought periods.
    Parsinejad et al.31 argued that lake restoration requires a comprehensive approach
    that considers both human and natural components. The impacts of climate oscillations
    and climate change on the occurrence of surface and subsurface water can be calculated
    and analyzed to demonstrate how water resources are affected by natural or human
    activities32. Global datasets indicating water resource locations have been obtained
    from satellite imagery observational data, inventories, and national descriptions.
    However, investigating climate changes at both spatial and temporal scales remains
    challenging33,34. Many studies focus on measuring present or future water resources35,36,37,38
    and water quality39,40,41,42 using information derived from satellite imagery.
    These studies contribute to the development of sustainable water management approaches
    by evaluating the impacts of climate change and global warming on water resources.
    Global datasets documenting the location and seasonal variations of surface water
    have been generated through inventories, national reports, statistical extrapolation
    from regional data, and satellite imagery. However, accurately measuring long-term
    changes at high resolution remains a challenging task. Although remote sensing-based
    methods and products have employed for mapping water resources in water studies,
    it is important to consider new products such as JRC Global Surface Water Mapping
    Layers, v1.4 with a spatial resolution of 30 m to update these datasets and approaches.
    It furnishes valuable statistics pertaining to the extent and alterations in water
    surfaces36. This product offers comprehensive insights into various aspects of
    water surfaces, including seasonal, temporal, monthly, and permanent reservoir
    information. It distinguishes itself from other Landsat products, most notably
    the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) dataset spanning from 1999 to 202043,
    the global surface water dataset (GSWD) covering the years 1984 to 201536, and
    the landsat dynamic surface water extent (DSWE) dataset developed by44. The literature
    review reveals that several studies have utilized remote sensing datasets in combination
    with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to map and monitor long-term changes
    in water surfaces45,46,47. Several studies48,49,50 have also explored the relationship
    between fundamental climatic variables (such as air temperature (AT), evapotranspiration
    (Eta), and precipitation) and water resources. Previous studies have employed
    the GEE platform to map water surface changes using Sentinel and Landsat series
    images45,47,51. However, limited research has utilized the Landsat high-resolution
    mapping of the global surface water product (JRC Global Surface Water Mapping
    Layers, v1.4) for mapping and monitoring changes in water resources36,52. Therefore,
    the objectives of this study are to: (1) monitor the impacts of climate change
    on water resources in LUB, Iran, (2) estimate the relationship between different
    climatic variables (AT, ETa, and precipitation) and changes in water surfaces,
    and (3) assess the efficiency of the Landsat high-resolution surface water product
    in tracking trends in various water resources. Study area The study area is the
    LUB, located in the northeast of Iran, with a land area of 51,876 km2 (Fig. 1).
    Approximately 10% of this area is occupied by LU. The LUB is fed by a total of
    60 rivers, of which 21 are permanent or seasonal, and 39 are temporary. Notably,
    the Zarineh river, Simineh river, and Aji Chai serve as the main inflows to LU.
    Within this basin, Zarineh river (14%), Simineh river (11%), Godar (8%), Barandoz
    (6%), Shahrchai (2%), and Nazlu Chai (6%) are joined by seven seasonal rivers,
    39 intermittent streams, internal springs, as well as rainfall and snowfall to
    sustain LU. The rivers in this watershed are categorized based on their water
    sources, exhibiting distinct characteristics in the east and west of the lake.
    The rivers to the east and southeast of the lake originate from high-altitude
    sources such as Sahand, Sabalan, and Chehel Cheshme in Kurdistan, following relatively
    longer courses and remaining perennial (e.g., Aji Chai, Zarineh river, Simineh
    river, and Sufi Chai). In contrast, the western, southwestern, and northern rivers
    of the lake, which have shorter distances and carry less water, include Godar
    Chai, Nazlo Chai, and Zola Chai22,53. The region is characterized by a semi-arid
    and dry-cold climate, with an average annual rainfall of 359.1 mm, a minimum temperature
    of 4.3 °C, and a maximum temperature of 17.7 °C54. Evaporation rates range from
    930 to 1513 mm per year55. The Lake receives approximately 25% of its inflow from
    direct precipitation and 75% from 60 permanent or seasonal rivers56. Figure 1

    (a) its location within Iran''s basins, and (b) a hydro-topographic representation.
    Full size image There have been significant changes in the water surface area
    of the LU from year to year (Fig. 2), particularly in the southern regions of
    the lake where the lake bed occasionally becomes exposed during summer and fall57.
    From 2014 to 2016, 2015 experienced the minimum lake surface area, while 2016
    experienced the maximum lake surface area. In August, the minimum and maximum
    surface areas were 1550 km2 and 2500 km2 in 2015 and 2016, respectively, clearly
    indicating the rapid shrinkage of the lake in recent years58. Figure 2 Spatio-temporal

    the GEE platform, we mapped and monitored the trends of these climatic variables
    from 2000 to 2021. Additionally, a high-resolution global surface water product,
    available from March 16, 1984, to December 31, 2021, was integrated into the GEE
    platform. In the final stage of the study, the correlation coefficient between
    climatic variables and changes in water resources was estimated. Climatic variables
    The temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method, originally introduced by Nemani
    et al.59 and further developed by Goward et al.60, has been successfully applied
    to estimate near-surface air temperature. It has been successfully applied to
    various satellite temperature datasets, as demonstrated by Czajkowski et al.61
    and Lakshmi et al.62. In this study, we employed MODIS Land Surface Temperature
    (LST) products (MOD11A2.061), meteorological station data, and MODIS Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets to estimate AT using the TVX method
    from 2000 to 2021 (Fig. 3a). This method relies on the underlying assumption that
    a strong negative correlation exists between LST and a vegetation index. For more
    comprehensive information on the TVX method, please consult the following references:59
    and60. The linear relationship between LST and NDVI is expressed by Eq. (1): $$LST={a}_{t,i}+{b}_{t,i}.NDVI$$
    (1) where \\(t\\) and \\(i\\) represent that the regression coefficients \\(a\\)
    and \\(b\\) are time dependent and factor in each moving window \\(i\\). Once
    Eq. (1) established, the AT can be extrapolated for the pixel located at the center
    of the moving window by allowing the linear relationship to intersect with the
    NDVI value associated with full vegetation cover. The estimation equation is as
    follows: $${T}_{t,i}={a}_{t,i}+{b}_{t,i}.{NDVI}_{max}$$ (2) where \\({T}_{t,i}\\)
    represents the AT of the pixel cantered at the moving window \\(i\\) in time \\(t\\),
    and \\({NDVI}_{max}\\) denotes the NDVI value of full vegetation cover. Figure

    change on water resources throughout the LUB, generated in the ArcGIS 10.7.1 software
    (www.esri.com): (a) Air Temperature (AT) (°C), (b) actual evapotranspiration (ETa)
    (mm/d), and (c) total precipitation (mm/h) for the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and
    2021. Full size image We also used the MODIS ETa product [PML_V2 0.1.7: Coupled
    Evapotranspiration and Gross Primary Product (GPP)] based on the GEE platform
    to monitor the impacts of climate change on water resources from 2000 to 2021
    (Fig. 3b). The PML_V2 0.1.7 product (unit = mm/d) provides information about 8-day
    evapotranspiration at a resolution of 500 m. ETa refers to the amount of moisture
    that evaporates from the Earth’s surface and transpires from plants to the atmosphere.
    As we can see in Fig. 3b, ETa rate increased about 0.32 ml over the LUB from 2000
    to 2021. The maximum ETa rates were estimated to be 12.33, 11.81, 12.01, and 12.65
    for the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2021, respectively. Another climatic factor
    used in this study is the GPM: Monthly Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)
    v6 product (Fig. 3c). The global precipitation measurement (GPM) is an international
    satellite mission that provides advanced observations of rain and snow globally
    every three hours. Figure 3c provides insight into the precipitation trend in
    the LUB between 2000 and 2021. As depicted in the figure, there has been a noticeable
    decrease in the precipitation rate during this time period. Specifically, the
    precipitation rates for the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2021 were estimated to
    be 0.094, 0.088, 0.079, and 0.070, respectively. This data underscores a clear
    downward trend in precipitation over the specified years. Water product The JRC
    Global Surface Water Mapping Layers, v1.4, is a comprehensive dataset that provides
    detailed information about water bodies worldwide, including their extent and
    shoreline characteristics36. This dataset covers the period from 1984 to 2021
    and offers maps of surface water location and temporal distribution. It offers
    valuable statistics regarding the extent and changes in water surfaces. Table
    1 presents further details about the notable features of this product. The data
    is generated using 4,716,475 scenes acquired from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 between
    March 16, 1984, and December 31, 2021, with a spatial resolution of 30 m. An expert
    system is employed to classify pixels into water and non-water categories, and
    the results are compiled into historical periods and two epochs (1984–1999, 2000–2021)
    for change detection63,64. This mapping layer product consists of one image containing
    seven bands, which collectively map different aspects of surface water spatial
    and temporal distribution over the last 38 years. To access the JRC code via Google

    This study employed an integrated approach that combined remote sensing techniques
    and the GEE to monitor the effects of climate change on water resources in the
    LUB. Figure 4 provides an overview of the methodology used for mapping and monitoring
    the impacts of climate change on water resources. Figure 4 A brief review of the
    applied methodology for mapping and monitoring the impacts of climate change on
    water resources, generated in the Microsoft Office Word 2023 (https://www.microsoft.com).
    Full size image Google Earth Engine The GEE offers a wide range of geospatial
    datasets and satellite imagery, accompanied by powerful spatial analysis capabilities.
    It is extensively used by researchers, scientists, and industry professionals
    to generate maps that facilitate the detection of surface changes on Earth. In
    the context of this study, various MODIS and Landsat global water surface products
    were employed within the GEE platform. Data retrieval on the GEE platform is straightforward,
    requiring only a few commands without the need to handle data loading manually.
    The platform automatically processes the commands and manages the data retrieval
    process66,67. Since the command takes care of calling the dataset, radiometric
    and geometric correction are not necessary. Users are expected to write code according
    to their specific processing requirements. The implemented code facilitated the
    execution of the following operations. Spatial subset on the interested area;
    Temporal subset on the collection datasets; Selecting the targeted datasets; Exporting
    the selected datasets to perform further analysis. Statistical analysis The Mann–Kendall
    (MK) non-parametric trend test68 was employed to identify statistically significant
    trends (p < 0.05) in the time series data (Eqs. 3 and 4). To address serial correlation
    effect, the modified version of the MK test proposed by69 was applied. Moreover,
    the Spearman partial correlation analysis70 was conducted to determine the most
    influential climate factor contributing to the dynamics of water resources. These
    statistical techniques have been widely employed in previous studies investigating
    climate variability and change in water resources worldwide (e.g.,71). $$S=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{n}sgn({x}_{j}-{x}_{i})$$
    (3) $$sgn\\left({x}_{j}-{x}_{i}\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}+1\\\\ 0\\\\
    -1\\end{array} \\begin{array}{c}{x}_{j}>{x}_{i}\\\\ {x}_{i}={x}_{j}\\\\ {x}_{j}<{x}_{i}\\end{array}\\right.$$
    (4) where \\(n\\) represents the length of the time series, and \\({x}_{i}\\)
    and \\({x}_{j}\\) denote the sequential data amounts, respectively. For \\(n>10\\),
    given that \\({x}_{i}\\) is independent and randomly ordered, the statistic \\(S\\)
    is approximately normally distributed with a mean of zero. Results This study
    applied an integrated approach involving remote sensing datasets and GEE to monitor
    climate change effects on water resources over the LUB, Iran. Figures 5 and 7
    show the results of water surface changes over the study area. Based on Fig. 5a,
    which illustrates the frequency of water presence from 1984 to 2021 (see Table
    2), it is evident that in the central parts of the LU, water has consistently
    been present throughout this period, accounting for 0.99% of the area. This corresponds
    to an approximate area of 0.051 km2 (as shown in Figure 6). In contrast, the surrounding
    areas of the central parts have undergone significant changes in terms of water
    presence. Figure 5b provides insight into the absolute change in water occurrence
    between two epochs: 1984–1999 and 2000–2021 (see Table 2). The findings reveal
    that there has been a significant change in water presence across most of the
    LUB area. With the exception of dams and a small portion of the LU in the northern
    part of the LUB, the entire area has experienced such changes from 1984 to 2021.
    According to Table 2, approximately 73.58% of the study area has undergone an
    absolute change in water presence during the period of 1984–2021. Similarly, apart
    from dams and a small part of the LU in the northern region of the LUB, there
    has been a substantial change in surface water presence from 1984 to 2021, which
    illustrates the normalized occurrence change (see Fig. 5c). Table 3 further supports
    this observation, indicating that approximately 66.29% of the study area within
    the LUB has experienced a change in water presence over the period of 1984–2021.
    Figure 5d provides insights into the number of months during which water was present
    in the study area from 1984 to 2021. The data presented in Fig. 5d and Table 4,
    indicate that January (10.82%) and December (56.08%) have a high level of water
    availability. The high water availability in December and January can be attributed
    to the occurrence of snow, which is common during the winter season in the study
    area. Furthermore, the increase in water surface during the spring months of April,
    May, and June can be attributed to the higher amount of precipitation in the study
    area during this season. Figure 5e in this study displays the frequency of water
    return from year to year between 1984 and 2021. It indicates that the central
    parts of the LU have the highest percentage of water return, suggesting that these
    areas have experienced more consistent recovery of water over time. On the other
    hand, the surrounding areas of the LU, as depicted in Fig. 5e, have not witnessed
    significant water recovery from year to year (Fig. 6). Figure 7 presents a categorical
    classification of the changes that occurred between the first and last years from
    1984 to 2021. According to Fig. 7, the surrounding areas of the LU have undergone
    significant changes in terms of water conditions compared to previous years. Out
    of the total, 38.65% has been identified as permanently water-covered from 1984
    to 2021. Within this permanent water area, 0.34% has been newly classified as
    permanent, as indicated in Fig. 8. Over the study period, a permanent water area
    of 12.78% has been lost. Additionally, 2.74% has been detected as seasonal water
    resources from 1984 to 2021. While 3.98% of the LUB has experienced a loss in
    seasonal water resources, 4.12% has been newly added as seasonal water resources,
    as illustrated in Fig. 8. Figure 8 shows that there has been no change in the
    conversion of seasonal to permanent water resources over the study area from 1984
    to 2021. However, 28.99% of the permanent water has been converted to seasonal
    water in the LUB during this period, as depicted in Fig. 8. Furthermore Fig. 8
    indicates that 0.48% and 7.84% of the water resources have been classified as
    ephemeral permanent and ephemeral seasonal, respectively, over the study area
    from 1984 to 2021. Figure 5 Results of the employed Landsat high-resolution global

    Full size image Our findings indicate correlation coefficients of − 0.55, − 0.59,
    and 0.39 between water area and AT, ETa, and precipitation, respectively (Fig.
    9 and Table 5). According to our research, climate change has affected water resources
    from 1984 to 2021, which is in accordance with the results of22. They observed
    that over the past few decades, a warming trend of approximately 0.18 °C per decade
    has been identified, while precipitation in the basin has been decreasing by about
    9 mm per decade. As a result of this significant warming, ETa from the lake has
    been increasing at a rate of 6.2 mm per decade. The rising AT and increased ETa,
    combined with the decreasing precipitation, indicate that LUB has been experiencing
    meteorological drought conditions. In addition to climate change effects19, discovered
    a roughly 98% increase in agricultural lands and a substantial 180% increase in
    urban areas between 1987 and 2016. Consequently, the lake area experienced a significant
    reduction of around 86%. Their studies also revealed a decline in terrestrial
    water storage in the lake region, with the lake losing water at a faster rate
    than the watershed. Comparing river inflow to the lake, it is evident that human
    water management activities resulted in a reduction in streamflow of approximately
    1.74 km3/year from 1995 to 2010. This reduction accounts for approximately 86%
    of the total decrease in the lake''s volume during the same period72 also indicated
    that the process of change in LU was slow between 1970 and 1997. However, the
    shrinkage accelerated between 1998 and 2018, with approximately 30.00% of the
    lake''s area disappearing. According to their findings, anthropogenic factors,
    such as population growth, extensive dam construction, low irrigation water use
    efficiency, poor water resources management, increased sediment flow into the
    LU, and the absence of political and legal frameworks, had a much greater impact
    on LU than climate change and prolonged drought. The mismanagement of water consumption
    in the agricultural sector and the extraction of surface and groundwater from
    the basin have resulted in a sharp decrease in the lake''s surface area. Figure

    bodies and climatic variables including air temperature (AT) and total precipitation,

    The significance of the trend lines was determined using the Mann–Kendall test.
    The trend line slope is based on Sen''s slope estimator. In cases where a time
    series experienced a significant abrupt shift, identified by Buishand''s test,
    the change year is indicated. For these instances, “mu” denotes the average of
    the sub-series. Full size image Table 5 Spearman correlations and partial correlations
    of the water surface area with climatic variables, including AT and total precipitation,
    throughout the LUB over the period 2000–2021. Full size table In this study, the
    water surface area in the LUB exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.05)
    decline of 2.0% decade−1 over the past two decades. This decline was accompanied
    by a significant downward abrupt shift in 2008, resulting in an average sub-series
    of 9% before the shift and 7% after the shift. Conversely, AT showed a significant
    increase of 1.02 °C decade−1, with an upward abrupt shift identified in 2012.
    The average sub-series after the shift was 1.2 °C higher than the average before
    the shift. On the other hand, annual total precipitation experienced a decline
    of 20 mm decade−1 in the LUB during the period of 2000–2021, but no statistically
    significant trends or variations were observed. In general, there were negative
    correlations observed between water surface and AT, while positive correlations
    were found with total precipitation throughout LUB from 2000 to 2021 (Table 5).
    It was observed that an increase in AT corresponded to a decrease in water surface
    area, highlighting the significant influence of AT and ETa on controlling the
    water surface in the LUB (partial rho of − 0.65 and − 0.68, respectively) (See22).
    A partial correlation coefficient assesses the strength and direction of a relationship
    between two variables while controlling for the influence of other variables.
    In this case, it indicates a moderately strong negative correlation between AT
    and water surface area when considering the effects of other potential influencing
    factors. These findings imply that as AT rises, there is a tendency for water
    surface area to decrease. It is important to note that correlation does not necessarily
    imply causation, and further analysis might be needed to establish the underlying
    mechanisms driving this relationship. In practical terms, these findings could
    have implications for understanding and managing water resources in semi-arid
    and arid regions. High AT might lead to increased ET or changes in hydrological
    patterns, which could impact water availability and ecosystem dynamics. Conversely,
    no significant relationship was found with precipitation and water surface area
    (partial rho of + 0.25). The partial correlation coefficient of + 0.25 suggests
    a weak positive correlation between these two variables when accounting for other
    factors. This means that, in the context of our study, changes in precipitation
    do not seem to have a strong influence on variations in water surface area. This
    finding aligns with the work of54, who also reported a lack of significant correlation
    between water level and precipitation in the case of the LU. In their study, they
    demonstrated a significant negative correlation (rho of − 0.68) between water
    level and temperature, indicating that as temperature increased, the water level
    decreased. However, they found no significant correlation (rho of + 0.10) between
    water level and precipitation. These consistent findings across different studies
    highlight the complex interactions between climatic variables and water bodies.
    While temperature appears to have a more pronounced impact on water surface area
    or water levels, precipitation might not exhibit a clear relationship in certain
    contexts. This could be due to the influence of various other factors, such as
    ET rates, runoff patterns, and local hydrological characteristics. The results
    of the partial correlation analysis, which aimed to identify the most influential
    climate factor contributing to water resource dynamics while considering the effect
    of each studied climatic variable, revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.05)
    correlation of − 0.656 between water surface and AT. However, no significant correlation
    was found between water surface and precipitation, indicating that temperature
    plays a dominant role in controlling water surface in the LUB. Discussion This
    study was applied an integrated approach of remote sensing and GEE for monitoring
    the effects of climate change on water resources. The LUB was selected as the
    case study area, which has experienced significant changes in water resources
    in the last decades. The results of this study provide valuable insights into
    the impact of climate change on water resources in the LUB from 1984 to 2021.
    This study reveals a statistically significant change in the water surface area
    over the past two decades. This suggests that there has been a notable alteration
    in the extent of water bodies in the LUB during this period like previous studies23.
    AT and ETa in the LUB have shown significant increases from 2000 to 2021 aligns
    with the findings of numerous studies on climate change and land use patterns73,74.
    These increases in AT and ETa are indicative of warming in the region, which is
    a common consequence of climate change. In contrast to the rising AT and ETa,
    the study observes a decline in annual total precipitation in the LUB during the
    period from 2000 to 2021. The reduction in precipitation observed over the study
    area, as indicated by previous studies73,75, is consistent with broader climate
    change projections and observations in many regions globally. This suggests that
    the region has been experiencing reduced rainfall or other changes in precipitation
    patterns. The research indicates negative correlations between water surface and
    AT and ETa. This means that as AT and ETa increase, there is a tendency for the
    water surface area to decrease. This relationship aligns with the expectation
    that warmer temperatures can lead to evaporation and reduced water availability.
    Conversely, there are positive correlations between water surface and total precipitation.
    This implies that when there is more precipitation, there tends to be a larger
    water surface area. This relationship underscores the importance of precipitation
    in maintaining water resources. In summary, the research findings suggest that
    climate change has led to increase AT and ETa and reduce annual total precipitation
    in the LUB from 2000 to 2021. These changes have had a noticeable impact on water
    resources, as evidenced by the negative correlation between AT, ETa and water
    surface area. This study also was employed a data-driven approach by utilizing
    the automatic product called JRC-Global surface water mapping layers V1.4 on the
    GEE platform for monitoring water surface area changes. Previous studies (e.g.,48,72)
    have relied on traditional or semi-automatic methods, which typically provide
    an accuracy of around 500 m. However, in the current study, a more accurate approach
    was employed. This approach offers a significantly improved accuracy of 30 m,
    allowing for more precise monitoring and mapping of all water bodies, including
    seasonal and small rivers. By leveraging this higher accuracy, the study was able
    to reveal important findings. The JRC Global Surface Water Mapping Layers, version
    1.4, provides valuable data on the extent and changes of water surfaces. In contrast
    to GLAD, GSWD, and DSWE, this dataset offers comprehensive statistics regarding
    various aspects of water bodies, including seasonal fluctuations, temporal alterations,
    monthly variations, and details on permanent reservoirs. Each of these datasets
    has its unique characteristics and time coverage, but the JRC Global Surface Water
    Mapping Layers, v1.4, is particularly noteworthy for its comprehensive insights
    and up-to-date information on water surfaces. The results of the study indicated
    that over the past 4 decades, only approximately 40% of the water bodies in the
    LUB remained permanent. This suggests a loss of around 30% of the permanent water
    resources, which have transitioned into seasonal water bodies, accounting for
    nearly 13% of the total. These findings highlight the significant changes that
    have occurred in the water resources of the basin and emphasize the importance
    of accurate and detailed monitoring methods in assessing and understanding such
    changes. Water scarcity in the LUB causes several ecological problems. Different
    studies have proven that the shrinking the lake resulted in a 90% decline in the
    Artemia population76. Moreover, the salinity has dramatically increased in recent
    years, reaching a point where the lake water is saturated with salts and salt
    crystals form on the lake surface throughout the year. This has also led to the
    conversion of surrounding land into salt marshes. A recent study by Sima et al.77
    reported that the flamingo population in the lake has decreased to almost zero.
    The loss of water resources in the LUB has resulted in a general decrease in vegetation,
    leading to a dramatic increase in the frequency and intensity of dust storms in
    the region. Dust storms have a detrimental impact on over 7 million residents
    in the region, causing various challenges related to health, socioeconomic conditions,
    soil fertility in agriculture, and vegetation weakening. These issues present
    significant concerns that need to be addressed to safeguard the well-being of
    the affected population and maintain the ecological balance of the region. Furthermore,
    frequent decreases in the volume of water resources would affect food security
    in the study area. It is because agriculture over the LUB is the main source of
    food, and water scarcity would pose a significant threat to this sector78. In
    summary, as the consequence of climate change intensify and the water crisis in
    the basin worsens, the region may face a significant challenge in terms of migration
    from rural areas to suburban areas of metropolitan cities. This migration crisis,
    along with its accompanying socio-economic costs, will pose a major obstacle to
    regional development. Limitation of the study and future perspective The main
    limitation of this study is related to the temporal variation of the JRC Global
    Surface Water Mapping Layers, v1.4 product. Since there is no information related
    to water surface storage for each year separately, having information for each
    year separately that shows all various aspects of water surfaces, including seasonal,
    temporal, monthly, and permanent reservoir information, is of great importance.
    This provides valuable information for monitoring changes in water patterns. Conclusion
    The application of remote sensing in studying the impacts of climate change on
    water scarcity necessitates effective, efficient, and cost-effective technologies
    capable of analyzing large datasets. Therefore, this study was initiated to map
    various influential climatic variables and determine the impacts of climate change
    on water resources. The findings of this study indicate correlation coefficients
    of − 0.55, − 0.59, and 0.39 between water area and AT, ETa, and precipitation,
    respectively. According to the results, climate change has affected water resources
    from 1984 to 2021 in the LUB. The results also demonstrate that a permanent water
    area of 12.78% was lost from 1984 to 2021 in the LUB. Additionally, 2.74% has
    identified as seasonal water resources. While 3.98% of the LUB has experienced
    a decline in seasonal water resources, an additional 4.12% has newly added as
    seasonal water resources. A general monitoring framework was applied to analyze
    climate feature changes across extensive regions at different temporal scales.
    The study further reveals that online-based approaches, such as GEE combined with
    remote sensing datasets, are valuable for monitoring climate change impacts, particularly
    in semi-arid and arid regions, to simulate dynamic climate changes. In summary,
    the results of this study hold great significance for water management planners
    and managers and contribute significantly to the advancement of GIS science through
    the application and identification of effective techniques for mapping climate
    change effects on water resources. Data availability The datasets used and/or

  description: 'Background: Grasslands in drylands are increasingly influenced by
    human activities and climate change, leading to alterations in albedo and radiative
    energy balance among others. Surface biophysical properties and their interactions
    change greatly following disturbances. However, our understanding of these processes
    and their climatic impacts remains limited. In this study, we used multi-year
    observations from satellites and eddy-covariance towers to investigate the response
    of albedo to variables closely associated with human disturbances, including vegetation
    greenness (EVI) and surface soil volumetric water content (VWC), as well as snow
    cover and clearness index (Ta) for their potential relationships. Results: EVI
    and VWC during the growing season were the primary factors influencing albedo.
    EVI and VWC were negatively correlated with albedo, with VWC’s total direct and
    indirect impacts being slightly smaller than those of EVI. During the non-growing
    season, snow cover was the most influential factor on albedo. VWC and Ta negatively
    affected albedo throughout the year. We estimated the impact of variations in
    EVI and VWC on climate to be in the range of 0.004 to 0.113 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1 in
    CO2 equivalent. Conclusions: This study indicates the significant impacts of climate

    increasingly influenced by human activities and climate change, leading to alterations
    in albedo and radiative energy balance among others. Surface biophysical properties
    and their interactions change greatly following disturbances. However, our understanding
    of these processes and their climatic impacts remains limited. In this study,
    we used multi-year observations from satellites and eddy-covariance towers to
    investigate the response of albedo to variables closely associated with human
    disturbances, including vegetation greenness (EVI) and surface soil volumetric
    water content (VWC), as well as snow cover and clearness index (Ta) for their
    potential relationships. Results EVI and VWC during the growing season were the
    primary factors influencing albedo. EVI and VWC were negatively correlated with
    albedo, with VWC’s total direct and indirect impacts being slightly smaller than
    those of EVI. During the non-growing season, snow cover was the most influential
    factor on albedo. VWC and Ta negatively affected albedo throughout the year. We
    estimated the impact of variations in EVI and VWC on climate to be in the range
    of 0.004 to 0.113 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1 in CO2 equivalent. Conclusions This study indicates
    the significant impacts of climate change and human disturbances on vulnerable
    grassland ecosystems from the perspective of altered albedo. Changes in vegetation
    greenness and soil properties induced by climate change and human activities may
    have a substantial impact on albedo, which in turn feedback on climate change,
    indicating that future climate policies should take this factor into consideration.
    Introduction Among the changes in land surface properties, changes in surface
    albedo directly influence regional and global climate (Betts 2000; Lee et al.
    2011; Carrer et al. 2018; Sciusco et al. 2020, 2022; Abraha et al. 2021; Ouyang
    et al. 2022; Lei et al. 2023). The magnitude and the spatiotemporal changes of
    surface albedo, the ratio of reflected to incoming short-wave radiation, represents
    the amount of radiation leaving the earth system. In turn, this leads to warming
    or cooling regulations on climate, together with the effects of greenhouse gases
    (GHGs, e.g., CO2, CH4 and N2O) and atmospheric conditions (e.g., aerosols, clouds)
    (Forster et al. 2021). In its 6th Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change (IPCC) indicated that albedo-induced radiation forcing (RF)
    was 0.20 ± 0.10 W m−2, accounting for 9.3% of the total RF attributed to increasing
    CO2 concentrations (2.16 ± 0.25 W m−2). This may be underestimated compared to
    other results in the literature (Betts 2000; Lee et al. 2011; Lei et al. 2023).
    Dryland regions in Eurasia have experienced rapid changes in ecosystems and associated
    surface properties due to both the warming climate and socioeconomic development
    (Groisman et al. 2009; Qi et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2022b). Native grasslands are
    the dominant ecosystem type in this region. These ecosystems have been extensively
    converted through agricultural intensification, urbanization, desertification,
    and overgrazing among other land use changes (John et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2018;
    Zheng et al 2019; Venkatesh et al. 2022a, 2022b; Yuan et al. 2022). Tian et al.
    (2014, 2017) examined the spatial relationships between albedo and vegetation
    on the Tibetan and Mongolian plateaus and found close spatial coherencies. While
    other human activities, such as grazing and harvesting, may not cause explicit
    changes in land cover types, they have been found to significantly influence canopy
    cover, leaf area, snow cover, and soil moisture, consequently leading to changes
    in albedo (Dedieu et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014; John et al. 2016; Dong et al.
    2021; Venkatesh et al. 2022a). As climate change and the coupling between ecosystems
    and societal systems strengthen, grasslands may face heightened anthropogenic
    disturbances, further inducing alterations in albedo and feedback on climate.
    The ecological impacts of disturbances on ecosystems and the potential radiation
    forcing (RF) induced by albedo changes have long been research foci in dryland
    regions. Previous studies have highlighted a broad spatial link between the greening
    of vegetation and decreased albedo during the growing season due to changes in
    vegetation structure and further radiative transfer processes based on satellite
    data (Tian et al. 2014). Through in situ observations, it has been found that
    albedo of sparsely vegetated surfaces (e.g., grasslands, deserts, and shrublands)
    is especially susceptible to factors such as soil moisture, snow cover, and atmospheric
    conditions (Briegleb et al. 1986; Lobell and Asner 2002; Wang et al. 2005; Yang
    et al. 2014; Li et al. 2019). However, little is known about albedo dynamics in
    grassland ecosystems that undergo frequent disturbances. These disturbances not
    only impact above-ground vegetation cover characteristics, such as vegetation
    structure and biomass, but also affect soil properties. The dynamics of these
    properties drive changes in albedo. Previous studies using satellite observations
    often simplified the modelling of albedo changes since they can only observe the
    land surface over short periods. This approach may overlook other factors influencing
    albedo and its dynamics. Currently, there is a lack of detailed investigations
    and assessments of the various factors influencing albedo in disturbed grassland
    ecosystems through ground measurements which offer higher spatial and temporal
    resolutions. Additionally, there is limited research quantifying albedo-induced
    RF (RFΔα) after disturbances, leading to a lack of understanding of the impact
    of post-disturbance albedo on climate (Betts 2000; Abraha et al. 2021; Chen 2021;
    Ouyang et al. 2022; Lei et al. 2023). In this study, we used multi-year in situ
    observations of albedo, soil moisture, vegetation indices, snow cover, and microclimate
    measurements (e.g., temperature) from ten grasslands sites that have available
    datasets in Asian dryland regions. After illustrating the magnitude and dynamics
    of albedo at these sites, we examined the multiple forcing mechanisms for the
    growing season (GS) and non-growing season (NGS) through multiple regression analyses
    and structural equation modelling (SEM) on albedo (α) and albedo-induced global
    warming impact (GWIΔα). We aim to address the following questions: (1) How do
    canopy cover, soil, and snowfall directly and indirectly affect albedo across
    seasons? (2) How important is GWIΔα following ecosystem perturbations? Materials
    and methods Study sites Our study includes ten grassland sites located in an area
    between 37°N to 48°N and 101°E to 124°E. Eddy-covariance flux measurements were
    conducted on six sites in China and four in Mongolia (Fig. 1; Table 1). The sites
    cover a gradient of arid, semi-arid, and alpine climate. Precipitation is low
    and the annual Palmer Drought Severity Index varies from − 3.87 to 0.18. Temperature,
    precipitation, radiation, soil volume moisture content, and carbon flux were observed
    separately during the growing season (April to October) and non-growing season.

    variables V2 dataset (Fick and Hijmans 2017) Full size image Table 1 Location,
    data spans, and annual Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) of ten eddy-covariance
    flux sites in Mongolia and China Full size table Three observation sites were
    established in 2014 in shrub grassland (MG-SHB), temperate grassland (MG-TPL),
    and meadow grassland (MG-MDW) locations in Mongolia. The northernmost meadow grassland
    site is located in Inner Mongolia, China, and is clipped annually at the end of
    August (HAI-CMDW). A pair of sites are in Jilin, China: one is degraded saline
    alkali land that has been fenced from grazing (Cha-NENU) since 2000, and the other
    is harvested at the end of August (Cha-CMDW). A site in Qinghai (CN-HAM) is part
    of the FLUXNET2015 (https://fluxnet.org/), and another in Qinghai (QHB) and the
    Kherlenbayan Ulaan site (KBU) are part of the AsiaFlux (http://asiaflux.net/).
    The KBU site is fenced grassland. CN-ham is a winter-grazed grassland and QHB
    is a seasonally grazed grassland. All sites experience seasonal snowfall during
    the winter. Site-specific data from the eddy flux tower site On each tower, a
    four-way radiometer (CNR1 or CNR4) was used to measure incoming and outgoing short-
    and long-wave radiation (SWin, SWout, LWin and LWout, respectively). Surface albedo
    (α) was calculated as the ratio of outgoing short-wave radiation to incoming short-wave
    radiation (α = SWout/ SWin). We used daytime radiation data between sunrise and
    sunset to calculate albedo (Chen 2021). Albedo with high solar zenith angle (SZA)
    (> 85°) were discarded. In addition, we included half-hourly air temperature (TA),
    soil volume moisture content (VWC), and precipitation (P) as potential drivers
    on albedo. All data were aggregated to monthly average. Satellite data The enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI) was used as an indicator of vegetation abundance because
    it reflects many plant properties and activities, such as foliage chlorophyll
    content, leaf area, and above-ground biomass (Myneni and Williams 1994; Kawamura
    et al. 2005). EVI has been widely used in grassland studies because it can reduce
    the influence of soil background and atmospheric aerosol effectively (Huete et
    al. 2002). We calculated EVI based on a combination of MODIS reflectance data
    in the near-infrared, red, and blue spectral bands. The MODIS surface reflectance
    data were obtained from MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted
    Reflectance dataset (MCD43A4 v061, https://lpdaac.usgs.gov) which removed view
    angle effects from the directional reflectance. MCD43A4 v061 product provides
    daily nadir reflectance and quality label with a 500 m spatial resolution. The
    data were assessed to match the tower base observation data well (Chu et al. 2021).
    We used a Savitzky–Golay filter to remove the noise potentially caused by clouds
    and other atmospheric conditions and reconstruct the time series. We also used
    MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) obtained from MODIS Terra Snow Cover
    product (MOD10A1 v061, https://lpdaac.usgs.gov), as an indicator of snow cover.
    The dataset provides a daily composite of snow cover and basic quality assessment
    flag with cloud mask, atmospheric correction, and surface temperature screening
    (Riggs et al. 2017). We considered the data points with an NDSI of > 0.1 as snow
    (Zhang et al. 2019). Depending on the study area, season and validation method,
    the accuracy of MODIS snow cover products range between 85 and 95% (Coll and Li
    2018). Finally, all satellite data were composited to monthly data to match the
    monthly albedo and meteorological data. Albedo-induced global warming impact (
    ) Instantaneous short-wave radiation forcing RF∆α at the top of atmosphere was
    estimated as (Chen 2021; Bright and Lund 2021): (1) where Ta is the atmospheric
    transmittance of downward short-wave radiation (a.k.a. clearness index), is the
    change of surface albedo, and n is the number of months in the GS or NGS. The
    two terms represent the actual RF in the growing and non-growing seasons. We used
    as an approximation for atmospheric transmittance of upward short-wave radiation
    (Bright and O’Halloran 2019), where Ta can be calculated as: (2) where is the
    incident solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere, which is calculated from
    latitude, longitude, and day of the year (d): (3) where is the solar constant
    (1367 W m−2). Finally, we converted due to alteration of albedo in the GS to CO2-equivalent
    (GWIΔα) (Carrer et al. 2018; Abraha et al. 2021): (4) where GWI∆α is the CO2-equivalent
    from the change of albedo in the GS, S is the perturbed area (1 m2), AE is the
    earth’s surface area (5.1 × 1014 m2), ΔF2x is the radiative forcing per doubling
    of current CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (3.7 W m−2), mair is the mass of
    the atmosphere (5.148 × 1015 Mg), Mair and MCO2 are the molecular weights of air
    (28.95 g mol−1) and CO2 (44.01 g mol−1), respectively, CO2ref is the reference
    CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (389 ppm), TH is the time horizon, set as
    100 years following IPCC standards; and AF (i.e. CO2 airborne fraction) is the
    percentage of CO2 emissions left in the atmosphere after a period of time t. Statistical
    analysis We initially estimated the relationships of albedo with the VWC and EVI
    by using linear, cubic polynomial regression and a mixed effects model with the
    site as a random effect (Kuznetsova et al. 2017). We analysed the relationship
    between the EVI and albedo during the GS, whereas the VWC was analysed throughout
    the year due to its great variations in NGS. As the influence of soil moisture
    and EVI on albedo may be nonlinear (Sellers 1985; Wang et al. 2005), we used a
    cubic model to test the non-linear relationship for different variables because
    it has a flexible form. We also used a linear mixed effects model with site as
    a random effect, which allowed us to consider the potential differences between
    sites caused by topography, biomass, and species when fitting the model. We compared
    the linear model and the cubic model to assess the linearity of the relationships
    between EVI and albedo, as well as between VWC and albedo. We compared the models
    using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). As
    vegetation dynamics can overshadow the influence of soil moisture during the GS,
    especially at high canopy cover, we further performed residual analysis to eliminate
    one variable (i.e. VWC) before exploring the relationship between EVI and albedo.
    In this analysis, we chose to calculate residuals using the best model selected
    through model comparison in the previous step. Finally, we examined the relative
    contributions of the EVI, VWC, and snow through a linear mixed effects model (Table
    2). The model was designed as: (5) where 1|site was selected as the random effect
    to account for site as a random, block factor affecting the relationships with
    EVI, VWC, and NDSI. Table 2 Statistical relationship between the monthly albedo,
    VWC and EVI for the ten sites in growing season Full size table We constructed
    a structure equation model (SEM) to evaluate the complex, interactive relationships
    between multiple variables and albedo, including direct and indirect impacts.
    The SEM is a powerful multivariate technique to test multiple possible pathways
    and to evaluate whether data are consistent with a theoretical, expected initial
    model (Fan et al. 2016). We conducted the analysis at the annual, growing season,
    and non-growing season scales. SEMs establish directed paths among different variables
    to represent causal relationships. Therefore, we employed standardized path coefficients
    in the SEM to quantify the direct impacts of the EVI and VWC on albedo. Given
    that the standardized path coefficients in SEMs remove differences in variable
    scales, we calculated the indirect influence of the VWC on albedo by multiplying
    the standardized path coefficient between VWC and EVI with the standardized path
    coefficient between EVI and albedo (i.e. VWC affects albedo by affecting EVI).
    Finally, the potential impacts of anthropogenic alterations of EVI and VWC on
    albedo in the growing season were quantified by calculating GWIΔα. Specifically,
    we estimated the potential changes in albedo (Δα) because of variations in the
    EVI and VWC during the GS using the regression coefficients of linear regression
    for corresponding variables. Then, the GWIΔα induced by the indirect impact of
    EVI and VWC was estimated using methods described in Sect. \"Albedo-induced global
    warming impact \". All statistics were conducted in R version 4.2.0. Results Seasonal
    changes in albedo and their drivers Albedo, vegetation greenness, soil moisture
    content, and other meteorological variables showed clear seasonal changes as expected
    (Fig. 2). In general, albedo was low (~ 0.20) during April–October; while the
    EVI, temperature, and precipitation were high during July–August. The annual variation
    of the VWC showed a bimodal distribution while the incoming radiation was high
    in April/May. The albedo reached 0.78 (HAI-CMDW) in snow-covered months but remained
    low at 0.26 (QHB) in snowless months. The EVI in the peak GS, mean temperature,
    precipitation, incoming radiation, and VWC also showed great differences by site
    and year. Fig. 2 Seasonal changes in monthly average albedo, enhanced vegetation
    index (EVI), temperature, precipitation, short-wave radiation, and soil volumetric
    water content (VWC) at the ten study sites (Fig. 1). The visualization was created
    using one year of observational data from each site Full size image Clipping effects
    on albedo and radiative forcing The paired sites with and without clipping treatments
    provided an opportunity to directly assess the effects of land use on RFΔα. Compared
    with the fenced site (CHA-NENU), the clipped grassland site (CHA-CMDW) had a lower
    EVI. After reaching a peak in August 2018, CHA-CMDW showed a significantly lower
    EVI than CHA-NENU (Fig. 3). In 2019, 2020 and 2021, CHA-CMDW had a lower EVI only
    in July. The maximum difference in the EVI between the two sites was 0.2. CHA-CMDW
    showed higher VWC (note only two years of data are available). In August 2019,
    CHA-CMDW had a VWC of 0.38, while CHA-NENU had a VWC of 0.58. The albedo also
    differed between the two sites, with CHA-NENU having a higher albedo during the
    GS, while there was no obvious difference during the NGS. Fig. 3 The average daily
    enhanced vegetation index (EVI, a), volumetric water content (VWC, b) and albedo
    (c) in clipped meadow (CHA-CMDW) and fenced meadow (CHA-NENU), showing the consequences
    of clipping manipulations Full size image Comparing the albedo at CHA-CMDW with
    CHA-NENU, we evaluated 3-year RFΔα between clipped and fenced meadow since 2019
    (Fig. 4). The difference in albedo yielded a positive RFΔα in the GS (i.e. warming),
    ranging from 4.6 to 15.9 W m−2. Large variations were found in the NGS, showing
    a negative RFΔα of − 1.6 W m−2 in 2019 and − 7.2 W m−2 in 2020 but a positive
    RFΔα 17.6 W m−2 in 2021. The annual average RFΔα varied from 2.0 to 16.6 W m−2.

    meadow (CHA-NENU) to clipped meadow (CHA-CMDW) in the growing season, non-growing
    season and the annual mean. Error bars indicate the standard errors Full size
    image Changes in albedo with vegetation index and soil moisture Albedo decreased
    exponentially with EVI and VWC at the ten study sites (Fig. 5). Higher monthly
    snow-free albedo was observed in the NGS (NDSI = 0), ranging from 0.19 to 0.54,
    while lower values were observed in the GS, with an average of 0.20, albeit with
    large variations. Compared to the fast decrease during the transition from NGS
    to GS in response to EVI, albedo responded more slowly to the rising VWC. Interestingly,
    albedo had a continued decreasing trend even at high soil moisture (VWC > 0.60).
    Fig. 5 Changes in monthly mean albedo with EVI and VWC in the growing season and
    non-growing season at the ten study sites Full size image VWC was a significant
    independent variable affecting albedo in both the GS and NGS. However, its contributions
    to the variance varied significantly between different model types (Tables 2 and
    3). The correlation coefficients between the VWC and albedo were − 0.472 and −
    0.374 in the GS and NGS, respectively. The EVI was also a significant variable
    on albedo in the growing season (r =  − 0.462). Based on the AIC and R2 values,
    the cubic polynomial model outperformed the linear model in both the growing and
    non-growing seasons. There was a significant positive relationship between the
    VWC and EVI during the GS. After considering the interactive effects of the EVI
    and VWC during the GS, the R2 increased by 0.042 in the linear model while it
    increased by 0.071 in the polynomial model compared to the model only considering
    the EVI. The mixed effects accounting for variability between sites, tended to
    provide a stronger explanatory power compared to linear models. Table 3 Statistical
    relationship between the monthly albedo, VWC and EVI for the ten study sites in
    the non-growing season Full size table After statistically controlling for the
    impact of VWC on the albedo and EVI (i.e. by regressing on the residuals between
    VWC and EVI, as well as VWC and albedo), a negative relationship remained between
    the EVI and albedo in both the growing and non-growing seasons (Fig. 6). The relationship
    between the EVI and albedo during the non-growing season was notably weak. Fig.
    6 Partial relationship between residuals of regression for the EVI and VWC and
    residuals of regression for the albedo and VWC in a the growing season and b the
    non-growing season Full size image Direct and indirect effects of multiple biophysical
    variables We designed a similar SEM for the GS, NGS, and year-round by including
    all potential direct and indirect relationships between albedo and biophysical
    factors (Fig. 7). All three SEMs showed a non-significant Fisher’s C value (p > 0.05),
    indicating that the covariance structure of the model could be accepted. Overall,
    the EVI, VWC and Ta had significant negative effects on albedo, whereas NDSI had
    a significant positive effect (Fig. 7). The EVI showed positive control on albedo
    during the GS but not during the NGS as indicated by standardized path coefficients
    of − 0.35 and 0.04, respectively. The direct influences of VWC and Ta on albedo
    were significant for both seasons and at annual scale. The standardized path coefficient
    for VWC was − 0.23 for the GS, − 0.19 for the NGS, and − 0.16 for the annual scale.
    The standardized path coefficient for the indirect effect of VWC in the GS was
    − 0.05 (i.e. impacting albedo through its influence on the EVI). The sum of the
    direct and indirect effects of VWC on albedo in the GS was − 0.28. For the whole
    year, the standardized path coefficients for the indirect and total effects of
    VWC on the albedo were − 0.02 and − 0.18, respectively. The standardized path
    coefficients of the Ta were − 0.14, − 0.13 and − 0.29 for the GS, NGS, and annual
    scale, respectively. For annual scale, the influence of EVI and VWC were equally
    important while NDSI was more important, with standardized path coefficients of − 0.17, − 0.16,
    and 0.53, respectively. Fig. 7 Results of the structural equation models (SEMs)
    explaining the direct influences of the volume moisture content (VWC), enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI) and albedo for the growing season (a), non-growing season
    (b), and the whole year (c). Indirect influences of temperature, radiation, and
    precipitation are considered via their direct influences on the EVI, VWC, and
    NDSI. Significance levels are indicated by solid arrows and insignificant relationships
    by dashed-arrows. The numbers on each line indicate the estimated standardized
    path coefficient. Coefficients of determination (R2) for explained variables are
    given below the variable names Full size image Relationships among other variables
    showed that temperature and precipitation had a strong positive control on EVI
    during the GS, while the effect of radiation via EVI was negative. The VWC showed
    a positive control on the EVI in both the GS (Additional file 1: Table S1), with
    standardized path coefficients of 0.14 (Fig. 7). Additionally, precipitation had
    a direct positive effect on VWC. We further quantified the effects of the EVI
    and VWC on albedo and GWIΔα at each site. The responses of albedo to the VWC and
    EVI (Δα) varied greatly among sites with negative relationships. The regression
    coefficients (i.e. slopes in the regression) of albedo with the EVI ranged from − 0.411
    to − 0.016 while varying from − 0.046 to 0.278 with the VWC. The GWIΔα corresponding
    to the changes in EVI ranged from 0.007 to 0.186 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1, but varied from
    0.028 to 0.122 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1 with VWC. The responses of albedo and GWIΔα to
    the EVI and VWC at the four sites in Mongolia were generally higher than those
    in China. At the three sites in northeastern China and one site in Inner Mongolia,
    the response of albedo to the VWC was stronger than that to the EVI. Discussion
    The complex influences on albedo in the grasslands In this study, we examined
    the interactive effects of vegetation greenness, soil moisture, climate, and snow
    cover on albedo in grasslands of East Asia. Temporally, both albedo and its potential
    drivers showed clear seasonal changes. As expected, albedo was lower in the GS
    than in the NGS, while vegetation grassland index (i.e. EVI) showed an opposite
    seasonal pattern (Fig. 2), resulting in a negative relationship (Fig. 4; Tables
    2, 3). With a high EVI (i.e. high leaf area), less incoming solar radiation is
    reflected or scattered by the canopies, resulting in an albedo of ~ 0.20 during
    the growing season (Hammerle et al. 2008). However, the albedo-EVI relationship
    is complicated by human-induced disturbances. The albedo of the clipped site (CHA-CMDW)
    was not as high as expected compared to that of the fenced site (CHA-NENU) in
    spite of their close locations (i.e. similar snow cover, microclimate, and SZA,
    Fig. 2). With clipping treatments in August, the daily EVI of the two sites showed
    striking differences. The EVI was higher in CHA-NENU after clipping in August
    compared with low values in June and July (Fig. 3a), which were in agreement with
    in situ measurements (Dong et al. 2021). However, EVI differences alone cannot
    explain the differences in albedo between the two sites, as we also observed that
    the albedo of CHA-NENU was often higher than that of CHA-CMDW during the GS (Fig.
    3c). A possible reason could be differences in soil moisture between the two sites,
    especially during the growing season. Soil characteristics (i.e. moisture, texture
    and structure) directly influence surface albedo (Ångström 1925). Albedo decreased
    with soil moisture (Fig. 5) because of internal reflection on the thin water film
    covering the soil particles and higher thermal capacity and thermal conductivity,
    and a darker surface can be observed when soil moisture is higher (Planet 1970;
    Wang et al. 2005). Human disturbances can significantly alter the soil moisture
    of terrestrial ecosystems. In the CHA-CMDW region, historical overgrazing has
    been suggested to have substantially influenced the structural and compositional
    aspects of grasslands, possibly leading to reductions in soil moisture (Dong et
    al. 2021). This could be primarily attributed to the reduced canopy cover, or
    leaf area, which may limit the interception of wind-blown snow during the winter
    and augment heat exchange between the soil and the atmosphere (Yan et al. 2018).
    In addition, the trampling from livestock can compact the soil, impeding moisture
    capacity and transfer between the surface and the soil, potentially decreasing
    soil moisture (Zhao et al. 2011). In summary, our study highlighted the interplay
    between vegetation greenness, soil moisture, and albedo in dryland grasslands,
    and the impact of human disturbances on these relationships. Snow cover and Ta
    are additional variables indicating changed albedo. Snow albedo is considerably
    higher than that of vegetation and soil, with fresh snow exhibiting reflectivity
    values of 0.8–1.0 (Chen 2021). Therefore, the seasonal dynamics of snowfall are
    directly related to surface albedo variations. Similarly, Ta, representing the
    ratio of incoming short-wave radiation to radiation at the top of the atmosphere,
    depends on factors such as solar angles and atmospheric conditions such as clouds
    and aerosols (Perez et al. 1990). For instance, Ta is low in early morning and
    late afternoon because of high solar zenith angle and large atmospheric optical
    thickness (Yang et al. 2020). At this time, short-wave radiation is more susceptible
    to attenuation than longwave radiation. Additionally, plants exhibit lower reflectance
    in the visible and near-infrared bands than in the longwave part, leading to higher
    albedo in early morning and late afternoon. However, Ta is also affected by cloud
    cover. Under such circumstances, diffuse radiation becomes a prominent part of
    radiation (Misson et al. 2005), leading to an insensitivity of albedo to solar
    zenith angle and increased energy absorption by vegetation (Gu et al. 2002). Thus,
    low albedo is expected compared to clear-sky conditions. The relationship between
    Ta and albedo depends on mechanisms operating at different temporal and in different
    regional contexts. In this study, we observed a negative correlation between Ta
    and albedo, emphasizing the importance of the relationship between Ta and solar
    zenith angle in semi-arid regions. Our synthetic analysis of ten sites revealed
    a significant correlation between albedo and both the EVI and VWC during the GS,
    whereas a low correlation was found between the EVI and albedo in the NGS (Tables
    2 and 3). Among sites used in this study, grasslands rapidly turn yellow during
    the non-growing season, exposing significant amounts of soil (Fig. 3, Chen et
    al. 2022a). Importantly, the VWC still exhibited higher variability in the NGS,
    thus retaining its significance as the exposed soil area increased (Fig. 3). A
    better fit by cubic models instead of linear models demonstrates that the relationship
    between soil moisture, greenness, and albedo can be nonlinear (Yang et al. 2020).
    This means that certain regions may be more sensitive to human perturbations,
    resulting in stronger changes in albedo. For instance, in extremely arid conditions,
    albedo may respond rapidly to changes in soil moisture (Fig. 5). Overall, EVI
    only played a role during the growing season, while the VWC was important throughout
    the year. It is worth noting that the relationship between albedo and the VWC
    and EVI varies greatly between sites (Table 2), likely because differences in
    vegetation-specific hydrometeorological conditions can cause different near-infrared
    absorptions and reflections (Zheng et al. 2019). The significance of soil moisture
    for surface albedo should not be overlooked. Our results clearly indicate that
    even in the growing season soil water conditions can significantly alter the surface
    albedo of grasslands. The relative contributions of VWC and EVI were close in
    both the mixed-effect models and SEMs (Additional file 1: Table S2; Fig. 7). Albedo
    can be considered as the joint contribution of soil albedo and canopy albedo (Sellers
    1985). In semi-arid areas such as Inner Mongolia, soil albedo is generally higher
    than canopy albedo (Carrer et al. 2014). Some studies have reported that variations
    in vegetation greenness in GSs is a crucial factor to determine albedo in drylands
    (Tian et al. 2014; Zheng et al. 2019) because of the high sensitivity of albedo
    to the large differences between vegetation albedo and soil albedo. In this study,
    we found that soil moisture was as crucial as vegetation greenness in determining
    the albedo of grasslands. This can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, the
    sparse canopy of grasslands may result in a significant contribution of soil background
    to reflectance, leading to a higher overall contribution of soil albedo (Hammerle
    et al. 2008). Secondly, in semi-arid regions, irregular rainfall is the only source
    of water in soils (Sala and Lauenroth 1982), which means that soil moisture can
    fluctuate easily and affect soil albedo. Implication of GWIΔα We adopted a widely
    used method to calculate the potential contributions of variations of vegetation
    greenness and soil moisture in GS to annual GWIΔα (Abraha et al. 2021; Bright
    & Lund 2021; Chen 2021; Lei et al. 2023). The contribution of growing season albedo
    to annual RF is greater than that of non-growing season albedo, which is consistent
    with previous estimates (Tian et al. 2017; Lei et al. 2023). Potential increases
    in EVI and VWC on grassland ecosystems produce positive GWIΔα (i.e. warming effect)
    by lowering surface albedo. For example, a 0.1 change in the EVI and VWC could
    induce a 0.0008–0.0218 and 0.0024–0.0147 reduction in albedo, respectively, corresponding
    to a 0.007 to 0.186 and 0.028 to 0.122 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1 variation in GWIΔα (Fig.
    8). Fig. 8 Regression coefficients (i.e. slopes of the regression) for albedo
    vs. EVI and albedo vs. VWC and albedo-induced global warming impact (GWIΔα) at
    the ten study sites. The error bar indicates standard deviation Full size image
    To emphasize the importance of GWIΔα, we compared it to the carbon budgets of
    the same grasslands. Previous studies have shown that the net ecosystem productivity
    (NEP) of semi-arid grasslands varies greatly. The global average NEP of grasslands
    is about 0.36 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1 (Chen 2021). The four grasslands in Mongolia were
    carbon sources, with annual mean NEP of − 0.7 to − 0.21 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1 (Shao
    et al. 2017), while the grassland sites in northeastern China had an annual mean
    NEP of ~ 0.24 kg CO2 m−2 yr−1 (Dong et al. 2021). Our results suggest that GWIΔα
    induced by fluctuations in the EVI and VWC in Mongolia reaches 0.113 kg CO2 m−2
    yr−1, which could produce opposite climate effects if NEP were combined with GWIΔα.
    It is worth noting that GWIΔα caused by variation of the EVI and VWC over time
    may be insignificant because albedo might return to its prior-to-disturbance level,
    while the climate effect of greenhouse gases works on a longer time scale (Bright
    and Lund. 2021; Forster et al. 2021). The magnitude of the climate impact of albedo
    and NEP depends on climate and geographical location. For example, Lawrence et
    al. (2022) reviewed the biophysical and biogeochemical impacts of global deforestation,
    suggesting that in mid-latitude regions (> 50°), net climate cooling from deforestation
    is dominated by increased albedo, even though it results in a significant carbon
    debt. However, due to regional differences, the balance between NEP and albedo
    can vary significantly. Rohatyn et al. (2022) recently demonstrated that in some
    dryland regions, the conversion from grassland to forest did not lead to higher
    NEP but resulted in decreased albedo, while in other regions, the opposite was
    observed. The reasons for these differences may involve multiple factors, including
    climate, vegetation, and other surface characteristics. Therefore, understanding
    how changes in dryland ecosystems (i.e. climate change and human activities) alter
    surface biophysical properties is crucial for formulating effective land-based
    mitigation policies. Human disturbances have produced profound impacts on arid
    ecosystems, especially on changes in surface properties. When coupled with climate
    change, their impacts may further exacerbate changes in surface attributes. For
    example, overgrazing in the CHA-NENU site has led to soil deterioration, affected
    soil water conservation capacity, caused soil salinization, and changed the microclimate
    (Dong et al. 2021). Through satellite-derived EVI observation we found that the
    grassland recovered for a decade, yet the substantial effects on albedo from reduced
    soil moisture and soil salinization remain irreversible. Recovery from clipping
    or grazing on grasslands—the two most widely practised human disturbances—can
    increase vegetation greenness, reduce surface albedo and have a climate impact
    similar to greenhouse gas emissions to some extent (Fig. 3), while reduction in
    soil moisture can have the opposite effect (without accounting for the influence
    on evapotranspiration). Clearly, our assessment of albedo-induced climate cooling
    should consider both positive and negative impacts. Nonetheless, the climate cooling
    effects from elevated albedo following land use change (i.e. GWIΔα) are among
    the few cooling effects following intensified land use change in Asian drylands
    in recent decades (Forster et al. 2021). Scientific investigations of the underlying
    mechanisms of albedo change are clearly needed in an integrated and holistic understanding
    of social-environmental systems. While more research is needed to accurately quantify
    GWIΔα and comprehend the interactions between human societies and the environment,
    more direct measurements of albedo in different ecosystems and regions are needed.
    Our understanding of dryland ecosystems is presently constrained by uneven measurement
    networks across extensive spatial scales and limited data sharing. Satellite observations
    provide a fundamental means of monitoring large-scale surface attribute changes.
    However, their effectiveness is hindered by differences in frequency and spatial
    resolution (Smith et al. 2019). For example, optical remote sensing data provide
    only snapshots of the surface (e.g., vegetation indices) due to cloud and bad
    weather, while microwave remote sensing data typically have coarse spatial resolution
    (e.g., soil moisture observations). Moreover, it is essential to integrate remote
    sensing and in situ measurements to gain a detailed understanding of complex processes,
    which will allow to develop better parameterization for earth system models and
    comprehend the non-linear carbon cycle and albedo dynamics in the future. In this
    study, we combined satellite and flux tower observations. However, we acknowledge
    that there may be some scale mismatch between satellite and in situ observations
    (Additional file 1: Figs. S1, S2), which may affect the relationship between the
    EVI and albedo (Chu et al. 2021). Shadow effects resulting from the complex composition
    and structure of vegetation communities may induce uncertainty on reflectance
    of grassland (Alavipanah et al. 2022). However, dynamics of EVI and NEP correspond
    well in our sites and shadow effects may be relatively small in grassland ecosystems
    because of the relative low canopy height and leaf area. We only discussed the
    relationship between the surface VWC, EVI, NDSI, Ta, and albedo, while deep-layer
    VWC, snow days, phenology, and weather conditions may also have an impact on albedo
    (Yang et al. 2020). In addition, our data cover a short period of time while other
    factors such as the VWC and EVI may vary at longer time scales. Finally, the mechanisms
    affecting albedo need to be explored at different time scales and in combination
    with more systematic observations in future studies. Conclusions We explored the
    changes in albedo of grasslands in the context of intensified human activities
    in a dryland region of East Asia and analysed the complex interactions among the
    albedo, EVI, VWC, Ta, and NDSI. We found that: (a) the EVI and VWC exerted significant
    effects on albedo changes during the growing season, while the VWC also indirectly
    influenced albedo by affecting the EVI; the relative contributions of these variables
    were similar in the growing season; (b) the VWC and NDSI were the dominant factors
    in the non-growing season; and (c) growing season albedo dominated the variations
    of GWIΔα through changing in EVI and VWC. By analysing multi-year ground observations
    in five grassland ecosystems in drylands Eastern Asia, we highlighted the complex
    interactions among vegetation, soil moisture, and albedo, in which anthropogenic
    disturbances play non-negligible roles. Therefore, in the context of rapidly changing
    socio-environmental systems in drylands, understanding the synergy between multiple
    factors, including albedo, is essential to understand the role of these ecosystems
    in a changing climate. Availability of data and materials The data in site CN-CNG

  description: As a result of climate change, the pan-Arctic region has seen greater
    temperature increases than other geographical regions on the Earth’s surface.
    This has led to substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystems and the hydrological
    cycle, which have affected the distribution of vegetation and the patterns of
    water flow and accumulation. Various remote sensing techniques, including optical
    and microwave satellite observations, are useful for monitoring these terrestrial
    water and vegetation dynamics. In the present study, satellite and reanalysis
    datasets were used to produce water and vegetation maps with a high temporal resolution
    (daily) and moderate spatial resolution (500 m) at a continental scale over Siberia
    in the period 2003–2017. The multiple data sources were integrated by pixel-based
    machine learning (random forest), which generated a normalized difference water
    index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and water fraction
    without any gaps, even for areas where optical data were missing (e.g., cloud
    cover). For the convenience of users handling the data, an aggregated product
    is provided, formatted using a 0.1° grid in latitude/longitude projection. When
    validated using the original optical images, the NDWI and NDVI images showed small
    systematic biases, with a root mean squared error of approximately 0.1 over the
    study area. The product was used for both time-series trend analysis of the indices
    from 2003 to 2017 and phenological feature extraction based on seasonal NDVI patterns.
    The former analysis was used to identify areas where the NDVI is decreasing and
    the NDWI is increasing, and hotspots where the NDWI at lakesides and coastal regions
    is decreasing. The latter analysis, which employed double-sigmoid fitting to assess
    changes in five phenological parameters (i.e., start and end of spring and fall,
    and peak NDVI values) at two larch forest sites, highlighted a tendency for recent
    lengthening of the growing period. Further applications, including model integration
    and contribution to land cover mapping, will be developed in the future. (Figure

    known for its extremely cold climate. However, it has recently been experiencing
    a higher rate of temperature increase than other regions of the Earth’s surface,
    mainly as a result of global climate change (Hantemirov et al. 2022, Arctic Monitoring
    and Assessment Programme (AMAP) 2021). The higher temperatures increase the risk
    of climatic extremes and disasters, such as heatwave-induced wildfires (Witze
    2020), thawing permafrost that promotes the release of greenhouse emissions from
    these areas (Yokohata et al. 2020), and river ice jams and consequent flooding
    (Madaeni et al. 2020; Sakai et al. 2015). In order to evaluate the impact of climate
    change on the pan-Arctic region, detailed monitoring of specific environmental
    parameters is essential. This has been accomplished using remote sensing techniques.
    Water-related parameters (Suzuki and Matsuo 2019) such as total water storage,
    snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and surface water coverage (Velicogna
    et al. 2012; Suzuki et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2007; Bartsch et al. 2009; Watts
    et al. 2012; Mizuochi et al. 2021a) have been used to investigate local and global
    hydrological cycles. Another focus is vegetation parameters (Nagai et al. 2019)
    such as plant functional type (i.e., land cover) map, aboveground biomass, leaf
    area index, and growing season duration (Leroy et al. 2006; Myneni et al. 2001;
    Kushida et al. 2007; Buitenwerf et al. 2015), which are important for ecological
    monitoring and carbon cycle research. Water and vegetation parameters are closely
    interlinked via energy budgets and meteorological and ecological schemes in relation
    to evapotranspiration, albedo, vegetation growth, canopy interception of precipitation,
    and surface aerodynamic properties (e.g., Mizuochi et al. 2021b). Optical remote
    sensing has been traditionally used in such environmental studies to monitor changes
    in surface water and vegetation. Band indices, such as the (modified) normalized
    difference water index (NDWI: Xu 2006) and the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI: Hatfield et al. 1984; Perry and Lautenschlager 1984), are widely
    used to characterize spectral reflectance features and enhance the appearance
    of water and vegetation bodies in satellite imagery, respectively. Another promising
    approach is microwave remote sensing using either active radar or passive radiometers,
    which has the advantage of being less sensitive to cloud cover than optical sensors.
    Backscatter signals observed by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to
    extract open water and forest areas and to estimate surface soil moisture content
    (Twele et al. 2016; Zakharov et al. 2020; Reiche et al. 2018). Microwave radiometers
    also can estimate the surface water fraction, soil moisture content and vegetation
    optical depth (Fily et al. 2003; Owe et al. 2008; Moesinger et al. 2020). When
    using satellite data to retrieve physical parameters, the divergent characteristics
    of the data and the technical difficulty in data handling often result in trade-offs
    between the spatial and temporal resolutions of the resulting product. For example,
    previous broad-scale water maps (e.g., open water and wetland distribution, water
    fraction within pixels) have resolution ranging from tens to hundreds of meters
    (Lehner and Döll 2004; Fluet-Chouinard et al. et al. 2015; Yamazaki et al. 2015;
    Pekel et al. 2016). While they offer detailed spatial information, they often
    provide no temporal information, or if such information is provided, the time
    intervals are long. Conversely, maps with high temporal resolutions (i.e., daily
    to monthly) typically provide relatively coarse spatial information (e.g., several
    tens of kilometers) (Papa et al. 2010; Schroeder et al. 2015). To overcome such
    trade-offs, researchers have used multiple datasets in a synergistic manner (i.e.,
    data fusion; Belgiu and Stein 2019). There has been particular interest in combining
    image data obtained by optical and microwave sensors (Suzuki and Matsuo 2019;
    Beamish et al. 2020). This is because information that is missing from optical
    sensor observations due to cloud cover or insufficient solar illumination can
    be compensated for using data obtained by microwave sensors. Many applications
    of such data fusion approaches have been reported for wetland mapping (Chasmer
    et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021; Mizuochi et al. 2021a), snow and thawing detection
    (Armstrong and Brodzik 2001; Kim et al. 2012) and vegetation and ecosystem monitoring
    (Kimball et al. 2009; Mavrovic et al. 2023). These studies involved intercomparison
    of different data sources and/or complementary inputs for process-based models
    or machine learning (ML). However, there have been few studies on simultaneous
    mapping of areas of water and vegetation that are interlinked. In addition, the
    creation and handling of broad-scale datasets that combine both high temporal
    resolution (e.g., daily) and moderate spatial resolution (e.g., sub-kilometer
    scale) are challenging, although there has been one report on the creation of
    daily maps of soil moisture content with a spatial resolution of 1 km (Zhu et
    al. 2023). The goal of the present study was to produce simultaneous continental-scale
    inundation and vegetation maps for Siberia. By integrating optical and microwave
    satellite data with other ancillary data, maps were obtained with a daily temporal
    resolution and a moderate spatial resolution of 500 m. In this paper, the map
    generation process and the characteristics and utility of the created products
    are described in detail. It is expected that this data will provide fundamental
    information that can be used to analyze the impacts of climate change on the risk
    of disasters, and also to clarify changes in water and carbon cycles in the pan-Arctic
    region. As example applications, we performed a time-series analysis of the NDWI
    and NDVI on a continental scale and extracted phenological features at two experimental
    sites. 2 Methods 2.1 Target area and product specifications The target is a wide
    area of Siberia, approximately corresponding to 50–70° N and 31–180° E at maximum
    (Fig. 1). Considering potential applications (i.e., large-scale monitoring and
    model integration), computational resources and the spatial coverage of permafrost
    over Siberia (Shestakova et al. 2021), the specifications of our product are shown
    in Table 1. Fig. 1 MODIS tiles used in this study. The tiles (h20–h25, v02–v03)
    were superimposed on a sinusoidal map projection of the study area Full size image
    Table 1 Specifications of developed product Full size table To meet these requirements,
    we relied mainly on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    to identify vegetation and water distributions at optimal spatiotemporal resolutions.
    In this way, the spatiotemporal resolution of our target product is consistent
    with those of MODIS: the original spatial resolution was 500 m, and the temporal
    resolution was daily. The product duration (2003–2017) was determined after considering
    the temporal characteristics of all of the data sources (see Sect. 2.2.1). In
    polar regions in particular, commonly used geographic projections (i.e., latitude/longitude)
    exaggerate distances along the longitude direction, so distorting the shape of
    objects on the map and increasing pixel-based computational costs. Consequently,
    in the present study, data fusion processing was conducted using a MODIS sinusoidal
    projection (Fig. 1), which is originally provided at a resolution of 500 m. For
    convenience, an aggregated product using a latitude/longitude projection with
    a 0.1° grid resolution is also provided as a postprocessing output (see Sect.
    2.2.5). 2.2 Algorithm and data sources The basic algorithm used for map generation
    was previously developed by us for use in a limited study area (Mizuochi et al.
    2021a). In the ML-based algorithm used in this study, a pixel-based random forest
    (RF; Breiman 2001) approach is used to fill observation gaps in MODIS data (explained
    variable) by referring to other matching data sources (explanatory variable).
    Subsequently, bias correction is applied using a conditional generative adversarial
    network (pix2pix; Mirza and Osindero 2014; Isola et al. 2017). This study expands
    the previous study area to a pan-Arctic scale and includes an update to the NDVI
    map, the details of which are summarized in Table 1. To conserve computational
    resources, no pix2pix bias correction was used, as the procedure only improved
    the RMSE accuracy by ~ 1% (Mizuochi et al. 2021a). The overall procedure involves
    (1) data download, (2) preprocessing including extraction of feature variables,
    map translation and coregistration, (3) ML training and prediction, and (4) postprocessing
    including validation, visualization, creation of the water fraction maps, and
    product format conversion. Freely available optical and microwave satellite data,
    together with reanalysis data, were downloaded from the relevant websites (see
    the ‘Availability of data and materials’ section). Preprocessing and postprocessing
    treatments that include geospatial analysis were implemented mainly using GRASS
    GIS (ver. 7.8.2) and QGIS (3.10.4). ML processing was implemented using Python
    3.8.10 with PyCaret 2.3.10 for preliminary model selection and hyperparameter
    tuning, scikit-learn 1.2.1 was used for ML training and prediction, and ray 2.2.0
    was used for multiprocessing. Detailed explanations of each step are provided
    in the following subsections. 2.2.1 Data preparation The data sources and physical
    parameters were similar to those used by Mizuochi et al. (2021a); however, vegetation
    optical depth (VOD) data (Moesinger et al. 2020) were newly added since they may
    be useful for NDVI prediction. The data sources and retrieved physical parameters
    are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Data source and physical parameters for data
    fusion Full size table Surface reflectance data obtained by the MODIS instrument
    on the Aqua satellite (MYD09GA, collection 6.1) were used to calculate the NDWI
    and NDVI as follows: (1) (2) where G, R, NIR, SWIR are the green, red, near infrared,
    and short-wave infrared surface reflectance, which correspond to MODIS band 4
    (545–565 nm), band 1 (620–670 nm), band 2 (841–876 nm), and band 7 (2105–2155
    nm), respectively. Cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and cloud-adjacent pixels were screened
    out (i.e., treated as missing data to be filled by ML) by referring to accompanying
    quality assurance data (“state_1km” subset with bitmask that indicates cloud and
    snow states). Also, pixels recorded during shadow time in the high-latitude winter
    were also treated as missing data to be filled using ML. The quality controlled
    NDWI and NDVI were the explained variables to be predicted from the following
    low-resolution explanatory variables. Level-3 brightness temperature data, obtained
    by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) on the Aqua satellite
    and AMSR-2 on the Global Change Observation Mission-Water (GCOM-W) satellite,
    were used to calculate the polarization index (e.g., Moradizadeh and Srivastava
    2021; Sawada et al. 2017) and surface water fraction. These indices are sensitive
    to soil moisture and/or abundance of surface water. The calculation method employed
    for the indices was the same as that in Mizuochi et al. (2021a). In addition,
    the SWE product retrieved from the AMSR series was used to determine snow masks.
    To maintain consistency with the AMSR series (on the Aqua satellite or a satellite
    with a similar overpass time), the other MODIS product on the Terra satellite
    platform (MOD09GA) was not used. Sixteen meteorological parameters provided by
    ERA5-land (ECMWF 2023) along with the VOD product (Moesinger et al. 2020) estimated
    from multiple microwave satellite data sources (i.e., SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR2
    and WindSat), were also used. These were selected because they were likely to
    be sensitive to the water and vegetation conditions on the surface. In addition,
    day of year (DOY) information was used to represent the season. To ensure continuity
    between the end of one year and the beginning of the next, DOY was calculated
    in cosine and sine forms as follows: (3) In total, 23 low-resolution maps (derived
    from AMSR series, ERA5-Land, VOD and DOY) were assumed to be the common explanatory
    variables to predict the two explained variables (MODIS NDWI and NDVI), since
    the NDWI (water) and NDVI (vegetation) are likely to be closely interlinked. 2.2.2
    Preprocessing Preprocessing consisted of calculating the abovementioned variables,
    converting map projections, coregistering maps, and performing climatology calculations.
    All of the processes were managed on individual MODIS sinusoidal tiles, which
    encompassed 12 tiles in total (vertical tile numbers 02–03 and horizontal tile
    numbers 20–25). First, the MODIS HDF files were converted into raw binary images
    containing 2400 × 2400 pixels using a sinusoidal projection with the HDF-EOS-to-GeoTIFF-conversion
    tool (HDF-EOS Tools and Information Center 2023). Using GIS software, data from
    other data sources (i.e., explanatory variables) were processed to align them
    with the MODIS sinusoidal image. This involved resampling, cropping (i.e., cutting
    out the region of interest), and converting different data formats and on different
    projections into raw binary images with matching locations and dimensions (i.e.,
    coregistration). Importantly, the process employed nearest-neighbor resampling,
    which involves oversampling (i.e., dividing a coarse pixel into multiple pixels
    while retaining the same pixel value). This step was necessary as the other data
    sources have lower resolution than MODIS. After coregistration, daily climatology
    maps were prepared for the explanatory variables by averaging the maps for the
    same DOY over the period 2003–2017. These daily climatology maps were assumed
    to represent typical values of the variables on a given DOY and were used to fill
    any missing pixels in the explanatory maps for ML prediction (see Sect. 2.2.3).
    2.2.3 ML processing In our data fusion scheme, pixel-based ML was used to train
    matching pairs of explanatory and explained variables, allowing the prediction
    of explained maps without any gaps (Mizuochi et al. 2018; 2021a). Before initiating
    ML processing, a preliminary study was conducted to select the ML model and to
    tune the hyperparameters using a limited number of sampling pixels (100 pixels)
    from several tiles. In total, 25 ML algorithms (different types of regression
    models) were compared based on tenfold cross validation using PyCaret. RF was
    chosen as a robust regressor, with the following hyperparameters: maximum tree
    depth 5, minimum impurity decrease 0.005, minimum samples at leaf node 2, minimum
    samples for internal node splitting 7 and number of trees 60. Strictly speaking,
    the rank of the models fluctuated depending on the tile, the presence of absence
    of snow, the NDWI or NDVI (detailed below), and the referred accuracy criteria.
    However, ensemble models of decision trees (RF and extremely randomized trees)
    usually showed top scores. For simplicity, we decided to use RF for all the tiles,
    since it is widely used in remote sensing (Zhao et al. 2022) and is also consistent
    with our previous research (Mizuochi et al. 2021a). The spectral features of snow
    are characterized by a continuous decrease in reflectance from the visible to
    the infrared region (Petty 2006), a pattern that resembles that for water bodies
    in NDWI and NDVI maps. To consider the sensitivity of the snow pixels to the NDWI
    and NDVI, RF models with and without snow were created separately by checking
    if the SWE retrieved by AMSR-E/AMSR2 was positive or zero. Four original images
    taken in May, August, November, and February of a randomly picked year during
    the study period were selected for validation of each season. Each variable was
    then normalized by subtracting the spatiotemporal mean from the original values
    and dividing by the spatiotemporal standard deviation for the RF training. For
    each pixel, historical match-up pairs were searched during the period 2003–2017,
    where all the explained and explanatory variables existed altogether. In other
    words, one matching pair containing a full set of 23 explanatory and 2 explained
    variables was used as one training sample for each the pixel. SWE and ERA5-Land
    included permanently missing pixels for water and ocean masks. To avoid wasting
    information for the other variables and to make a wall-to-wall product, ML was
    performed on these pixels by filling zero for SWE and the spatially averaged values
    of climatology maps for ERA5-Land. After RF training, RF prediction was performed
    for each pixel: explanatory maps were again input to the trained RF model to predict
    the explained maps (i.e., MODIS NDWI and NDVI) without gaps. To this end, it was
    ensured that the explanatory maps at this stage had no missing values. Temporary
    gaps (much fewer than in the explained maps but still non-negligible) were filled
    by daily climatology maps. It should be noted that this treatment was applied
    only during the prediction process, not during the training process, to avoid
    overfitting to the average map. Ancillary flag maps indicating the absence/presence
    of this treatment (0: original explanatory variables, 1: explanatory variables
    filled by climatology data) and maps showing the presence of snow were also produced.
    Table 3 summarizes the tile-averaged rate of missing pixels filled by climatology
    data in each explanatory map, and the number of available explanatory variables.
    AMSR-related parameters (no. 3, 4) were approximately 60% available, and ERA-related
    parameters (no. 5 to 21) were 100% available, both of which were insensitive to
    the tile location. VOD (no. 22) was sensitive to the tile location, fluctuating
    in the range 66–90%. In all cases, 21–22 of a total of 23 parameters were available
    in the spatiotemporal average for all tiles. 18 parameters were obtained even
    in the worst case, which is understandable because ERA5-Land and DOY are at least
    available at any time. Therefore, if some variables were missed and filled by
    climatology data, the remaining variables are expected to offer realistic input
    data to some extent. Table 3 Rate of missing pixels in each explanatory variable

    table 2.2.4 Postprocessing: creating water maps by NDWI thresholding Inundation
    pixels were extracted as physically intuitive information by thresholding the
    NDWI created by ML. Through visual interpretation of NDWI maps and high-resolution
    satellite imagery from Google Earth, ground references were established for three
    typical land cover categories (barren land, vegetation and water). Three hundred
    samples for each category were then used to produce category-dependent NDWI histograms
    (Fig. 2). A Gaussian distribution was fitted to each histogram, and the intersection
    between the Gaussian curve representing water and those representing the other
    categories was extracted as the tentative NDWI threshold for the data (i.e., the
    maximum likelihood approach). Fig. 2 Scheme of NDWI thresholding. (Top) Visual
    interpretation of three land cover categories (red: barren ground, green: vegetation,
    and blue: water); (bottom left) Summary table of extracted thresholds for different
    seasons; (bottom right) Example of maximum likelihood approach using data obtained
    in August 2017 Full size image The tentative thresholds between vegetation and
    water, derived from 12 (snow-free) monthly averaged maps for a particular tile
    (h24v02), showed a limited fluctuation range (Table 4). Consequently, the average
    value (NDWI =  − 0.043) with a standard error of 0.003 (N = 12) was assumed as
    the fixed threshold for all seasons. Utilizing this threshold, binary maps were
    generated to show 0 (non-water) and 1 (water). Table 4 Summary of estimated NDWI
    thresholds in different seasons Full size table To assess the uncertainty in the
    water map, a sensitivity analysis of the threshold setting was conducted. In the
    average map derived from the 12 monthly NDWI scenes, the threshold was slightly
    adjusted from the average value (NDWI =  − 0.043) within one standard deviation
    (0.012) using Gaussian noise. This process was repeated 12 times to calculate
    variations in the water fraction across the entire tile (h24v02). The mean water
    fraction and the standard error (N = 12) were 0.032 ± 0.001, corresponding to
    3% uncertainty in water fraction estimation. This study also considered fluctuating
    wetlands, i.e., areas where the extent of inundation changes seasonally, rather
    than permanent open water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers and reservoirs,
    which often attract special interest in estimating methane emissions, a key process
    affecting climate change (Zhang et al. 2021). Thus, the mode value for the summer
    season was subtracted from the original water maps to create what we refer to
    as “floating water maps”, which likely represent areas that are intermittently
    inundated, and which exclude permanent open water. 2.2.5 Postprocessing: creation
    of analysis-ready data (ARD) In addition to the raw binary maps based on MODIS
    tiles, which cover the wall-to-wall NDVI, NDWI, water, and quality flags at the
    original spatial resolution of 500 m, a merged product was also created using
    a commonly used latitude/longitude projection. The product was resampled using
    the nearest neighbor method and stored in GeoTiff format. To reduce the cost of
    data handling on a continental scale, the original resolution was aggregated into
    a 0.1° pixel spacing. Within these pixels, the average NDVI and NDWI values were
    stored, along with the fractional coverage of both permanent and intermittent
    wet areas. 2.3 Validation The ML result was validated for each tile over four
    seasons (Table 5), by comparing the generated MODIS NDVI and NDWI images with
    the original images that were not used in the ML training process (i.e., by employing
    a hold-out approach). Spatial patterns and statistical criteria were evaluated,
    with the latter including the mean error, root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation
    coefficient ®, slope and offset of the regression line between the original and
    created images. These values were summarized for each MODIS tile and image acquisition
    season. Table 5 Acquisition date of original MODIS images used for validation
    in each tile Full size table Spatiotemporal patterns were also checked for the
    0.1° ARD product. In addition to visualizing the NDVI and NDWI, spatially averaged
    time series and temporally averaged spatial patterns of the original and floating
    water maps were compared with a previous wetland map (WAD2M; Zhang et al. 2021).
    WAD2M primarily draws upon water fraction maps derived from multiple microwave
    satellite data sources (SWAMPS; Jensen and McDonald 2019), supplemented with ancillary
    satellite data and static maps for snow and permanent water masking, plus bias
    correction. The recent product, which emerged from the integration of multiple
    data sources through different schemes and at varying spatiotemporal resolutions
    (0.25°, monthly), seems useful for assessing the advantages and potential disadvantages
    of our product. The terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomaly is also useful for
    time-series comparisons with surface water (Suzuki et al. 2018). Gravity Recovery
    and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly water mass datasets were prepared (Swenson
    2012; Landerer and Swenson 2012), with contributions from the Center for Space
    Research (CSR), GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ), and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    (JPL), culminating in the calculation of the ensemble mean of the three datasets
    (Sakumura et al. 2014). In addition, as in Suzuki et al. (2018), reanalysis data
    from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) version 2 (Li et al. 2019) were
    also compared for the other TWS data source. The TWS includes snowpack, river
    runoff and groundwater and is not directly comparable to the NDWI and NDVI. However,
    it is helpful for interpreting time-series NDWI (and derived surface water area)
    data in relation to the water budget. 2.4 Application: trend analysis and phenological
    feature extraction The first application of the product developed in this study
    involved trend analysis at a continental scale. Time-series of snow-masked NDVI
    and NDWI maps were used to calculate the 15-year trend (i.e., Theil Sen’s regression
    slope) for each 0.1° pixel. The statistical significance of the trends was calculated
    using the Mann–Kendall test. The results were compared with previous reports for
    15-year trends in vegetation and water in polar regions. The second application
    involved the extraction of phenological features at two study sites covered by
    larch forest (Spasskaya Pad: 62°15′ 17’’N, 129°37′ 10’’E; Elgeeii: 60°01′ 01’’
    N, 133°49′ 53’’ E), utilizing the high observation frequency of our product (Fig.
    3); detailed descriptions of each study site can be found in Nagano et al. (2022).
    As a useful approach for phenological monitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, a
    moving average (window size = 5 days) of snow-masked NDVI time series data was
    fitted using a double sigmoid function (e.g., Ide and Oguma 2013; Myers et al.
    2019; Yan et al. 2019) as follows: (4) where NDVIb is the baseline value, NDVIa
    is the amplitude, Di is the day of year when the NDVI increases most rapidly,
    Dd is the day of year when the NDVI decreases most rapidly, and p and q determine
    the rate of increase and decrease of the NDVI, respectively. The initial parameter
    values were set to NDVIb = 0.4, NDVIa = 0.2, Di = 150, Dd = 250, and p = q = 0.001,
    based on a preliminary investigation of interannual phenology patterns over the
    sites. These parameters were then precisely fitted to the actual NDVI time-series
    data during the growing season (assumed to be from DOY = 100 to DOY = 280), employing
    the curve_fit function of the Python SciPy library. Fig. 3 Examples of double
    sigmoid fitting for seasonal NDVI. The NDVI with a 5-day moving average, sigmoid
    fitting and second derivative plots for sites at Spasskaya Pad (left) and Elgeeii
    (right) during 2017 are shown Full size image Then, local maximum and minimum
    values of the second derivative in the fitted function were identified, allowing
    for the determination of four commonly used phenological features (i.e., D1, D2,
    D3, and D4), which correspond to the start of spring (SOS), end of spring (EOS),
    start of fall (SOF), and end of fall (EOF), respectively. The date of the peak
    NDVI (D5) was also extracted, and the 15-year trends in these five parameters
    were investigated. A summary of the individual definitions of these phenological
    features is given in Table 6. Table 6 Definition of five phenological parameters
    Full size table 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Created data and validation Data
    fusion using RF produced wall-to-wall MODIS-like NDWI and NDVI maps for the period
    2003–2017 with enhanced the spatiotemporal extent compared to the existing data
    fusion product (Mizuochi et al. 2021a). Examples of comparisons between the original
    and newly created maps in a tile are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The examples show
    that the cloud gaps present in the original images were completely filled in the
    images created by RF regression, closely resembling the original spatial patterns
    and values of the NDWI and NDVI. The scatterplots show that images in the fall
    season deviated from the 1:1 (i.e., unity) lines, and that spatially discontinuous
    patterns were observed in the southwest area. Fig. 4 Comparison between original
    and created MODIS NDVI maps for tile h23v03. Spring image: 2007/05/03, summer
    image: 2003/08/01, fall image: 2015/11/21, winter image: 2010/02/26. Color scale
    of the scatterplot was configured by kernel density estimation (KDE) Full size
    image Fig. 5 Same as Fig. 4, but for MODIS NDWI Full size image The discrepancy
    in the scatterplot analysis was quantified by Theil-Sen’s regression slope for
    each tile and season (Table 7). While the regression slope was close to unity
    for both the NDWI and NDVI in summer, large deviations representing uncertainties
    in the values were observed in the seasons affected by snow or soil freezing.
    Since the RF models were trained separately for snow and no-snow pixels, the mixture
    of these pixels within a scene resulted in discontinuous spatial patterns and
    poor regression among multiple clusters in the scatterplots (Fig. 6, h22v03).
    The other reason for the poor regression may have been that the limited variable
    range of the NDWI and NDVI in the snow-covered winter season creates a featureless
    spectral pattern over the entire scene (Fig. 6, h23v02). Different tiles likely
    had different snow or soil freezing event distributions, resulting in varying
    accuracies among tiles (Table 7). Table 7 Accuracy of RF prediction averaged for
    each tile, for each season with standard deviation Full size table Fig. 6 Snow-affected
    images. Images showing regressions adversely affected by a mixture of snow and
    no-snow areas (h22v03), and areas with fewer spectral features due to snow cover
    (h23v02) Full size image Table 7 also shows the small mean error for all tiles
    (-0.01 ± 0.04 for NDWI, and 0.02 ± 0.02 for NDVI), indicating minimal biases in
    the reproduced images. The RMSE for all tiles was approximately 0.1 for both the
    NDWI and NDVI. Seasonal changes were clearly observed in the snow-masked NDWI
    and NDVI time-series data, averaged over the entire study region (Fig. 7A). The
    NDVI oscillated between being high in the growing season and low in the winter
    season, while the NDWI was high in the winter season and low in the growing season.
    A high local NDWI peak was observed in the spring season, possibly due to spring
    soil thawing and/or snow melting which rapidly supplied water to rivers and wetlands.
    Given the high ratio of null pixels in the winter season (~ 1.0), the low NDVI
    and the high NDWI observed at this time were attributed to the limited number
    of pixels affected by snow, even after the application of snow masking, which
    produced spectral patterns that differed from the original land cover. In addition,
    the low solar incidence angle in the winter season could reduce the signal-to-noise
    ratio for the measured radiance as well as the reliability of atmospheric correction
    for the optical data, potentially resulting in poor quality of the original MODIS
    products. As a result, studies on vegetation and surface water using our ARD product
    should focus on spring through fall, with special consideration given to snow
    masking. Fig. 7 Time series of 0.1° ARD product spatially averaged over the entire
    Siberian region. A Snow-masked NDVI and NDWI time-series with ratio of null cells
    averaged over entire study region. B Comparison between original (blue line) and
    floating (red line) water fraction extracted from our product, WAD2M wetland maps
    (Zhang et al. 2021), and time-series anomaly of terrestrial water storage (TWS)
    volumes (mm) from GRACE monthly water mass dataset (Swenson 2012; Landerer and
    Swenson 2012) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) version 2 (Li et
    al. 2019). For comparison with our floating water fraction, the minimum value
    of the WAD2M time-series data was subtracted from the original WAD2M to adjust
    the baseline to zero Full size image Gap-filling by the climatology maps (i.e.,
    an average value for the same date over 15 years) can potentially lead to bias
    in the prediction. This is particularly the case when predicting recent climatic
    extremes away from the 15-year average. In fact, slight differences in patterns
    around the beginning of 2012 were likely caused by a gap in the microwave data
    (AMSR-E terminated on 2011/10/03 and AMSR2 started on 2012/07/02), which was filled
    by the daily climatology maps for ML prediction. Time-series data for the original
    and floating water fraction (Fig. 7B) showed consistent seasonal variability,
    with high values recorded in the summer season (~ 0.07) and the spring local peak,
    and low values recorded in the winter season. The baseline for the original water
    fraction was adjusted to zero in the floating water fraction. Comparison with
    a previous wetland map (i.e., WAD2M; Zhang et al. 2021) showed similar seasonal
    changes during the spring to fall seasons, although large discrepancies were observed
    in the winter season. The water fraction obtained in the present study for the
    winter season was lower than that for WAD2M, in both the original and floating
    cases. This difference was likely due to differences in the definitions used for
    snow masking. Specifically, our product strictly masked pixels where the microwave
    SWE was positive. This screened almost all of the pixels in the winter season
    and resulted in the water fraction being nearly zero. Conversely, the water fraction
    data from SWAMPS version 3.2 (Jensen and McDonald 2019), mainly used in WAD2M,
    applied a more relaxed approach to snow masking, which resulted in a substantial
    water fraction even in the winter season. In the spring to fall seasons, the original
    WAD2M values were close to the lower limit of our original water fraction. In
    contrast, those for the offset-corrected WAD2M (adjusted to make the minimum values
    zero) were close to the upper limit of our floating water fraction. The WAD2M
    did not sense the strong peaks in the water fraction associated with soil thawing
    or snow melting in spring, probably due to its lower observation frequency (monthly)
    and coarser spatial resolution (0.25°) compared to our product (daily, 0.1° in
    the ARD product and 500 m in the original product). Furthermore, differences in
    the variable range of the water fraction between the ARD product and WAD2M also
    seemed to be linked to differences in their data sources. Unlike WAD2M, our optical
    sensor-based output observes the tree canopy in densely vegetated areas, but cannot
    explicitly delineate inundation under the vegetation. However, our product does
    implicitly utilize sources such as microwave data (i.e., AMSR series) and other
    data sources (i.e., ERA5-Land, VOD, DOY) that may be sensitive to inundation under
    the vegetation to some extent. The interpretations above are also supported by
    TWS from GRACE and GLDAS, both of which account for snowpacks and show large values
    in winter. Snowmelt from snowpacks increases river runoff in the spring (Suzuki
    et al. 2018), which is consistent with the peak observed in our water fraction
    data. The lowest TWS during the summer–fall period also likely reflected our water
    fraction, as seen in the local minimum in the summer season. Figure 8 shows temporally
    averaged NDWI and NDVI maps, which are useful for visualizing the overall distribution
    of surface water and vegetation (Fig. 8A, B). The original water fraction map
    largely contained permanent water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and coastal areas
    (Fig. 8C), which were mostly excluded in the floating water fraction map (Fig.
    8D). The difference between the original and floating water maps exposes the intermittent
    wetlands. Comparisons with WAD2M showed a substantial underestimation of the water
    fraction on the west Siberian plain (Fig. 9E, F). High-resolution satellite images
    (Google Earth) confirmed the existence of abundant small-scale wetlands, which
    may not be detected by our moderate-resolution product (i.e., 500 m). Different
    effects of topography and vegetation cover on optical and microwave data may also
    cause discrepancies between WAD2M and our product. However, apart from this area,
    the exclusion of permanent water bodies from the original water map improved the
    consistency of the water fraction data between our product and WAD2M (Fig. 8F).

    8 Full size image 3.2 Application: trend analysis and phenological feature extraction
    Our wall-to-wall products enable us to perform time-series trend analyses for
    vegetation and surface water (Fig. 9). Specifically, the NDVI slope map showed
    an overall decreasing trend especially in the southwest area, with sporadic hotspots
    in western to central Siberian wetlands and water bodies such as Lake Baikal.
    Several studies have reported an overall greening trend (i.e., increasing NDVI)
    in the Arctic region in recent decades, which they have attributed to increased
    temperatures and a longer growing season (May et al. 2020). However, there have
    been also reports of browning (i.e., decreasing NDVI) (Myers-Smith et al. 2020),
    with the distribution varying depending on the data sources and methodologies
    used. The browning patterns (i.e., negative NDVI values) shown in Fig. 9 are closely
    aligned with the spatial distribution of the annual maximum NDVI trend (Fig. 1
    in Myers-Smith et al. 2020) based on the GIMMS3g AVHRR dataset (2000–2015) (Tucker
    et al. 2005; Pinzon and Tucker 2014), which supports the validity of our NDVI
    product. Extensive greening is expected over the northernmost Arctic Tundra region,
    but this could not be investigated as this region is not covered by our product.
    Consequently, expanding the map coverage area will be undertaken in future research.
    Expanding the study duration with similar data sources with a longer period is
    also important future work to monitor recent climate extremes after 2017 and to
    track the historical record before 2003. The NDWI slope map showed an overall
    increasing trend across the study area. Given that the NDWI and NDVI are based
    on the inverse differences between visible and infrared reflectance, their overall
    contrasting spatial trends are expected. Exceptions were found in small hotspots
    around Lake Baikal, the lake around the Zeya Nature Reserve, and coastal areas
    facing the Sea of Okhotsk, where decreasing trends were observed even in NDWI
    slope maps. These hotspots were also observed in the water fraction map for WAD2M,
    although WAD2M showed an overall decreasing trend across the study area. Rather,
    our results were more consistent with previous findings of significant increasing
    trends in the water fraction from 2003 to 2010 (Watts et al. 2012). The dense
    time series (i.e., daily) nature of our product is well suited to extracting phenological
    parameters in the spring and the fall seasons through double-sigmoid fitting (Tables
    8 and 9, Fig. 10). In both Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii, D1 showed a negative trend
    (i.e., SOS occurring earlier), whereas D3 and D4 showed positive trends (i.e.,
    SOF and EOF occurring later), although only the D3 in Spasskaya Pad was statistically
    significant. Therefore, the duration of the growing season at the two larch forest
    sites increased from 2003 to 2017. Table 8 Phenological parameters estimated by
    double sigmoid fitting of NDVI over Spasskaya Pad Full size table Table 9 Phenological

    Nagai et al. (2020) determined the start of the growing season (SGS) and the end
    of the growing season (EGS) for the Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii sites, based on
    in-situ observations and a degree-day model. Although the parameters that they
    used differed from those used in this study, the SGS was significantly correlated
    with our D1 (SOS) (r = 0.55 with p < 0.05 for Spasskaya Pad; r = 0.93 with p < 0.01
    for Elgeeii). These findings show that our SOS extraction is potentially well
    suited for use as a proxy for SGS. Conversely, unlike SGS, EGS showed a weaker
    correlation with our D4 (EOF) (r = 0.34 with p = 0.21 for Spasskaya Pad; r = 0.54
    with p = 0.17 for Elgeeii). The D1 time series data for Spasskaya Pad seem to
    have changed at around 2005–2007, with the SOS occurring earlier thereafter (Fig.
    10). This change was likely associated with waterlogging events and changes in
    the composition of the understory/overstory vegetation from 2005 to 2008 at the
    site (Kotani et al. 2014; 2019; Ohta et al. 2014; Nagano et al. 2022). The DOY
    of the Peak NDVI (D5) showed larger interannual variability than the other parameters,
    and the temporal changes in D5 were similar between Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii.
    Similarly, D1 and D2 showed time-series similarity between Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii,
    suggesting that these parameters were sensitive to large-scale meteorological
    factors such as temperature. Nagano et al. (2022) also observed a strong correlation
    between temperature anomalies and precipitation between Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii,
    supporting the importance of temperature as a large-scale phenological driver.
    Nagai et al. (2020) also stressed the complexity of the sensitivity of leaf senescence
    to air temperature, noting that various internal (hormones and timing of spring
    budburst) and external (precipitation, photoperiod, drought, and heat stress)
    factors need to be considered in order to better understand leaf senescence, as
    doing so will improve predictions of the EOF and/or EGS. In this study, our original
    and ARD products are considered to be valuable for monitoring water and vegetation
    distributions, and for performing trend analysis and phenological research. Further
    potential applications may include contributions to land surface modeling (Guimberteau
    et al. 2018) as input and/or reference data. In addition, enhancing time-series
    land cover maps (Brown et al. 2022) to explicitly quantify temporal changes in
    vegetation and water distributions could also be undertaken in the future. 4 Conclusions
    This research provided 15-years water and vegetation maps with daily frequency
    and a 500-m spatial resolution over the Siberia region on a continental scale,
    integrating optical and microwave satellite data, and meteorological data. A systematic
    treatment based on pixel-based RF techniques and further postprocessing produced
    maps of the NDWI, NDVI, and water fraction (original and floating), without any
    gaps for the period from 2003 to 2017. In addition to the original sinusoidal
    maps with 500-m resolution, an analysis-ready product that merges all of the sinusoidal
    maps on a latitude/longitude projection was also rescaled to a resolution of 0.1°
    pixel spacing. The treated NDWI and NDVI images showed no overall systematic biases,
    with a RMSE of approximately 0.1 for all tiles. Based on the products, trend analysis
    showed the distribution of NDVI browning and increasing NDWI hotspots for the
    period from 2003 to 2017. Phenological features were extracted for each year at
    two larch forest sites (Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii) based on double-sigmoid fitting
    of NDVI time-series data. The findings revealed a recent lengthening tendency
    in the growing period at the sites and confirmed that waterlogging caused an earlier
    start to spring at the Spasskaya Pad site. Our product can potentially be applied
    to spatiotemporal monitoring of water and vegetation, including trend analysis,
    phenological research, model integration and contribution to land cover mapping.

  description: Dynamics of vegetation in arid areas have drawn worldwide attention.
    The expansion of irrigated cropland (ICE) in arid regions contributes to increased
    food security and impacts on the extent and development of regional vegetation.
    However, the quantitative attribution of vegetation growth variation from ICE
    and biogeochemical factors (e.g., atmospheric CO2 concentration, climatic factors)
    is still lacking. Here, we assessed key drivers of vegetation growth in the inland
    arid region of Northwest China (IANC) from 1982 to 2018, including ICE, increased
    nitrogen rates, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) and climate drivers,
    using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ecosystem gross primary
    productivity (GPP) as measures. These variables were quantified through trend
    decomposition, machine learning algorithms, and a satellite-based model. The results
    show that vegetation growth was increased in IANC mainly due to eCO2 and ICE.
    After 1995, as the regional climatic aridity intensified, the CO2 fertilization
    effect on vegetation growth decreased, as the atmospheric CO2 concentration continued
    to increase. Meanwhile, irrigated cropland area increased sharply, and ICE-driven
    GPP variation exceeded that driven by eCO2 in the whole region, while the ICE-driven
    NDVI variation exceeded that due to eCO2 when the ICE reached 6.38%. The ICE effect
    on regional vegetation growth rather than the CO2 fertilization effect has mitigated
    the slowdown of the rate of vegetation growth caused by climate changes. Although
    the ICE is conducive to food security and continuous greening of arid areas, further
    reclamation will exacerbate water scarcity. Our results provide research base
    for identifying the scale of sustainable agricultural development.

    Metrics Abstract Dynamics of vegetation in arid areas have drawn worldwide attention.
    The expansion of irrigated cropland (ICE) in arid regions contributes to increased
    food security and impacts on the extent and development of regional vegetation.
    However, the quantitative attribution of vegetation growth variation from ICE
    and biogeochemical factors (e.g., atmospheric CO2 concentration, climatic factors)
    is still lacking. Here, we assessed key drivers of vegetation growth in the inland
    arid region of Northwest China (IANC) from 1982 to 2018, including ICE, increased
    nitrogen rates, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) and climate drivers,
    using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ecosystem gross primary
    productivity (GPP) as measures. These variables were quantified through trend
    decomposition, machine learning algorithms, and a satellite-based model. The results
    show that vegetation growth was increased in IANC mainly due to eCO2 and ICE.
    After 1995, as the regional climatic aridity intensified, the CO2 fertilization
    effect on vegetation growth decreased, as the atmospheric CO2 concentration continued
    to increase. Meanwhile, irrigated cropland area increased sharply, and ICE-driven
    GPP variation exceeded that driven by eCO2 in the whole region, while the ICE-driven
    NDVI variation exceeded that due to eCO2 when the ICE reached 6.38%. The ICE effect
    on regional vegetation growth rather than the CO2 fertilization effect has mitigated
    the slowdown of the rate of vegetation growth caused by climate changes. Although
    the ICE is conducive to food security and continuous greening of arid areas, further
    reclamation will exacerbate water scarcity. Our results provide research base
    for identifying the scale of sustainable agricultural development. Highlights
    Vegetation growth was enhanced in Northwest China mainly due to the CO2 fertilization
    effect and irrigation expansion during 1982–2018. The effect of irrigation on
    vegetation growth approached or even outweighed that of elevated atmospheric CO2
    concentration after 1995. The effect of irrigation expansion mitigates the slowdown
    of vegetation growth trend, instead of the CO2 fertilization effect. Introduction
    Satellite observations have shown that since the 1980s, global vegetation has
    exhibited an overall greening. Despite this, some areas show browning trends [5,
    28, 32, 50, 56]. After the mid-1990s, due to the intensification of drought condition,
    the intensity and extent of vegetation browning expanded, resulting in a stalling
    or reversal of vegetation greening in different parts of the world [28, 31, 50].
    Although the trends of vegetation growth in some regions have declined, there
    are still regions that continue greening as a result of land-use management. In
    recent years, to protect and restore degraded forest ecosystems, many countries
    have implemented a series of forest restoration projects, such as the Three North
    Shelterbelt Development Program and the Grain to Green Program in China, the New
    York Forest Declaration and the Bonn Challenge [4, 20, 39, 52]. In addition, expanding
    the sown area through irrigation and fertilization increases crop yield [25],
    which not only enhances food security, but also promotes regional greenness. Studies
    have shown that since 2000, the increase in global vegetation growth is mainly
    caused by the greening of forests and cropland [4]. Many studies have attached
    great importance to the impact of afforestation on regional vegetation growth
    [4, 21, 33, 40]. However, the quantitative effects of expansion of irrigated cropland
    (ICE) on NDVI and GPP are still uncertain. Vegetation growth dynamics are influenced
    by a combination of factors, including biogeochemical factors, as well as land-use-related
    drivers (e.g., land use changes and agricultural management measures) [32, 56].
    Globally, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) is considered to be the
    most important driver of vegetation greening [56]. In arid regions, climate change
    has had an important impact on vegetation growth [9, 26, 56]. Recently, as atmospheric
    CO2 concentration continues to increase, the warming-induced atmospheric aridity
    is intensifying, which generates a negative impact on vegetation growth [27, 31,
    50]. Studies have shown that the physiological response of plants to eCO2 can
    enhance leaf photosynthesis, improve water use efficiency [7], and alleviate some
    of the impact of atmospheric drought on vegetation growth [2, 48]. However, some
    studies have reported that enhanced vegetation growth means more water and nutrients
    consumption, aggravating the water scarcity in arid regions [8, 22], and the CO2
    fertilization effect will decrease due to water and nutrient limitations [17,
    38, 42, 44]. These indicate that in drier conditions, the fertilization effect
    of CO2 may decrease. A critical gap in our understanding pertains to the synergy
    and antagonism between different drivers. The inland arid region of Northwest
    China (IANC) is located in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S1a). It is an important strategic place of the ancient and modern
    ‘Silk Road’. It covers an area of 2.115 million km2, equivalent to about half
    of the area of the European Union. Four of the eight deserts in China are completely
    contained in the IANC, and two deserts are adjacent to it. Among them, the Taklimakan
    Desert is the largest desert in China and the second largest mobile desert in
    the world. The agriculture in IANC is highly dependent on irrigation, and the
    oasis agriculture formed at the edge of the desert has become important ecological
    barrier. Since the mid-1990s, large-scale ICE has taken place to meet the surging
    food demand, increasing the area of irrigated cropland by about 55% (Additional
    file 1: Figs. S2b, S3). In addition, over the last few decades IANC has experienced
    remarkable climatic warming, and the relative humidity decreased significantly
    after 1990s (Additional file 1: Figs. S2c, S4c), which has had an impact on regional
    ecological vegetation. It is urgent to clarify the impacts of various factors
    on regional vegetation growth in such an ecologically fragile environment, and
    it is necessary to explore the interaction between human activities and ‘natural’
    factors, as well as different ‘natural’ factors to ensure food security and ecological
    health in this and other arid regions. In this paper, satellite-based GIMMS3g
    NDVI and MODIS NDVI data sets were used to show the greening pattern in IANC from
    1982 to 2018. We then quantified the effects of biogeochemical factors (including
    atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate) and land-use-related drivers (including
    ICE and change of nitrogen fertilization per unit area) on IANC’s NDVI variation
    in the growing season (from May to October). This was achieved through trend decomposition
    and three machine learning algorithms. In addition, the cumulative GPP in the
    growing season was calculated using a revised remote sensing-based light use efficiency
    (LUE) model, and model experiments were performed to quantify the effects of various
    factors on ecosystem productivity. Methods Data sets The data used in this paper
    include satellite remote sensing data, meteorological data, reanalysis data, and
    statistical yearbook data. The time period, temporal and spatial resolutions,
    and sources of the data are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Vegetation greenness
    As an indicator of vegetation greenness, the satellite-based NDVI data was used
    in this study, including the GIMMS3g NDVI and the MOD13A3 NDVI (see details in
    Additional file 1: Table S1). The multi-year monthly average values of GIMMS3g
    NDVI in IANC were calculated, and the months with NDVI greater than 0.1 were designated
    as the growing season (from May to October). The growing season NDVI was integrated
    by taking the average value from May to October. The GIMMS3g NDVI is represented
    on a resolution of 0.0833°. The MOD13A3 NDVI was resampled to the same spatial
    resolution as the GIMMS3g NDVI by the nearest neighbour method, and the variation
    and magnitude of the GIMMS3g NDVI and the MOD13A3 NDVI were almost the same in
    the study area (Additional file 1: Fig. S5). Therefore, the MOD13A3 NDVI was used
    to supplement the GIMMS3g NDVI to obtain vegetation greenness information for
    a longer time period (1982–2018). Human activities Two land use data sets (see
    Additional file 1: Table S1 for details) were collected as indicators of spatial
    change in regional irrigated cropland area from 1982 to 2018, and the irrigated
    cropland area and its changes displayed in these two sets of data are highly consistent
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). By summing the cropland area of all 0.00833° pixels
    in each 0.0833° pixel, the data were aggregated to the same spatial resolution
    as the NDVI data. We used data on nitrogen application per unit area in Xinjiang
    and the Hexi Corridor from the Xinjiang Statistical Yearbook and the Gansu Development
    Yearbook. In addition, spatial nitrogen application data were obtained from a
    global data set [23]. There was a significant linear correlation between the nitrogen
    fertilization data in the statistical yearbook and the global data set (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S6a), so the statistical yearbook data were used to correct and extend
    the data in the global data set. Meteorological data and atmospheric CO2 concentration
    data Meteorological data mainly came from the China National Meteorological Center.
    The data collected at 110 meteorological stations were interpolated to 0.0833°
    spatial grid data using the nearest neighbor method. The cumulative solar radiation
    for the growing season was calculated from the solar radiation data in the re-analyzed
    data set and the record of sunshine hours from the meteorological stations. Atmospheric
    CO2 concentration data observed at the Global Atmospheric Background Station at
    Waliguan was obtained from the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center. Waliguan
    Station is the only atmospheric background observation station in the inland region
    of the Northern Hemisphere, and its observations reflect the atmospheric greenhouse
    gas concentrations and their changes in the mid-latitude inland regions of the
    Northern Hemisphere. In addition, longer observation from the Mauna Loa Observatory
    was obtained from the Global Monitoring Laboratory. The interannual variations
    in CO2 data from the two stations were highly consistent (Additional file 1: Fig.
    S6b), so the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory were used in calculations.
    Trend change point detection The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and segmented
    regression [1] (a linear regression that modifies its slope at a certain value
    of the predictor, or threshold) were used to determine the trend change points
    of interannual variations of observation elements. We used AIC to choose the model
    that best-fitted the data. When non-linear regression (e.g., quadratic function)
    was a better fit to the data, trend change point may be present, and in these
    cases, the trend change point is defined by segmented regression. The segmented
    regressions were achieved through the ‘SiZer’ package in R, and the bootstrap
    sampling on each database was set 1000 times, with a confidence interval of 95%.
    After AIC judgement, we found that there were trend change points in the trends
    of ‘growing season’ mean GIMMS3g NDVI in the natural vegetation zone, the irrigated
    cropland area, and the relative humidity. The trend change points of the above
    three elements are 1990, 1995 and 1992 respectively (Additional file 1: Fig. S2).
    We selected 1995 as the dividing point between the early and later periods, because
    1995 is not only the change point for the trend in irrigated cropland area, but
    also falls within the 95% confidence interval of the trend change points for natural
    vegetation NDVI and relative humidity (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Effect of
    ICE on NDVI calculated by trend decomposition We used the trend decomposition
    method to quantify the effect of ICE on NDVI. We use a linear trend to represent
    the change in NDVI over a period of time. First, we calculated the growing season
    NDVI trend of each 0.0833° pixel (pel0.0833) from1982 to 2018. Secondly, the pels0.0833
    with the proportion of cropland greater than 10% were identified as cropland pixels
    in 1982 and 2018, and then the cropland change pixels between 1982 and 2018 (hereinafter
    referred to as ICE pixels) were identified (Additional file 1: Fig. S7a). The
    pels0.0833 with the proportion of natural vegetation (uncultivated vegetation)
    greater than 60% coverage, both in 1982 and 2018, were defined as natural vegetation
    pixels. The proportions of cropland and natural vegetation were derived from the
    land use data products. We then decomposed the NDVI trends of ICE pixels by considering
    two cases: a) If there was natural vegetation in the ICE pixel before 1982, it
    was considered that the NDVI variation trend caused by ICE was the actual NDVI
    trend minus the reference trend value [Eq. (1)]. b) If there was no natural vegetation
    in the ICE pixel before 1982, it was considered that the variation of NDVI was
    caused by ICE [Eq. (2)]: (1) (2) Where represents the NDVI trend caused by ICE
    in the ICE pixel, represents the actual NDVI trend in the corresponding pel0.0833,
    and represents the reference trend value which is calculated at the grid with
    spatial resolution of 0.75° (grid0.75) (Additional file 1: Fig. S7c). Each grid0.75
    contains 81 pels0.0833. The is calculated by averaging the NDVI trends of all
    natural vegetation pixels in the grid0.75. It should be noted that we assume that
    at each grid0.75, all pels0.0833 have the same climate background and are taken
    to have experienced the same agricultural management measures. Through the above
    operation, we calculated the effects of ICE on NDVI in ICE pixels. However, the
    pels0.0833 that had cropland before 1982 and the pels0.0833 with small change
    in the irrigated cropland area were ignored. Where there was a significant linear
    correlation between cropland area change and NDVI variation (Additional file 1:
    Fig. S7b), the NDVI variation caused by ICE was spatially extrapolated through
    the actual irrigated cropland proportion of change of the pel0.0833 and the of
    the grid0.75 where the pel0.0833 is located [Eqs. (3), (4)]: (3) (4) where is
    actual cropland proportion changes of the ICE pixels; is the NDVI trend caused
    by the change of unit cropland proportion in the ICE pixels, and the is the average
    value of in a grid0.75; is the NDVI trend caused by the ICE (Additional file 1:
    Fig. S7d), and is the actual irrigated cropland proportion changes in the pels0.0833.
    Machine learning algorithms for estimating the effects of various factors on NDVI
    Three machine learning algorithms (Additional file 1: Table S2) were used to model
    and estimate NDVI with variation in different biogeochemical factors (atmospheric
    CO2 concentration, photosynthetically active radiation, relative humidity and
    air temperature) and human activities (irrigated cropland area, nitrogen fertilization).
    Satellite-derived growing season mean NDVI data were used for model training and
    verification. If the numbers of target data are small, the machine learning algorithm
    may ‘over fit’. Therefore, we used grid0.75 as the calculation unit to expand
    the sample size. We had 81 pels0.0833 in each grid0.75, and each pel0.0833 contained
    35 years of data, that is, there were 2835 samples at each grid0.75 for model
    construction. 70% of the samples were randomly selected for model training and
    the remaining 30% for testing. Through the random search and the cross validation,
    the optimal parameters were selected for each grid. We use the coefficient of
    determination (R2) between the simulated values and observed values in the test
    set as the evaluation metric for the model, and our results suggest that machine
    learning algorithms can effectively estimate NDVI (Additional file 1: Fig. S8).
    Among them, the simulation efficiency of the Random Forest and MLP Neural Network
    is superior to that of the Support Vector Machine. We synthesized the results
    of the three models by calculating their average. We calculated the effects of
    various drivers on variation of NDVI through model experiments. Firstly, we made
    all factors change over time to calculate (a normal model run). Next, we kept
    the variable x constant (e.g., ICE, eCO2) to calculate with other factors changing
    over time. The difference between and is the NDVI variation driven by variable
    x: (5) where is the NDVI variation driven by variable x in the ith year. The trend
    of NDVI driven by x was calculated by the least square method. The sensitivity
    of NDVI to the ICE was analyzed through linear regression. The calculation equation
    is as follows: (6) where is the NDVI variation driven by ICE between 1982 and
    2018 in the kth grid0.75, and is ICE proportion (i.e., the proportion of irrigated
    cropland area to total vegetation area between 1982 and 2018) in the kth grid0.75;
    is the sensitivity of NDVI to ICE; is the residual term. Regional productivity
    estimation and attribution A revised light use efficiency (LUE) model was used
    to estimate regional productivity of vegetation (GPP), and the calculation equation
    is as follows [10, 50]: (7) where PAR is photosynthetically active radiation,
    calculated as 1/2 of the solar radiation (unit: MJ/m2/month); FPAR is the fraction
    of PAR absorbed by the vegetation canopy, which can be calculated by NDVI [Eq.
    (8)] [3]; is the maximum LUE, and we take the fixed empirical value of 2.76 g
    C/MJ [12, 37, 50] to prevent the effects of some factors from being repeatedly
    considered; , and represent the downward-regulation scalars for the respective
    effects of eCO2, air temperature and moisture conditions on the LUE [3, 10, 29,
    50, 53]. The effect of atmospheric CO2 concentration on LUE ( ) was obtained from
    the work of Yuan et al. [50], and see details in the supplementary information.
    was calculated by mean air temperature ( , unit: ) and the optimal air temperature
    which is the average temperature of the month with the largest NDVI in a year
    [10] (see details in the supplementary information). was calculated using regional
    evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration [PET, Eq. (9)]. The regional
    ET was obtained through the GLASS ET product [49] and PET was calculated using
    the Hargreaves equation [Eq. (10)]: (8) (9) (10) where and represent the maximum
    and minimum air temperature in the calculation period, respectively (unit: ).
    is the theoretical solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (unit: MJ/m2/month);
    the is the conversion coefficient with a value of 9.39 × 10–4. In the cropland
    zone, we made some adjustments to the above LUE model. In addition to natural
    factors, we also considered the effects of ICE and nitrogen fertilization on GPP.
    The calculation is as follows: (11) We found that there was a significant linear
    correlation between the ICE and regional ET, so we substituted this relationship
    into Eq. (9) to obtain : (12) (13) here, a and b are the coefficients in the regression
    equation between ET and ICE, which were quantified by the ET of GLASS products
    and irrigated cropland area in the land use data set, and each pel0.0833 has specific
    values of a and b. Within a certain range, there is a stable proportional relationship
    between biomass and GPP [16, 24], so we collected nitrogen fertilization and biomass
    data for three main crops (corn, wheat and cotton) in IANC to quantify . Wheat,
    corn, and cotton occupy 22.4%, 15.4%, and 31.8% of the planting area, respectively.
    Over the years, these three crops together have consistently comprised around
    70% of the total cultivated area. The regression relationship between nitrogen
    fertilization and relative biomass (biomass after nitrogen application divided
    by biomass without nitrogen application) was established, and the AIC was used
    for judgment. The results showed that there was a significant quadratic function
    relationship between nitrogen fertilization and relative biomass (Additional file
    1: Fig. S9a). We integrated data of different crops to establish a unified relationship
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S9b). The revised LUE model was verified by the GPP observation
    data for the experimental sites, and the simulated results matched well with the
    observed values (Additional file 1: Fig. S10). GPP was then calculated by weighted
    averaging based on the proportions of cropland and natural vegetation in each
    of the pels0.0833: (14) where represents the GPP in the jth pel0.0833; and represent
    the GPP of cropland and natural vegetation, respectively in the jth pel0.0833;
    and represent the proportions of cropland and natural vegetation area in the jth
    pel0.0833. We performed numerical simulations to evaluate the effects of various
    factors on GPP with the revised LUE model. In the LUE model, various factors affect
    GPP through two aspects: on one hand, drivers regulate GPP by affecting the FPAR
    which is calculated directly through NDVI, so we call this path the FPAR variable
    [Eq. (8)]; on the other hand, GPP is affected by various factors through controlling
    the downward-regulation scalars (e.g., , ) of the LUE, and we call this path LUE
    variable [Eq. (16)]: (15) (16) where NFER is the nitrogen fertilization and RH
    is the relative humidity. In the normal model run, all variables changed with
    time both in the FPAR path and LUE path, which we called . Next, we calculated
    by allowing other factors to change over time while holding the variable x constant
    at its initial baseline level in the LUE path and substituting NDVI with the in
    the FPAR path. was calculated by keeping the variable x to maintain the initial
    value and other factors to change over time in the machine learning algorithm
    models mentioned above. The difference between and is the GPP variation driven
    by variable x [Eq. (17)]. In addition, we conducted another set of simulation
    experiments by substituting NDVI with the in the FPAR path and making all variables
    change with time in the LUE path, which was named . The difference between and
    is the GPP variation driven by variable x through the LUE path [Eq. (18)]: (17)
    (18) where is the GPP variation driven by variable x in the ith year, and is the
    GPP variation driven by variable x through the LUE path. The trend of GPP driven
    by x was calculated by the least square method. In the same way, the sensitivity
    of GPP to the change of ICE was analyzed through linear regression: (19) where
    is the GPP variation driven by ICE between 1982 and 2018 in the kth grid0.75,
    and is the ICE proportion (i.e., the proportion of the total vegetation area which
    is irrigated cropland area), a value which changes between 1982 and 2018 in the
    kth grid0.75; is the sensitivity of GPP to ICE; is the residual term. Results
    Vegetation growth changes in IANC The GIMMS3g NDVI data showed the interannual
    variation of the average NDVI during the growing season in IANC, with the trends
    of NDVI calculated by the least square method, as shown in Fig. 1a, b, c. The
    trends were tested and the trend change points were determined by the AIC and
    segmented regressions. From 1982 to 2015, the NDVI increased significantly, especially
    in the cropland zone (Fig. 1a, b). The NDVI trends are 0.000572 yr−1 (p = 3.77e-8)
    and 0.00154 yr−1 (p = 1.5e-11) for the whole area and the cropland zone, respectively.
    The trend change point was found in the NDVI variation in the natural vegetation
    zone (mainly woodland and grassland) (Additional file 1: Fig. S2a). Since the
    1990s, the growth rate of natural vegetation NDVI has slowed down. The study period
    was divided into two periods, before and after 1995. The NDVI in the natural vegetation
    zone increased significantly over the early period (from 1982 to 1995), but the
    growth trend in the later period (from 1995 to 2018) decreased by 84.4% compared
    with the early period, and the slope became statistically insignificant (Fig.
    1c). Figure 2a, c, d shows the spatial distributions of GIMMS3g NDVI trends. After
    1995, the intensity and extent of vegetation browning increased significantly,
    but the cropland zones in the central part of Northern Xinjiang, the Tarim River
    Basin, and the central and western Hexi Corridor continued greening (Fig. 2a,
    c, d, Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In addition, the MOD13A3 NDVI data also shows
    that from 2001 to 2018, the vegetation greenness in the cropland zone increased
    significantly during the growing season, and the zones with vegetation browning
    were mainly concentrated in the mid-range of the Tianshan Mountains and the northern
    mountainous area of Northern Xinjiang (Fig. 2b, Additional file 1: Fig. S1), which
    was consistent with the GIMMS3g NDVI result. Fig. 1 Variations of vegetation growth

    We used the revised LUE model to estimate regional GPP [10, 50]. The results of
    the revised LUE model matched well with the measured GPP at the ground experimental
    sites, especially in the cropland zone (Additional file 1: Fig. S10). We also
    verified the result of revised LUE model by comparing it with other GPP products.
    The cumulative GPP in the growing season estimated by the revised LUE model is
    close to the GLASS GPP product, and is consistent with the variation of MODIS
    GPP, but the value is greater than that of MODIS GPP (Additional file 1: Fig.
    S11). From 1982 to 2018, the cumulative GPP in the growing season in IANC increased
    significantly. The GPP trends are 2.77 g C m−2 yr−1 (p = 9.46e-13) and 9.29 g
    C m−2 yr−1 (p = 2.08e-16) for the whole area and the cropland zone, respectively
    (Fig. 1d, e). After 1995, the growth of GPP in the natural vegetation zone stalled.
    The increasing rate of GPP at the late period of the natural vegetation zone decreased
    by 79.1% compared with the early period (Fig. 1f). Attribution of vegetation growth
    trend The relative importance of various factors in the attribution calculated
    by the three machine learning algorithms are basically consistent (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S12a), and we integrated the results of the three models by averaging.
    The machine learning algorithms and trend decomposition method showed similar
    effects of ICE on NDVI (Additional file 1: Fig. S12b). Figure 3 shows the attribution
    of NDVI trend obtained from the model experiments using the machine learning algorithms.
    ICE was the dominant factor in NDVI variation in the cropland zone, explaining
    61% (61.12 ± 9.78%) of NDVI variation (Fig. 3a). In the natural vegetation zone,
    NDVI variation was mainly due to eCO2 (Fig. 3b). Over the whole region, the effect
    of eCO2 also dominated, explaining 70% (70.25 ± 7.72%) of the NDVI variation (Fig.
    3c). Among the climatic factors, change in relative humidity had the greatest
    effect on NDVI, and the relative humidity-driven NDVI trend is significantly negative
    in both cropland zone and natural vegetation zone (Fig. 3a, b). From 1982 to 1995,
    the regional relative humidity increased, and the NDVI trend driven by relative
    humidity was positive as well. In the late period (1995–2018), due to the significant
    decline of regional relative humidity, the NDVI trend driven by relative humidity
    also became negative (Additional files 1: Figs. S4c and Fig. 3d, e, f). After
    1995, the effect of ICE on NDVI trend increased substantially, while the effect
    of eCO2 decreased (Fig. 3d, e, f). ICE showed an equally significant effect on
    NDVI variation as did eCO2 during the latter part of the study period (ICE: 0.356 ± 0.502,
    eCO2: 0.408 ± 0.992, unit: 10–3 yr−1) in the whole region (Fig. 3f). Fig. 3 Attribution

    of NDVI variation in the two periods. The “early” notation indicates the period
    of 1982–1995, and “late” indicates 1995–2018. The drivers include irrigated cropland

    CO2 concentration (ES_eCO2), photosynthetically active radiation change (ES_PAR),
    relative humidity change (ES_RH) and air temperature change (ES_Ta). ES_ALL notation
    indicates the result of model simulation with all factors changing over time.
    Error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of the trends. Two asterisks indicate
    that the trend is extremely significant (P < 0.01), and one asterisk indicates
    that the trend is significant (P < 0.05) Full size image Model experiments were
    conducted through the revised LUE model to quantify the effects of various factors
    on GPP variation. In the cropland zone, ICE is the dominant factor in GPP variation,
    explaining 58% (57.93 ± 11.66%) of the GPP trend (Fig. 4a). In the natural vegetation
    zone, as well as the whole region, the eCO2 had the greatest influence on GPP
    variation (Fig. 4b, c), which is consistent with the attribution of NDVI trend.
    However, over the whole region, the contribution of ICE to GPP trend reached 42%
    (41.99 ± 8.45%), which was close to that of eCO2 (49.79 ± 12.43%) (Fig. 4c). The
    effects of various factors on GPP trend were also analyzed in two periods (Fig.
    4d, e, f), and the GPP trend driven by relative humidity change was positive at
    the early period and negative at the late period. The effect of eCO2 decreased
    during the late period, while the effect of ICE increased significantly, and the
    ICE-driven GPP trend over the whole zone exceeded that of eCO2 at the late period
    (ICE: 1.30 ± 0.229, eCO2: 0.800 ± 0.265, unit: g C m−2 yr−1) (Fig. 4f). Fig. 4

    In panel (a), (b), (c), the effects of various factors on GPP in the cropland
    zone, the natural vegetation zone and the whole region are shown respectively
    from 1982 to 2018, while panel (d), (e), (f) represent the attribution of GPP
    trend in the two periods. The “early” notation indicates the period of 1982–1995,
    and “late” notation indicates 1995–2018. The drivers include irrigated cropland
    expansion (ES_ICE), nitrogen fertilization change (ES_NFER), elevated atmospheric
    CO2 concentration (ES_eCO2), photosynthetically active radiation change (ES_PAR),
    relative humidity change (ES_RH) and temperature change (ES_Ta). ES_ALL notation
    indicates the result of model simulation with all factors changing over time.
    Error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of the trends. Two asterisks indicate
    that the trend is extremely significant (P < 0.01), and one asterisk indicates
    that the trend is significant (P < 0.05) Full size image ICE threshold The percentage
    of the change of irrigated cropland area as a function of total vegetation area
    (ICE proportion) reached 5.25% by 2018. As the ICE proportion grows, the ICE-driven
    NDVI (or GPP) variation becomes greater, and eventually exceeds the effect of
    eCO2. The relationships of the ICE-driven NDVI and GPP variations against ICE
    proportion between 1982 and 2018 were calculated spatially [Eq. (6), (19)], and
    showed significant linear correlations (Fig. 5). This means that the sensitivities
    of NDVI and GPP variations to ICE are consistent in the spatial grids0.75, with
    values of 0.0022 for NDVI and 12.9 for GPP. During the whole period, only if the
    ICE proportion reaches 10.4%, ICE-driven NDVI variation can exceed the eCO2 effect
    in the whole region (Fig. 5a), while the threshold for ICE-driven GPP variation
    exceeded eCO2-driven GPP variation is 6.55% (Fig. 5b). Since regional irrigated
    cropland began to expand after 1995, the ICE-driven vegetation growth variation
    in the late period was close to that recorded during the entire period. The GPP
    variation driven by ICE outstripped that by eCO2 when the ICE proportion exceeded
    4.37% in the late period. The ICE-driven NDVI variation reached a level equivalent
    to the eCO2 effect in the late period, when the ICE proportion increases to 6.38%
    (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Threshold of the ICE-driven NDVI and GPP variation ( and ) outpace
    that of eCO2. ICE proportion is the percentage of the change of irrigated cropland

    of ICE on NDVI and GPP The term ‘Vegetation growth dynamics’ is often used with
    reference to changes in vegetation structures and functions, which are affected
    both by natural drivers and by human activities. As such, such growth dynamics
    can play a critical role in the material and energy flows of ecosystems [11, 32].
    The growth dynamics of vegetation can be quantified by various indicators, such
    as vegetation greenness, vegetation cover, and ecosystem productivity [13, 21,
    45]. Satellite-based NDVI represents vegetation greenness, which can reflect the
    capacity of vegetation to absorb PAR, as well as the extent of vegetation coverage.
    The ecosystem productivity quantified by GPP represents the carbon sequestration
    capacity of vegetation and is an important indicator of the amount of carbon cycling
    between ecosystems and the atmosphere [6, 36]. The annual precipitation in the
    desert oasis area in northwest China is less than 200 mm, and the natural vegetation
    cover is mainly desert steppe and low shrubs [47]. Since the mid-1990s, substantial
    areas of cropland have been developed and improved in the region through diverting
    water for irrigation to previously uncultivated areas and to grassy areas in IANC.
    This has resulted in enhanced vegetation growth regionally. The ICE in IANC supplements
    the water and nutrient conditions required for vegetation growth through irrigation
    and fertilization, which promotes regional vegetation greening, increases fixation
    of CO2 by plants and further increases ecosystem productivity [43, 51, 55]. After
    1995, ICE in IANC had a significant positive effect on regional vegetation growth,
    and had a greater effect than NDVI on GPP (Figs. 3c, f and 4c, f). In the LUE
    model, GPP is calculated by multiplying the PAR, FPAR, and LUE [Eq. (15)], where
    FPAR is related to vegetation greenness and can be estimated by NDVI. The environmental
    factors that affect FPAR also affect the LUE. Figure S13 shows the GPP trends
    for the whole region from 1982 to 2018 driven by environmental variables through
    effects on LUE. During this period, the ICE contribution was the most significant
    of that of all driving variables (Additional file 1: Fig. S13c). As a result,
    ICE not only increases NDVI, which improves the ability of the vegetation canopy
    to absorb PAR, but more importantly, increases LUE, and further improves regional
    carbon sequestration. ICE has slowed the decline of vegetation growth in the region
    Plant photosynthesis is enhanced as by the climate change-driven enhancement of
    atmospheric CO2 concentration and this can significantly promote vegetation growth.
    In addition, the physiological response of plant leaves to eCO2 can improve water
    use efficiency [7]. Globally, eCO2 is considered the most important factor in
    vegetation greening [32, 56]. However, climate change is also increasing air temperatures,
    crop water losses and the development of drought on all continents of the world
    [15, 48], thereby adversely affecting plant growth [18, 35, 50]. Some studies
    suggest that the positive influence of eCO2 on vegetation growth can offset the
    negative impact of climatic drought, which can avoid further expansion of drylands
    [2, 48]. However, an increasing number of studies also show that the CO2 fertilization
    effect is reduced by the limitation of water and nutrient conditions in the ecosystem
    [17, 34, 42, 44]. The observed data from meteorological stations show that since
    the 1980s, the air temperature and precipitation in IANC have increased. The early
    precipitation trend is 2.00 mm/yr, and the later precipitation trend is 1.11 mm/yr,
    which decreased by 45% compared with the earlier period. However, the air temperature
    continued to rise, and the relative humidity increased significantly in the early
    period and decreased significantly in the later period. As a result, the regional
    climatic aridity intensified in more recent time (Additional file 1: Fig. S4).
    We found that as the relative humidity-driven NDVI and GPP trends changed from
    positive to negative, the fertilization effect of CO2 on NDVI and GPP also decreased
    (Figs. 3d, e, f and 4d, e, f), although the atmospheric CO2 concentration continued
    to increase (Fig. S6b). In the later period, the natural vegetation is 0.338 0.094
    (unit: 10–3 yr−1) and the is − 0.15 0.119 ( : -0.298 0.568, unit: g C m−2 yr−1,
    Figs. 3e and 4e). The fertilization effect of CO2 alleviated the effect of drought,
    but its effect was not enough to alleviate the decline of NDVI and GPP trends.
    The trends of NDVI and GPP in cropland zone did not decrease as in natural vegetation
    zone, mainly due to the significant positive impact of ICE (Figs. 3d and 4d).
    The results of this paper show that in arid regions, it is ICE that mitigates
    the decline of vegetation growth trend, rather than the CO2 fertilization effect,
    in the case of intensified climatic drought. In addition, over the entire region,
    the effect of ICE on the NDVI or GPP variation, was close to or even has outpaced
    that of eCO2 at the late period (Figs. 3f and 4f). Our results indicate that the
    impact of ICE on vegetation growth has kept pace with the CO2 fertilization effect
    in IANC, which is due to the significant increase in irrigated cropland area and
    the reduced effect of eCO2 in the later years of the period under study. In summary,
    ICE plays a significant role in the growth of vegetation in arid regions. We highlight
    the role of ICE, which on one hand confirms the importance of water availability
    in arid areas. Although the fertilization effect of CO2 has a considerable impact
    on vegetation growth, the limitation of water conditions still predominates in
    arid regions [19, 32, 54]. On the other hand, we emphasize the impact of human
    activities on fragile ecosystems, which continuously challenge natural regulatory
    capacities. This finding is consistent with many other research results [4, 30].
    ICE may exacerbate regional water conflicts in the future The fertilization effect
    of CO2 and human land use management promote regional vegetation growth, however,
    vegetation expansion, especially the increase of the afforestation and cropland,
    will exacerbate regional water conflicts in arid regions [8, 22]. In recent years,
    as the population grows rapidly and the demand for food increases, more and more
    land has been reclaimed. The data from the statistical yearbook show that the
    agricultural production in the northwest region has significantly increased, ensuring
    regional food security (Additional file 1: Fig. S14). More output means more water
    consumption, and agricultural water consumption also significantly increases (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S14). For the total amount of water resources in the region remains
    stable, the increase of agricultural water use will inevitably crowd out ecological
    water use, which will lead to the cutoff of downstream inland rivers and the formation
    of more groundwater table drop funnels. Terrestrial water storage observations
    from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission
    have revealed significant decline in regional water resources (Additional file
    1: Fig. S14). The soil drought in some areas will intensify, and the natural vegetation
    will be affected and even face the threat of death, which will have an adverse
    impact on the regional ecology [14]. Facing the twofold pressure of water shortage
    and the adverse effects of climate change, maintaining an appropriate scale of
    irrigated cropland is critical for ensuring food security and ecological health
    in IANC in the future. Assessment of data and methodological reliability In this
    study, we employed multiple sources of data and a variety of methodologies to
    demonstrate the impact of natural factors and human activities on regional NDVI
    and GPP. To ensure the reliability and validity of our research findings, we conducted
    a comprehensive evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of the data, as well
    as the appropriateness of the methods. First, we utilized GIMMS3g NDVI and MOD13A3
    NDVI data to study regional greenness variations and as input data for the LUE
    model. These data sets have been widely used and analyzed by many scholars and
    are broadly considered to have high reliability and representativeness [28, 41,
    46, 50]. The driving data, such as climate data and atmospheric carbon dioxide
    concentration, are derived from authoritative observation organizations, ensuring
    high quality. Second, we integrated three machine learning algorithms to attribute
    NDVI, and subdivided larger grids into smaller ones to increase the data volume
    for training models, meeting the requirements of machine learning algorithms.
    The impacts of ICE on NDVI quantified by machine learning algorithms and trend
    decomposition methods are largely consistent, mutually validating each other.
    Finally, we used a revised LUE model to calculate GPP and attributed it. We collected
    real measurement data from four ground stations to validate the results of the
    improved LUE model, which showed that the LUE model performs well (Additional
    file 1: Fig. S10). Although there are certain limitations in the data and methods,
    we have taken measures to address them: (1) Some data have a short time range
    and can only be supplemented with other data to ensure the timeliness of the article.
    We have chosen data with consistent results for mutual verification and supplementation,
    and the supplementation period is short to ensure that it minimally impacts the
    main findings of our study. (2) The research objective of the text is to study
    the overall variation in regional vegetation growth indicators and their attribution.
    Using regional average values provides an overview of large-area trends, facilitating
    comparisons across the entire region, cropland zone, and natural vegetation zone.
    However, this approach lacks a more detailed and nuanced understanding of spatial
    variations, which should be addressed in future work through increased research
    on regional spatial changes. Conclusions Our results show that, from 1982 to 2018,
    vegetation growth was enhanced in IANC mainly under the influence of ICE and eCO2,
    with ICE being the dominant factor in cropland zones. Since the mid-1990s, the
    significantly decreased regional relative humidity has negatively affected vegetation
    growth, and the CO2 fertilization effects on NDVI and GPP also decreased. However,
    the irrigated cropland area has increased sharply, and its positive impact on
    vegetation growth approached or even exceeded that of eCO2 in the later period,
    which has delayed the slowing down of the growth trend. In the whole region, the
    change of irrigated cropland area accounts for 5.25% of the total vegetation area,
    and the variation of GPP driven by ICE reached a level equivalent to that by eCO2
    at the late period when the ICE proportion reached 4.37%, while the ICE-driven
    NDVI variation will outpace the eCO2 effect when the ICE proportion raises to
    above 6.38%. Although our study highlights the positive effect of irrigation cropland
    expansion on vegetation growth in arid areas, further expansion of irrigated cropland
    in the future will exacerbate regional conflict between water demand and supply,
    which may adversely affect the growth of natural vegetation. In the future, the
    ecological impact of ICE needs to be in-depth studied. Availability of data and

    2024 Introduction Terrestrial ecosystems absorb ~30% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide
    (CO2) emissions and thus play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change1,2.
    Over the past five decades, the terrestrial carbon sink has more than doubled
    at a pace that is consistent with the increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions2,3.
    Current evidence demonstrates that the enhancement of the terrestrial carbon sink
    is partially attributable to the increased carbon uptake by vegetation under elevated
    atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2)4,5,6,7. The eCO2-induced changes in vegetation
    carbon uptake (represented by gross primary production (GPP)) are governed by
    two different mechanisms. The first is the direct effect of eCO2 through the stimulation
    of photosynthetic carbon fixation and the enhancement of water-use efficiency
    (hereafter eCO2(dir))8,9. The second is the indirect effect of eCO2 through its
    radiative forcing and the associated change in climate (e.g., temperature and
    water regime) and related environmental conditions (e.g., variation in nitrogen
    availability linked to temperature-driven changes in the mineralization rate of
    soil organic matter) (hereafter eCO2(ind))10,11,12. Recently, data-driven assessments
    based on in-situ and satellite observations have documented a declining trend
    in eCO2(dir)9,13. Given the dominant role of eCO2 in the recent increase in GPP14,
    the sign and temporal variation in eCO2(ind) is expected to increasingly control
    the future trajectory of the terrestrial carbon budget15. However, the dynamics
    of such indirect CO2 effect on the terrestrial carbon budget remain largely elusive.
    The relative importance of future indirect versus direct effects of eCO2 in regulating
    vegetation carbon uptake has not yet been quantified, and the underlying ecological
    mechanisms remain poorly understood. Such knowledge gaps are reflected in substantial
    uncertainties in the effectiveness of land-based climate mitigation policies.
    eCO2(ind) originates from the strong and non-linear effects of eCO2-induced climate
    change on terrestrial GPP, which involve multiple pathways, including the plants’
    response to changing temperature, water supply, atmospheric dryness (expressed
    by vapor pressure deficit, VPD) and their complex interactions16. In addition,
    these pathways via which climate influences GPP also interact with the eCO2(dir)17,18.
    For example, the rising VPD with eCO2 generally causes a reduction in stomatal
    aperture, modulating the transpiration rate and—at the same time—the positive
    effect of CO2 fertilization on photosynthesis19. In view of the variety of interacting
    feedbacks that regulate vegetation carbon uptake, it is challenging to quantitatively
    disentangle the total eCO2(ind), particularly at regional-to-global scales, where
    local-scale findings of Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments may not be
    applicable20,21. Recent studies based on satellite products and model simulations
    have reported the weakening of the temperature-vegetation relationship in northern
    ecosystems over the past 30 years22, the increasingly negative impact of VPD on
    alpine grassland productivity23, and the increasing water constraint on vegetation
    growth in many regions across the globe24,25 and the corresponding higher risk
    of droughts to the global carbon cycle26. However, considering that changes in
    temperature, atmospheric dryness, precipitation, and soil moisture are single
    components of the climate response to the CO2 radiative forcing, findings of the
    abovementioned studies can only partially reflect the temporal variations in eCO2(ind).
    eCO2 drives changes in various climatic factors, and their effects on vegetation
    carbon uptake are covariant, can be additive or offsetting, and may lead to nonlinearities
    due to different feedback mechanisms27,28. Existing studies focusing on a single
    climate driver (e.g., temperature22), generally assumed that the effects are independent
    by neglecting the covariation and the interaction between drivers. Therefore,
    the assessment of the variations in the total indirect effect of eCO2 can only
    be partially represented. To address these knowledge gaps, here we investigate
    the dynamics in eCO2(ind) at the global scale for the period 1982–2014 using both
    satellite retrievals and an ensemble of Earth system models (ESMs) participating
    in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)29 (Table 1), and
    project potential changes in eCO2(ind) up to the year 2100 under the SSP5-8.5
    scenario. Factorial simulations derived from the fully coupled experiment and
    the biogeochemically coupled experiment are used to disentangle the eCO2(ind)
    signal for the historical and scenario periods30 (Table 2, details in Methods).
    To further evaluate the robustness of model-based results, we retrieve the eCO2(ind)
    term from satellite observations (hereafter eCO2(ind)obs) through a statistical
    methodology within the climate analog framework (Methods). We complement the analyses
    by deriving eCO2(dir) through multiple non-linear regression, incorporating CO2
    and climate drivers, and exploring its relationship with eCO2(ind) across time
    and space. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of eCO2(ind) on land aridity
    to elucidate the underlying eco-hydrological mechanisms. Table 1 Information of
    CMIP6 ESMs used in this study Full size table Table 2 Description of CMIP6 factorial
    simulations Full size table Results Temporal change in the indirect effect of
    eCO2 An ensemble of historical simulations from seven CMIP6 models (CMIP6SMA,
    SMA: simple model averaging) shows that global eCO2(ind) during the period 2000–2014
    is significantly (p < 0.05, t test) lower than that during 1982–1996 (Fig. 1a,
    b). Averaged across the global vegetated areas, eCO2(ind) simulated by CMIP6 models
    decreases from 0.24 ± 0.32 gC m−2 ppm−1 (mean ± s.e.) during 1982–1996 to −0.04 ± 0.24 gC m−2 ppm−1
    during 2000–2014 (Fig. 1a, b). The emergence of negative eCO2(ind) during 2000–2014
    suggests the recent upsurge of climate stresses on the global vegetation carbon
    uptake, which is in agreement with the negative contribution of climate change
    on global GPP trend after 2000s reported in previous literature31. Remarkable
    differences in changes in eCO2(ind) emerge across geographic areas and climatological
    gradients. Cold and dry climate zones experience a prominent decline in eCO2(ind).
    The statistically significant decreasing signal is mostly in boreal regions (16.8%
    of global vegetated land with p < 0.05) with hot spots in eastern Canada, Scandinavia,
    and south-central Siberia (Fig. 1c, d). Warm and wet climate zones show an opposite
    tendency with more limited significant patterns (9.9% of global vegetated land
    with p < 0.05) (Fig. 1c, d). Fig. 1: Historical variations in the indirect effect
    of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) on vegetation carbon uptake.

    Corresponding interquartile ranges of CMIP6SMA simulation are shown as shaded
    bands. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image In parallel,
    we used satellite retrievals of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)
    as a proxy of observed GPP32 to further verify the robustness of the signals derived
    from model simulations. The satellite-observed eCO2(ind)obs was disentangled from
    the other confounding effects through a climate analog approach33, based on the
    identification of years with similar climate and distinct atmospheric CO2 concentration
    (details in Methods). Observation-based results confirm a global weakening effect
    of eCO2-driven climate change on GPP between the two periods (2000–2014 versus
    1982–1996), with an overall change in eCO2(ind)obs of −0.38 gC m−2 ppm−1. We also
    found a good agreement between model-based and observation-based results in terms
    of spatial patterns emerging across climatological and latitudinal gradients (Fig.
    1d–f). A comprehensive set of experiments was additionally performed to test whether
    our model-based results were potentially affected by the data source, temporal
    window length, and the criteria used to define the growing season (Supplementary
    Text 1 and 2; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, and Table 1). Meanwhile, analyses replicated
    by using the kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) as an alternative
    satellite GPP proxy were also performed to further verify the robustness of our
    results (Supplementary Text 3; Supplementary Fig. 3). Altogether, these results
    univocally show a substantial reduction of the indirect effect of eCO2 at the
    global scale (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figs. 1–3) and particularly in the Northern
    Hemisphere (Fig. 1d–f and Supplementary Fig. 3c). Such patterns agree with the
    weakening temperature-vegetation relationship in northern ecosystems documented
    in previous literature22, and appear plausibly influenced by the increasing water
    limitation (Supplementary Fig. 4). eCO2(ind) is expected to further decline in
    all investigated future temporal periods under the SSP5-8.5 scenario to the point
    that the global mean could persistently settle on negative values (Fig. 2a). Five
    out of seven individual ESMs agree that eCO2-driven climate change will exert
    a negative role on the global vegetation carbon uptake for the period 2086–2100,
    albeit the inter-model spread is considerable (Supplementary Fig. 5a). For the
    period 2086–2100, the global eCO2(ind)—as estimated by CMIP6SMA—is projected to
    decrease significantly by 0.36 gC m−2 ppm−1 compared to the analogous estimate
    derived for the period 1982–1996 (p < 0.01, t test) (Fig. 2a). Such decreasing
    signal appears statistically significant (p < 0.05) over 46.5% of global vegetated
    land and prominently in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 2b,c). The global declining
    signal is partially dampened by opposite increasing patterns mainly occurring
    along the equatorial belt, which, however manifest statistically significant over
    a smaller extent (32.7%). Fig. 2: Projection of future variations in indirect

    Full size image To derive a more comprehensive picture of the terrestrial ecosystem
    response to eCO2-driven climate change, we explored the temporal change in the
    strength of indirect CO2 effect on carbon release by respiration (Supplementary
    Fig. 6), and on the net ecosystem carbon uptake (eCO2(ind)-NEP, Fig. 2d, e) through
    factorial experiments of CMIP6 ESMs. We estimated a global eCO2(ind)-NEP of −0.02 gC m−2 ppm−1
    during the whole historical period (1982–2014), which is consistent with previous
    findings about the negative carbon-climate feedback from the land’s perspective
    (i.e., positive from the atmosphere’s perspective)34. In pace with the attenuation
    of the indirect effect on total vegetation carbon uptake (Fig. 2a), global eCO2(ind)-NEP
    is projected to decrease from 0.05 ± 0.12 gC m−2 ppm−1 during 1982–1996 to −0.05 ± 0.03 gC m−2 ppm−1
    during 2086–2100 (inset box in Fig. 2d). The smaller decline in eCO2(ind)-NEP
    compared to that in eCO2(ind) (−0.1 versus −0.36 gC m−2 ppm−1) suggests the concurrently
    reduced influence on ecosystem respiration and its consequent offsetting effect.
    The latitudinal gradient of the changes in eCO2(ind)-NEP between the two periods
    is largely concordant with the one derived from the changes in eCO2(ind), thus
    reflecting similar spatial dependences on environmental factors (Fig. 2b–e). Relationship
    between the indirect and direct effects of eCO2 To quantify the relative importance
    of indirect versus direct effects of eCO2 in regulating vegetation carbon uptake,
    simulated and observed eCO2(dir) was derived based on a multiple non-linear regression
    (Methods) (i.e., CMIP6SMA and obs-RM in Fig. 3a). The analyses were complemented
    by two additional independent estimates of eCO2(dir) based on factorial experiments
    of CanESM5 (i.e., CanESM5-FE in Fig. 3a), and on the climate analog approach applied
    to observational datasets (i.e., obs in Fig. 3a) (details in Methods). We found
    that along with the decrease in eCO2(ind), global eCO2(dir) has dropped as well
    in recent years and is expected to further decline in the coming decades (Fig.
    3a). Model results based on factorial experiments and non-linear regression show
    a strong reduction in global eCO2(dir) between the periods 2000–2014 and 1982–1996,
    largely in agreement with satellite-derived estimates (Fig. 3a). Nevertheless,
    the magnitude of the decline simulated by CMIP6SMA (−0.44 gC m−2 ppm−1, or −22.8%)
    is clearly lower than the analogous estimate derived from satellite product (obs:
    −1.20 gC m−2 ppm−1 or −78.3%; obs-RM: −1.65 gC m−2 ppm−1 or −67.0%) and from dedicated
    factorial experiments (CanESM5-FE: −1.38 gC m−2 ppm−1 or −69.2%) (Fig. 3a). While
    we recognized the intrinsic difficulties of disentangling drivers and producing
    robust causal attribution in observation-based analysis, we argued the emerging
    differences between models and observations could be partially attributable to
    the simplifying assumptions of CMIP6 models. Fig. 3: Relationship between direct

    shown by diamond symbol and whiskers. Bars in green and orange represent the relative

    eCO2(ind) and increase in eCO2(dir) and so on. The legend shows the fraction of
    vegetated areas for each thematic class (i.e., “– –”, “– +”, “+ –”, and “+ +”).

    = values of 10th and 90th percentiles. Source data are provided as a Source Data
    file. Full size image Under the investigated SSP5-8.5 scenario, the relative importance
    of eCO2(ind) and eCO2(dir) for the terrestrial carbon cycle is expected to vary
    greatly. The relative contribution of eCO2(ind) to the net effect of eCO2 (i.e.,
    eCO2(net), the sum of eCO2(dir) and eCO2(ind)) will likely decrease from 11.1%
    (1982–11996) to −22.6% (2086–12100) (Fig. 3b). On the contrary, the relative contribution
    of eCO2(dir) is projected to increase, mainly due to the higher relative decreasing
    rate of eCO2(ind). However, in view of the expected progressive decline in both
    eCO2(ind) and eCO2(dir), eCO2(net) could become negative, and eCO2(ind) could
    emerge as the dominant driver of the future temporal dynamic of GPP. Some regions
    of the globe, such as central Canada, northern Amazon, and western and southern
    Africa, could exhibit a dominant role of eCO2(ind) by the end of 21st century
    (Supplementary Fig. 7). A detailed analysis suggests that the negative eCO2(ind)
    will overcome the positive eCO2(dir) over 30.3% of global vegetated land by 2041–12055,
    and over 48.0% by 2086–12100 (Supplementary Fig. 8). These results agree with
    previous studies which have emphasized the expected net negative role of eCO2
    on the terrestrial carbon uptake as a result of the increasing detrimental impacts
    of climate change on vegetation and a saturating CO2 fertilization13. Results
    reveal that 66.9% of global vegetated land could experience the same direction
    of changes in eCO2(ind) and eCO2(dir) (i.e., “+ +” and “– –” in Fig. 3c) between
    the historical (1982–11996) and future (2086–2100, SSP5-8.5) period, while the
    remaining 33.1% could manifest reverse directions of changes (i.e., “+ –” and
    “– +”). The concurrent decrease in eCO2(ind) and eCO2(dir) (“– –”) appears to
    be the most pervasive case (48.5%), particularly over northern latitudes (Fig.
    3c). Averaged across regions with simultaneous reductions in eCO2(ind) and eCO2(dir),
    changes in eCO2(ind) and eCO2(dir) explain 47.9% and 52.1% of reduction in net
    CO2 effect on growing-season GPP (−4.87 gC m−2 ppm−1), respectively (Fig. 3d).
    Such concurrent decrease in eCO2(ind) and eCO2(dir) is also reflected in the sharper
    decrease in eCO2(net) in northern lands (−2.69 gC m−2 ppm−1, or −82.0%) between
    the historical and future periods compared to the global mean (−1.65 gC m−2 ppm−1,
    or −75.7%), as estimated by CMIP6SMA (Supplementary Table 2). Additional analyses
    based on model simulations from the idealized 1% per year increasing CO2 experiments
    show spatial patterns and trends in both indirect and direct CO2 effects at the
    global mean level similar to those described above (Supplementary Text 4; Supplementary
    Figs. 9–11). Meanwhile, under such idealized scenario where radiatively-coupled
    mode is available, estimates of direct CO2 effect based on the non-linear regression
    framework and those based on the climate analog approach were carefully compared
    against those obtained directly from factorial experiments (Supplementary Text
    4). The high agreement among the three sets of estimates further supports the
    validity of our multiple non-linear regression framework and of the climate analog
    approach (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). GPP in the Northern Hemisphere has increased
    steadily during the past decades35 in response to the large and positive eCO2(ind)
    and eCO2(dir) (Supplementary Fig. 14), thus playing a critical contribution to
    the global terrestrial carbon sink36,37. Therefore, the widespread and strong
    decrease in both indirect and direct effects of eCO2 in the Northern Hemisphere
    resulting from our analyses rises concern about the future dynamic of the regional
    carbon sink and its capacity to keep the pace of anthropogenic emissions. Mechanisms
    behind the decline in the indirect effect of eCO2 To disentangle the possible
    mechanisms responsible for the declining eCO2(ind), we explored its relationship
    with the expected changes in terrestrial water availability. To this aim, we first
    exploited the CMIP6 simulations to quantify the spatiotemporal variations in aridity
    conditions, here expressed in terms of surface (0–10 cm) soil moisture (SMsurf).
    Results indicate a projected widespread decline in terrestrial water availability
    by the end of the century compared to the current conditions (82.6% of global
    vegetated land exposed to a reduction in SMsurf, Fig. 4a). At the global level
    and based on multi-model means (i.e., CMIP6SMA), we estimated a significant decrease
    in SMsurf during 2086–2100 by 7.3% (p < 0.01, t-test) compared to analogous estimates
    obtained for the period 1982–1996 (Fig. 4b). Similar drying patterns emerge for
    individual model runs (Supplementary Fig. 15), for total soil moisture (SMtotal),
    for a widely used aridity index (defined as the ratio of annual precipitation
    to potential evapotranspiration, P/PET) (Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17). Previous
    studies focusing on dryness indices38 and hydrological regimes39,40 further corroborate
    such drying trends. Fig. 4: Sensitivity of indirect CO2 effect on terrestrial
    water availability. a Spatial pattern of relative change in surface soil moisture
    (SMsurf) between the historical and future periods (2086–2100 versus 1982–1996)

    statistically significant (t test, p < 0.05). Dots are spaced 3° in both latitude
    and longitude, and statistics were computed over 9° × 9° spatial moving windows.

    c Difference in indirect effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2)

    (eCO2(ind)) between the periods 1982–1996 and 2000–2014 derived from CMIP6SMA,
    binned as a function of corresponding changes in SMsurf and mean annual SMsurf
    (Supplementary Fig. 4a). SMsurf = 0.26 m3 m−3 (i.e., the green solid line) overall
    corresponds to the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration
    (P/PET) = 1 at the mean annual scale, that is the threshold between non-humid
    and humid regions (Supplementary Fig. 17b). Black dots indicate bins with differences
    that are statistically significant (t test, p < 0.05). d Same as c, but for the
    difference between the periods 1982–1996 and 2086−2100. Source data are provided
    as a Source Data file. Full size image To investigate the relationship between
    change in eCO2(ind) and land surface drying/wetting, we averaged the change in
    eCO2(ind) across gradients of mean annual SMsurf during 1982–1996 and the corresponding
    change in SMsurf (i.e., 2000–2014 versus 1982–1996, and 2086–2100 versus 1982–1996).
    SMsurf = 0.26 m3 m−3 generally corresponds to P/PET = 1 at the mean annual scale
    (Supplementary Fig. 17b), which is widely treated as the threshold between non-humid
    and humid regions41,42. We found that eCO2(ind) generally declines (enhances)
    with the land drying (wetting) in humid regions (SMsurf > 0.26 m3 m−3, Supplementary
    Fig. 4a) in both historical and scenario simulations (Fig. 4c, d). However, in
    water-limited conditions (SMsurf < 0.26 m3 m−3), the weakened negative eCO2(ind)
    along with the land drying results in a negative relationship between changes
    in eCO2(ind) and SMsurf (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 7). CO2 and drought-related
    enhancement in growing-season water-use efficiency (WUE) (Supplementary Fig. 18),
    relax the water limitation to vegetation growth, especially over semi-arid climate
    zones24,43,44,45, and may consequently limit the negative trend in eCO2(ind) (Fig.
    4d). In addition, for water-limited environments, a decrease in eCO2(ind) occurs
    consistently under both land drying and wetting, indicating the possible importance
    of other factors, such as vegetation type and species diversity, in modulating
    the vegetation response to climate change. Similar sensitivities to increasing
    water limitation have been obtained using SMtotal and P/PET in place of SMsurf
    and referring to different temporal window lengths (Supplementary Figs. 16, 17,
    and 19). Such high consistency demonstrates the substantial independence of our
    results on the proxy of terrestrial water availability and the selection of time-window
    length. Discussion Our study provides multiple and coherent evidence that the
    indirect effect of eCO2 on global vegetation carbon uptake via associated climate
    change has declined over the last three decades (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig.
    3). The signal of the ongoing trends has been derived both from Earth system models’
    simulations and from satellite observations using a statistical approach to disentangle
    direct and indirect CO2 effects from time series analysis. In addition, results
    show that the positive indirect effect of eCO2 that has stimulated the global
    GPP in recent years will most likely continue to decline in the future, particularly
    in northern high latitudes, and turn into negative values firmly under the high
    CO2 emission scenario (Fig. 2). This epochal change in the sign of the indirect
    CO2 effect may lead to a positive land carbon-climate feedback from the atmosphere’s
    perspective34,46. The interpretation of the CO2 effects mediated by climate change
    is intrinsically complex because primary productivity is controlled by different
    environmental drivers in the different biomes, like low temperature in the boreal
    regions, incoming radiation in the humid tropics, or water availability in the
    arid regions27. For this reason, analyses have to address multiple factors and
    their interactions at once28,47. However, previous assessments were largely based
    on the analysis of a single climatic factor (e.g., temperature22, water availability48,
    and VPD23), while our study presents an attempt to integrate multiple drivers
    across the different World regions. For instance, the strong signal emerging in
    the boreal regions (Figs. 1f and 2c) can be partially attributable to the weakening
    temperature-vegetation relationship in northern ecosystems22, which may be related
    to the non-linear response of photosynthesis to temperature, increased extreme
    heat, increasing water limitation driven by the anticipation of phenology49 and
    expansion of woody shrubs50,51. Our assessment shows that the increasing water
    limitation is a critical driver of the weakened indirect effect of eCO2 on the
    global vegetation carbon uptake (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 16, 17 and 19).
    This phenomena may be driven by the detrimental effect of water scarcity on the
    resilience of global vegetation to climate variability and extremes52. An exception
    to this pattern occurs in water-limited environments, where the negative indirect
    effect of eCO2 seems to weaken with the land drying (Fig. 4c, d), probably due
    to the enhancement of direct CO2 effect on WUE and the resulting mitigating effect
    on water constraints24 (Supplementary Fig. 18). A recent analysis focusing on
    global forests suggests that WUE and aridity index are closely and negatively
    related below a threshold value of aridity index≈153, partly supporting our finding.
    The complex interplay between the rapid changes in climate conditions and the
    increasing risks of natural disturbances may also contribute to the transition
    from positive to negative indirect CO2 effects. For example, warmer and drier
    conditions facilitate insect outbreaks, while warmer and wetter conditions increase
    disturbance from pathogens54. The expected intensification of disturbances may
    amplify the negative effect of climate change on primary productivity by enhancing
    plant vulnerability and mortality rates55. However, the abovementioned processes
    have not yet been fully considered in state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models
    and ESMs that are used in major climate assessments like the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports56,57. The simplified representation
    of disturbances and mortality in these models may ultimately hamper our full understanding
    of the ongoing and future variations in carbon-climate feedback, and in turn,
    lead to the overestimation of the future terrestrial carbon sink due to the misestimation
    of the indirect effect of eCO2. In fact, our study shows that CMIP6 model simulations
    clearly report a lower magnitude of the decline in global indirect CO2 effect
    during the historical period compared with observation-based estimates (Fig. 1f).
    This could be attributable to the poor representation of water limitation and
    natural disturbances in current ESMs, the limited consideration of vegetation
    mortality associated with biotic agents and the non-linearity of the processes
    behind57,58. Considering that disturbance regimes are expected to intensify in
    many parts of the globe because of climate change54,58,59, the enhanced representation
    of the phenomena in ESMs would plausibly produce an even stronger decline in the
    global projection of the indirect CO2 effect. The weakened indirect effect of
    eCO2 reported here, in addition to the concurrent decline in direct physiological
    effect, confirms the transitory nature of the strong growth benefits induced by
    climate warming and CO2 fertilization, especially in the boreal regions9,60. These
    findings are in accordance with the expectation about the future saturation of
    CO2 fertilization effect and the increasingly negative effect of climate change
    on vegetation13. More importantly, the simultaneous reductions in indirect and
    direct effects of eCO2 imply that eCO2 may exert a less positive up to negative
    role on the terrestrial carbon uptake in the future (Fig. 3), consequently reducing
    the ecosystems’ capacity to sequester atmospheric CO2. These phenomena may ultimately
    lead to an acceleration of climate change in the second part of the century, further
    challenging the efforts of humanity toward carbon neutrality. In addition, more
    frequent and severe climate extremes in a warming climate61,62, e.g., increasing
    drought conditions, may further aggravate the decline in the indirect effect of
    eCO2 (Fig. 4) as well as that in direct CO2 fertilization63. The intensification
    of a positive feedback loop between climate change and land CO2 emission undoubtedly
    would limit the potential of terrestrial ecosystems to serve as carbon sinks and
    have great implications for the efficacy of land-based mitigation policies and
    for the societal efforts required for meeting climate mitigation targets. In this
    respect, our results contribute to a better understanding of global change impacts
    on terrestrial ecosystems under current and future conditions, and meanwhile,
    may help the development of more integrated and realistic mitigation strategies,
    by informing climate policies on the weakening of the fertilization effects of
    eCO2 and associated amplification of climate warming. Methods CMIP6 simulations
    To explore the indirect effect of eCO2 on vegetation carbon uptake, we used outputs
    from an ensemble of seven Earth system models (ESMs) that participate in the carbon-climate
    feedback experiment (C4MIP) within the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)30 (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/): ACCESS-ESM1-5,
    CanESM5, CNRM-ESM2-1, E3SM-1-1, MIROC-ES2L, MRI-ESM2-0, and UKESM1-0-LL (Table
    1). These models were selected because they provide simulations under different
    coupling modes required to disentangle the effects of eCO2. We focused on the
    SSP5-8.5 scenario because C4MIP simulations are available only for the highest
    emission trajectory (CO2 concentration is projected to reach 1135 ppm in 210064).
    The ESMs have full carbon cycles, which include carbon uptake by vegetation that
    varies in response to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate46.
    For each ESM, one biogeochemically-coupled experiment and one fully-coupled experiment
    in both historical (1982–2014) and future scenario (2015–2100) periods were analyzed
    within a factorial simulation framework (Table 2). In biogeochemically coupled
    experiments (“hist-bgc” and “ssp585-bgc” in the CMIP6 terminology), biogeochemical
    processes over land respond to eCO2, whereas the radiative code experiences fixed
    CO2. In the fully-coupled experiment (“historical” and “ssp585” in the CMIP6 terminology),
    both radiative and biogeochemical processes respond to eCO2 (consistent with observations
    in the historical period). All other forcings (e.g., non-CO2 greenhouse gases,
    aerosols, and land use) are identical for these two sets of experiments, i.e.,
    time-varying in both radiative and biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, we used
    outputs from CO2 individual forcing experiment (“hist-CO2” in the CMIP6 terminology)
    conducted by the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP)65
    (Table 2). “hist-CO2” experiment refers to the historical simulation driven only
    by observed changes in CO2 concentration, with other forcings keeping temporally
    constant (e.g., non-CO2 greenhouses gases, aerosols, and land use). Combining
    “hist-CO2” with “historical” and “hist-bgc” enables to quantify the historical
    eCO2(dir) through factorial simulations of CMIP6 runs. Unfortunately, CO2 individual
    forcing experiment has not yet been extended to the future period, and only one
    ESM (i.e., CanESM5) took part in all three experiments. Because of these disadvantages,
    the abovementioned analysis applied for the estimation of global direct effects
    of eCO2 was complemented by a more general regression framework extendible to
    the full ESM ensemble and to the different temporal periods (details in section
    “Quantifying indirect and direct effects of eCO2 by model outputs”). Factorial
    simulations based on the abovementioned experiments (“hist-bgc”, “historical”,
    and “hist-CO2”) were elaborated in the following sections. A set of variables
    generated by ESM simulations were used for the following analyses, including:
    monthly scale gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), autotrophic
    respiration (Ra), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), evapotranspiration (ET), maximum,
    minimum and mean air temperature (Tmax, Tmin, and T), precipitation (P), cloud
    cover (CL), relative humidity (RH), surface (0–10 cm) soil moisture (SMsurf, 0–10 cm),
    and total soil moisture (SMtotal, depth depending on models, see Table 1). Considering
    that the hydrologically active soil depth varies greatly among the models (from
    2 m in UKESM1-0-LL to 35.18 m in E3SM-1-1), SMtotal as well as SMsurf was converted
    from the original gravimetric unit (kg m−2) to volumetric unit (m3 m−3) by dividing
    the gravimetric soil water content by the corresponding soil depth, Such conversion
    allows for the comparison of results obtained from different models and the development
    of more robust multi-model ensembles of soil moisture. Variations in SMtotal and
    SMsurf were expressed in relative terms (%) with respect to their average values
    computed for the baseline period (e.g., 1982–1996)39 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
    Figs. 4, 15 and 16). Only for the ES3M-1-1 model, some of the abovementioned variables
    were not provided (NPP, Tmax, Tmin, and RH), and therefore they were retrieved
    by empirical formula and statistical approach (additional details reported in
    Supplementary Text 5). We additionally derived ecosystem respiration (Reco) as
    the sum of Ra and Rh, and the net ecosystem production (NEP) was calculated as
    the difference between GPP and Reco66. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which directly
    relates to atmospheric water demand19,67, was calculated based on Abbott and Tabony68
    for each grid-cell as follows: $${{{{{\\rm{VPD}}}}}}=0.6108{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}^{\\frac{17.27{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}+237.3}}\\left(1-\\frac{{{{{{\\rm{RH}}}}}}}{100}\\right)$$
    (1) where T is given in °C, and the resulting VPD is in kPa. Furthermore, we used
    the ratio of mean annual P to potential evapotranspiration (PET) as the aridity
    index retrieved from the FAO Penman-Monteith algorithm69. Details on the PET estimation
    are reported in Supplementary Text 6. CMIP6 outputs were resampled to a common
    0.5° × 0.5° global grid-cell using the bilinear method of interpolation. Moreover,
    for each temporal window (e.g., 1982–1996, 2000–2014, 2086–2100, and 1982–2014),
    we computed the associated multi-year mean growing season at the grid-cell scale.
    The growing season was defined as the period spanning months with average T > 0°C14
    and—limitedly to arid and semi-arid ecosystems—cumulative P between 10% and 90%
    of the annual total P (Supplementary Fig. 20). The integration of a P threshold
    in the definition of the growing season for water-limited environments enables
    to account for possible inactive vegetation phase at T > 0 °C due to water deficit
    conditions70. Areas characterized by an aridity index, quantified in terms of
    P/PET, <1 were labeled as arid and semi-arid ecosystems9. For arid and semi-arid
    grid cells located in the Southern Hemisphere, P accumulation was set to start
    in July and end in June of the next year. The resulting growing season was used
    as a reference period to aggregate the original monthly variables provided by
    CMIP6 to the growing-season scale. The robustness of our results is tested with
    respect to two alternative definitions of the growing season period: (1) T > 5 °C
    and cumulative P between 10% and 90% of the annual total P; (2) T > 5°C and cumulative
    P between 20% and 80% of the annual total P (Supplementary Fig. 2). In both cases,
    the P threshold is applied to arid and semi-arid regions only. Observation-based
    products We exploited the long-term GPP dataset (hereafter GPPobs) based on near-infrared
    reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) retrieved from the Advanced Very High Resolution
    Radiometer (AVHRR) reflectance observations32,71 (https://data.tpdc.ac.cn/en/data/d6dff40f-5dbd-4f2d-ac96-55827ab93cc5/).
    The satellite GPP dataset, provided at monthly temporal resolution and at 0.05°
    spatial resolution, has global coverage and spans the period 1982–2014 (Supplementary
    Fig. 21a). It has been largely validated in previous studies against ground measurements
    and compared with estimates derived from machine-learning upscaling approaches,
    light-use-efficiency models and processed-based models32,72. To match the spatial
    and temporal resolution of ESMs output, satellite GPP data were resampled to 0.5°
    and integrated over the growing season derived from the CMIP6 simulations in the
    fully-coupled experiment, as described above, to increase consistency in the data-model
    comparison (Supplementary Fig. 20). The obtained satellite-based growing season
    GPP data were used to evaluate the ESMs performance in capturing global GPP dynamics
    (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23). Furthermore, to explore the observed impact of
    eCO2 on vegetation carbon uptake (details in the following sections), we used
    monthly Tmax, Tmin, T, P, CL, actual water vapor (VP), and PET retrieved from
    the Climatic Research Unit (CRU v4.05) climate dataset73 (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/)
    delivered for the whole globe at 0.5° spatial resolution and covering the period
    1982–2014. We additionally derived monthly VPD values as the difference between
    the saturated vapor pressure (SVP) and VP for each grid-cell based on the following
    formulation: $${{{{{\\rm{VPD}}}}}}=0.6108{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}^{\\frac{17.27{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}+237.3}}-{{{{{\\rm{VP}}}}}}$$
    (2) where T is given in °C, VP and VPD are in kPa. Here we applied Eq. (2) instead
    of Eq. (1) to estimate VPD because RH is not available from the CRU dataset. All
    climatic factors were then aggregated at the growing-season temporal resolution.
    We derived a global vegetated land mask from the annual land cover maps of the
    European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative74 (https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org)
    acquired for the period 1992–2014 at 300 m spatial resolution, referring to a
    simplified aggregation scheme based on physiognomy alone. Land cover maps were
    resampled to 0.5° using the majority method to match the common spatial resolution.
    All grid cells (0.5 × 0.5° resolution) classified as vegetation class (including
    forest, grassland, shrubland, cropland, and wetland) throughout the 23 years were
    defined as vegetated areas and included in our analyses (Supplementary Fig. 24).
    Assessing indirect/direct effects of eCO2 from model outputs Following similar
    approaches reported in literature10,16,75,76, the effect of eCO2-induced climate
    change on growing-season GPP (i.e., the indirect effect of eCO2, expressed as
    eCO2(ind)) was derived from factorial simulations of multiple CMIP6 experiments
    by calculating the difference between the trend in growing-season GPP generated
    in the fully-coupled mode and that in the biogeochemically-coupled mode normalized
    by the increase rate of atmospheric CO2 concentration: $${{{{{{\\rm{eCO}}}}}}}_{2}({{{{{\\rm{ind}}}}}})=\\frac{{{{{{\\rm{\\delta
    }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{FULL}}}}}}}-{{{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{BGC}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{\\rm{\\delta
    }}}}}}{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}}$$ (3) where \\({{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{FULL}}}}}}}\\)
    and \\({{{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{BGC}}}}}}}\\)
    are the trends in growing-season GPP in the fully-coupled experiment (i.e., “historical”
    and “ssp585”) and the biogeochemically-coupled experiment (i.e., “hist-bgc” and
    “ssp585-bgc”), respectively; \\({{{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}\\)
    represents the trend in atmospheric CO2 concentration and is prescribed by CMIP664,77.
    The statistical significance of the trends was evaluated using the nonparametric
    Mann–Kendall test. The absolute signal (term \\({{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{FULL}}}}}}}-{{{{{{\\rm{\\delta
    }}}}}}{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{BGC}}}}}}}\\)) was normalized to the unit
    of gC m−2 ppm−1, to eliminate the impact of the difference in increasing rate
    of atmospheric CO2 concentration in various periods (e.g., 1982–1996, 2000−2014,
    and 2086–2100). The term eCO2(ind) excludes the direct physiological effect of
    eCO2 and the effects of non-CO2 forcing agents on GPP, as these components have
    been removed from the factorial simulations (Eq. (3)). The approach enabled us
    to separately quantify the eCO2(ind) for different reference temporal period (e.g.,
    1982−1996, 2000–2014, and 2086–2100) at grid-cell level. For global-scale eCO2(ind)
    estimates, the GPP terms reported in (Eq. (3)) were obtained by spatial average
    weighting each grid-cell value based on its area (Fig. 1a). The same methodology
    is applied consistently for all global-scale and regional-scale aggregated metrics
    described in the following sections. The analyses were complemented by applying
    Eq. (3) to NPP, Ra, Rh, Reco, and NEP (in place of GPP) to comprehensively evaluate
    the response of distinct carbon fluxes to CO2 radiative forcing (Fig. 2d, e and
    Supplementary Fig. 6). We quantified the direct effect of eCO2 on growing-season
    GPP (i.e., eCO2(dir)) within a multiple non-linear regression framework applied
    to simulations obtained from the CMIP6 fully-coupled experiment. Such approach
    was specifically designed since radiatively-coupled experiments ideally required
    to derived eCO2(dir) from factorial simulations were not available. To derive
    robust fitting functions, we first performed a collinearity test based on the
    variance inflation factor (VIF), to preliminary select what drivers to include
    in the multiple regression. Results show that CO2, Tmin, P, VPD, and CL, show
    no/weak collinearity (VIF < 10) in most parts of the globe (CRU: 97.0 ~ 100%;
    CMIPSMA: 86.7 ~ 100%) and thus were all retained in the predictor set (Supplementary
    Fig. 25). Considering that climate exerts non-linear control on terrestrial carbon
    uptake78,79, non-linear terms (e.g., interaction and quadratic terms) were incorporated
    into the regression model in addition to linear terms. Following the modeling
    framework described in Chen et al.80, we used stepwise regression at the grid-cell
    scale to reduce redundant predictors. The model form most often identified across
    all grid cells was ultimately adopted to each grid-cell, enabling a consistent
    analysis at the global scale. The adopted model is described by the following
    equation: $${{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}=\\beta \\left({{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}\\right)+{C}_{1}\\left({{{{{\\rm{P}}}}}}\\right)+{C}_{2}\\left({{{{{\\rm{VPD}}}}}}\\right)+{C}_{3}\\left({{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}}_{\\min
    }\\cdot {{{{{\\rm{VPD}}}}}}\\right)+{C}_{4}\\left({{{{{\\rm{P}}}}}}\\cdot {{{{{\\rm{CL}}}}}}\\right)+{C}_{5}+\\varepsilon$$
    (4) where β, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 represent the regression coefficients, and
    ε is the residual error term. Therein, β (gC m−2 ppm−1) refers to the sensitivity
    of GPP to CO2, and thus reflects the term eCO2(dir). Such an approach enabled
    us to disentangle the direct physiological effect of eCO2 on GPP by factoring
    out the potentially confounding effects of climatic factors. All variables in
    Eq. (4) were taken from CMIP6 model simulations under “historical” and “ssp585”
    experiments. Regressions were estimated on annual anomalies (i.e., annual values
    minus the mean signal for a given period) for all variables, thus removing the
    background effects on vegetation but preserving those originating from interannual
    variations9. We performed an additional set of modeling experiments to test the
    model sensitivity on different hydrological variables. To this aim, we expressed
    the interannual variations in GPP within a non-linear regression that incorporates
    soil moisture in place of P (details in Supplementary Text 7). Test results based
    on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the corrected Akaike Information Criterion
    (AICc), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) suggest that non-linear regression
    based on soil moisture has no substantial improvement in model performance (Supplementary
    Fig. 26) and leads to larger inter-model spread compared to the original one (i.e.,
    Eq. (4)) (Supplementary Fig. 27 and Table 3). We therefore retained the regression
    framework based on P as defined in Eq. (4) for subsequent analyses. For CanESM5,
    we estimated eCO2(dir) by the use of an alternative method based on the outputs
    from three sets of factorial experiments available for the historical period as
    follows: $${{{{{{\\rm{eCO}}}}}}}_{2}({{{{{\\rm{dir}}}}}})=\\frac{{{{{{\\rm{\\delta
    }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}2}-({{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{FULL}}}}}}}-{{{{{\\rm{\\delta
    }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{BGC}}}}}}})}{{{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}}$$
    (5) where \\({{{{{\\rm{\\delta }}}}}}{{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}2}\\)
    is the trend in growing-season GPP in the CO2 individual forcing experiment (“hist-CO2”).
    Estimates based on this approach were compared against those generated by the
    abovementioned regression model to test the robustness of Eq. (4) in quantifying
    global mean eCO2(dir) and its change (Fig. 3a). Deriving indirect effect of eCO2
    from observations To further corroborate our model-based findings, we investigated
    the direct and indirect components of eCO2 and their changes through an observation-based
    approach. The method is based on the pixel-level assessment of the changes in
    GPP under similar climate conditions but different atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
    For this purpose, we used the climate analog approach33 to identify couples of
    years with different atmospheric CO2 concentrations but similar climate conditions
    (i.e., climate analogous (CA) years) in each time period (e.g., 1982–1996, and
    2000−2014) based on the CRU v4.05 climate dataset. Temporal climate analogs are
    derived from the Mahalanobis distance, which is a multivariate distance independent
    of the scale of the climate variables81. For the period 1982−1996, as an example,
    we first identified the two sub-periods 1982–1988 and 1989–1996, and then identified
    for each grid-cell the years in which the climate condition is most similar between
    the two sub-periods. We calculated the Mahalanobis distance based on eleven climate
    variables derived from the CRU v4.05 dataset and identified as key determinants
    for climate analog analysis in previous studies33,81,82,83. The selected variables
    include: mean annual CL, mean annual VPD, mean annual T, total annual P, annual
    P/PET, mean T, and total P for December–February (DJF) and June-August (JJA),
    T seasonality (represented by the standard deviation of monthly T), and P seasonality
    (represented by the coefficient of variation in monthly P). In order to reduce
    the dimensionality of the data space, we applied a principal component analysis
    to all climate variables and discarded the principal components with variance
    <0.0133. The Mahalanobis distance was then computed between all the possible 56-member
    couples of years at the grid-cell scale based on the following equation: $${{{{{{\\rm{MD}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{ij}}}}}}}=\\sqrt{\\mathop{\\sum
    }\\nolimits_{k=1}^{N}\\frac{{\\left({x}_{{jk}}-{x}_{{ik}}\\right)}^{2}}{{\\sigma
    }_{k}^{2}}}$$ (6) where j and i belong to the first and second sub-period, respectively;
    xjm and xim are the values of the principal component k in the year j and i, N
    represents the number of retained principal components, and σk2 refers to the
    standard deviation of the principal component k. Low MD scores represent similar
    climate conditions between the two sub-periods, high MD scores the opposite. For
    each grid-cell, the minimum Mahalanobis distance (MDmin) was then selected, and
    its corresponding couple of years were identified as potential CA years. We assessed
    the statistical significance of the obtained MDmin. Considering that the chi distribution
    provides a null distribution for (non-squared) Mahalanobis distances, the obtained
    MDmin can be expressed probabilistically as percentiles of a chi distribution
    with degrees of freedom corresponding to the number of dimensions in which MDmin
    was measured (i.e., N in Eq. (6)). Following Mahony et al.33, we considered the
    95th percentile of the associated chi distribution to identify the upper threshold
    of the representative analog. MDmin whose corresponding percentile is lower than
    the abovementioned threshold, indicates a statistically similar climate between
    those two years (i.e., CA years). Climate analogs were found not significant for
    a minority of grid cells (4.2%), and these areas were therefore excluded from
    the following analyses. For the remaining grid cells, we estimated the direct
    physiological effect of eCO2 on GPP as follows: $${{{{{{{\\rm{eCO}}}}}}}_{2}({{{{{\\rm{dir}}}}}})}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}=\\frac{{\\Delta
    {{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{CA}}}}}}}}{\\Delta {{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}^{{{{{{\\rm{CA}}}}}}}}$$
    (7) where \\(\\Delta {{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{CA}}}}}}}\\)
    is the change in growing-season GPPobs computed between CA years, and \\(\\Delta
    {{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}^{{{{{{\\rm{CA}}}}}}}\\) is the corresponding variation
    in atmospheric CO2 concentration acquired from the Earth System Research Laboratory
    of NOAA84 (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/). The analysis was complemented
    by the estimation of the combined direct and indirect effect of eCO2 on GPP quantified
    as: $${{{{{{{\\rm{eCO}}}}}}}_{2}({{{{{\\rm{net}}}}}})}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}=\\frac{\\Delta
    {{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}}{\\Delta {{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}}$$
    (8) where \\(\\Delta {{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}\\) and \\(\\Delta
    {{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}\\) represent the change in the mean growing-season GPPobs
    and CO2 concentration, respectively, computed between the two sub-periods. We
    finally derived the observed indirect effect of eCO2 on vegetation photosynthesis
    via associated climate change in a given period by combining Eq. (7) and Eq. (8)
    as follows: $${{{{{{{\\rm{eCO}}}}}}}_{2}({{{{{\\rm{ind}}}}}})}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}=\\frac{\\Delta
    {{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}}{\\Delta {{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}}-\\frac{\\Delta
    {{{{{{\\rm{GPP}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{obs}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\\rm{CA}}}}}}}}{\\Delta {{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}}_{2}^{{{{{{\\rm{CA}}}}}}}}$$
    (9) The approach assumes that both direct and indirect eCO2 effects on GPP are
    annual and do not have legacy effects, and that eCO2 is the dominant factor of
    climate change in the short-term. The above-described analyses were carried out
    at the grid-cell scale and separately for the periods 1982–1996 and 2000–2014.
    Changes between the two periods were then used to quantify the historical variations
    in the indirect effect of eCO2 from observations (Fig. 1e, f). To further test
    the robustness of our methods, a set of additional experiments were produced.
    First, the observed direct effect of eCO2 was estimated using an alternative approach
    based on multiple non-linear regression model (i.e., Eq. (4)) in combination with
    CRU v4.05 climate dataset and GPPobs. The obtained results, expressed as eCO2(dir)obs-RM,
    were confronted with climate analog-derived eCO2(dir)obs estimates (i.e., obs-RM
    and obs in Fig. 3a). Second, the climate analog approach presented above and applied
    to observations was also implemented with CMIP6 model outputs in fully-coupled
    experiments to verify the consistency with results obtained from factorial simulations
    described in Eq. (3) (Supplementary Fig. 28). Statistical analysis To explore
    the dynamics of the indirect effect of eCO2 on vegetation carbon uptake during
    the historical period, we quantified the temporal changes in model-based eCO2(ind)
    and observation-based eCO2(ind)obs retrieved for the two independent periods 1982–1996
    and 2000–2014. The significance of the emerging changes was assessed through t
    test. Results presented in the main text refer to analyses conducted over 15-year
    time windows. Results obtained for different temporal window lengths (12 and 16
    years) are quantified as well to verify the robustness of our results (Fig. 1a
    and Supplementary Fig. 1). In exploring the projected changes in eCO2(ind) from
    CMIP6 model simulations, we refer to six 15-year consecutive and independent periods,
    namely 2011–2025, 2026–2040, 2041–2055, 2056–2070, 2071–2085, 2086–2100 (Fig.
    2a). We considered a series of not overlapped temporal windows to eliminate the
    possible impact of autocorrelation. To better disentangle the signal of future
    variation in eCO2(ind), we compared the eCO2(ind) during the last 15 years (2086–2100)
    against that one originating from the first 15 years of the historical period
    investigated here (1982–1996) and assessed the statistical significance of the
    change through t test. Furthermore, to properly represent the generality of the
    relationships between the direction and extent of changes in eCO2(ind) and local
    aridity conditions, we performed binned average analysis across environmental
    gradients. Such spatial averaging minimizes the uncertainty originating from spatial
    heterogeneity (e.g., the difference in topography and vegetation type) that may
    randomly affect the control of climate change on vegetation carbon uptake (Figs.
    1d and 4c, d). Data availability All datasets used in this study are publicly

  description: Discerning vulnerability differences among different aged trees to

    countermeasures for forest management in water-limited areas. An important species
    for afforestation in dry environments of northern China, Mongolian pine (Pinus
    sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) has recently exhibited growth decline and dieback
    on many sites, particularly pronounced in old-growth plantations. However, changes
    in response to drought stress by this species with age as well as the underlying
    mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, tree-ring data and remotely sensed
    vegetation data were combined to investigate variations in growth at individual
    tree and stand scales for young (9 − 13 years) and aging (35 − 52 years) plantations
    of Mongolian pine in a water-limited area of northern China. A recent decline
    in tree-ring width in the older plantation also had lower values in satellited-derived
    normalized difference vegetation indices and normalized difference water indices
    relative to the younger plantations. In addition, all measured growth-related
    metrics were strongly correlated with the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity
    index during the growing season in the older plantation. Sensitivity of growth
    to drought of the older plantation might be attributed to more severe hydraulic
    limitations, as reflected by their lower sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic
    conductivities. Our study presents a comprehensive view on changes of growth with
    age by integrating multiple methods and provides an explanation from the perspective
    of plant hydraulics for growth decline with age. The results indicate that old-growth
    Mongolian pine plantations in water-limited environments may face increased growth
    declines under the context of climate warming and drying.

    Abstract Discerning vulnerability differences among different aged trees to drought-driven
    growth decline or to mortality is critical to implement age-specific countermeasures
    for forest management in water-limited areas. An important species for afforestation
    in dry environments of northern China, Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica
    Litv.) has recently exhibited growth decline and dieback on many sites, particularly
    pronounced in old-growth plantations. However, changes in response to drought
    stress by this species with age as well as the underlying mechanisms are poorly
    understood. In this study, tree-ring data and remotely sensed vegetation data
    were combined to investigate variations in growth at individual tree and stand
    scales for young (9 − 13 years) and aging (35 − 52 years) plantations of Mongolian
    pine in a water-limited area of northern China. A recent decline in tree-ring
    width in the older plantation also had lower values in satellited-derived normalized
    difference vegetation indices and normalized difference water indices relative
    to the younger plantations. In addition, all measured growth-related metrics were
    strongly correlated with the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index during
    the growing season in the older plantation. Sensitivity of growth to drought of
    the older plantation might be attributed to more severe hydraulic limitations,
    as reflected by their lower sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivities.
    Our study presents a comprehensive view on changes of growth with age by integrating
    multiple methods and provides an explanation from the perspective of plant hydraulics
    for growth decline with age. The results indicate that old-growth Mongolian pine
    plantations in water-limited environments may face increased growth declines under
    the context of climate warming and drying. Similar content being viewed by others

    modulated growth resilience to drought in conifer forests on the Eastern Tibetan
    Plateau Article 26 September 2023 Introduction Tree growth decline and mortality
    have recently occurred across numerous ecosystems globally which are likely associated
    with increases in intensity and frequency of droughts (Allen et al. 2010; IPCC
    2013, 2021). Drought negatively affects growth and carbon sequestration capacity
    of forest ecosystems and hence can have a significant effect on the global carbon
    cycle (Ciais et al. 2005; Sippel et al. 2018). Endogenous processes related to
    age have been suggested as an important factor affecting variability of tree growth
    and its response to water availability (McMahon et al. 2010; Luo and Chen 2013;
    Chen et al. 2016). In the process of development, trees initially grow slowly,
    then have a period of increasing growth, followed by decreasing growth, all associated
    with changes of biological processes with aging (Fritts 1976). A number of studies
    have reported that the growth behavior of different aged trees reflected hydroclimate
    variability and this was linked to the changes in tree physiology with increasing
    age (Carrer and Urbinati 2004; Rozas et al. 2009; McDowell and Allen 2015). For
    example, evidence from natural forests in some high latitude areas indicated that
    old trees were more vulnerable to growth decline and mortality under drought stress
    than younger ones (Chen et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2021). In contrast, several dendroclimatological
    studies have shown that radial growth of younger trees is more likely to be affected
    by climate change relative to that of older trees (Carrer and Urbinati 2004; Rozas
    et al. 2009). A study investigating performance of a natural white spruce forest
    in western Canada found that recent climate drying led to growth decreases in
    both old and young trees (Hogg et al. 2017). However, few studies have examined
    changes in growth response to water availability across different ages in shelterbelts
    that are usually established in water deficit areas. Determining whether young
    or old trees are more susceptible to drought-related growth decline and underlying
    mechanisms is crucial to the construction and management of shelterbelts, as it
    can provide important information for making age-specific adaptation strategies.
    Variations of tree growth performances under drought are closely associated with
    changes of xylem hydraulic behavior (Tyree 2003; Choat et al. 2018). For example,
    canopy conductance decreases under climate warming and drying through increasing
    vapour pressure deficits which would adversely affect photosynthesis and growth
    (Whitehead and Jarvis 1981; McDowell and Allen 2015). In addition, taller old-growth
    trees enduring greater resistance in water transport because of longer hydraulic
    paths faced higher risks of growth decline or mortality, compared with shorter,
    younger trees (Enquist 2003; Petit et al. 2011; McDowell and Allen 2015). Older,
    taller trees are thus considered more subject to growth decline or even mortality
    associated with severe hydraulic limitations, particularly given a drier future
    climate (Bennett et al. 2015). An increasing number of studies have reported growth
    decline and death linked to drought across different biomes. Large, old individuals
    were the main victims that influenced the sustainable development of forests as
    well as their capacity for carbon sequestration (Allen et al. 2010; Ryan 2015;
    Gora and Esquivel-Muelbert 2021). As for different aged shelterbelts in water-limited
    areas, investigating temporal changes of growth performance with age and clarifying
    underlying mechanisms from the perspective of plant hydraulics will provide important
    information for the management of mature forests vulnerable to water stress. Tree-ring
    analysis provides an ideal approach to explore long-term variations in radial
    growth on an annual time scale in their response to environmental factors (Fritts
    1976). Using dendroclimatology, the temporal variability of tree growth covering
    the entire life cycle can be revealed, which will be beneficial for characterizing
    differences of growth performances at various ages and identifying underlying
    causes (Fritts 1976; Schweingruber 1988). However, this method focuses on growth
    performance in the transverse direction of the trunk for individual trees and
    is often restricted to tree growth behavior in a limited number of sites (Schweingruber
    1988; Cook and Kairiukstis 1990). Compared with tree-ring data, time series remote-sensing
    vegetation indices (VIs) based on spectral reflectance measurements of satellite
    images can be used to monitor temporal changes and spatial patterns of canopy
    conditions at the stand level as well as aboveground productivity at regional
    and even global levels (West et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2021). Among the VIs, the
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is most commonly used for examining
    the vegetation greenness at a canopy scale under environmental stress (Tucker
    1979). In recent decades, NDVI has been used successfully to monitor drought impacts
    on vegetation growth at regional, continental, and global scales (Kogan 1990;
    Karnieli et al. 2010; Vicente-Serrano et al. 2013; Ukkola et al. 2021). The normalized
    difference water index (NDWI), another vegetation index, is sensitive to fluctuations
    of vegetation moisture condition and commonly serves as a surrogate of canopy
    water content (Gao 1996; Chen et al. 2005; Ji et al. 2011). The combination of
    NDVI and NDWI makes it possible to examine the relationship between vegetation
    growth status and water content that would help to reveal the underlying mechanisms
    behind the fluctuations of canopy vitality. Both tree-ring parameters and time
    series VIs have been widely used for investigating long-term growth and their
    response to climate variability, with focus respectively on individual tree and
    forest canopy scales. However, little research has attempted to combine these
    two methods (Kannenberg et al. 2019). Examining tree growth from different spatial
    scales by integrating multiple methods, i.e., tree-ring and remote-sensing analyses,
    would help to detect signs of tree growth decline and comprehensively assess forest
    dynamics for shelterbelts established in water-deficit areas. Mongolian pine (Pinus
    sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) is widely used for establishing shelterbelts
    in water-deficit areas of northern China (Zhang et al. 2005a). However, in these
    areas, the species is vulnerable to growth decline and mortality when it reaches
    30 − 35 years old (below its lifespan of 150 − 200 years in its natural areas),
    a phenomenon called “premature aging” (Song et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2016). A recent
    study attributed the decrease in radial growth in introduced areas to increasing
    water stress with aging and explained the mechanisms behind this phenomenon from
    the view of xylem hydraulics (Liu et al. 2018). However, less is known about the
    responses of growth to water availability at the stand level, as well as the response
    across different ages for this species, hindering a more comprehensive understanding
    on forest response to water stress with increasing stand age. In this study, both
    dendroclimatological analysis and remotely sensed Vis were used to investigate
    growth changes to drought in relation to changes in xylem hydraulics in two age
    groups (9 − 13 years and 35 − 52 years) of Mongolian pine plantations in a water-limited
    area of northern China. It was hypothesized that: (1) interannual variations in
    tree-rings and of remotely sensed VIs were coupled in both older and younger plantations;
    (2) both tree-ring values and remotely sensed VIs were more sensitive to drought
    in older plantations; and, (3) xylem hydraulic conductivities decreased in the
    older Mongolian pine trees. Materials and methods Description of study area and
    tree species The study area is located in the southern part of the Horqin Sandy
    Land in northern China. This region has a temperate continental monsoon climate
    with a May to September growing season receiving 85% of the annual precipitation
    (Fig. S1 in Online Appendix). Annual total precipitation was 512 mm and mean temperature
    7.6 °C during 1953 − 2020 according to climate records from the Zhangwu meteorological
    station (42.42°N, 122.53°E) from the China Meteorological Administration. The
    forest vegetation is composed of a number species used for afforestation such
    as Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv., Pinus tabulaeformis Carr., Pinus densiflora
    Siebold & Zucc. var. zhangwuensis Zhang and Yuan, Populus simonii Carr., Populus
    alba ''Berolinensis'' L., and several native species (e.g., Ulmus pumila L., Phellodendron
    amurense Rupr.) that are naturally distributed. Historically, this region has
    been alternately occupied by forest-steppes and deserts under the influences of
    both climate fluctuations and human activities (Feng and Jiang 1996). Under increasing
    drought, grazing and aggressive land reclamation, native forests and grasslands
    were gradually transformed into desert lands from the late nineteenth century
    to the early twentieth century (Tao 1987). Massive reforestation programs organized
    by the government since the 1950s have returned parts of the desert lands back
    to forest that effectively curtailed further extension of deserts and protected
    the ecological environment of urban settlements in surrounding areas (Zhu et al.
    2016). Mongolian pine is a variety of Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in eastern
    Asia. Because of its ability in resisting drought and adapting to sandy soils,
    Mongolian pine was introduced from its native areas in Honghuaerji, Hulunbuir,
    China for afforestation to the region since the 1950s (Zhu et al. 2006). This
    species has also been widely used for afforestation programs in other areas of
    northern China over the past decades and have reached more than northern 300 counties
    (Zhu et al. 2005b), playing important roles in increasing vegetation cover and
    improving ecological services. Data collection Acquiring tree-ring data During
    August 2020, two different age plantations of this species (9 − 13 years and 35 − 52
    years) in the southern Horqin sandy lands in northern China. Age was obtained
    by counting the number of annual rings at breast height. Two plots of each age
    group were selected (42.71434 − 42.71479°N, 122.49038 − 122.49099°E; 42.66875 − 42.66920°N,
    122.57166 − 122.57227°E), with one plot per plantation for annual ring sampling.
    Tree heights in the younger and older plantations were approximately 2.5 − 3 m
    and 13 − 14 m, respectively. Thirty-seven and 33 increment cores were taken from
    20 to 21 trees, respectively, with one or two cores per tree at breast height
    using an increment borer. The increment cores were processed to obtain ring width
    data as well as their cross-dated results following the standard procedure of
    tree-ring analysis (Cook and Kairiukstis 1990). To extract the variances linked
    to climate while removing those related to biological trends, the tree-ring width
    measurements of each core for the older plantation were detrended using a cubic
    spline with a 50% frequency–response cutoff equal to two-thirds of the series
    length, which was performed by the program ARSTAN (Cook 1985). All detrended series
    were averaged to obtain a ring width chronology for the older plantation using
    the method of bi-weight robust means (Cook and Kairiukstis 1990; Fig. 1). For
    the younger plantation, the undetrended ring width series of all cores were averaged
    to obtain a raw chronology through the way of bi-weight robust means (Fig. 1a).
    We derived tree-ring raw chronology rather than the standard detrended chronology
    because the period of tree-ring data availability was relatively short (2008 − 2019).
    This is because there could be some possible drawbacks on detrending tree-ring
    data of short periods using the current detrending methods (Fritts 1976; Cook
    1985). However, the raw tree-ring width (RRW) data of the younger plantation could
    represent those being detrended, since trends of biology related to age might
    have limited impacts on annual ring data covering a relatively short period (Cook
    and Kairiukstis 1990). Chronology statistics include mean sensitivity (MS), standard
    deviation (SD), inter-series correlation (Rbar) and expressed population signal
    (EPS; Fritts 1976; Table 1). For each chronology, the reliable period is determined
    when EPS surpasses 0.85 (Wigley et al. 1984). Accordingly, the reliable periods
    for the chronologies of the younger and older plantations were 2010 − 2019 and
    1983 − 2019, respectively (Fig. 1a, b). Tree-ring chronologies covering these
    periods were used for growth-climate correlation analysis. Fig. 1 a Variability

    (PS1) and b older age groups (PS2) as well as changes of sample depth over time

    two age groups; sample depth denotes the number of increment cores (light blue

    of tree-ring width standard chronology for the older groups (PS2) of P. sylvestris
    var. mongolica Full size table To better reflect radial growth of different aged
    Mongolian pine, annual basal area increment (BAI) was also calculated using non-detrended
    tree-ring data through the formula of Biondi and Qeadan (2008): $${BAI}_{t}=\\pi
    \\times ({RW}_{t}^{2} -{RW}_{t-1}^{2})$$ (1) where BAIt is BAI in year t; RWt
    and RWt-1 are cumulative undetrended ring widths from the pith to year t and t-1,
    respectively. Tree ages denote the cambium ages of the trees in 2020 when the
    tree-ring cores were sampled; the end of the chronology extension for both groups
    was determined in 2019, as the complete rings for the trees in 2020 had not formed
    when they were sampled in early August of that year. MS is mean sensitivity; SD
    is standard deviation; Rbar is inter-series correlation; EPS is expressed population
    signal. The unit of tree-ring width raw series was mm, which was used for calculating
    chronology statistics for PS1. Acquiring remotely sensed vegetation index data
    Six cloud-free sentinel-2A Level-1C MSI images (tile number T51TVH) covering the
    same region (including our study area) were acquired between late July and late
    August during 2016 − 2021, with one image per year (Table S1 in Online Appendix).
    The sentinel-2A satellite was launched by the European Space Agency 23rd June
    2015 to provide high spatial resolution multispectral data covering the globe
    with a 5-day revisit frequency (Drusch et al. 2012). The Level-1C images used
    in this study were derived from the Sentinels Scientific Data Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)
    which had already been orthorectified and geometrically corrected (Korhonen et
    al. 2017). Therefore, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction for the
    images were further carried out utilizing the Sen2cor 2.9.0 program (Gascon et
    al. 2017), through which Level-1C data were converted into Level-2A data. All
    13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution between 10 and 60 m for each image
    were combined and converted into the spatial resolution of 10 m using the ArcGIS
    10.2 software. The analyzed images were further extracted from the combined images
    using the vector boundary of the study area in the ERDAS 2010 software (ERDAS
    1999). After the above preprocessing, the spectral reflectance values from band
    4 (red region), band 8 (near infrared region) and band 12 (short wave infrared
    region) of the images were employed using formulas (2) and (3) for obtaining NDVI
    and NDWI data, respectively, which were performed with the ERDAS 2010 software.
    NDVI was calculated using the following formula (Tucker 1979): $$NDVI = \\frac{{\\rho_{NIR}
    - \\rho_{{{\\text{Re}} d}} }}{{\\rho_{NIR} + \\rho_{{{\\text{Re}} d}} }}$$ (2)
    where \\(\\rho_{{{\\text{NIR}}}}\\) and \\(\\rho_{{{\\text{Re}} d}}\\) are spectral
    reflectance values in near infrared (NIR) and red regions, respectively. NDWI
    was calculated using the formula (Chen et al. 2005): $$NDWI = \\frac{{\\rho_{NIR}
    - \\rho_{SWIR} }}{{\\rho_{NIR} + \\rho_{SWIR} }}$$ (3) where \\(\\rho_{SWIR}\\)
    is the value of spectral reflectance in the short wave infrared region (SWIR).
    NDVI and NDWI data for the younger and older Mongolian pine plantations were obtained
    through the following steps. Five square plots in each of the two plantations
    were established according to the layouts of pixels in the sentinel-2A Level-1C
    MSI image, with one covering the tree-ring sampling plot as described previously
    and surrounded by the other four for remotely sensed analysis. Each plot covered
    5 pixels × 5 pixels of the image corresponding to 50 m × 50 m in the field. The
    NDVI and NDWI data of each square plot were extracted from the data layers of
    these two indicators. The data for the five plots within each plantation were
    averaged and further used for analyzing canopy vegetation conditions at the stand
    scale. Acquiring xylem hydraulic data On early mornings during August 2020, four
    branches facing the sun, with per branch from each tree, were collected at the
    tree-ring sampling plot within each of the plantations for hydraulic conductivity
    measurements. During the sampling process, the cut ends of the four branches were
    recut immediately under water to eliminate potentially embolized tracheids. In
    the laboratory, 10-cm stem segments were extracted from the branches under water.
    The ends of each segment were then connected to a tubing apparatus filled with
    a degassed and filtered 20 mM KCl solution and a graduated glass pipette for measuring
    native hydraulic conductivity (Kh-native; Sperry and Tyree 1988). The solution
    flowed through the segment under a hydrostatic pressure developed by a hydraulic
    head of 50 cm. Native hydraulic conductivity (Kh-native, kg m s−1 MPa−1) was calculated
    using the following formula (Tyree and Ewers 1991): $$K_{{\\text{h-native}}} =
    \\frac{{J_{v} }}{\\Delta P/\\Delta L}$$ (4) where Jv denotes the flow rate through
    the stem segments (kg s−1); ΔP/ΔL is the pressure gradient across the stem segment
    (MPa m−1). Sapwood-specific (Ks, kgm−1 s−1 MPa−1) and leaf-specific (Kl, kg m−1
    s−1 MPa−1) hydraulic conductivities were obtained by Kh-native divided by the
    sapwood area (SA) of the transverse section and the total area of the needles
    terminal to the segment (LA), respectively. Both SA and LA were calculated using
    the software ImageJ 1.48v (US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
    The measurements of the two variables provided LA to SA ratio (LA/SA). Statistical
    analysis To investigate long-term growth responses to drought at both individual
    tree and stand scales, Pearson correlation analyses between the tree-ring metrics
    (e.g., RRW and tree-ring width index—RWI), BAI, NDVI and NDWI of the younger and
    older plantations and monthly self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI;
    Wells et al. 2004) were carried out during their overlapping period. Monthly scPDSI
    data were obtained by averaging the corresponding gridded data within the geographical
    range 42.5 − 43.0 N, 122 − 123 E from the CRU scPDSI Global 4.05early datasets
    with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° (van der Schrier et al. 2013; Barichivich
    et al. 2020). This range covered all the sampling plots. The available data of
    scPDSI included the period from January 1901 to December 2020. The scPDSI data
    during January through October were used. To test differences in the traits of
    xylem hydraulics and the remotely sensed vegetation indices between the younger
    and older age groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using
    the software SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc. 1997). Results Differences in growth patterns
    between younger and older age groups There were large differences in radial growth
    patterns between the two age groups. The RRW of the younger group (PS1) showed
    an overall increase before 2012 but decreased afterwards (Fig. 1a), which may
    partly be attributed to the effects of biological trends. Inconsistently, RWI
    of the older group (PS2) exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) period of decline,
    i.e., 2004 − 2019, while there was no significant trend over the earlier period
    (Fig. 1b). Both Rbar and EPS for the RRW of PS1 and the RWI of PS2 were relatively
    high (Table 1), indicating that the radial growth of the two age groups might
    be sensitive to climate variability. During the common period (2008–2019) of the
    two age groups, the values of BAI for PS1 showed an obvious increase but PS2 remained
    relatively stable (Fig. 1c). Consistent with the patterns of individual radial
    tree growth, vegetation greenness and water content at the stand level were poorest
    in the older plantations than in the younger ones. NDVI values of PS2 were lower
    than those of PS1 during the common period 2016 − 2021, with significant disparities
    between both groups in 2017, 2019 and 2021 (P < 0.1; Fig. 2a). Lower NDWI values
    were also observed for PS2 than in PS1 over the same years, with a significant
    difference in 2021 (P < 0.05; Fig. 2b). Fig. 2 Variability in remote sensing-based

    There did not appear to be any close relationships between the metrics of radial
    growth at a single tree level and those at a stand level. Correlations of tree-ring
    metrics (RRW and RWI) and BAI with NDVI and NDWI during the common period 2016 − 2019
    were all insignificant (P > 0.1) in each of the age groups (results not shown).
    However, it should be noted that there may be large uncertainties on the correlation
    results between these two kinds of indicators because the period of correlation
    analysis was relatively short, and hence their relationships may need to be further
    verified using longer time series data in future studies. There were strong associations
    between individual radial growth at the tree level and at the stand level in the
    same age group. Specifically, RWI was significantly (P < 0.01) and positively
    correlated with BAI in PS2, although there was no significant correlation in PS1
    (Fig. 3a). Moreover, NDVI was significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with NDWI in
    both age groups (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3 Scatter plots showing the relationships of annual
    basal area increment (BAI) with tree-ring metrics and of normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) with normalized difference water index (NDWI) over their
    common periods (2008 − 2019, 2016 − 2021, respectively), for the younger (PS1)
    and older (PS2) groups of P. sylvestris var. mongolica. The tree-ring metrics
    used for PS1 and PS2 are raw tree-ring width and tree-ring width index, respectively.
    The solid and dashed oblique lines respectively show significant (P < 0.05) and
    insignificant trends for the linear regression lines Full size image Contrasts
    in growth response to drought between age groups The radial growth of the older
    trees was more likely to be negatively affected by drought during the growing
    season. There was a significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation between RWI of
    the trees in PS2 and June scPDSI over 2010 − 2019 as well as first-order differences
    over 2011 − 2019 (Fig. 4a). In addition, although no significant correlation occurred
    between the RWIs of PS2 and scPDSI during the declining period of 2004 − 2019
    (correlation results not shown), the first-order differences of the two variables
    were significantly (P < 0.01) positively correlated over 2005 − 2019 (Fig. 4b),
    indicating their high frequency associations. For PS1, there was no significant
    relationship between RRW and monthly scPDSI from January to October during 2010–2019
    (Fig. 4a). To further determine the growth-drought relationship over the early
    period of tree development, a correlation analysis was carried out between RWI
    and scPDSI during a much longer period 1983–2012 for PS2, a period when the age
    of most trees was < 30 years (Fig. 1b); with age < 30 years, drought-related growth
    decline has been rarely observed. There was no significant correlation between
    these two variables (Fig. S2 in Online Appendix). In addition, there was a significant
    (P < 0.05) positive correlation between the first-order differences of BAI for
    PS2 and of June scPDSI (Fig. 4d), but it did not occur for PS1 over the same period
    (result not shown). Fig. 4 Relationships between the tree-ring metrics and basal

    at the individual tree level in older trees relative to younger ones were echoed
    by the response patterns of their vegetation greenness and water content at the
    stand level. Both NDVI and NDWI showed higher correlations with July scPDSI during
    the growing season in PS2 than PS1, although the correlations between the former
    two variables and July scPDSI were significant (P < 0.05) in both age groups (Fig.
    5a, b). In addition, correlations between the first-order differences of NDVI
    and those of July scPDSI were significant (P < 0.05) in PS2 but not in PS1 (Fig.
    5c). There were no differences in correlations for the first-order differences

    declines in aging Mongolian pine under drought Older, mature trees are more vulnerable
    to growth decline or to mortality than younger ones, which might be attributed
    to greater impacts of drought (Lindenmayer et al. 2012; Bennett et al. 2015).
    Our results show that older Mongolian pines experienced an obvious decline in
    radial growth and concurrently showed a greater sensitivity to drought during
    the growing season, as reflected by higher correlations of RWIs and BAI with June
    scPDSI. This concurs with a tree-ring investigation that found more obvious decrease
    of radial growth in older trees than younger ones of Qinghai spruce in Qilian
    Mountains in northwestern China under the influence of climate change (Wang et
    al. 2021). In addition, using plot-based measurements, several studies have also
    indicated that aboveground biomass of old forests in western Canada were more
    strongly affected by climate change relative to younger forests and were particularly
    vulnerable to growth decline caused by increasing drought associated with climate
    warming (Chen and Luo 2015; Chen et al. 2016). A synthesized analysis of diameter
    growth data revealed that, on a global scale, drought played a more detrimental
    role in radial growth and mortality of larger old-growth trees than smaller ones
    (Bennett et al. 2015). As large trees play a key role in forest ecosystems and
    radial growth is closely associated with biomass accumulation (Lamsal et al. 2012;
    Lindenmayer et al. 2012; Bennett et al. 2015), greater vulnerability in the radial
    growth to drought indicates that the dynamics of forest carbon sequestration would
    be largely affected by climate extremes and water availability changes related
    to climate fluctuations. The larger old-growth trees in Mongolian pine plantations
    tend to suffer from drought-driven radial growth decline, especially in water-limited
    environments as in our study area, which could substantially influence the capacity
    of carbon fixation and other benefits they provide. Consistent with increasing
    vulnerability of radial growth with age to drought, canopy greenness and water
    content at the stand level for older trees were more likely to be negatively affected
    by drought than younger ones. This is shown by stronger correlations of NDVI and
    NDWI with the growing season scPDSI in the older plantation. This agrees with
    a recent finding that old-growth forests at the southern edge of the taiga have
    low resilience at the canopy level in coping with water stress (Liu et al. 2021).
    Studies have shown a significant positive correlation between radial growth (i.e.,
    RWIs) and satellite-derived vegetation indices (i.e., NDVI) under similar climatic
    conditions, especially for the relationships with vegetation indices on seasonal
    and longer time scales (Leavitt et al. 2008; Bunn et al. 2013; Vicente-Serrano
    et al. 2016). As there are associations between the variables of the two aspects,
    they may exhibit synchronized changes in sensitivity to drought with stand age.
    There is, however, no close linkage between individual tree radial growth and
    vegetation greenness and water content at the stand level in relatively short
    time scales for the plantations analyzed. This is indicated by the lack of correlation
    of RWIs and BAI with the daily NDVI and NDWI for the same age group. This is consistent
    with the findings of studies showing no relationship between radial growth and
    satellite-based measurements at biweekly or daily scales (Beck and Goetz 2011;
    Berner et al. 2013; Brehaut and Danby 2018). That there were no statistically
    significant correlations between the metrics of these two aspects might be due
    to the long-term dynamics of carbon stored in woody parts of trees. This is reflected
    by radial growth and does not fully depend on recently synthesized carbohydrates
    from photosynthesis and is hence possibly decoupled from the short-term carbon
    gain of leaves at the canopy level (Huston and Wolverton 2009; Vicente-Serrano
    et al. 2016). Consequently, different responses to climate could occur between
    radial growth and the condition of the canopy vegetation. The annually-resolved
    RWIs and BAI were particularly sensitive to June scPDSI, while daily NDVI and
    NDWI during late July to late August were vulnerable to July scPDSI. However,
    this study also indicated that, in water-limited environments of our study area,
    both short-term canopy vegetation dynamics at the stand level (i.e., daily NDVI
    and NDWI) and relatively long-term radial growth at a tree scale (i.e., RWIs and
    BAI) were more susceptible to drought during the growing season in older Mongolian
    pines. This result is in accordance with recent reports that growth at both individual
    tree and stand levels consistently showed declines when the climate became drier
    in the Sierra Nevada (southwest USA), a water-deficit area (Wong et al. 2021).
    In regions with water shortages, trees are particularly vulnerable to drought
    and the negative impacts were probably expressed in growths at different scales
    (Beck et al. 2011; Subedi et al. 2021). Unlike several studies that relied on
    a single method (e.g., Carrer and Urbinati 2004; Liu et al. 2018, 2021), this
    study examined tree performance by combining tree-ring analysis and remotely sensed
    VIs that provided a more comprehensive understanding on response of tree growth
    to water stress with increasing age. Water-related mechanisms on growth decline
    of aging Mongolian pine Greater vulnerability of larger old-growth trees to drought-induced
    growth decline relative to younger trees may be attributed to greater restrictions
    on water transport. Trees become more susceptible to drought and suffer more severe
    hydraulic limitations with height increase, as deduced by Darcy’s law of permeability
    (McDowell and Allen 2015). Compared with smaller, younger trees, larger ones must
    overcome greater resistance for lifting water from roots to crowns because of
    increased length in water transport pathways, resulting in more challenging xylem
    hydraulics (Ryan and Yoder 1997; Ryan et al. 2006; Bennett et al. 2015). Furthermore,
    old trees having larger crowns and leaf areas relative to younger trees endure
    greater water loss from elevated transpiration that exacerbates soil moisture
    deficits and reduce water availability (Duan et al. 2021). As water stress and
    hydraulic limitations become stronger with age, trees become more sensitive to
    hydroclimatic conditions leading to more prominent climate signals expressed in
    measurements of radial growth at individual tree level (i.e., RWIs and BAI) and
    of vegetation canopy condition at stand level (i.e., NDVI and NDWI) for older
    individuals (Travis et al. 1990; Carrer and Urbinati 2004). Larger old-growth
    Mongolian pines in water-deficit environments susceptible to severe xylem hydraulic
    limitations under increasing water stress. Decreases in the groundwater table
    in the study area because of the dramatic expansion of water-consuming agricultural
    land since the 1950s most likely have led to increased water stress in plants
    (Zheng et al. 2012). The larger, older Mongolian pines might have more potential
    to avoid water stress than the smaller, younger trees because their larger root
    systems allow them access to deeper soil water. However, larger old-growth trees
    having greater root length and mass are commonly accompanied by increase leaf
    transpiration (Poorter et al. 2012), which exacerbates water loss through elevated
    transpiration. These causes make it is less likely to convert the merits in extensive
    root systems into hydraulic advantages for larger old-growth trees under water
    deficits (Bennett et al. 2015). Conversely, larger, older trees might suffer more
    from increasingly severe water stress compared to smaller, younger ones as the
    former depend more on groundwater that has continuously decreased over recent
    decades (Zheng et al. 2012; Song et al. 2015, 2016). Furthermore, larger old-growth
    trees may also experience greater hydraulic dysfunction due to the effects of
    height-related water transport resistance (Ryan and Yoder 1997; Midgley 2003).
    Such deduction is confirmed by our results that lower Ks and Kl occurred in larger
    old-growth Mongolian pines relative to the smaller, younger ones. This agrees
    with Liu et al. (2018) who found increasing hydraulic constraints with tree size
    for Mongolian pine trees in the vicinity of our study area. Because of greater
    hydraulic constraints, larger and older Mongolian pines have probably undergone
    more severe growth decline at both individual tree and stand levels, as indicated
    by the results of our tree-ring metrics and remotely sensed vegetation indices
    investigation. Under a future drier climate, we speculate that aging Mongolian
    pine plantations would be more vulnerable to drought-driven forest die-back. Conclusions
    By integrating tree-ring analysis and remotely sensed vegetation indices, our
    study suggests that recent decreases in RWIs (radial width indices) at individual
    tree level was echoed by consistently lower multi-year values of satellite-derived
    normalized difference vegetation and water indices at the stand level in plantations.
    In addition, all growth-related metrics were more sensitive to drought stress
    during the growing season, reflected by strong correlations between these metrics
    and the June/July scPDSI as well as their first-order differences, in older stands.
    Consistently lower sapwood-specific and leaf-specific hydraulics occurred in the
    older trees, indicating that changes of xylem hydraulics played an important role
    in mediating growth performances to drought. By integrating multiple approaches
    for quantifying tree growth performance, our study provides a comprehensive understanding
    of the differences in growth between older and younger Mongolian pine plantations
    and reveals the underlying causes from xylem hydraulics. Under climate warming,
    old-growth Mongolian pine plantations will exhibit more pronounced growth decline
    associated with increased water stress. Therefore, renewing old-growth plantations
    and taking action to alleviate competitions for water through thinning might be
    required for the sustainable management of Mongolian pine plantations. References

  description: Halving nitrogen pollution is crucial for achieving Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs). However, how to reduce nitrogen pollution from multiple sources
    remains challenging. Here we show that reactive nitrogen (Nr) pollution could
    be roughly halved by managed urban development in China by 2050, with NH3, NOx
    and N2O atmospheric emissions declining by 44%, 30% and 33%, respectively, and
    Nr to water bodies by 53%. While rural-urban migration increases point-source
    nitrogen emissions in metropolitan areas, it promotes large-scale farming, reducing
    rural sewage and agricultural non-point-source pollution, potentially improving
    national air and water quality. An investment of approximately US$ 61 billion
    in waste treatment, land consolidation, and livestock relocation yields an overall
    benefit of US$ 245 billion. This underscores the feasibility and cost-effectiveness
    of halving Nr pollution through urbanization, contributing significantly to SDG1
    (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG6 (Clean water), SDG12 (Responsible consumption
    and production), SDG14 (Climate Action), and so on.

    The invention of the Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation (HBNF) has doubled
    global grain production that has supported rapid growth of the global population1.
    However, reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses during food and energy production and consumption
    have led to multiple unintended consequences, including air and water pollution,
    soil acidification, biodiversity loss and global warming2,3,4. The United Nations
    Environment Programme (UNEP) has formulated the objective to halve nitrogen waste
    globally to achieve global sustainable development goals (SDGs)5, which has now
    been embraced by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity6. Nitrogen use and
    losses are directly linked to about half of SDGs such as No poverty (SDG1), Zero
    hunger (SDG2), Clean water (SDG6) and Responsible consumption and production (SDG12),
    Climate Action (SDG14), and Life and Land (SDG15)7,8. Therefore, halving nitrogen
    waste is key to achieving SDGs in coming decades. China is a hotspot of global
    Nr pollution, using about 30% of global nitrogen fertilizers and feeding 22% of
    global livestock9. Wastage of Nr from agriculture, industrial production and human
    activities has potentially contributed to China’s air and water quality challenges,
    leading to millions of premature deaths annually10,11,12. However, it is difficult
    to reduce nitrogen waste given the multitude of Nr sources (e.g. cropland, livestock,
    sewage) and Nr forms (e.g., ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide
    (N2O), nitrate (NO3-)). This is especially the case for non-point source Nr pollution
    from agriculture and rural areas13. Advanced technologies and management options
    reduce Nr losses from some forms, but may increase Nr losses of other forms14,15.
    Moreover, some abatement measures are rarely implemented to their full potential
    due to socioeconomic barriers, such as small farm size, which especially limits
    control of agricultural non-point source pollution in China16,17. It is therefore
    crucial to identify and realize synergies of Nr abatement across different sources
    and different nitrogen forms. Urbanization is often associated with food security
    challenges as cropland conversion to urban areas reduces agricultural outputs
    and increases the concentration of pollutant emissions in population centres18,19.
    Unmanaged urbanization also holds many risks, such as inadequate water treatment
    infrastructure, leading to major pollution and health damages. However, research
    indicates that well-managed urbanization can benefit large-scale crop production
    since urbanization increased the total cropland area and the farm size which allows
    a faster introduction of modern agricultural practices, which potentially benefits
    crop-livestock integration for sustainable agriculture20,21. Meanwhile, urbanization
    moves rural populations to urban areas, which benefits the control of diffuse,
    non-point source pollution such as rural sewage, waste and livestock production.
    Here we show the concept of well-managed urbanization pertains to the governance
    of land, resources, and the environment throughout the urbanization trajectory,
    deliberately omitting the management of social and economic aspects. It’s worth
    noting, for example, that urbanization, when leveraged appropriately, has the
    potential to alleviate poverty and reduce inequality by expanding job prospects,
    improving living standards, enhancing educational opportunities, and bolstering
    healthcare services—factors that are outside the scope of our current investigation.
    Currently, approximately 14 million people move from rural to urban areas annually
    in China22,23, which has an impact on the spatial distribution of resource use
    and environmental pollution along a rural-urban gradient. However, it has remained
    little understood how such a socioeconomic change affects Nr use and losses. In
    this paper, we estimated the potential to halve nitrogen pollution in China through
    well-managed urbanization in all of the >2800 counties of China through analysis
    in four stages: 1) assessing changes of population, land use and agriculture with
    urbanization; 2) quantifying how these changes reduce Nr pollution from different
    sources and Nr forms; 3) estimating how these reductions in wasteful Nr losses
    on air and water quality; and 4) examining the feasibility and policy implications,
    including conducting a cost-benefit analysis. Results and discussion Changes with
    well-managed urbanization Urbanization signifies a pivotal demographic transition
    from rural to urban living, a change that is profoundly shaping contemporary China.
    When effectively managed, urbanization can serve as a dynamic catalyst for various
    dimensions of sustainable development by conscientiously balancing environmental
    stewardship with socioeconomic considerations. This study, however, narrows its
    focus specifically to the aspects of the urbanization process that are intricately
    tied to nitrogen management through direct biophysical changes. This encompasses
    land intensification, the refinement of agricultural practices, and the expansion
    of treatment capabilities for domestic and industrial pollution. Urbanization
    in China has been increasing by about 1% annually since the 1990s22,23. The United
    Nations’ World Urbanization Prospects projected that China’s urban population
    would increase from 0.8 billion in 2017 to 1.1 billion in 2050 with a population
    urbanization level of around 80% if this trend continues (Fig. 1a, b and Fig.
    S1, S2). We predict that rural-to-urban migration also leads to a relocation of
    population from inland to coastal areas. Overall, population growth is projected
    to occur in the three largest coastal urban agglomerations, the Beijing-Tianjin
    region, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, while the remaining
    regions would experience rural depopulation both through migration and natural
    aging (Fig. 1a). Rural depopulation and continued urban prosperity would lead
    to an increased level of urbanization in 82% of the counties, mainly in south
    of the Hu Line (Fig. 1e). Fig. 1: Population, land use and agricultural change
    with urbanization. These figures demonstrate changes in population, land use and
    agricultural system with urbanization from 2017 to 2050. a Geo-distribution of

    Full size image The expansion of urban area in response to urban population growth
    will take up natural and agricultural lands (Fig. 1c and Table S1). During the
    period from 2017 to 2050, China’s total urban area is expected to increase from
    5.5 to 7.8 Mha ( + 2.2 Mha, million hectares, an increase of about 40%), while
    rural built-up areas would decrease from 13.4 to 6.2 Mha (−7.2 Mha, ~−54%) (Fig.
    1c, d). Although 1.3 Mha of cropland area would be occupied due to urban expansion,
    a total area of 6.9 Mha could be reclaimed from rural homesteads and converted
    to cropland. As a consequence, net cropland area can potentially increase by 5.6
    Mha, mainly located in North China Plain and Northeast Plain (Fig. 1f). A decrease
    of cropland is estimated to mainly occur in the three largest metropolitan areas,
    Beijing-Tianjin region, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. The
    reclamation of rural land associated with urbanization could benefit the ongoing
    increase of large-scale farming practices, with opportunities to reduce nitrogen
    pollution and increase efficiencies. We estimate that the proportion of large-scale
    cropland farms (size over 10 ha) could increase from 9% (2017) to 90% in 2050
    (Fig. S3). On the one hand, rural land reclamation increases the total area of
    croplands available; on the other hand, it contributes to increasing the spatial
    connectivity of cropland, since rural homesteads are normally next to croplands,
    which are naturally suitable to be reclaimed for better agricultural production.
    Urbanization also drives the potential for coupled crop-livestock production.
    Smallholders normally quit livestock production due to having to keep part-time
    jobs in non-agricultural sectors to ensure their economic viability, which is
    not comparable with the time needed for livestock feeding24. In contrast, the
    rise of large-scale farming introduces more full-time professional farmers capable
    of managing both crop and livestock production simultaneously25. When accompanied
    by appropriate training and equipment, this enable crop-livestock coupling at
    the house hold level, as observed in areas adopting the new farming models (e.g.,
    family farm, cooperative farm, industrial farm) with larger farm size and full-time
    farmers26. These new farming models would gradually replace smallholder farming
    as the dominant farming practice with less rural laborers and larger farm size
    by 2050, as has happened historically in other world regions. To ensure a well-managed
    transition, however, it is important that the nitrogen management opportunities
    are utilized, such as maximizing effective use of manures and other organic residues,
    while minimizing losses to the environment. Additionally, the distribution of
    large-scale farms by 2050 would lead to livestock relocation while ensuring that
    livestock manure production matches crop requirements at the county level. Approximately
    325 million pig units (all livestock species converted to pig units) would need
    relocation. For example, about 178 million pigs must move from the southern region
    (Fujian, Yunnan, Guangdong, Hunan, etc.) to the central region (Sichuan, Chongqing,
    Henan, etc.) (see Figs. 1g and S4). In 2050, it is assuming that nitrogen management
    will adhere to the latest Five-year plan of the central government27. The government’s
    plan involves collecting excreta from urban areas through a septic-sewer network,
    which will undergo treatment using nitrogen removal or recycling technologies28(Fig.
    S5). It aims to reduce Nr emissions by upgrading industries and restructuring
    energy consumption for transportation and heating in urban areas. Managing non-point
    source pollution in rural areas presents a significant challenge, particularly
    with regard to wastewater and municipal solid waste. While controlling point source
    pollution in urban areas is comparatively more manageable, addressing non-point
    source pollution in rural areas is more complex. Therefore, the government has
    established precise indicators for wastewater and waste treatment efficiency in
    urban areas, and we assume that the status quo will persist in rural areas. Reduction
    of total Nr loss In the well-managed urbanization scenario, national Nr losses
    would be reduced from 33.8 to 18.3 Tg (−46%), with reductions of 10.9, 3.4 and
    1.2 Tg in agricultural, human and natural system losses, respectively (Fig. 2).
    Agricultural systems, especially large-scale farming, full manure recycling, and
    emission abatement measures like reducing NH3 emissions (Fig. 3a, b), drive the
    reductions. In agriculture, Nr inputs such as fertilizer, deposition, and irrigation
    decrease as professional farmers seek cost optimization, especially in a world
    with potentially higher nitrogen prices, while manure and straw recycling increases.
    In the human system, migration would increase the share of population connected
    to centralized sewage treatment (including nitrogen recovery opportunities) and
    foster household energy transformation, hence leading to both reductions of Nr
    emissions to water bodies and atmosphere in rural areas. The reduction of overall
    Nr losses to the environment from agricultural and human systems would result
    in lower Nr deposition and related Nr inputs, and thus also reduce Nr losses from
    natural ecosystems, such as forests. Below we summarize the changes in nitrogen
    pollution according to the main forms of Nr loss to the environment: Fig. 2: Spatial
    variation of nitrogen loss with urbanization. a Distribution of total reactive
    nitrogen (TN) losses in 2017. b Distribution of predicted TN losses in 2050 assuming
    an urbanization level of 80%. c Distribution of the change in TN losses during
    the 2017-2050 period. d National NH3, NOx, N2O and NO3- loss in 2017 and 2050.
    TN losses include NH3, NOx, N2O and NO3- loss. We use NO3- to represent the Nr
    loss via runoff and leaching, given that most of the other dissolve forms of Nr
    would be converted to NO3- during moving with water. The base map is applied from
    GADM data (https://gadm.org/). Full size image Fig. 3: Nitrogen budgets within

    treatment, garbage treatment and industry subsystems. Nature subsystem set includes

    Full size image NH3 emissions are calculated to decrease from 11.9 Tg N to 6.7
    Tg N (−5.2 Tg N, −44%), with 2.8 and 1.8 Tg N reductions from cropland and livestock
    systems, respectively (Fig. 3c). Such large reductions are mainly due to the enhanced
    Nr recycling ratio (NrR, which equaling manure nitrogen returned to field divided
    by the amount produced) and the increase in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of crop
    and livestock systems, the primary NH3 source. Large-scale farming boosts cropland
    NUE from 43% to 54%, ultimately reducing total fertilizer use from 28.9 to 18.5
    Tg N by 2050 (Fig. S6). Re-coupling crop and livestock production increases manure
    NRR from 23% to 63%, further reducing fertilizer use to 12.9 Tg N, with cropland
    NUE reaching 59%, similar to developed countriess29. NH3 emissions from human
    subsystems decrease by around 0.4 Tg N, primarily due to reduced emissions from
    rural sewage and upgraded industrial facilities in urban areas. Improved management
    of sewage and industrial energy consumption in urban areas significantly contributes
    to reducing NH3 emissions in non-agricultural sectors compared to free drainage
    systems in rural areas. Well-managed urbanization is projected to reduce NOx emissions
    from 4.8 to 3.4 Tg N (−1.4 Tg N, −30%) (Fig. 3d), primarily driven by the human
    system (−1.4 Tg N). Fossil fuel consumption, responsible for over 80% of total
    emissions, is the main source. Well-managed urbanization would enhance energy
    efficiency, reducing NOx emissions per unit of energy supply, aided by growing
    urban populations and increased clean energy use in 2050. The Clean Air Act has
    reduced NOx emissions by 10% between 2015 and 2020 mainly through reductions per
    unit of energy supply30, particularly in energy sectors, including rural bioenergy
    use31. Urban waste incineration is expected to rise, leading to an 0.1Tg N ( + 80%)
    increase in NOx emissions, but this only account for 7% of the total NOx emissions
    with reduced Nr runoff and leaching. Additionally, minor NOx emissions come from
    soil nitrogen transformation, like denitrification. Reduced Nr input to agricultural
    and natural lands by professional farmers, including from Nr deposition, could
    reduce soil NOx emissions by 10%-30%. N2O emission reductions, while relatively
    modest in absolute term (−0.47 Tg N), account for 33% of the total N2O emissions,
    making a significantly to climate change mitigation Fig. 3e). The largest contribution
    is from agricultural subsystem (−0.36 Tg N), where N2O mainly originates as direct
    emissions from cropland soil due to fertilization, nitrogen deposition and BNF,
    as well as manure recycling from livestock farming4,32. Even if cropland and livestock
    N2O emission factors remain constant, N2O emissions would be reduced due to reduced
    nitrogen input and increased manure recycling. Meanwhile, the reduction of nitrogen
    inputs in agricultural and human subsystems is calculated to reduce indirect N2O
    emissions by 0.11 Tg, which occur downstream or down-wind to forest and grassland
    via water bodies or the atmosphere33. Nr runoff and leaching to water bodies (dominated
    by NO3-, and labeled as NO3- in Fig. 3, although also including other Nr forms
    including organic nitrogen) would be reduced from 15.6 to 7.3 Tg (−8.3 Tg N, −53%).
    The livestock subsystem leads this reduction (−3.2 Tg N) (Fig. 3f), through sustainable
    livestock management practices and livestock- cropland coupled system. The cropland
    subsystem contributes the second-largest reduction (−2.7 Tg N) due to reduced
    Nr inputs and increased NUE. In addition, Nr loss to water is predicted increase
    0.5 Tg N in wastewater treatment plants, but decrease 2.1 Tg in wastewater directly
    discharge and garbage leaching. Domestic wastewater treatment capacity is increasing,
    aligning with China’s 14th Five-Year Plan and 2035 Vision Plan27,34, which emphasizes
    environmental investment to reduce Nr loss to water in urban areas35. Based on
    current knowledge, denitrification emissions of N2 are highly uncertain but are
    still quantified in our approach for mass consistency as shown in Fig. S7. Although
    N2 emissions are environmentally benign, they are usually ten times greater than
    N2O emissions and result in a significant loss of valuable Nr resources36. Reducing
    N2 emissions and recovering associated Nr resources offers a cleaner, more circular
    system, minimizing fresh Nr inputs. Urbanization would lead to a 10% reduction
    in N2 emissions by 2050 (−2.3 Tg N). Nitrogen removal technologies predict a 0.9
    and 2.3 Tg N increase in N2 generation in wastewater and garbage subsystems. Agricultural
    systems produce 40% less N2 from denitrification (−3.8 Tg N) due to lower Nr input
    like fertilizer. Additionally, a 16% reduction in N2 emissions (−1.0 Tg) results
    from reduced nitrogen deposition from natural subsystems. While a few counties
    in megalopolises with populations exceeding 10 million, such as Beijing, Shanghai,
    and Shenzhen, are expected to have increased Nr losses to the environment due
    to urbanization by 2050, over 96% of counties are projected to witness reductions
    in Nr losses (Fig. 4). The North China Plain and Sichuan Basin stand out as key
    regions for reductions in NH3, N2O, and NO3-, driven by larger farms, livestock
    relocation, and improved sewage treatment (Fig. S8). While, The North China Plain
    is also a focal area for NOx reduction, primarily due to urban migration and industrial
    upgrades. Fig. 4: Spatial variation of Nr species loss with urbanization. Distribution

    Full size image Reduction of PM2.5 and Nr output to water bodies Curtailing nitrogen
    losses can have far-reaching consequences, including but not limited to air and
    water pollution, biodiversity diminution, and climate change. Within this spectrum
    of impacts, air pollution—predominantly attributed to PM2.5, with a marginal contribution
    from ozone11 —poses significant threats to human health. Concurrently, water pollution
    and biodiversity depletion adversely affect ecosystem vitality. In light of these
    considerations, our following benefit assessment encompasses human health, ecosystems,
    and climate impact. Given that climate change is chiefly reflected in N2O emissions,
    our analysis delves deeper into PM2.5 pollution and nitrogen losses affecting
    aquatic environments. PM2.5 stands as a paramount environmental precursor to premature
    mortality globally37. Our focus on the influence of adeptly administered urbanization
    on reducing PM2.5 levels is predicated on the profound ramifications of PM2.5-induced
    air pollution on human health, corroborating its global prominence as a mortality
    risk factor. Given the repercussions of PM2.5 on human well-being, coupled with
    its significant presence in urban landscapes, this study emphasizes the shifts
    in PM2.5 concentrations resultant from targeted reductions in Nr emissions. Reduction
    of NH3 and NOx emissions are predicted to decrease national average surface concentrations
    of PM2.5 from 28.0 to 25.6 μg m−3 (−2.4 μg m−3, −9%). Regions with the largest
    reductions are projected to be in the North China Plain (Fig. 5a-c), and the largest
    reduction of PM2.5 concentration could reach −7.7 μg m−3, accounting for 18% of
    PM2.5 concentrations in 2017.We predict that the three major coastal metropolitan
    areas, i.e., Beijing-Tianjin region, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River
    Delta, would also experience reductions of PM2.5 concentrations, although urbanization
    is likely to increase NH3 and NOx emissions there. The meteorological conditions
    in these coastal areas, however, are more favorable for the dispersion of air
    pollutants, and more importantly, the large reduction of NH3 and NOx emissions
    in surrounding regions will contribute to an overall reduction of PM2.5 concentrations
    at regional scale. In line with the nationwide decrease of PM2.5 concentrations,
    the national population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations will drop from 41.4 to 32.8 μg m−3
    (−8.7 μg m−3, −21%), and consequently reduce population exposed to the PM2.5 levels
    above the national clean air standard (35 μg m−3) from 609 million to 476 million
    (−22%)38, leading to a marked public health benefit and reducing premature deaths.

    also a strong reducing effect on Nr loading to water bodies and the related Nr

    Simulations based on the total Nr to surface water and purification capacity of
    lake, reservoirs, and rivers through denitrification and Nr accumulation in sediments.
    On the one hand, the rural-to-urban migration by 2050 is predicted to lead to
    a shift of hotspots of Nr losses from inland to coastal urban agglomerations,
    which weakens the purification potential of inland water bodies (−2%), due to
    the shortened retention time of Nr pollutants in the rivers. On the other hand,
    the reduction in domestic and agricultural Nr discharge is predicted to decrease
    the overall Nr loading to the lower reaches, with the most significant reduction
    occurring in the North China Plain (Fig. 5d-f). However, water Nr loading is predicted
    to increase in a few scattered reaches of rivers in the Pearl River Delta and
    the Yangtze River Delta. Cost-benefit assessment of Nr pollution abatement The
    above-mentioned Nr pollution reduction potentials implies substantial benefits
    to the whole society, but it also requires the implementation of abatement measures
    with related costs. We calculate that approximate US$ 61 billion yr−1 is be required
    to achieve the above-mentioned Nr pollution reduction potential (Fig. 6h). The
    one-time implementation cost of US$ 1404 billion are required for agricultural
    management optimization over the period of 2017-2050, including rural homestead
    reclamation, cropland consolidation and livestock relocation (Fig. S9). Assuming
    that these changes would be completed by 2050, the annual implementation cost
    would be US$ 43 billion. The cost of cropland consolidation is estimated around
    US$ 15 billion yr−1, mainly in the North China Plain and the Middle-lower Yangtze
    River regions (Fig. 6b), which have the largest potential for the implementation
    of large-scale farming. As a result of the increase of large-scale farming, livestock
    production would relocate to these regions, with an annual cost of US$ 14 billion.
    The implementation cost of rural reclamation is estimated at US$ 13 billion yr−1,
    more than half of which is calculated for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze
    River Delta and Pearl River Delta. Although the rural reclamation area is small
    in these three regions, the unit cost per area is one order of magnitude higher
    than that in other regions due to their relatively higher economic development
    and land values. Fig. 6: Costs and benefits of halving Nr pollution with urbanization.

    implementation costs, while red indicates benefits. The base map is applied from
    GADM data (https://gadm.org/). Full size image In contrast to agricultural measures,
    the upgrading industrial processes and domestic waste treatment have lower implementation
    cost, requiring only US$ 11 and US$ 8 billion yr−1, respectively (Fig. 6h). Industrial
    process upgrading is mainly utilized for energy sectors, such as NOx emission
    reduction measures in power plants and vehicles. The implementation cost includes
    both fixed input and operation cost, with the largest abatement cost in the North
    China Plain and the northeast regions (Fig. 6c). Relocating population from rural
    to urban areas would require more facilities to treat domestic sewage and solid
    waste. We found that urbanization would lead to an additional 40 million tons
    of wastewater and 0.3 million tons of solid waste daily in urban areas by 2050,
    requiring roughly a US$ 106 billion one-time investment in facilities construction.
    Assuming these facilities would be completed by 2050, the annual cost would be
    calculated at US$ 3 billion. Beyond the construction of treatment facilities,
    the unit cost per ton to treat wastewater and solid waste is estimated at US$
    0.16 and US$ 2.8, respectively, leading to around US$ 4 billion yr−1 operating
    costs. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta
    are calculated to account for more than 60% of the total implementation cost for
    domestic waste treatment (Fig. 6a). In contrast to these implementation costs,
    estimated benefits due to reduced regional Nr pollution, due to reduced impacts
    on human and ecosystem health, climate benefits and increased economic returns
    through fertilizer saving and higher yields, and are estimated near US$ 245 billion
    yr−1. Ecosystem benefits are estimated at US$ 156 billion yr−1, mainly from the
    mitigation of eutrophication, improvement of drinking water quality and aquaculture
    production due to reduction of NO3- loading of water bodies, as well as preserving
    forest biodiversity through reduction Nr emission and deposition. These benefits
    mainly occur in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions where the
    largest reductions of NO3- discharge are estimated and which have advanced levels
    of economic development (Fig. 6f). Reduction of NH3 and NOx emissions will improve
    air quality due to the reduction of PM2.5 and near-surface O3 concentrations,
    with benefits to human health estimated at US$ 75 billion yr−1, with the North
    China Plain being experiencing the most propound air quality improvements (Fig.
    6e). Reduction of agricultural inputs from fertilizers is calculated to lead to
    savings of US$ 12 billion yr−1, which would increase farmers’ income. Similarly,
    increases in crop yields are predicted to generate US$ 12 billion yr−1 economic
    returns to farmers. The reduction of N2O emissions would results in climate benefits
    valued at US$ 6 billion yr−1, but being more than offset by the reduction of carbon
    sequestration (US$ −15 billion yr−1) due to reduced Nr deposition, resulting in
    a net climate change effect valued at US$ −9 billion yr−1. In total, urbanization
    could thus result in a societal benefit of approximately US$ 245 billion yr−1
    in China, approximately five times the total implementation cost, suggesting it
    would be both feasible and cost-beneficial to adopt ambitious targets for mitigating
    Nr. The North China Plain and the Middle-lower Yangtze River regions have the
    largest total benefit share and benefit-to-cost ratio, highlighting those as preferential
    areas for Nr management. Challenges and policy implications This study introduces
    a series of measures to achieve effective resource and environmental management
    during urbanization process, alongside the goal of halving nitrogen pollution.
    However, the implementation of these measures presents institutional and socioeconomic
    challenges. Firstly, the fragmentation of rural land ownership in China inhibits
    the development of large-scale farming, while land consolidation projects and
    livestock relocation require significant financial investments, with relatively
    low agricultural production benefits and weak incentives for producers. Additionally,
    despite the potential for high economic returns in urban industries to drive industrial
    upgrading and pollution control, this also necessitates standardized and regulated
    systems. Below, we will analyze the opportunities and feasibility of theses measure
    and how improve policy to address these challenges. The Chinese government has
    promoted the scale of cropland tenure and the reclamation of homesteads through
    rural land system reform. With urbanization and rural aging, an increasing number
    of farmers voluntarily leasing their cropland to new farming models, which has
    reached 37 Mha as of 201939. Simultaneously, the hollowing of villages has become
    widespread in central and western China as the younger generation has moved to
    urban areas. In this context, over the past decade, the potential rural reclamation
    area has exceeded 4000 ha40. However, additional efforts will be needed to address
    potential challenges such as land quality monitoring and maintenance of supporting
    infrastructure in response to potential land quality degradation resulting from
    the separation of land ownership and management rights. An annual investment of
    approximately US$21 billion has been dedicated to transforming fragmented croplands
    into large-scale, high-standard farms. The Chinese government has already initiated
    a cropland consolidation initiative with the ambitious goal of achieving 72 Mha
    of high-standard croplands equipped with modern management and facilities in the
    forthcoming decades41. These efforts align with our urbanization projections and
    underscore the importance of conducting suitability assessments for high-standard
    farmland construction while avoiding high-cost, non-scalable areas. To enhance
    this endeavor, the government should refine the financing model by utilizing land
    tenure as collateral in land reform and increasing subsidized interest rates for
    high-standard farmland construction. Collaboration with institutions like the
    Agricultural Development Bank can further stimulate investments in cropland. For
    livestock relocation, the Chinese central government requires newly-built livestock
    farms to be surrounded by a certain area of croplands for manure recycling. This
    ensures livestock relocation is not required. Where livestock farms have already
    been built, livestock relocation costs could be subsidized by government. It should
    be noted that cross-province relocation of livestock only accounts for 8% of livestock
    needed to be relocated (Fig. S4), suggesting the bulk of the relocation is estimated
    to occur within provinces, increasing the feasibility of livestock relocation
    due to farmers may not want to move far away from home. With the increase of large-scale
    croplands, having both crop and livestock production located close to each other
    becomes more viable for rural households, further aided by a reduction of implementation
    barriers by governments. In any case, subsidies supporting the relocation of livestock
    are vital, and central government has recently provided subsidies worth about
    US$ 750 million per county to improve the coupling of livestock and crop production
    as a measure to reduce environmental pollution originating from manure management
    in 100 demonstration counties42. Upgrading industrial and waste treatment facilities
    are essential measures responding to an increase in urban population. A continued
    focus on the implementation of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act would
    further aid the reduction of Nr losses from the human system. Meanwhile, the newly
    implemented policy “Co-reduction of pollution and carbon emission” would link
    efforts for pollution control with the target of carbon neutrality (NetZero) while
    pursuing urbanization objectives. This will place a focus on measures which can
    achieve both goals in a cost-effective and overall cost-beneficial manner. These
    policy goals have already put Nr reductions on a good pathway, enhancing the feasibility
    of halving Nr pollution in the context of urbanization. Further actions to include
    measures and policies with relevance for Nr pollution reduction into wider considerations,
    including linking to climate change mitigation and NetZero targets, would contribute
    to achieving a range of SDGs in China and beyond. Agricultural practices, urban
    growth, and urbanization management strategies in China exhibit considerable regional
    diversity. Regions such as the North China Plain, the Middle and Lower Yangtze
    River Plain, and the Sichuan Basin are anticipated hotspots of swift urbanization
    and are crucial food-producing areas. As of 2017, these areas primarily relied
    on small-scale farming characterized by excessive nitrogen fertilizer usage and
    suboptimal NUE levels of 20%-40%43. Additionally, these regions are known for
    monogastric animal farming, leading to lower NUEs compared to northern areas where
    ruminant farming prevails44. These specific regions are instrumental in curtailing
    nitrogen pollution, including NH3 and N2O emissions as well as runoff losses.
    They present the most favorable benefit-to-cost ratio for intervention measures,
    underlining the urgency for expeditious land system reforms, upscaling to large-scale
    production, and embracing integrated crop-livestock methodologies. Eastern China,
    in the throes of accelerated urbanization and industrial expansion, is critical
    in the battle against nitrogen pollution, especially concerning NOx emissions.
    The burgeoning populations in coastal urban conglomerates, notably the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
    cluster, predict a persistent surge in pollution emissions. In spite of the overarching
    developmental gains, this area is bracing for the urbanization-induced pollution
    repercussions. It is imperative for the region to steadfastly enhance domestic
    pollution treatment capabilities and enforce stringent emission controls, potentially
    through industrial evolution and structural overhauls. Conversely, the Northwestern
    and Northeastern regions, despite their sparser populations, have triumphed in
    establishing extensive agricultural production, achieving NUEs above 50%—a feat
    unmatched by other regions in China43. With population dips and diminished urban
    stressors on the horizon, these territories require sustained land reforms and
    agricultural fine-tuning, although their prospects for nitrogen pollution mitigation
    are relatively constrained. In the undulating terrains of Southwestern China,
    urbanization rates are slated to climb notwithstanding an overarching population
    contraction. This terrain, representing 10% of the country’s arable land, faces
    challenges in transitioning to large-scale farming by 2050 due to its topographical
    constraints (Fig. S3b). Compounding these challenges are the poorer soil conditions
    relative to other regions. It’s crucial to recognize that expanding agricultural
    landholdings here may inadvertently intensify soil erosion and nitrogen depletion45.
    To bolster nitrogen utilization efficiency and fortify food security, innovative
    strategies—such as altering crop compositions or strategic relocation of cultivable
    land—are worth investigating. Consequently, under existing policies, the scope
    for curtailing nitrogen emissions in these Southwestern highlands is circumscribed.
    We propose nuanced urbanization management strategies tailored to China’s diverse
    sub-regions, advocating for a unified national framework that endorses meticulously
    coordinated and well-managed urbanization. This strategic blueprint, emphasizing
    agricultural refinement, domestic pollution abatement, and industrial modernization,
    holds immense promise for propelling socio-ecological progress and realizing sustainable
    development ambitions. Limitation Urbanization can affect dietary and production
    structures, which in turn can affect the use and loss of nitrogen. On the one
    hand, the increasing proportion of meat consumption due to income increase of
    urban residents can increase the production of livestock farming and the cultivation
    of animal feed such as soybeans. China has launched forage/soybean revitalization
    plans to address this issue. The increase in livestock farming can lead to more
    nitrogen loss, but the replacement of food crops with forage/soybean cultivation
    can increase NUE and reduce nitrogen loss44. In addition, the demand for aquatic
    products, which accounted for about 4% of China’s food intake in 2021, is increasing,
    leading to an increase in aquaculture production. Generally, economic growth increases
    the demand for food and the use of nitrogen fertilizers, leading to more nitrogen
    pollution. However, at the same level of economic development, urban residents
    consume less food per capita than rural residents46. This complex process makes
    it difficult to predict how dietary changes will affect nitrogen cycling in urbanization
    in China. Moreover, this paper is more focused on well-managed urbanization that
    is defined at the beginning for only biophysical changes other than social and
    economic aspects. Thus, the extended implications of urbanization on future agricultural
    production structures and nitrogen pollution via dietary structure changes are
    beyond the scope of our present study and will be explored in future research.
    We concur that the health ramifications of Nr emissions extend beyond diseases
    related to PM2.5, encompassing ailments arising from such as the toxicity of NOx
    compounds. Our choice to use PM2.5 concentrations as a quantifiable indicator
    of health benefits stems from the impact it has on human health and the availability
    of comprehensive assessment data. PM2.5 is universally acknowledged for its severe
    and far-reaching health consequences. The health effects of PM2.5 air pollution,
    which include conditions such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and a range
    of chronic and acute respiratory diseases, have been meticulously evaluated. These
    evaluations are employed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for calculating
    the financial toll of air pollution-related health issues. While we recognize
    the value in assessing the toxicity of NOx for a more nuanced understanding of
    health benefits, we faced modeling and methodological limitations that precluded
    us from distinctly parsing out the unique toxic effects attributable to NOx and
    other potential constrains. This study utilized a sophisticated multi-modeling
    methodology to evaluate both air and water pollution. In particular, the PM2.5
    concentrations appraised for the year 2017 demonstrated a strong alignment with
    the actual measured values, as evidenced by a correlation coefficient ranging
    from 0.54 to 0.73 (Fig. S10). However, the validation of national-scale water
    quality models remains a complex endeavor, largely due to the limited availability
    of comprehensive time series data and information across various river sections.
    Consequently, we juxtaposed Nr water pollution levels with findings from preceding
    studies. Our analysis inferred that approximately 15.6 Tg of Nr was deposited
    into aquatic systems, a figure calculated through the CHANS model. This estimate
    closely mirrors the findings presented by the IMAGE-GNM (15.4 Tg)47 and DNDC models
    (14.5 Tg)10. Moreover, our projection of Nr discharge into the ocean, derived
    using the WNF model, was approximately 6.8 Tg. This figure is conservative when
    compared to the 11.7 Tg suggested by the IMAGE-GNM model but exceeds the estimates
    put forth by the MARINA model (0.83-1.18 Tg)48 and the official report from China,
    which stands at 2.3 Tg49. Despite the inherent uncertainties surrounding the extent
    of Nr contributions to marine environments, we ascertain our estimation outcomes
    to be within reasonable bounds. It’s pivotal to note that this research primarily
    aims to discern the effects of proficiently orchestrated urbanization on nitrogen
    flows into rivers and oceans, rather than to quantify nitrogen loss on a national
    scale. The synergistic application of CHANS and WNF models ensures a harmonious
    simulation of nitrogen transit processes, implying that variations in nitrogen
    inputs into watercourses and seas are solely attributable to shifts in emission
    origins consequent to well-managed urbanization. Methods Data sources High Resolution
    Remote Sensing Monitoring of Chinese Land Cover 2018 (HRRSM-CLC2018, 30 m) was
    derived from the Resource and Environment Data Cloud Platform (REDCP, https://www.resdc.cn/),
    which was used to model land use change with urbanization, as well as accompanying
    potential of large-scale cropland. The digital elevation model (DEM) data used
    for slope and elevation extraction was derived from Geospatial cloud (http://www.gscloud.cn/).
    Records of urban and rural population were derived from county-level census data
    set in China County Yearbook 2018, and provincial level statistical data from
    National Bureau of Statistics of China 2018 (http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2018/indexch.htm).
    Records of livestock were derived from the Agriculture Organization’s online statistical
    database (FAOSTAT, https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EMN), National Bureau
    of Statistics of China 2018 (NBSC, https://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=C01&zb=A0D0O&sj=2018)
    and Agricultural Pollution Source Census of China in 2017 (APSCC2017)25. The FAOSTAT
    and NBSC provides comprehensive survey data for livestock species in 2017. The
    APSCC2017 provides grided data of livestock numbers, production and excretion
    to cropland. Quantification of changes in urban and rural areas, farm size and
    crop-livestock recoupling Changes in urban and rural area by migration with related
    changes in urban areas and crop land areas were simulated from 2017 onwards using
    the High-Resolution Remote Sensing Monitoring of Chinese Land Cover 2018 (HRRSM-CLC2018)
    at a 30 m x 30 m resolution as the base line. Migration and land use change modeling
    were based on following assumptions: (1) urban expansion has the highest priority,
    and can occupy surrounding grids, including cropland; (2) rural land reclamation
    is used to supply cropland; (3) no limits on migration distance. Spatial land
    use data and county level urban/rural population data were transformed to gridded
    data. The change of urban and rural grids at a resolution of 30 ×30 m from 2017-2050
    was predicted by the ArcGIS platform (version 10.6), aligning the number of people
    on urban and rural grids with the urban and rural populations in 2050 as projected
    by the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects (UNWUP, https://population.un.org/wup/Download/),
    respectively. More details of the prediction of urban expansion and land reclamation
    are in Supplementary Methods. Urbanization level of the county (UL) in 2050 was
    defined as the ratio of urban residents to the total residents in the county:
    $${{{\\mbox{UL}}}}_{{{\\mbox{t}}}}^{2050}=\\frac{{{{\\mbox{UP}}}}_{{{\\mbox{t}}}}^{2017}+{\\Delta
    {{\\mbox{UP}}}}_{{{\\mbox{t}}}}}{{{{\\mbox{UP}}}}_{{{\\mbox{t}}}}^{2050}+{\\Delta
    {{\\mbox{UP}}}}_{{{\\mbox{t}}}}+{{{\\mbox{RP}}}}_{{{\\mbox{t}}}}^{2017}-{\\Delta
    {{\\mbox{RP}}}}_{{{\\mbox{t}}}}}$$ (1) where \\(U{P}_{t}\\) and \\(R{P}_{t}\\)
    are the urban and rural residents in the tth county, respectively. \\(\\varDelta
    U{P}_{t}\\) and \\(\\varDelta U{P}_{t}\\) are the changes on urban and rural residents
    during 2017-2050, respectively. Potential for Large-scale farming Potential large-scale
    cropland is predicted and mapped on county scale, assuming it could be connected
    to the maximum extent, as long as not divided by other land uses, such as rivers,
    roads, villages, etc. The simulation method for potential large-scale farming
    by ArcGIS is described in detail in the Supplementary Methods. The planting structure
    of crops in this process remains consistent with year 2017. Crop-livestock coupling
    Livestock was relocated based on the distribution of large-scale farming by spatial
    analysis and linear optimization. FAOSTAT and NBSC were used to estimate the livestock
    numbers. Details of conversion of pig units are shown in the Table S2, Fig. S4
    and Supplementary Methods. The relocation process only takes into account livestock
    from agricultural areas, and the livestock production structure remains consistent
    with the year 2017. Livestock relocation potential (LRPi) is used to determine
    if the livestock in the ith grid exceeds the demand of the crop or the carrying
    capacity of the arable land, and to quantify the potential for moving out or in
    of livestock. $${{LRP}}_{i}={{LCP}}_{\\max }-\\frac{{{LI}}_{i}}{{{LCA}}_{i}},{if}.{{LRP}}_{\\max
    }\\le {{DN}}_{i}2$$ $${{LRP}}_{i}={{DN}}_{i}-\\frac{{{LI}}_{i}}{{{LCA}}_{i}},{if}.{{LRP}}_{\\max
    } > {{DN}}_{i}$$ (3) $${{DN}}_{i}={F}_{t}^{2050}+{M}_{i}$$ (4) where \\({{LCP}}_{\\max
    }\\) represents the maximum manure Nr carrying capacity of cropland (around 144 kg N
    ha−1)50, LIi represents the total manure Nr (kg) in the county where the ith grid
    is located (kg), LCAi represents the areas of large-scale cropland where the ith
    grid is located (km2), DNi represents the crop demand for Nr, calculated as the
    sum of optimal fertilizer application rates (Fi, kg ha−1) and manure Nr returned
    to cropland (Mi, kg ha−1) in 2050. We assume that Fi equals the synthetic fertilizer
    inputs after cropland scale-up, as estimated in Eq. (7). Given reducing the cost
    of demolition and construction, the livestock would be prioritized to move from
    the N overload grids into the surrounding grids. Statistics Tool in ArcGIS was
    used to calculate the priority of all non-overload grid (LPi) with a value of
    1 to the overload grid (LRPi ≤ 0) and 0 to the other grid (LRPi > 0), respectively.
    $${{LP}}_{i}=\\frac{{N}_{i}}{20\\times 20}$$ (5) where Ni is the number of overloads
    grids within surrounding 400 (20×20) grids and ith grids in the central of 400
    grids. Based on the following linear programming, grids are selected for livestock
    moved in. $${maxmize}\\,n\\,$$ $$s.t\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{n}{{LRP}}_{j,r}\\le
    {PLR}{P}_{r}$$ (6) where j is the serial number for non-overload girds in descending
    order according to LRPj,r, r represents province, PLRPr is the livestock relocation
    capacity in the rth province. If the provincial livestock volume exceeds the provincial
    carrying capacity, it is assumed that the maximum livestock volume is matched
    on all the large-scale cropland. The excess livestock volume is moved to the nearest
    province, and the method of spatial allocation is the same as the intra-province
    relocation. Livestock cannot be relocated to provinces with restricted development
    based on the vulnerability level of the surface water, as determined by the Ministry
    of Agriculture and Rural Affair. According to the National Key Research and Development
    Program in China, we assume that crop-livestock coupled would reduce 60% NH3 in
    manure management51. This reduction can be achieved through various measures,
    including slurry acidification, covering slurry storages, and using closed manure
    composting technologies. Additionally, when manure is recycled to replace synthetic
    fertilizer, the NH3 emission factor is assumed the same. Furthermore, due to strict
    water pollution regulations, direct discharge of NO3- is assumed not allowed in
    205051. Table S3 and Table S4 provides further details on the optimization of
    various parameters. Quantification of changes in urbanization on Nr pollution
    Large-scale farming can increase the adoption of new technologies such as 4 R
    nutrient stewardship (i.e., the right rate, type, time, and place of fertilizer
    application), optimal irrigation techniques, and organic amendments, resulting
    in reduced fertilizer application and improved nitrogen use efficiency. This,
    in turn, can reduce fertilizer NH3, N2O and N loss to water. The estimation of
    influence of farm size on fertilizer use and NH3 emission followed Duan et al.,
    202152 and Wang et al., 202253. The Eqs. (7) and (8) are used to calculate fertilizer
    use and NH3 emission on county scale in 2050. $$\\begin{array}{c}{F}_{t}^{2050}=\\exp
    \\left(\\alpha \\times {Ln}{X}_{t}^{2017}-\\alpha \\times {Ln}{X}_{t}^{2050}\\,\\right)\\times
    {F}_{t}^{2017}\\end{array}$$ (7) $${E}_{t}^{2050}=\\exp \\left(\\beta \\times
    {Ln}{X}_{t}^{2017}-\\beta \\times {Ln}{X}_{t}^{2050}\\right)\\times {{EF}}_{t}^{2017}\\times
    {F}_{t}^{2050}$$ (8) where Ft represents the synthetic fertilizer input in tth
    county (kg). Xt stands for the farm size in tth county (ha). Et represents the
    total NH3 emission in tth county (kg), EFt represents NH3 emission factor in tth
    county (%), α, β refers to estimated coefficients of large-scale farming from
    Duan et al.52 and Wang et al., 202253. Meanwhile, the management of livestock
    would be optimized through mitigation measures, such as surface coverage, frequent
    removal of manure from animal houses, and low crude protein feeding to reduce
    ammonia volatilization. We cited the research findings of Zhang et al., 202054,
    which showed that a combination of different measures in three stages of feeding
    (including low-protein feed and phased feeding), housing (including ventilation
    systems, floor mats, dry manure removal, and solid-liquid separation), and manure
    management (including anaerobic digestion, and high-temperature composting) can
    achieve a 60% reduction in NH3 emissions from the livestock farming process in
    China. Since there is no direct report on the relationship between farm size and
    other Nr loss to water, the study assumed constant loss efficiency runoff he leaching
    in the field. The reduction of agricultural nitrogen losses may be underestimated
    here. In addition, the adoption of a crop-livestock coupled system can ensure
    that all manure is collected and applied to cropland51. An inverted U-shaped relationship
    between urbanization and industrial pollutants in China was identified based on
    Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT)
    model and panel data55,56.The changes of industrial NOx emission (NE) and NO3-
    discharge (ND) with urbanization were estimated as follow: $$\\begin{array}{c}{{NE}}_{g}^{2050}=\\exp
    \\left(\\alpha \\times {Ln}{{NE}}_{g}^{2017}-\\alpha \\times {Ln}{{NE}}_{g}^{2050}\\,\\right)\\times

    et al.55,56 Nitrogen budget The CHANS model36,57 was used in this study to analyze
    the impact of urbanization on the national nitrogen budget (Fig. S1). The CHANS
    model has 14 subsystems (e.g., croplands, livestock, human, industry, forest,
    grassland, atmosphere, water bodies, etc.) that covers all the nitrogen budget
    calculations in this paper. The baseline of nitrogen budget in 2017 was built
    first, then urbanization scenarios with corresponding parameters adjusting and
    urban/rural subsystem developing integrated into CHANS model to forecast the nitrogen
    cycle and loss in 2050. Urban/rural population change and accompanying difference
    of domestic pollution treatment efficiency are the key parameters which affect
    nitrogen budgets through urbanization. Details about the data sources, parameters
    and modeling methods can be found in Table S3 and Table S4. Annual nitrogen emissions,
    encompassing NH3, NOx, N2O, and NO3-, derived from each subsystem of the CHANS
    model, were allocated to counties using proxy parameters, relevant methodology
    is detailed in Supplementary Methods and Table S5. Quantification of reductions
    in Nr losses on air PM2.5 Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with
    Chemistry (WRF-Chem)58 was used to estimate the changes on surface concentrations
    of PM2.5 based on NH3 and NOx emission reduction through well-managed urbanization.
    The baseline simulation in 2017 included all anthropogenic and natural emissions.
    Anthropogenic emissions data of air pollution was taken from the MEIC 2017 for
    mainland China59,60 and the MIX Asia emission inventory for the rest of the WRF-Chem
    domain61 (www.meicmodel.org). The NH3 and NOx emission inventories were replaced
    with the results of this study, thus enabling the assessment of the impact of
    urbanization-reduced NH3 and NOx emissions on PM2.5. More details for model simulation
    and validation are given in the Supplementary Methods. The population-weighted
    PM2.5 concentration (PWC), which considers population as weights at different
    exposure to PM2.5, is used to reflect the impact of PM2.5 concentrations on the
    national population. It is defined as: $${PWC}=\\frac{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}({P}_{i}\\times
    {C}_{i})}{P}$$ (11) where PWC is population-weighted PM2.5 concentration in China,
    Pi is the population in the ith grid, n is the total number of grids in the China,
    Ci is the PM2.5 concentration in the ith grid, and P is the total population of
    China. Quantification the reductions of Nr output to sea A water network-based
    framework (WNF)62 was used to estimate the changes on Nr output to sea based on
    Nr loss to surface water through well-managed urbanization. WNF is parsimonious
    solution for surface water modeling that incorporates topology structure, hydrological
    and biogeochemical processes. And it ensured that Nr transport processes were
    simulated in complete agreement and the loss of Nr to ocean is only influenced
    by the changes in N loss to surface water. Reactive nitrogen loss to surface runoff
    (SR) depend on the Nr input to the grid and the loss coefficient determined by
    the type of land use. $${SL}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{k=1}^{m}{{Input}}_{k}\\times
    {\\alpha }_{k}$$ (12) where Inputk represent Nr input from the kth source, covering
    all of anthropogenic and natural sources, i.g. cropland grid input includes fertilizer,
    deposition, irrigation, livestock manure, human excretion, cropland BNF and straw
    recycling.αk is the surface runoff loss coefficient36. Details about Nr transfer
    process estimation during surface water based on WNF are given in the Supplementary
    Methods. Quantification of costs and benefits of urbanization Nr related implementation
    cost with urbanization includes the costs of construction and operation of waste
    treatment facilities, as well as the costs of agricultural management optimization
    and industrial upgrading. To assess unit cost of sewage/garbage facilities construction
    (CSCost and CGCost), over 200 actual investment projects for waste treatment were
    collected from the Public-Private Partnership Service Platform under the National
    Development and Reform Commission of China (www.chinappp.cn). All cost data from
    the literature or web were measured in constant 2017 US$ (i.e., 100 CNY = US$
    16.16). The numbers of projects and unit investment costs for each region are
    given in Table S6. In addition, the referenced daily unit costs of operating wastewater
    treatment plants, landfill plants and waste incineration plants (US$ 0.2, 6.5
    and 23.0 t−1) were used to calculate the operating costs63,64,65. Annual construction
    and operation costs of waste treatment facilities (CFC and OFC) were estimated
    on county scale as follows: $${CFC}=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{t,n}\\left[\\left({SD}\\times
    {{CSCost}}_{t}+{GD}\\times {CG}{{Cost}}_{t,n}\\times {R}_{n}\\right)\\times {{MP}}_{t}\\right]/{YS}$$
    (13) $${OFC}=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{t,n}\\left[\\left({SD}\\times {{OSCost}}_{t}+{GD}\\times
    {OG}{{Cost}}_{t,n}\\times {R}_{n}\\right)\\times {{MP}}_{t}\\right]\\times 365$$
    (14) where t represents >2800 counties, SD and GD represent the daily production
    of sewage and garbage per capita (0.15 t capita−1 and 1.17 kg capita−1, respectively66,67),
    MPt represents the numbers of migrated people in the tth county (million capita),
    YS represents the time span from 2017 to 2050, equal to 33 years, CSCost and OSCost
    represent the unit cost for the construction and annual operation of sewage treatment
    facilities, respectively (US$ t−1), CGCost and OGCost represent the unit cost
    for the construction and annual operation of garbage treatment facilities, respectively
    (US$ t−1), n represents two types of garbage disposal, i.e. incineration and landfill
    and Rn is the predicted ratio of incineration and landfill (65% and 35%), referring
    to the national 14th Five year plan27, Agricultural management would be changed
    with urbanization in China, with the increasing on the size and scale of farmland
    and coupling crop-livestock production. Implementation cost of this agricultural
    optimization is calculated including homestead reclamation, cropland consolidation
    and livestock relocation. We did not factor in the cost of homeownership for farmers
    relocating to urban areas, as we assume their migration is part of natural process
    of urbanization, not a well-managed measure, and their implementation costs have
    already been balanced through market regulations. Cost data of homestead reclamation
    and cropland consolidation were collected from more than 200 projects in China
    Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation (CLCR, http://www.lcrc.org.cn), and were
    divided into three regions according to migration and economic development levels
    (Table S7). Annual construction cost of rural reclamation and cropland consolidation
    (RRC and CCC) were estimated on county scale. $${RRC}=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{t}{{RA}}_{t}\\times
    {RR}{{Cost}}_{t}/{YS}$$ (15) $${CCC}=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{t}{{CA}}_{t}\\times
    {CC}{{Cost}}_{t}/{YS}$$ (16) where RAt and CAt are the areas of rural reclamation
    and cropland consolidation in the tth county (ha), respectively. YS represents
    the time span from 2017 to 2050 (33 years). RRCost and CCCost are the unit cost
    of rural reclamation and cropland consolidation (US$ ha−1), respectively. The
    cost of livestock relocation (LC) mainly includes the costs of dismantling livestock
    farms and reconstruction new livestock farms. The cost of dismantling a livestock
    farm includes the cost of the farming facilities and the livestock in stock. Cost
    data on facilities and livestock (FLCost and LLCost) were obtained from around
    35 local compensation programs by local governments for the removal of livestock
    farming (Table S7). Reconstruction cost (RCCost) was derived from National Compilation
    of Agricultural Cost-benefit information 201868. $${LC}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{t}\\left[{{PR}}_{t}\\times
    \\left(\\varepsilon \\times {FL}{{Cost}}_{t}+{LL}{{Cost}}_{t}\\right)/{YS}\\right]+\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{t}{{PI}}_{t}\\times
    {RCCost}$$ (17) where PRt represents the livestock that need to be moved out of
    tth county (unit pig), PIt represents the livestock that need to be resettled
    in the tth county (unit pig), ε represents the area of land occupied per unit
    pig (2.3 m2 per pig)69, FLCost and LLCost represents the unit cost for removal
    facilities and livestock (US$), respectively. RCCost represents the unit product
    cost of livestock (US$)68. The implementation cost of industrial upgrading is
    defined as direct expenditure for the abatement measures with urbanization to
    reduce Nr emission. Here we mainly refer to the database and methodology of cost
    assessment from the online Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies
    (GAINS) model (https://gains.iiasa.ac.at/models/index.html) to calculate the abatement
    costs of industrial mitigating Nr emissions. International technology cost data
    have been taken into account and adjusted in GAINS for province-specific conditions
    in China, which take into account Consideration of local labor costs, energy prices,
    costs of by-products, etc. The costing module of GAINS has been described in detail
    by Klimont and Winiwarter70 and Zhang54. The annual cost of implementation (COSTind)
    is calculated as follows: $${IC}=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{t,q}{\\Delta {NR}}_{t,q}\\times
    I{{Cost}}_{t,q}$$ (18) where q represents the forms of Nr losses including NH3,
    N2O, NOx and NO3-, ΔNR is the reduction of Nr through industrial upgrading in
    county scale, ICost is the integrated mitigation unit cost of industrial upgrading
    to reduce Nr emission (US$ per kg N) (Table S8), which is derived from the online
    GAINS model database. The total benefit (TB) of reducing Nr loss with urbanization
    include human health benefit (HBq), ecosystem benefit (EBq) and climate benefit
    (CBq) and economic benefit (EcB) by reducing agricultural inputs and increasing
    total yield as follow: $${TB}=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{q}\\left({{HB}}_{q}+{{EB}}_{q}+{{CB}}_{q}\\right)+{EcB}$$
    (19) where q represents the forms of Nr losses, i.e. NH3, NOx, N2O and NO3-. HB,
    EB, and CB denote social benefits, which need to be defined in conjunction to
    Nr loss and converted for monetization. The impact of Nr loss on human health
    is focused on PM2.5 caused various disease, such as ischemic heart disease (IHD),
    lung cancer (LC) and so on. The impact on environment mainly refers to water pollution,
    i.e. eutrophication and biodiversity loss of aquatic ecosystems, due to NO3- loss
    to water, as well as soil acidification and biodiversity loss of terrestrial ecosystems
    due to Nr emission and deposition. The impact of Nr loss on climate change is
    complex, with benefits from N2O reduction and damages from NH3 and NOx reduction
    that affecting carbon sequestration in forests. The monetary benefit of HB, EB
    and CB were estimated by multiplying social benefits per unit Nr by reduction
    in Nr with the following equations: $${{HB}}_{q}={\\Delta {NR}}_{q}\\times H{{Cost}}_{q}$$
    (20) $${{EB}}_{q}={\\Delta {NR}}_{q}\\times E{{Cost}}_{q}$$ (21) $${{CB}}_{q}={\\Delta
    {NR}}_{q}\\times C{{Cost}}_{q}$$ (22) where ΔNRq is the reduction of qth Nr with
    urbanization in China (kg). HCostq, ECostq and Ccostq are the unit damage cost
    of the three societal benefit due to the qth Nr loss (US$ kg N−1), respectively.
    HCostq was calculated by the cause-specific integrated exposure-response functions
    which can estimate the relative mortality risk from exposure to PM2.511. ECostq
    was derived from the nitrogen assessment in Europe after correction for difference
    in the willingness to pay (WTP) and the purchasing power parity (PPP) between
    EU and China71,72. Ccostq was calculated based on the marginal abatement cost
    (the carbon price) to reduce or increase emission of CO2-eq73. A detailed method
    description of the unit damage cost of varying forms of N loss can be found in
    Table S9. HB, EB, and CB are assigned to counties based on relevant parameters,
    for example, changes in air and water pollution, population density, and VSL were
    used to correct for HB. More details are given in the Supplementary Methods. Agricultural
    management optimization during urbanization increases economic benefit (EcB) by
    reducing agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, and increasing total yield due
    to cropland area increase. $${EcB}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{t}\\left({A}_{t}\\times
    {Y}_{t}^{2017}\\times {PC}+{F}_{t}\\times {FC}\\right)$$ (23) where t represents
    >2800 counties; At is the increasing potential of cropland due to homestead reclamation
    in the tth county (ha); Yt is crop yield in the tth county in 2017 (kg ha−1),
    which is derived from the National Bureau of Statistics (https://www.stats.gov.cn);
    PC is the average market price of the wheat in China in 2017 (US$ 0.38 kg−1),
    which was from National Development and Reform Commission (https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/xxgk/zcfb/tz/201610/t20161021_963246.html);
    Ft represents the reduction of synthetic fertilizer input of tth county related
    to an increased NUE, assoicatied with an increased farm size, as given in Eq.7
    (kg); FC is the unit cost of Nr fertilizer (US$ 0.66 kg N−1), estimated with reference
    to the 2017 urea market price from the price monitoring network of the Ministry
    of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, PRC (http://zdscxx.moa.gov.cn:8080/nyb/pc/search.jsp).

  description: 'Background: The nationally determined contribution (NDC) presented

    as well as forest carbon conservation (REDD+). In addition, climate change constitutes
    one of the greatest threats to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. However,
    the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of native forests have not been incorporated

    using climatic, topographic and vegetation as predictor variables, and (ii) to
    relate SOC stocks with spatial–temporal remotely sensed indices to determine biodiversity
    conservation concerns due to threats from high inter-annual climate variability.
    Methods: We used 1040 forest soil samples (0–30 cm) to generate spatially explicit
    estimates of SOC native forests in Argentina at a spatial resolution of approximately
    200 m. We selected 52 potential predictive environmental covariates, which represent
    key factors for the spatial distribution of SOC. All covariate maps were uploaded

    SOC stock reached 2.81 Pg C (2.71–2.84 Pg C with a probability of 90%) for a total
    area of 460,790 km2, where Chaco forests represented 58.4% of total SOC stored,
    followed by Andean Patagonian forests (16.7%) and Espinal forests (10.0%). SOC
    stock model was fitted as a function of regional climate, which greatly influenced
    forest ecosystems, including precipitation (annual mean precipitation and precipitation

    Kyoto Protocol and REDD+, information derived in the present work from the estimate
    of SOC in native forests can be incorporated into the annual National Inventory

    In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+, information derived in the present

    National Inventory Report of Argentina to assist forest management proposals.
    It also gives insight into how native forests can be more resilient to reduce
    the impact of biodiversity loss. Introduction Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the
    main terrestrial C reservoir and contains three times more C than the atmosphere
    and twice the amount stored in the vegetation (Friedlingsten et al. 2019; Mayer
    et al. 2020). Increasing C storage in forest ecosystems is widely recognized as
    having high climate mitigation potential as well as environmental and socio-economic
    benefits (Lewis et al. 2019; Duarte-Guardia et al. 2020). Also, SOC correlates
    positively with several soil functions (soil fertility, infiltration, structural
    stability, porosity) and biodiversity (e.g. plants, insects, birds, and other
    living things) that support ecosystem services to societies (Mori et al. 2017;
    Trivedi et al. 2018; Duarte-Guardia et al. 2019; Canedoli et al. 2020; Magnano
    et al. 2023). SOC stocks vary as a function of C inputs and outputs resulting
    from ecosystem factors such as climate, soil, and vegetation, land use change
    and the mechanisms controlling C residence times (Jobbágy and Jackson 2000; Don
    et al. 2011; Stockmann et al. 2013; Villarino et al. 2017; Berhongaray and Alvarez
    2019; Duarte-Guardia et al. 2020). Different statistical techniques have been
    applied in the mapping of SOC stocks, including multiple linear regression, linear
    mixed models, geographically weighted regression, regression-kriging and methods
    from the machine learning field to map SOC stocks (Vågen and Winowiecki 2013).
    In Argentina, different simulation models have been used to estimate and project
    SOC changes. For example, Villarino et al. (2014) used the IPCC (Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change) empiric Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches to estimate historical
    SOC stocks and flows in the Pampa Region and Piñeiro et al. (2006) applied the
    Century model to simulate historical SOC changes in temperate grasslands. However,
    there are no antecedents of SOC stocks estimation of native forests in Argentina
    at the country level due to the lack of field measurements over large forested
    areas including SOC, bulk density and rock fragment content, and because high
    spatial variability of SOC requires a very high sampling density to get accurate
    estimates. The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report
    stated that unless there are deep reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
    the goal of limiting warming well below 2 °C and close to 1.5 °C will be out of
    reach (IPCC 2021). In this context, Argentina has reaffirmed its commitment to
    the Paris Agreement, extending the country’s goal regarding the reduction of GHG
    by 2030 and announcing a long-term, low-emission development strategy to achieve
    carbon-neutral development by 2050. Also, the nationally determined contribution
    (NDC) presented by Argentina within the framework of the Paris Agreement is aligned
    with the decisions made in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention
    on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the reduction of emissions derived from deforestation
    and forest degradation, as well as forest carbon conservation (REDD+). The Forest
    Reference Emission Levels (FREL) is one of the pillars of the REDD+ process, which
    defines a baseline to evaluate the performance of a country in the implementation
    of REDD+ activities in terms of reducing GHG in the forestry sector. Despite its
    importance, the SOC stock of native forests has not been incorporated into the
    FREL calculations. For this, it is necessary to generate accurate estimates of
    SOC stocks and changes for the major land-use and management conditions. Thus,
    in the context of international policy agendas on GHG emission mitigation, it
    becomes relevant to develop reliable tools for SOC stock monitoring at a national
    scale (Lal 2011). SOC is the basis for sustain net primary production, which in
    fact is one of the key functional dimensions of ecosystems to maintain biodiversity.
    Furthermore, biodiversity is strongly influenced by climatic and environmental
    variables (Read et al. 2020; Rosas et al. 2023), but also by many other site characteristics,
    where soils are pointed as a key factor (Khaziev 2011). Recently, a close relationship
    between SOC stocks and biodiversity was informed (Peri et al. 2019). In other
    words, changes in abiotic factors as temperature, or radiation, can alter the
    biogeochemical cycles inducing losses or gains in forest SOC and consequent alteration
    of NPP, directly affecting biodiversity (Ma et al. 2013; Sardans and Peñuelas
    2013; De Frenne et al. 2021; Mina et al. 2021). When the species are not able
    to adjust to these changes, populations can decline over time due to temporal
    mismatches (e.g. food and reproduction) (Socolar et al. 2017; Silveira et al.
    2021). High spatial variability in phenology (proxy: vegetation greenness) and
    climate (proxy: soil surface temperature) can reduce the biodiversity loss threat
    by increasing ecosystem resilience when high inter-annual variability occurs (Nystrom
    and Folke 2001; Peaucelle et al. 2019). High spatial variability can be related
    to higher food resources, habitat diversity and climatic refugia, enhancing species
    survival (Thuiller et al. 2005; Oliver et al. 2010). Inter-annual variability
    in the vegetation greenness and seasonality of temperature were previously calculated
    for Argentina (Silveira et al. 2021) using temperature infrared data (Hengl et
    al. 2012) and time series of satellite-based vegetation indices, as the Enhanced
    Vegetation Index (EVI) (Hu et al. 2019). The objectives in this study were: (i)
    to model SOC stocks to 30 cm of native forests at a national scale using climatic,
    topographic and vegetation as predictor variables, and (ii) to relate SOC stocks
    with spatio-temporal satellite-derived indices related to vegetation greenness
    and climate to determine biodiversity conservation concerns due to threats from
    high inter-annual climate variability. We hypothesized that SOC is related to
    environmental gradients, which together with other factors (e.g. abiotic and biotic)
    define the potential biodiversity of one particular forest ecosystem. This work
    aims to assist the Government of Argentina in the quantification of SOC content
    of the country’s native forests to have information in relation to the mitigation
    measures in the National Forest and Climate Change Action Plan. Methods Study
    area and SOC database The Argentinian territory covers 2.78 million km2 area from
    21° 46ʹ to 55° 03ʹ S latitude and from 53° 38ʹ to 73° 34ʹ W longitude that determines
    a wide range of ecosystems, where native forest is grouped in six forest regions:
    Monte forests, Espinal forests, Parque Chaqueño forests, Yungas rainforests, Paranaense
    rainforests, and Patagonian forests (Tierra del Fuego forests and Andean Patagonian
    forests) (Appendix 1). Within these regions we masked the native forest lands
    by using the map of the National Native Forest Inventory (SAyDS 2005) and its
    update (SAyDS 2019). On this map, we used the current definition of the native
    forest implemented by the Argentine Government within the framework of Law 26,331/07,
    which regulates the implementation of institutional policies: “all natural forest
    ecosystems in different stages of development, of primary or secondary origin,
    with a tree cover greater than or equal to 20% and a minimum tree height of 3
    m, including palm groves” (SAyDS 2019). The study area was the total native forest
    that covers an area of 0.468 million km2. We used 1040 forest soil samples (0–30
    cm depth) taken from 2015 to 2021. The mean soil sampling density was 2.37 samples
    per 1000 km2 (Appendix 1). We extracted soil samples (n = 3–9 in randomly selected
    areas) using a hand soil sampler including the first 30 cm depth below litter
    layer. The soil sampler has a known volume, making it possible to calculate soil
    bulk density (SBD). The calculations were conducted with air-dried samples, with
    any particles > 2 mm removed previously by sieving (roots, stones, coarse woody
    debris). The SOC stock (kg m−2) was calculated according to the equation: where
    C is the concentration of SOC (kg 100 kg−1); BD is bulk density (kg m−3), 0.3
    is the thickness of the layer (m), CF is the fraction of coarse fragments in the
    soil sample and 0.01 is a scale factor. Environmental predictors for SOC estimation
    We selected 52 potential predictive environmental covariates, which represent
    key factors for the spatial distribution of SOC content such as climate, topography,
    soil and vegetation (McBratney et al. 2003) (Appendix 2). All covariate maps were
    generated or uploaded to the Google Earth Engine cloud-based computing platform
    for subsequent modelling. The original covariates’ spatial resolution was adjusted
    to a common resolution of 200 m and then masked the native forest lands of Argentina.
    Climatic variables We included climatic variables (more specifically precipitation
    and temperature) because climate influences the SOC stock through the control
    of soil processes such as weathering of parent materials, erosion rate and mineralization/humification
    of organic matter, but also because it affects the net primary productivity (NPP)
    that is essential in SOC accumulation (Gaitán et al. 2019). Data on the mean (1970–2000)
    annual precipitation and monthly mean, minimum and maximum temperature were obtained
    from the Worldclim global database. Derived from these monthly temperature and
    precipitation data, we used a group of 17 maps of bioclimatic variables (Hijmans
    et al. 2005). Additionally, we included the mean annual (2001–2021) of day and
    night land surface temperatures, which were obtained from the Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD11A1 V6 product. Topographic variables Topography
    has the potential to control the spatial patterns of soil properties such as SOC
    and, therefore, models that take topographic variables into account can provide
    better estimates of SOC stocks (McBratney et al. 2003). This is because topography,
    through its influence on gravity, solar insolation and micro-climate, determines
    the water, solute, and sediment fluxes throughout the landscape. A set of 13 morphometric
    maps (Appendix 2) was generated using the Terrain Analysis in Google Earth Engine
    (TAGEE, Safanelli et al. 2020). This algorithm uses the digital elevation model
    (DEM) derived from a radar image from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM,
    Farr et al. 2007) with a 30 m spatial resolution. Soil variables Clay has been
    shown to actively protect organic matter from decomposition by adsorption and
    aggregation, slowing turnover and increasing SOC residence times (Paul 1984; Schimel
    et al. 1985). We also included pH because it controls microbial mechanisms of
    carbon accumulation (Malik et al. 2018). On the other hand, soil water erosion
    influences SOC in two ways: redistribution of C within the watershed, and loss
    of C to the atmosphere (Polyakov and Lal 2004). Therefore, in this study, we used
    national maps of soil clay content, pH (0–30 cm depth) and an Universal Soil Loss
    Equation (USLE)-derived map of soil loss rate by water erosion (Gaitán et al.
    2017) (Appendix 2). Vegetation variables We selected vegetation indices (VIs),
    based on satellite observations, that are mathematical transformations of reflectance
    measurements in different spectral bands, especially the visible (usually red)
    and near-infrared bands, that are widely used to obtain information about vegetation
    characteristics (Jackson and Huete 1991; Bannari et al. 1995). In this study,
    we used 10 different VIs and the Blue, Red and NIR bands (Appendix 2) derived
    from the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data produced by the collection
    2, Tier 1 of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor, available in the GEE platform (GEE collection
    snippet: ee. ImageCollection of ‘LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2’). To calculate the VIs,
    we used the CFmask algorithm to mask the cloud and shadow produced, as well as
    a per-pixel saturation mask (Zhu and Woodcock 2012) and used the mean of the 2015–2021
    period of the bands’ surface reflectance. Random forest (RF) modelling for SOC
    map Lamichhane et al. (2019) review 120 studies designed to correlate environmental
    variables with SOC stock by applying different digital soil mapping techniques.
    Among those methods, Random Forest (RF, Breiman 2001) algorithm performed better
    than other methods in most comparative studies. Therefore, in our study the RF
    algorithm was selected to predict and map the SOC stocks in the native forest
    of Argentina. This algorithm builds a set of regression trees. Each tree predicts
    the result in each pixel, while the final prediction is obtained by averaging
    these values (Breiman 2001). Each tree is built from a bootstrap sample of the
    original data set which allows for robust error estimation with the remaining
    test set, the so-called Out-Of-Bag (OOB) sample. The excluded OOB samples are
    predicted from the bootstrap samples and by contrasting predicted versus observed
    values different metrics can be calculated to assess the performance of the models.
    For each tree, only a subset of the predictor variables is used, which allows
    estimation of the variable importance measured by the mean decrease in prediction
    accuracy before and after permuting a variable. Of our 52 potential covariates,
    in preliminary simple correlation analyses, several showed a low correlation with
    stock SOC and a high correlation with each other. Therefore, due to random choices
    of subsets of variables being made at each split, many noise variables unrelated
    to the SOC stock may impact model’s performance (Bahl et al. 2019). In addition,
    the presence of correlated predictors impacts RF’s ability to identify the strongest
    predictors by decreasing the estimated importance scores of correlated variables
    (Gregorutti et al. 2017). To overcome this problem, we applied the Random-Forest-Recursive
    Feature Elimination (RF-RFE) algorithm (Gregorutti et al. 2017). The RF-RFE selects
    the subset of covariates that is most predictive for SOC stock by a backward selection
    algorithm that iteratively eliminates the weakest explanatory variable from the
    initial 52-covariates model. The performance of the models was evaluated using
    tenfold cross-validation. For doing this, the SOC dataset was randomly split into
    ten sets in which 70% of the data were used for calibration of models and 30%
    for validation. At each step of the RF-RFE algorithm, we calculate the mean of
    tenfold cross-validation root-mean-square error (RMSE) and plotted it versus the
    number of remaining covariates (Appendix 3). Based on this analysis, we finally
    selected 10 covariates for modelling and mapping SOC stocks (Appendix 2). To evaluate
    the performance of the final SOC stock model, three indices were calculated and
    averaged using tenfold cross-validation: root-mean-square deviation (RMSE), mean
    absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). Additionally,
    we computed the lower (Q5) and upper (Q95) percentiles for each pixel, resulting
    in maps of SOC stocks for lower and upper percentiles. The uncertainty was estimated
    as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles (e.g. 90% prediction interval)
    as proposed by Heuvelink (2014). SOC and biodiversity conservation concern To
    determine the biodiversity threats from high inter-annual climate variability,
    we employed the spatio-temporal remotely sensed indices determined by Silveira
    et al. (2021) for the whole of Argentina based on EVI and land surface temperature
    (LST) images from Landsat imagery. We used the final products (GRIDS at 250-m
    resolution): (i) inter-annual variability in phenology based on land surface temperature
    (IAV-LST); (ii) spatial variability based on land surface temperature (SV-LST);
    (iii) inter-annual variability in phenology based on vegetation greenness (IAV-PHE);
    and (iv) spatial variability based on vegetation greenness (SV-PHE). Silveira
    et al. (2021) assumed that: (i) high inter-annual variability in the seasonality
    of land surface temperature and phenology of vegetation greenness threatens biodiversity.
    This high variability can exceed the rate at which organisms are able to adapt,
    disrupting the synchrony of ecological interactions, and thus, the survival of
    the species. (ii) High spatial variability in land surface temperature and vegetation
    greenness enhances resilience to high inter-annual variability. Spatial variability
    provides a higher variety of resources in close proximity by increasing suitable
    conditions during times of climate extremes. Biodiversity conservation concerns
    due to threats from high inter-annual climate variability were considered: (i)
    low concern when IAV is low and SV is high (L); (ii) medium concern when both
    IAV and SV are high, or both IAV and SV are low (M); and (iii) great concern when
    IAV is high and SV is low (H). With these layers, we calculated 3 indices to synthesize
    the biodiversity conservation concerns due to threats from high inter-annual climate
    variability: (i) I-LST = integration between IAV-LST and SV-LST, where IAV and
    LST were classified in high (value = 1 for the area with 50% higher values) and
    low values (value = − 1 for the area with 50% lower values) for each forest region,
    and then calculated the index as I-LST = (IAV-LST − SV-LST)/2; (ii) I-PHE = integration
    between IAV-PHE and SV-PHE, where IAV and LST were classified in high (value = 1
    for the area with 50% higher values) and low values (value = − 1 for the area
    with 50% lower values) for each forest region, and then calculated the index as
    I-PHE = (IAV-PHE − SV-PHE)/2; and finally (iii) I-GLO = global integration between
    I-LST and I-PHE, where I-GLO = (I-LST + I-PHE)/2. We used a mask of native forests
    and forest regions to generate the final GRIDS: (i) a mask of native forests proposed
    by Silveira et al. (2022), which included forested areas taller than 5 m in height
    and 10% in canopy cover, as was defined by Global Forest Change (GFC) data set
    (Hansen et al. 2013). (ii) Forest cover classified into an adaptation of the proposed
    forest regions (Peri et al. 2021a), including Tierra del Fuego forests (TDF),
    Andean Patagonian forests (APF), Monte forests (MON), Espinal forests (ESP), Parque
    Chaqueño forests (PCH), Yungas rainforests (YUN), and Paranaense rainforests (PAR)
    (see Appendix 1). For data extraction, we used the hexagonal binning technique,
    a spatial methodology that offers the advantage of integrating different pixels
    (e.g. averaging values for each pixel) within polygonal regions to effectively
    capture spatial patterns (Battersby et al. 2017). We implemented a hexagonal binning
    process that involved one spatial matrix dividing the territory of Argentina into
    hexagonal areas of 5000 ha each (Rosas et al. 2023). Then, the average values
    of each hexagonal grid were computed. We excluded hexagons that presented less
    than 10% of native forest cover (e.g. < 500 ha in each hexagon). Data analyses
    Our final database included 21,420 hexagons classified in: (i) forest regions
    (TDF = 417 hexagons, APF = 1,487 hexagons, MON = 347 hexagons, ESP = 3,347 hexagons,
    PCH = 13,487 hexagons, YUN = 1,440 hexagons, and PAR = 895 hexagons); (ii) four
    SOC levels (L = low, M = medium, MH = medium high, H = high) representing quartiles
    calculated for each forest region; (iii) seven grids related to LST and PHE, and
    the derived indices. Data were compared through: (i) two-way analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) with SOC levels and forest regions as fixed factors, analysing IAV-LST,
    SV-LST, I-LST, IAV-PHE, SV-PHE, I-PHE, I-GLO; and (ii) simple ANOVAs comparing
    different SOC levels for the same variables, conducted at each forest region individually.
    We used the Fisher test (F) for the ANOVAs, and the means were compared through
    the Tukey test at p < 0.05. Finally, we determined one homogeneity index (HI)
    for each region based on the internal deviation of each SOC level with respect
    to the average value for each biodiversity conservation concern variable (IAV-LST,
    SV-LST, IAV-PHE, SV-PHE). The final index was the average of the four variables
    presented as the percent deviation of the absolutes obtained values. Results SOC
    stock in native forests The values of SOC stocks (to 30 cm depth) at the stand
    level ranged from 2.18 to 17.35 kg m−2 (Fig. 1) and varied considerably across
    forest regions: Patagonian forests (14.45 ± 2.32 mean value in kg m−2 ± standard
    error), Espinal forests (5.21 ± 2.52), Monte forests (2.95 ± 0.68), Parque Chaqueño
    forests (5.16 ± 1.41), Paranaense rainforests (9.73 ± 1.15), and Yungas rainforests
    (7.67 ± 1.44) (Table 1). Total SOC stock of native forests in Argentina was 2.81
    Pg C for a surface of 460,790 km2, where Parque Chaqueño forests represented 58.4%
    of the total SOC stored, followed by Patagonian forests (16.7%) and Espinal forests
    (10%). The estimated uncertainty was 0.10 Pg C (lower limit 5%) and 0.13 Pg C
    (upper limit 95%). Fig. 1 Soil organic carbon stock (30 cm depth) in native forests
    of Argentina Full size image Table 1 Mean (kg m−2) soil carbon contents (SOC)

    model explained 69% of the variance in SOC stock (RMSE = 33.99; MAE = 23.07; R2 = 0.69).
    The 10 most important variables for predicting SOC stocks across all cases were
    as follows: day land surface temperature, temperature seasonality (standard deviation × 100),
    surface reflectance of blue band, mean annual precipitation, maximum temperature
    of warmest month, monthly maximum temperature, precipitation of warmest quarter,
    night land surface temperature, soil water erosion rate, and monthly minimum temperature
    (Fig. 2). Thus, climate variables alone explained most of the variation in SOC
    stocks. Fig. 2 Covariates importance of the top ten variables for soil organic
    carbon (SOC) stock (0–30 cm depth) prediction based on the Random Forest model.
    Acronyms are defined in Appendix 2 Full size image SOC and biodiversity conservation
    concern Biodiversity conservation concern was influenced by the interactions between
    SOC levels and the forest regions (Table 2). Great SOC contents were related to
    high values of IAV-LST and SV-LST and resulting in higher I-LST. While high IAV
    showed a higher biodiversity conservation concern, high SV is associated with
    higher landscape resilience. However, when both variables were combined, I-LST
    indicated that high SOC values had higher biodiversity conservation concern. High
    SOC contents were also related to higher values of IAV-PHE and SV-PHE, and high
    I-PHE values occurred in the lowest SOC contents. Both IAV and SV presented the
    same trend (high biodiversity conservation concern and high landscape resilience).
    However, when both variables were combined, I-PHE indicated that high SOC values
    showed, in average a low biodiversity conservation concern for PHE. Both indices
    combined into a single one (I-GLO) did not present significant differences, but
    had high values (high biodiversity conservation concern and low landscape resilience)
    associated with high SOC values. Table 2 Multiple analyses of variance of biodiversity
    conservation concern, considering levels of soil organic carbon contents (SOC,
    L = low, M = medium, MH = medium high, H = high) at the different forest regions
    (TDF = Tierra del Fuego forests, APF = Andean Patagonian forests, MON = Monte
    forests, ESP = Espinal forests, PCH = Parque Chaqueño forests, YUN = Yungas rainforests,
    PAR = Paranaense rainforests) as main factors Full size table The forest regions
    presented significant differences in the studied variables (IAV-LST, SV-LST, IAV-PHE,
    SV-PHE), but not in the indices (Table 2). The lowest values of IAV-LST were found
    in the driest forest areas (MON and ESP) (lowest threat for biodiversity conservation
    concern), while the highest values were found in rainforests (YUN and PAR) (highest
    threat for biodiversity conservation concern). The lowest values of SV-LST were
    found in the central area of Argentina (ESP and PCH) (lower landscape resilience),
    while the highest values were found in Patagonian forests (APF) (higher landscape
    resilience). The lowest values of IAV-PHE were found in the rainforests (YUN and
    PAR) (lowest threat for biodiversity conservation concern), while the highest
    values were found in the most austral forests of Argentina (TDF) (highest threat
    for biodiversity conservation concern). Finally, the lowest values of SV-PHE were
    found in the driest forest (MON and ESP) and central area of Argentina (PCH) (lower
    landscape resilience), while the highest values were found in Patagonia and Tierra
    del Fuego temperate forests (APF and TDF) (higher landscape resilience). These
    results indicated that the trends for biodiversity conservation concerns varied
    depending on the studied indicator (LST or PHE). Driest areas (MON, ESP and PCH)
    showed different trends compared to rainforests (YUN and PAR) when inter-annual
    variability was considered (LST and PHE). However, the spatial variability of
    both variables (LST and PHE) had similar trends, where the driest areas (MON,
    ESP and PCH) presented low landscape resilience compared to southern forests (APF
    and TDF), which presented the maximum values. It is important to consider that
    these analyses showed significant interactions for all the studied factors (Table
    2), depending on forest region particularities (see Fig. 3, Appendices 4 and 5).
    Patagonian forests (TDF and APF) presented high IAV values (high threat for biodiversity
    conservation concern) at high SOC contents and high SV (enhanced landscape resilience)
    at middle-high SOC contents. Dry and central forests of Argentina (MON, ESP and
    PCH) presented contrasting response in IAV. Generally, higher IAV values (high
    threat for biodiversity conservation concern) were found at higher SOC contents,
    except for MON where IAV-LST was associated with low SOC contents and for PCH
    where IAV-LST was related to middle-high SOC contents. These forests had a similar
    pattern in SV, where high values (enhanced landscape resilience) were related
    to high SOC values. Rainforests (YUN and PAR) showed different patterns than other
    regions: (i) high IAV-LST were related to high SOC contents, but high IAV-PHE
    was related to low SOC contest, and (ii) high SV was related to high SOC values
    in YUN and low SOC values in PAR. These relationships can also be observed in
    the maps of Appendix 4, where the different forest regions presented a significant
    landscape variation for the studied variables (SOC and biodiversity conservation
    concern), but general trends can be observed according to the different particularities
    described before. Fig. 3 Simple analyses of variance for biodiversity conservation

    carbon contents using Tukey test at p < 0.05 Full size image Discussion The estimation
    of forest carbon storage at large scales has attracted considerable interests
    from diverse actors to mitigate climate change and conserve biodiversity (Vågen
    and Winowiecki 2013; Friedlingsten et al. 2019; Peri et al. 2019; Dante-Guardia
    et al. 2020). To our knowledge, this work is the first to quantify the SOC stocks
    in native forests of Argentina at a national scale and to analyse their relationships
    with multiple predictor variables. Thus, the model for SOC (0–30 cm depth) prediction
    accounted for 69% of the variation of this soil property across the whole native
    forest areas in Argentina with values ranging from 2.18 to 17.35 kg m−2. The SOC
    stock was mainly a function of climatic variables related mainly to precipitation
    (mean annual precipitation and precipitation of the warmest quarter) and temperature
    (diurnal land surface temperature, seasonality of temperature, maximum temperature
    of the warmest month, monthly maximum temperature, nocturnal land surface temperature
    and monthly minimum temperature), reflecting the influence of climate on the ecosystem’s
    forests. Temperature influenced SOC by increasing the quantity at lower temperatures
    (Patagonian forests with 14.45 kg m−2) compared to the average SOC stock for the
    entire country (mean of 6.10 kg m−2) and northern forest regions. Some models
    and observations suggest that forests may behave as a C source in response to
    increased decomposition of soil organic matter resulting from temperature increases
    (Davidson et al. 2000). Thus, the temperature sensitivity of decomposing organic
    matter in soil partly determines how much carbon will be transferred to the atmosphere
    because of global warming. This is consistent with Li et al. (2020) who reported
    that soil respiration rates were correlated strongly to air and soil temperatures
    by evaluating seasonal dynamics in contrasting forests across climate gradients.
    The negative effect of temperature on SOC observed is supported by studies in
    other types of ecosystems showing soil organic matter contents decrease with increasing
    temperature (He et al. 2014) due to increased mineralization rates (Kirschbaum
    1995). Rainfall and other related rainfall variables (seasonality) also influenced
    SOC by increasing the quantity of precipitation. It has been demonstrated that
    increased variability in rainfall and soil water content significantly affected
    SOC in forests (Duarte-Guardia et al. 2019). This relationship could be explained
    by the increase in primary productivity due to higher soil moisture and higher
    precipitation values and lower soil temperatures at elevated water supply that
    enhanced SOC storage (Chapin et al. 2002; Adhikari et al. 2014). However, SOC
    is probably controlled by the complex interaction of environmental and biotic
    factors. At the national scale, in this study, patterns of SOC were positively
    associated with mean annual precipitation and negatively correlated with mean
    annual temperature across a diverse range of soils and forest types. This has
    also been documented in grasslands in North America (Burke et al. 1989) and global
    dry-lands (Gaitán et al. 2019). The surface reflectance of the blue band (0.43–0.45
    μm) used to improve sensitivity to chlorophyll represents a proxy of vegetation
    type through estimations of vegetation canopy moisture and greenness indices (Rahaman
    et al. 2017). Thus, SOC may vary in different native forest types across the country
    as a result of the modification of both carbon inputs (e.g. net carbon gain by
    plants) and losses (e.g. microbial decomposition), as was reported previously
    for different vegetation types (Post et al. 1982; Yang et al. 2007). Rasse et
    al. (2005) found that vegetation with higher plant diversity leads to greater
    ANPP and belowground biomass, which enhances belowground carbon inputs and, thereby,
    SOC storage. In contrast, Chen et al. (2018) reported that the negative effect
    of ANPP on SOC in forests and shrublands indicates that the carbon losses associated
    with microbial respiration may offset the positive effect of belowground biomass
    on SOC storage. Also, SOC values related to variability in vegetation characteristics
    may be influenced by topography. For example, in Argentinean Nothofagus forests,
    evergreen species (e.g. less variability in primary productivity) are more common
    in lowlands, near lakes, and locations with alluvial soils, while upland forests
    are generally deciduous (e.g. more variability in primary productivity (Peri et
    al. 2021a). This is consistent with Martínez Pastur et al. (2022) who reported
    that SOC values were highest in valleys of the Andes Mountains and southern Tierra
    del Fuego, ranging from 5.35 to 27.78 kg C m−2 for the whole Patagonia region.
    Soil erosion rate influence negatively SOC. Erosion influences the vertical and
    horizontal distribution patterns of SOC in two ways: redistribution of C within
    the watershed and loss of C to the atmosphere by dispersing the soil, altering
    microbiological activity and inducing mineralization (Polyakov and Lal 2004; Fiener
    et al. 2015). The extent of ecosystems’ capacities to reduce erosion depends on
    many factors related to environmental conditions (amount of precipitation, wind
    velocity, soil properties, slope, and vegetation characteristics) and pressures
    (forest management practices and overgrazing). In Patagonia, Peri et al. (2021b)
    determined a SOC loss by erosion from 85.3 to 250.1 kg C ha−1 year−1. While topsoil
    formation takes thousands of years, erosion can disintegrate all the organic matter
    and nutrients in the topsoil in a few years, dramatically reducing soil productivity.
    This would also explain the higher SOC recorded in the valley or lowland forests
    than on the slopes of the Andes Mountains and in southern Tierra del Fuego. Furthermore,
    forest ecosystems contain a large number of terrestrial carbon stocks globally,
    with more than half allocated in soils (Liu et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019; Martínez
    Pastur et al. 2022; Mayer et al. 2020). It was proposed that SOC stocks and biodiversity
    were closely related (Peri et al. 2019). However, other studies did not find a
    clear relationship between them (Canedoli et al. 2020). Ecosystem services in
    natural ecosystems are underpinned by biophysical structures and processes (de
    Groot et al. 2010), and driven by biodiversity (Balvanera et al. 2006) with positive
    effects (e.g. regulating and supporting services) (Brockerhoff et al. 2017). Biodiversity
    is also important because contributes to soil formation, thereby contributing
    to enhance SOC contents (Canedoli et al. 2020). Many studies showed a positive
    effect of species and functional richness on SOC stocks (Saha et al. 2009; Dawud
    et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019; Magnano et al. 2023), e.g. higher
    plant diversity promotes higher litter accumulation in natural ecosystems (Steinbeiss
    et al. 2008; Lange et al. 2015). These plant–soil relationships play an important
    role in soil C accumulation, where high plant richness results in large litter
    biomass (Steinbeiss et al. 2008; Leff et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2018; Li et al.
    2019). A recent study reported using a prioritization analysis that sites that
    maximize protection of carbon stocks (living aboveground and belowground biomass,
    litter, dead wood, and active SOC) had high values for biodiversity conservation
    (all threatened terrestrial mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, with high
    threat status and endemism), and potential sources of clean water. By conserving
    30% of the territory, it is possible to achieve 80% of the conservation targets
    for biodiversity and water provisioning, and 50% of the conservation targets for
    carbon stocks (Frank et al. 2023). Climate change constitutes one of the greatest
    threats to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services, where model predictions
    warn about significant impacts for the next decades (Sala 2000; Seidl et al. 2014;
    Thom et al. 2019). It was found that climate change impacts will be spatially
    heterogeneous and nonlinear due to differences in climate, edaphic conditions,
    and competitive interactions among other factors (Frey et al. 2016; Creutzburg
    et al. 2017; Thom et al. 2019). Defining this spatial heterogeneity can assist
    land managers and policymakers to prioritize areas where a reallocation of resources
    for climate adaptation could be concentrated (Seddon et al. 2016; Thom et al.
    2017). Identifying spatial–temporal patterns of land surface temperature and vegetation
    greenness at the landscape level is important for decision-making in forest management
    and biodiversity conservation (Silveira et al. 2021), e.g. identification of areas
    to implement multi-objective adaptive management (e.g. land-sharing strategies)
    or areas to priories protection efforts (e.g. creation of new natural reserves)
    (Peri et al. 2022; Rosas et al. 2022, 2023). Forests with high seasonality of
    temperature or inter-annual variability in the phenology may require management
    actions that improve spatial variability to enhance resilience to biodiversity
    loss from high inter-annual variability (Silveira et al. 2021). In contrast, areas
    where spatial variability is higher, are more adequate for protection because
    this is where species can persist if inter-annual variability increases due to
    climate change (Martínez Pastur et al. 2020a; Trew and Maclean 2021; Ye et al.
    2023). In our analyses, we found significant differences among levels of SOC and
    forest regions in Argentina, both for inter-annual and spatial variability. Similarly,
    Silveira et al. (2021) found differences for different eco-regions in Argentina
    and suggest that species living in different areas face dissimilar threats from
    variability in temperature seasonality and associated changes in the ecosystem
    phenology. As we found for the different SOC contents and forest regions, they
    also highlighted the weakly correlation between land surface temperature and phenology.
    This suggests the importance of mapping both variables when assessing the threats
    from phenological and seasonal variations (e.g. areas with high inter-annual variability
    had a strong threat, and low spatial variability meant that resilience is low).
    If we agree that high SOC content is a good proxy for biodiversity (e.g. Peri
    et al. 2019), the results are consistent with many other findings for forests
    around the world (Fischer et al. 2006; Mori et al. 2013; Schmitt et al. 2020;
    Messier et al. 2022). However, our landscape analyses showed contradictory results.
    Inter-annual variability in phenology based on land surface temperature followed
    the described trend (e.g. rainforests presented higher biodiversity conservation
    concern than dry forests), while the inter-annual variability in phenology based
    on vegetation greenness showed the contrary. Besides, high resilience was found
    in the Patagonian forests indicating more stable ecosystem functioning due to
    climate stability at low temperature regions (Forest et al. 2015; Payette and
    Frégeau 2019; Barbé et al. 2020). These mismatches in the general trends and the
    different forests regions can be explained due to the different ecosystem functionality
    across Argentina (Silveira et al. 2022), forest structure and composition (Silveira
    et al. 2023), and human-derived drivers of land use change (Martinuzzi et al.
    2021), that greatly influenced native forests. Argentina implemented a specific
    national legislation to protect native forests (law 26,331/07) to promote sustainable
    uses and more effective conservation strategies (Martinuzzi et al. 2018; Martínez
    Pastur et al. 2020b). Unfortunately, the resulting land use planning incorporates
    little biodiversity explicitly information (Guida-Johnson and Zuleta 2013; Lorenzo
    et al. 2018; Silveira et al. 2022). However, these plans are updated every five
    years, thus, better knowledge about SOC contents (Martínez Pastur et al. 2022),
    as well as patterns of inter-annual and spatial variability of vegetation greenness
    and land surface temperature, can assist to identify those areas where many species
    may have difficulty to persist under more extreme climate events (Silveira et
    al. 2021). Under the negative effects of climate change on native forests, these
    tools can be used to identify vulnerable areas where the slow adaptation process
    implies that adaptive forest management strategies require long lead-in times
    (Maciver and Wheaton 2005; Thom et al. 2019). We need to promote in situ biodiversity
    persistence to avoid negative impacts on future provisioning ecosystem services
    (Bellard et al. 2012; Thom et al. 2017; D’Orangeville et al. 2018). Conclusions
    In the context of climate change mitigation, managing forest ecosystems to conserve
    existing carbon stocks in soils and to remove carbon from the atmosphere by adding
    to stocks is an important issue. In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+ that
    aim to conserve ecosystems and their carbon stocks and achieve land degradation
    neutrality, information derived in the present work from the estimate of SOC in
    the native forests can be incorporated into the annual National Inventory Report
    of Argentina. As Argentina strives to find measures to achieve vital climate targets,
    this work indicates the importance of considering forest soils in improved management
    practices to increase climate change mitigation under forest management practices.
    Increasing forest soils’ capacity to store carbon and reduce net GHG emissions
    is crucial for the Argentinean’s target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
    The inclusion of SOC as biodiversity surrogates allowed to improve conservation
    planning through positive correlation with remotely sensed data indices that capture
    the inter-annual and spatial variability of vegetation greenness and land surface
    temperature. These indices analysed together can be used to identify areas of
    high biodiversity threat and resilience to phenological and seasonal variability.
    Thus, results highlight the importance of long-term monitoring to know the processes
    that determine the magnitude of SOC variation to forecast how it may operate as
    climate and land use change in the future and to assist forest management proposals
    to strengthen the resilience of native forests in order to minimize biodiversity
    loss. Availability of data and materials The datasets used and/or analysed during
    the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

  description: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The condition of the watershed area, particularly
    the Tabunio Watershed, is one with priority treatment due to the condition of
    the land where it is located, which qualifies for the “very high recovery” category
    with a critical land area of 19,109.89 hectares. Moreover, the diminishing water
    absorption also results in flooding during the rainy season and drought in the
    dry season. Environmental damage in the Tabunio Watershed is exacerbated by the
    existence of traditional gold mining and has become a concern for many parties.
    With this in mind, the perceived increase in natural disasters, such as floods,
    landslides, and droughts from year to year requires an evaluation of land degradation
    in the Tabunio Watershed. METHODS: The objective of this study was to monitor
    and simulate the spatial and temporal aspects of land degradation in the Tabunio
    Watershed. It was suggested that a complete land degradation index be developed
    to capture the spatial and temporal aspects of land degradation between the years
    2005 and 2020. This index integrates land use land cover, vegetation coverage,
    soil erosion, and soil moisture content. FINDINGS: The proposed comprehensive
    land degradation index in this study demonstrated that (a) the land degradation
    index, which successfully monitored the spatio-temporal aspect of land degradation
    (kappa coefficient > 0.73 and overall accuracy?> 86 percent), is regarded as having
    high accuracy. (b) In comparison to the individual indices, the land degradation
    index is capable of revealing land degradation in a more comprehensive manner.

    most extreme year. CONCLUSION: The proposed comprehensive land degradation index
    method is capable of describing the spatial and temporal aspect of land degradation
    from 2005 to 2020 in the watershed area. Moreover, the proposed approach shows
    that the level of land degradation from 2005 to 2020 normally increases, recording
    the extreme years as the 2010s. In addition, in most years, the amount of land
    degradation was moderate, only few of which had severe or extreme degradation.

    • Soil C sequestration can be limited by plant productivity and soil quality.
    • We evaluated limiting factors for 20 farms testing C sequestration practices.
    • Nutrient deficiencies, low plant productivity, low microbial activity and poor
    structure were common. • Resolving the limiting factors may improve both food
    production and C sequestration. Abstract Soil carbon (C) sequestration is an important
    process for mitigating climate change while improving soil productivity. At the
    same time, it presents challenges for nutrient availability and changing agricultural
    practices. The aim of this study was to survey the challenges and limitations
    found on pioneering farms testing C sequestration using a Finnish network of farmers
    testing carbon farming practices. A combination of satellite monitoring, on-site
    measurements and soil analysis was used to quantify and evaluate soil physical,

    three stages: plant growth is constrained by crop choices which limit leaf area

    Like most matters in agriculture, soil carbon (C) sequestration is in theory simple,
    but in practice very complex. In theory, soil C stocks are built up by either
    increasing C inputs or decreasing C loss, which results in a gradual increase
    of stocks until they reach a new equilibrium (Chenu et al., 2019). Methods for
    C sequestration can be divided into those that mainly increase C inputs (cover
    crops, leyfarming, etc.) and to those that mainly decrease C loss (no-till and
    rewetting of peat soils) (Paustian et al., 2019). Estimates for C sequestration
    vary, but are in the range of 300–2000 kg C/ha/year (Paustian et al., 2019), presenting
    a considerable potential sink at the global scale (Chenu et al., 2019, Paustian
    et al., 2016). Considering the historical loss of C stocks, there is a large deficiency
    in soil C, resulting in reduced productivity (Lal, 2004, Mattila, 2023). This
    could indicate that sequestration could continue for decades to rebuild the lost
    stock and that doing so would also increase soil productivity. Soil C sequestration
    appears to be a highly scalable climate change mitigation strategy with additional
    benefits to food security (Lal, 2004, Paustian et al., 2016). At the same time,
    the strategy has been challenged from both productivity and soil chemistry viewpoints.
    On the productivity side, the land sparing vs. land sharing argument has been
    raised (Lamb et al., 2016). As some of the C sequestration strategies require
    taking land out of crop production temporarily (leyfarming) or include animal
    agriculture (improved grazing practices), land sparing advocates present an alternative
    approach, where certain areas are reforested or put to “carbon crops”, while food
    is produced in a smaller land area by a combination of plant-based diets and input-intensive
    plant production. Countercriticism against this approach involves looking at the
    sustainability of intensive plant production (i.e. land degradation) and the low
    success rate of reforestation projects. The land sparing vs. land sharing argument
    has been ongoing for decades and is unlikely to be resolved now (Fischer et al.,
    2014). A related argument in the production side is that as soil organic matter
    is not only C but also contains macronutrients N, P and S (Kirkby et al., 2011,
    Tipping et al., 2016), soil C sequestration would require additional fertilizer
    inputs, resulting in both increased emissions (Guenet et al., 2021, Jarvie et
    al., 2017) and excessive use of limited nutrient resources (van Groenigen et al.,
    2017) to maintain soil in a favorable C:N ratio for plant production and further
    C stabilization (Kirkby et al., 2014). A related problem is the C saturation concept,
    where soil C stocks are thought to be limited by the availability of mineral surfaces
    (clay and fines) (Cotrufo et al., 2019). Once the mineral surfaces “become saturated”
    with C, additional C sequestration is thought to occur only by particulate OM
    accumulation, which is also easily decomposed by microbes. The original saturation
    limits (Hassink, 1997) have been challenged and updated (Cotrufo et al., 2019,
    Matus, 2021). As a result, some authors have challenged the existence of the whole
    saturation concept and found that mineral-associated OM is a fixed fraction (86%)
    of the total C stock, irrespective of the SOC level or soil properties (Begill
    et al., 2023). Therefore, the limiting factor for SOC stocks may be the availability
    of plant biomass to build the SOC, i.e. a photosynthetic limit (Janzen et al.,
    2022). There is a considerable “yield gap” between what plants could produce,
    if they could utilize all the rainfall and sunlight, and what is achieved in practice
    (Sylvester-Bradley and Wiseman, 2005). The biomass potential for many temperate
    regions is in the range of 20 t/ha (Sylvester-Bradley and Wiseman, 2005), whereas
    the achieved crop yields are 4–8 t/ha (FAOSTAT, 2023). The reasons for this yield
    gap vary by location, but can be classified under the category of soil quality.
    Soil quality, productivity, and health are ways to describe the capacity of soils
    to support plants in producing biomass from available sunlight and water resources.
    Various approaches have been developed to quantify soil quality, typically containing
    chemical (nutrients), physical (structure) and biological (soil organisms) components
    (Lal, 2016). Poor soil structure can limit yields considerably, yield losses are
    up to 20–30% and root growth can be reduced by 50% (Keller et al., 2019), even
    in conditions that are far from the maximal potential yield. To achieve near-maximum
    yield, crops need to utilize all the available moisture in the soil profile, therefore
    poor rooting reduces the maximal yield considerably (White et al., 2015). Poor
    rooting can also be a major constraint to C sequestration, as roots contribute
    more to the stable C pools than does aboveground residue (Kätterer et al., 2011).
    Improving plant growth conditions can simultaneously improve soil C sequestration,
    both directly by increasing biomass C input and indirectly by improving root growth
    and microbial activity (Colombi et al., 2019). At the same time, C loss should
    be managed to keep the stored carbon in the soil (Chenu et al., 2019, Paustian
    et al., 2016). Anoxic and waterlogged conditions can destabilize C (Li and Schaeffer,
    2020), resulting in increased decomposition (in addition to poor plant growth
    (Oosterbaan, 2021)). Many agricultural currently have poor soil quality, with
    approximately 40% of soils subject to land degradation (Prăvălie et al., 2021).
    The main causes of degradation are aridity and erosion, but especially in Europe,
    C loss, compaction, contamination, sealing, and biodiversity decline (Montanarella,
    2007). Soil C loss can result in loss of soil quality. In a survey of UK fields,
    38% of arable fields were considered degraded based on their low C:Clay ratio
    (Prout et al., 2021). In a survey of farmers testing C sequestration, participants
    saw compaction, wetness, drought, low yields, and low SOM as their main motivations
    to start C sequestration (Mattila et al., 2022). In the same survey, only 15%
    of farmers considered nutrient deficiency as an limiting factor, although almost
    all sampled fields were deficient in at least one nutrient (B and Mn deficiencies
    were the most common at 70–80% of fields) (Mattila et al., 2022). Overall, improving
    soil health is a key motivation for farmers participating in soil C sequestration
    (Carlisle, 2016). Identifying the full spectrum of soil health problems and developing
    management options for fixing them can be highly beneficial for C sequestration,
    crop yields, and motivating farmers to participate in C sequestration. Although
    soil C sequestration is conceptually simple, it is limited by a large number of
    factors. The main limitations that have been studied are N limitation (Kirkby
    et al., 2014, van Groenigen et al., 2017) and saturation of mineral surfaces (Cotrufo
    et al., 2019). In this study, we aimed to investigate the limitations more broadly,
    focusing on a whole range of factors that can limit C sequestration on actual
    farms attempting to sequester C. We mapped these factors into a conceptual evaluation
    framework, which focuses on the three stages of C sequestration: 1) increased
    photosynthesis, 2) microbial growth, and 3) decreased C loss (Fig. 1). Each stage
    can be considered as a “bundle of soil processes” which then together deliver
    the soil function of C sequestration (Bünemann et al., 2018). The processes are
    partially driven by management (Van de Broek et al., 2019) and partially by local
    soil quality (Bünemann et al., 2018). To identify the limitations related to local
    soil conditions, we used a combination of soil sample analysis, satellite monitoring,
    and on-site measurements. We chose a subset of 20 of the 105 carbon farms in the
    Carbon Action trial and monitored them annually (40 fields). The initial starting
    state of the fields was analyzed in 2019 and 2020 to identify potential issues
    that can limit C sequestration. This study presents the results of this overview.
    A follow-up study is underway to determine the effect of 5 years of carbon management
    (2019–2023) on soil quality and productivity and what was the impact of the limiting
    factors on measured and modeled C sequestration. Mapping the actual challenges
    facing farmers who test C sequestration practices can broaden the discussion on
    the limits from the valuable but theoretical critique based on N, mineral C saturation,
    and photosynthesis to identify soil factors that can be managed to improve both
    C sequestration and crop yields. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download

    carbon stocks through increased photosynthesis, which feeds increased microbial
    growth, which results in carbon stabilization and possibly improved plant growth,
    restarting the cycle. The spiral represents the gradual improvement of soil processes
    over time. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Carbon sequestration framework and study
    fields A starting point for our analysis was a simplified conceptual framework
    of soil C sequestration (Fig. 1), based on recent improvements in the understanding
    of soil C processes, especially the microbial efficiency mineral-stabilization
    (MEMS) model (Zhang et al., 2021). Instead of considering soil C as undecomposed
    plant residue, newer process models describe plant residue being solubilized to
    dissolved C, which is then either sorbed to mineral surfaces or used by microbes
    for growth (Woolf and Lehmann, 2019). The microbial residue is then again resupplied
    to the dissolved C pool and may sorb to mineral surfaces with higher affinity
    than the original residues (Sokol et al., 2019). Microbial carbon use efficiency
    (CUE) determines, how much microbial biomass is produced from plant C inputs and
    controls C stabilization (Kallenbach et al., 2019, Sokol et al., 2019). High nutritional
    quality residue (C:N), stable moisture conditions, and minimal disturbance promote
    a high CUE (Bailey et al., 2019, Kallenbach et al., 2019). In addition, roots
    and root exudates have a higher CUE than the aboveground residue (Kätterer et
    al., 2011, Sokol et al., 2019). Disturbances may destabilize mineral-associated
    C and subject it to decomposition (Bailey et al., 2019, Li and Schaeffer, 2020).
    The simplified framework of Fig. 1 presents soil C sequestration as a three-stage
    process in which plant photosynthesized C is supplied to soil microbes which stabilize
    it on mineral surfaces. Limitations to each of these processes can be identified
    and surveyed at the field level to identify bottlenecks in the entire cycle. The
    process is described as a cycle, as increased C storage can improve soil productivity
    (Lal, 2016, Prout et al., 2021), ideally resulting in more photosynthesis and
    restarting the improvement cycle. The first step of photosynthesis may be limited
    by primary resources to plant growth (sunlight, water, nutrients) (Sylvester-Bradley
    and Wiseman, 2005), or by factors influencing plant access to these, such as poor
    structure (Rabot et al., 2018). Indicators for photosynthesis include the plant
    leaf area, aboveground biomass and the roots and root exudates supplied belowground.
    These are then processed by the second step of microbial growth, which may be
    limited by poor soil conditions (gas transport, compaction, drought) or factors
    influencing CUE (temperature, moisture, substrate quality). Microbial growth is
    represented by microbial biomass, which is stabilized on soil mineral surfaces.
    Finally, to form more stable organic matter N and S are also needed (Kirkby et
    al., 2014, Tipping et al., 2016). A high or low C:N ratio may limit stabilization
    through nutrient limitation or increased decomposition (Blanco et al., 2023).
    Soil should also be protected from waterlogging, which may destabilize the accumulated
    C (Li and Schaeffer, 2020). The end result of the process should be a soil clay:C
    ratio that promotes plant growth, but does not result in increased C decomposition
    (Prout et al., 2022, Prout et al., 2021). Many of the indicators could be placed
    in different parts of the cycle, for example, S deficiency or poor structure limits
    plant growth, microbial activity, and C stabilization. The indicators were placed
    as such to represent the overall cycle and to have a balanced number of indicators
    for each category. The framework does not provide a quantitative estimate of the
    sequestration limit, but instead can be used to explore the limitations qualitatively.
    A similar approach has earlier been applied for management effects of soil C sequestration
    (Van de Broek et al., 2019), whereas our approach focused on the on-site soil
    quality effects. Because most of these processes are excluded even in the most
    detailed C cycling models (Zhang et al., 2021), this semiqualitative analysis
    can provide a complementary view of the limitations and guide further modelling
    work. We applied the framework to the experimental fields in the Carbon Action
    experiment (Mattila et al., 2022). Twenty farms were chosen from the set of 105
    farms for annual monitoring. The 20 farms were chosen to represent different carbon
    farming practices (cover crops, diverse grass in rotation, subsoiling, improved
    grazing, and soil amendments), soil textures, and farming systems (cereal farming,
    mixed livestock, and vegetables). The selected 20 farms had a similar distribution
    of C than the overall 105 farm set (interquantile range 2.5–4.0% in the original,
    2.7–4.2% in the subset). In addition, the farmer planned carbon farming measures
    were required to have received a positive evaluation by an expert panel, as described
    in Mattila et al. (2022). The sampled farms were located in a 200 ×500 km area,
    which covered the main agricultural areas of Finland. A more detailed description
    of the farms is presented in Nevalainen et al. (2022). Each farm had two fields,
    resulting in 40 units of observation for the analysis. This analysis is based
    on the first two years of sampling (Mattila and Heinonen, 2021, Mattila, 2020).
    Each indicator was compared against published norms, and the analyzed fields were
    classified according to how the indicator compared against norms (i.e. sufficient,
    deficient, excessive). This approach is similar to that used to interpret soil
    nutrient analyses (Hatfield, 1972, Mattila and Rajala, 2022). We reported the
    results as percentage of fields affected and identified the main bottlenecks for
    improvement within each category. Description of indicators, methods and the classification
    thresholds are presented in Table 1. The following sections describe the data
    sources and calculation methods used for each indicator. Table 1. Indicators for

    Plants require at least 14 essential plant nutrients, which can be classified
    as macronutrients (N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg and Na) and micronutrients (Cu, Zn, Mn,
    Fe, B, Mo, Si, Ni and Cl) (Kirkby, 2012). Although they are classified as macro-
    and micronutrients (based on the typical concentrations in plants), a deficiency
    in any of them will have major effects on plant growth and therefore C sequestration.
    The study fields were sampled to a depth of 17 cm using a 16-mm diameter corer.
    In total, 45–60 cores per field were collected around a 10-m radius from three
    GPS locations, and the samples were pooled for analysis. A commonly used multiple
    nutrient analysis (Mehlich-3 extraction) was used to quantify nutrient concentrations
    (Mehlich, 1984). In addition, pH was determined from a 1:1 water:soil extract.
    The measurements were compared with interpretation norms collected for a previous
    survey (Mattila and Rajala, 2022) and converted into indices, where <1 is deficient
    and >1.5 is excessive. In addition, two combination indicators were calculated
    from the results: cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil P saturation. The cation
    exchange capacity describes the capacity of soils to store and release nutrients
    for plants and was estimated from pH and the concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, and
    Na (Logan Labs, 2018). Phosphorus saturation is the molar ratio of P to Fe and
    Al (i.e. P/(Fe + Al)) and is a measure of P availability (Dari et al., 2018).
    A low P saturation can result in P deficiency in plants, resulting in lower yields
    and especially less root biomass (Lopez et al., 2023). A high P saturation results
    in nutrient runoff and reduces C inputs to mycorrhizal fungi (Poeplau et al.,
    2016) and may release soil stored C (Bailey et al., 2019, Cui et al., 2022). In
    addition to P excess, S deficiency was considered an indicator of poor C stabilization
    (Kirkby et al., 2014). Soil C, N, and texture were determined from samples collected
    before the experiment (Mattila et al., 2022). Total C and N were measured from
    a dried and sieved soil sample using an elemental analyzer (dry combustion Leco
    CN-2000, 0.15 g sample size, Eurofins Laboratories). Concentrations of C and N
    were used to calculate and evaluate the C:N ratio. Two threshold values were used
    for classification: C:N less than 10 indicates rapid decomposition and C:N above
    15 indicates possible N unavailability and only partial decomposition (Blanco
    et al., 2023). Soil texture was determined by dispersion and sieving (Hartge and
    Horn, 2009) (Seilab Laboratories, Finland). Texture and C values were used to
    estimate C storage potential of fine fractions (Matus, 2021) and soil quality
    (Prout et al., 2021). The C storage potential was based on the fines fraction
    of <63 µm and the regression equation of Matus: maxC= (0.36 + (Silt+clay 63 µm))/8.11.
    The soil quality was evaluated by the Clay:OM ratio and four recommended classes
    (Prout et al., 2021): <13 is degraded, 10–13 moderate, 8–10 is good, and above
    8 very good. This was presented as an soil health index: SHI = (R – 1/13) / (1/8
    – 1/13), where < 0 is degraded, > 0.48 is good, and > 1 is very good (Prout et
    al., 2021). 2.3. Plant growth: satellite and on-site biomass monitoring Plant
    growth was monitored using two approaches. First, above-ground biomass was measured
    in July with a 33 ×33 cm quadrat (5 samples per field, cut from the same GPS points
    as from which the soil samples were taken). This indicated the biomass accumulated
    during the early growing season. To obtain an overview of photosynthesis over
    the entire growing season, we calculated the daily interception of photosynthetically
    active radiation (intercepted PAR). This was calculated from the leaf area index
    (LAI) and PAR, which were obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring
    Service and Sentinel-2 datasets as described in (Nevalainen et al., 2022). To
    estimate the interception of radiation, the leaf area index (LAI) was converted
    to the fraction of PAR (fPAR) captured with equation: fPAR = (1- e−0.59 LAI),
    where 0.59 is an average light extinction coefficient for wheat (Liu et al., 2021).
    The daily PAR was then multiplied with the daily fPAR values and aggregated to
    monthly values. In addition, a cumulative intercepted-PAR value was calculated
    for each field to evaluate how well the fields could capture plant available sunlight
    over the entire growing season. 2.4. Structure, drainage, and soil moisture The
    soil structure was used to evaluate plant root growth and microbial activity (gas
    transport). It was evaluated using three methods: a) visual evaluation of soil
    structure (VESS) to identify compacted layers, porosity, and roots, b) surface
    0–5 cm soil bulk density to calculate porosity and c) water infiltration (mini
    disk) to evaluate soil pore continuity and surface soil structure. Each field
    had 5 test pits dug to a depth of 35 cm, and a soil profile was extracted from
    the undisturbed sidewall of the pit. Following VESS guidelines, the soil profile
    was evaluated using five criteria, and each soil layer was classified on a scale
    of 1 (excellent structure) to 5 (severely degraded structure) (Ball et al., 2007).
    The results for each layer were aggregated with a weighted average (layer thickness
    times score divided by total profile thickness). In addition, the depth to the
    first compacted layer was recorded, as this represented the soil volume that was
    easily accessible to roots. Three bulk density cores (diameter 70 mm, depth 50 mm)
    were collected from each field GPS point center, oven dried, and weighed together.
    Then the porosity was then calculated from the bulk density using the assumption
    of 2.65 kg/l in solid earth (Hartge and Horn, 2009). The porosity was also investigated
    through water infiltration. A mini disk infiltrometer was used to measure the
    water conductivity (Dohnal et al., 2010). A negative pressure head (15–20 mm water
    head suction) was used to exclude the largest pores, i.e. the soil had to ”pull”
    the water out from the infiltrometer. Five infiltrometer readings were made on
    each plot, and the results were converted to unsaturated water conductivity using
    soil texture specific van Genuchten tables (Dohnal et al., 2010). 2.5. Microbial
    activity and growing conditions Microbial activity for each field was evaluated
    using two indicators: microbial activity from a CO2burst drying-rewetting experiment
    (Franzluebbers, 2020) and microbial rate coefficients based on moisture and temperature
    (Cruz-Paredes et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021). In the CO2burst, soil is first
    dried and then rewetted to 50% water filled pore volume, resulting in a burst
    of microbial activity (Bailey et al., 2019, Birch, 1958). We sampled 30 ml of
    soil from the samples collected for nutrient analysis and added 9 ml of water,
    to achieve the appropriate wetting amount (Woodsend laboratories, 2019). The development
    of CO2 was monitored for 24 h using an IRTH CO2 sensor-datalogger respirometer
    (Solvita, USA). The concentration was converted to the mass of CO2-C via the ideal
    gas law and the molar mass of C. CO2 released during the burst is an indicator
    of microbial activity, soil labile C amount, and soil OM quality (Bailey et al.,
    2019, Franzluebbers, 2020, Haney et al., 2012). It is a versatile indicator of
    soil health and N release (Haney et al., 2018). However, the burst experiment
    is done under optimum moisture and room temperature, which are not that common
    in field conditions. To evaluate the actual growing conditions of the microbes,
    the sites were fitted with real-time soil moisture and temperature sensors (Meter
    group, Teros-12 sensors), which were connected to LoraWan IoT radio transmitters
    (Datasense Oy, Finland). In the spring of 2020, two sensors were installed in
    each field to a depth of 9 cm to measure the soil profile from 3 to 15 cm depth.
    The sensors measured soil moisture and temperature every 30 min and transmitted
    the data to Field observatory -cloud storage (Nevalainen et al., 2022). Temperature
    and moisture were used to evaluate rate coefficients for microbial growth at an
    hourly resolution. However, the dataset had gaps due to sensor battery failures
    and intermittent connection losses. Therefore, the first step was to correct the
    datasets to an hourly series without gaps. This was done using the R software
    environment (R Core Team, 2022). First, the time-series with the least gaps was
    chosen as the primary series. Then, a linear model was fitted with least squares
    to estimate the primary series from the secondary series. The model was used to
    fill all gaps that were greater than 48-h. The zoo-library was then used to interpolate
    the remaining small gaps and to convert the time series to an hourly resolution
    (Zeileis and Grothendieck, 2005). After gap filling, two rate constants were calculated.
    The first rate constant was a Ratkowsky model (Ratkowsky et al., 1983), which
    was fitted to Scandinavian conditions and to bacterial and fungal growth rates
    (Cruz-Paredes et al., 2021). It integrates respiration and CUE to estimate microbial
    net growth. The Ratkowsky model relates temperature to growth by RT = [a∙ (T-Tmin)
    ∙ (1 – e b∙(T-Tmax))]2. The authors in Cruz-Paredes et al. (2021) reported only
    Tmin , Tmax  and Q10, so a and b coefficients were calculated from the Q10 and
    the presented results. This resulted in estimates of a=0.98, b=0.15, Tmin = −7.8
    °C and Tmax = 47 °C. (The low Tmin reflected the adaptation of microbes to the
    cold Scandinavian climate.) The second Rw coefficient was the moisture rate constant.
    For this, the MEMS model moisture rate submodel (Zhang et al., 2021) was used:
    Rw = (1 + c∙e-dW)−1, where c=95.4, d=11.3 and W is a relative moisture term. The
    volumetric water content V was converted to relative moisture by W = (V-Wres)
    / (Wfc – Wres), where Wres = residual water content and Wfc = moisture at field
    capacity (Zhang et al., 2021). The field capacity was estimated from the soil
    texture using pedotransfer functions fitted to local conditions (Kätterer et al.,
    2006). The overall microbial growth rate coefficient was calculated by normalizing
    the RT to the optimum RTopt at T=32 °C and then multiplying the two rate coefficients
    R = RT/RTopt ∙ Rw. The hourly rate coefficient time series were then aggregated
    to monthly average values. In addition, the total microbial rate was added over
    time for each field to evaluate the growing conditions for each field. Earthworms
    can be an aggregate indicator of microbial abundance because they use microbes
    as their food source (Angst et al., 2022). We sampled earthworms during field
    measurements and the soil structure evaluation. A soil block of 20 ×10×35 cm was
    dug up and hand crumbled. Earthworms were sorted and counted in a manner similar
    to the 60 minute worms protocol (Stroud, 2019). 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Short and weak growth are the main limitations for increasing photosynthesis Evaluating
    the first step in the analytical framework (Fig. 1) revealed widespread nutrient
    deficiencies that potentially limit crop growth and photosynthesis. Nutrient limitations
    are the most widely studied limitation to soil productivity. For C sequestration,
    the availability of both N and P has been raised as a potential problem (Spohn,
    2020, van Groenigen et al., 2017), but plant growth can also be limited by a wide
    variety of other nutrients (Kirkby, 2012). Our study soils had a considerable
    number of different nutrient deficiencies and some excesses (Fig. 2). The cation
    exchange capacity (CEC) and pH were in a favorable range for most soils, indicating
    potential for a balanced crop nutrition. However, a fifth of the fields (22%)
    had a CEC lower than 10 cmol/kg, indicating possible problems with the storage
    of cationic nutrients. These fields could benefit from increasing the CEC through
    organic matter increases. In general, the fields had low Ca, high Mg and low K,
    but also 33% of the fields had all cationic nutrients in ranges considered to
    be ideal. Therefore, liming would not improve growing conditions on most fields.
    High Mg might result in structural problems and low K limits biomass production
    (Dontsova and Norton, 2002, Seth et al., 2018). P and S were mainly deficient,
    with 50% of samples deficient in P and 74% in S. Approximately 16% of the soils
    had excessive P (based on P-saturation limit of 10%). Of the micronutrients, Cu,
    Mn (95% of fields), and B (85% of fields) were mostly deficient, with Zn deficiencies
    only in two fields. Fe levels were high in general and excessive in 21% of the
    fields. Based on the farmer notes, the farmers did not correct for deficiencies
    by fertilizing with micronutrients (apart from Mn on 5 farms) or extra S (except
    on 2 farms). Overall, at the start of the experiment, there were considerable
    nutrient limitations, and as they were not corrected by fertilization, they may
    have resulted in lower plant growth. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    the Carbon Action trial fields in 2019–2020 based on Mehlich-3 extraction. The
    results are indexed to the recommended low and high nutrient concentration norms
    (less than 1.0 is low, over 1.5 is high). The analysis of intercepted sunlight
    (PAR) over time and across fields revealed more gaps between potential photosynthesis
    and that achieved on individual fields (Fig. 3). This photosynthesis yield gap
    consisted of two components: i) limited photosynthesis time and ii) weak photosynthesis
    during the peak growing season. For spring cereals, photosynthesis was high only
    in June and July, effectively utilizing only two months of the five-month growing
    season. In contrast, grass fields used the whole growing season from May to October
    but had notable differences in how well they could use the peak summer radiation.
    Well-managed pastures could maintain leaf area and utilize sunlight well, but
    if grass was cut for hay, it resulted in low photosynthesis until the crop recovered.
    In the dry year of 2020, some crops did not recover from the first cut until September,
    effectively losing half of the growing period. Aggregated over the growing season,
    a two-fold difference was observed between the highest and lowest PAR interception
    (998 vs. 495 MJ m−2, median 759 MJ m−2). A similar difference was found for cumulative
    vegetation index (155 vs. 80 NDVI days, median 118). For the biomass sampled in
    July, the difference was much larger than that from satellite monitoring (factor
    18, minimum: 600 kg/ha and maximum: 10800 kg/ha, median 4160 kg/ha). The biomass
    was influenced by the sampling time and the timing of grass cutting. However,
    even in spring cereal crops, the variation in biomass was 980–9760 kg/ha, indicating
    large differences in soil productivity between fields. As most Finnish fields
    are continuously monocropped with spring cereals (Peltonen-Sainio and Jauhiainen,
    2019), there is considerable room for improvement in the intercepted PAR by increasing
    the period and intensity of photosynthesis. The wide variation in the productivity
    of sites highlighted, that the problem cannot be solved by only increasing the
    photosynthesis period, but the plant growing conditions during peak photosynthesis
    should be improved as well. Download : Download high-res image (238KB) Download

    rectangles represent a high-yielding spring cereal field, and the red triangles
    a pasture. As photosynthesis may be the overall limiting factor for soil C sequestration
    (Janzen et al., 2022), our results show that it is possible to double the photosynthesis
    in the poorest fields, if they could maintain the leaf area necessary to capture
    sunlight as well as in the best fields. The leaf area is constrained by both management
    practices (timing of seeding, cutting hay or using cover crops) and plant resources
    (water, nutrients). 3.2. Limitations in transferring plant C to microbes: growing
    conditions for roots and microbes The next stage in the conceptual carbon cycle
    is the transfer of photosynthesis products to soil organisms, which process them
    to more stabilized forms. This process was limited by both poor soil structure
    and periods of drought, resulting in suboptimal growing conditions for the microbes.
    Based on the evaluation of soil profiles, when averaged over whole fields, 45%
    of the fields were slightly compacted (VESS > 3.0, median VESS 2.80), with only
    two fields in excellent structural condition (VESS < 2.0). However, 154 (77%)
    of the 200 evaluated profiles in 2020 had compacted layers (VESS ≥ 4) in the topsoil.
    The compacted layer commonly started at the historical plowing depth (16 cm),
    but the starting depth varied considerably (median 16 cm; interquartile range
    6–21 cm). The relatively shallow compaction layer limited root growth and water
    infiltration and subjected the surface soil to periodic drought. If plant roots
    would mostly operate in the noncompacted layer, there would be a factor of 3 difference
    in depth of the root active layer between the shallowest and deepest soil (not
    considering the 46 soil pits, where compaction was not found at all). Based on
    the survey results, there is considerable potential for improving plant rooting
    depth by improving soil structure. Because roots are converted to more stabilized
    C with higher efficiency than aboveground residue (Kätterer et al., 2011, Sokol
    et al., 2019), shallow compaction is a major bottleneck for C sequestration. A
    compacted surface soil limits water storage capacity and infiltration, resulting
    in more runoff and shorter periods of optimum soil moisture for plants and microbes.
    In the studied soils, the saturated water conductivity ranged from 1 to 72 mm/h.
    Only two soils had moderate infiltration rates (> 20 mm/h), with the remaining
    either moderate-slow (27 soils; 5–20 mm/h) or slow (11; < 5 mm/h). In individual
    measurement points, the variability was even higher, from 0,19 mm/h to 121 mm/h
    (630-fold difference). Poor infiltration increased fluctuation between periods
    of waterlogging followed by periods of drought. Based on the soil moisture and
    temperature time series, soils had considerable variability in the conditions
    for microbes during the growing season (Fig. 4). At the beginning of the measurements
    in May 2020, the soils were wet and cold, and temperature limited microbial activity.
    In June, temperatures increased, but many soils dried during spring tillage and
    seeding. As a result, half of the soils had relative moisture contents of less
    than 50%, which halved the microbial growth rates (Zhang et al., 2021). From October
    onwards, soil temperatures began to decrease, resulting in both lower microbial
    activity and lower variability in activity. Starting in October, a considerable
    fraction of the soils started to become waterlogged (i.e. moisture was higher
    than field capacity for long periods of time). In November, half of the soils
    had moistures higher than field capacity, resulting in high risk of hypoxia (Parent
    et al., 2008) and C destabilization (Bailey et al., 2019, Li and Schaeffer, 2020).
    This situation was resolved in December, when soil freezing lowered the moisture
    and low temperatures slowed microbial activity. Calculated over the year, there
    was a 2.5-fold difference in the average microbial growth rates. The lowest values
    were observed on spring cereal fields grown on sandy soils, while the highest
    values were observed on cereal fields in moist clay soils. Overall, soil moisture
    limited microbial activity and presented a key limitation for converting plant
    residue to microbial biomass. Globally, lack of rainfall has been identified as
    a major limiting factor for soil carbon and nutrient cycling (Manzoni et al.,
    2012), but it was surprising to find the same in a humid and cold climate such
    as Finland. The largest microbial activity gap (difference between highest and
    lowest fields) occurred in June, due to excessive soil drying. Intermittent drying
    can also reduce microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), resulting in large losses
    of C with subsequent wetting (Tiemann and Billings, 2011). Download : Download

    of soil moisture and temperature on microbial growth rates in the 40 study fields
    based on rate-modifying coefficients. Yellow rectangles represent a cereal field,
    while the red triangles represent a pasture. The nutrient deficiencies and excesses
    found on the fields may further limit CUE. The addition of P, N and S has been
    found to speed plant residue decomposition and slow the loss of soil C (Kirkby
    et al., 2014). Deficiency of N and S may limit the formation of fine fraction
    associated soil organic matter (Kirkby et al., 2011, van Groenigen et al., 2017),
    but the results for P have been inconclusive. Adding P to soil may result in increased
    decomposition, which exceeds the increased C input from extra yield (Poeplau et
    al., 2016). It may also limit plant supply of C to mycorrhizal fungi (Poeplau
    et al., 2016) and decrease the microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) of soil microbial
    communities (Cui et al., 2022). Farmer fertilizer application practices did not
    improve the situation. The farmers applied similar amounts of P fertilizer (median
    11 kg/ha; 1–42 kg P/ha), irrespective of the soil P status, which may result in
    extra P build up. Six fields already had excessive P and 8 were applying fertilizer
    although P levels were sufficient. This may result in build-up of available P,
    which may decrease CUE further. In addition, Mn and B deficiencies were very common
    among the research fields, but there is no clear consensus on the effect of their
    deficiencies on microbial growth. B is necessary for root tip growth and overall
    cell wall integrity (Wimmer et al., 2020); therefore, a deficiency may reduce
    C input to microbes. B fertilization increased soil microbial activity in one
    experiment, but it is unclear what the mechanism behind this is (Bilen et al.,
    2011). In contrast, the mechanisms of Mn are well studied, as it is an essential
    nutrient for fungi (Li et al., 2021). Because fungi have a higher CUE than bacteria
    (Cruz-Paredes et al., 2021), Mn deficiency might reduce CUE. At the same time,
    a high Mn supply increases decomposition (Li et al., 2021). Further research is
    needed to evaluate how common micronutrient deficiencies and high Fe levels in
    the studied soils would influence both microbial activity and C stabilization
    (Bailey et al., 2019, Li et al., 2021). Unsurprisingly, the large variation in
    photosynthesis and microbial growing conditions was reflected in a 5-fold difference
    in the microbial activity in a drying-rewetting CO2-burst (30–144 mg CO2-C/l;
    median 54 mg/l). The CO2-burst describes both microbial biomass, substrate availability
    for microbes, and N cycling (Bailey et al., 2019, Franzluebbers, 2020). Most of
    the soils (84%) could be classified as medium-low, 5% as high, 5% as low and 6%
    as medium (Woodsend laboratories, 2019). The highest microbial activity was observed
    in a pasture field, which also had high photosynthesis and good microbial growing
    conditions during the season (triangles in Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The poor structure,
    periodic drought and waterlogging, and highly variable amount of microbial activity
    were also reflected in the number of earthworms (0–160 m−2; median 40 m−2). Only
    two fields had earthworm population densities of more than 150 m−2. The highest
    earthworm numbers were found only in fields with either pastures or manure application.
    The high variability and the overall low number of earthworms indicated a hostile
    environment for both earthworms and roots in the soil profile. Earthworms promote
    C stabilization by eating microbes and depositing them in organomineral mixtures
    (casts) (Angst et al., 2022). In addition, they assist in soil recovery from compaction
    by creating burrows (Yvan et al., 2012). The generally low presence of earthworms
    presents a bottleneck for microbial carbon stabilization. 3.3. Limiting nutrient
    and clay ratios for C stabilization As mentioned in the previous section, the
    conversion of plant biomass into soil C is improved by the addition of N and S
    (Kirkby et al., 2014). The widespread S deficiency in 74% of the fields may be
    a limiting factor for C stabilization, especially as the farmers did not add S
    in the fertilizer to balance the deficiency. Following the common stoichiometric
    ratios of C:N:S 10:1:0.2 (Tipping et al., 2016), the amount of C planned to be
    sequestered (median 360 kg C/ha/year (Mattila et al., 2022)) would also require
    36 kg N/ha/yr and 7 kg S/ha/yr. Lack of N and S supply would result in incomplete
    decomposition or an increase in the soil C:N ratio. The soil C:N ratio across
    soils varied between 7 and 20 (median 14.8 C:N). This would make it closer to
    the nutrient rich OM pool (C:N 8) in Tipping et al. than to the nutrient poor
    pool (C:N 25) (Tipping et al., 2016). The relatively low C:N ratio means that
    the soils could accumulate C even without additional N without the C:N ratio rising
    excessively. It is commonly assumed that a C:N ratio of 20:1 would result in N
    immobilization (Haney et al., 2012), although this view is increasingly challenged
    (Bengtsson et al., 2003). Of the sampled soils, only one had a C:N > 20, and it
    was a former peat soil. The sampled soils could increase 0–3% C (median 1,2% C,
    or 40% relative increase) without exceeding the 20:1 C:N threshold. However, as
    the more stable fine-fraction SOM generally has a lower C:N ratio, it is unknown,
    whether soil C sequestration could occur by increasing the C:N ratio (Kirkby et
    al., 2014, van Groenigen et al., 2017). A low C:N ratio results in increased decomposition,
    whereas a high C:N ratio represents incomplete decomposition (Blanco et al., 2023).
    However, most of the sampled fields (53%) were in an optimum range of 10–15:1 C:N,
    with 43% in high C:N and only 5% in low C:N. Therefore, the soil C:N ratio does
    not seem to be a major bottleneck for most of the studied farms. Carbon saturation,
    or the saturation of the fine fraction of soil with mineral associated organic
    C (MAOC), has been a researched and debated topic (Begill et al., 2023, Cotrufo
    et al., 2019). The conceptual idea is that soils have a limited capacity to store
    MAOC and that the remaining C storage would be in less stable particulate (POC)
    and dissolved forms (DOC) (Cotrufo et al., 2019). Several estimation equations
    have been presented, ranging from the initial Hassink (1997) to more updated Matus
    (2021). In the sampled soils and using the C storage potential equation of Matus
    (2021), all the studied fields appear to be far from MAOC saturation (Fig. 5).
    The current C concentrations were on average 34% of the maximal MAOC potential
    (11–69%). Therefore the fields could store an additional 26–213 t C/ha (median
    153 t C/ha) in the topsoil mineral surfaces. With a planned median C accumulation
    rate of 360 kg C/ha/a (Mattila et al., 2022), it would take 72–591 years to fill
    the storage potential. In practice, the C sequestration would slow down with increasing
    decomposition, making the time to fill the storage even longer. This supports
    the emerging viewpoint, that while mineral surface C saturation is an interesting
    theoretical concept, it might not be observed in practice (Begill et al., 2023)
    especially in bulk soil. However, it should be noted, that if the maximum C sequestration
    potential calculation presented here depends on the model used to estimate the
    maximal MAOC potential. The Hassink (1997) model produces much lower estimates
    than the updated Matus (2021). Further research is needed to more accurately quantify
    the mineral associated C status of soils. Download : Download high-res image (104KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Almost half of the studied soils were
    classified as degraded on the basis of SOC/Clay ratio; however, those soils also
    had the highest potential for carbon storage. Almost all soils had more than 100 t/ha
    of C storage potential (difference between current SOC and potential based on
    soil texture). Importantly for agricultural productivity, the C:Clay ratio was
    so low in almost half of the fields (18/40) that they were classified as degraded.
    Only 25% of the fields would not benefit from additional C based on the C/Clay
    index. The high proportion of degraded fields is similar to the proportion (38%)
    found in the UK National Soil Inventory (Prout et al., 2021). However, the soils
    that were classified as very good based on the index could also be at risk of
    C loss, as has been observed in the UK when resampling soils at a 20-year interval:
    the arable fields with the highest C:Clay ratios in the 1980 s also had the highest
    loss of C during 1980–2000 (Prout et al., 2022). Overall, only two of the observed
    fields had a limited C storage potential based on the availability of mineral
    surfaces, but quite a few would be classified as very good based on the C:Clay
    ratio. The difference between the methods was due to not including the fine fraction
    of 2–63 µm in the soil quality index, but including it in the mineral associated
    C storage evaluation. Although there seems to be room for C in the soil mineral
    surfaces, C can be destabilized due to excess soil moisture (Bailey et al., 2019,
    Li and Schaeffer, 2020). Waterlogging results in iron reduction and release of
    sorbed C (Huang and Hall, 2017), among other mechanisms (Li and Schaeffer, 2020).
    In the studied soils, wet soil conditions were observed only when plant transpiration
    stopped in late autumn and winter. At that stage, microbial rates were also slowed
    by low temperatures. Therefore, the main risk was not during summer, but destabilization
    of C during winter and poorer soil structure. The fields had drainage systems
    installed, but many were in malfunctioning. Of the surveyed fields, 60% had problems
    with drainage. Blocked drainage outlets (35%) and boundary ditches (45%) were
    the most common problems. Combined with the widespread compaction (77% of sites),
    this may have resulted in regular hypoxic conditions. In addition to destabilization,
    waterlogging can be a considerable limiting factor for plant growth (Castellano
    et al., 2019), in some cases reducing crop yields by 80% (Oosterbaan, 2021). When
    this occurs during the growing season or with overwintering plants water-filled
    pores can cause poor gas transport and hypoxia to roots (Parent et al., 2008).
    Poor drainage is therefore directly linked to the first step of the carbon cycle
    (plant growth) and presents a major bottleneck for C sequestration. 3.4. Overview
    of the limiting factors The farms studied had a several limiting factors for soil
    C productivity. Presented within the evaluation framework (Fig. 1 and Table 1)
    categories of photosynthesis, microbial growth, and C stabilization, limitations
    were common in all three categories (Fig. 6). In terms of plant photosynthesis,
    micronutrient deficiencies were the most common, followed by a short growing time
    of the crops compared with sunlight availability. Most fields had poor structure,
    as indicated by a compact layer in the top 20 cm. Almost half of the fields also
    suffered from drought stress during June, which limited microbial activity. Estimated
    using a CO2burst test, the microbial activity was low in most of the fields. Stabilization
    of C was most limited by S deficiency and periodic waterlogging. Download : Download

    of limiting factors for soil C sequestration in the Finnish carbon sequestration
    fields sampled in 2019–2020 (N=40 on 20 farms). The presented results are sensitive
    to the chosen threshold values (Table 1). Some of the thresholds are well established
    from crop nutrition studies, while others are just tentative observations on the
    distribution of photosynthetic activity or soil dryness during the monitoring
    period. Many of the thresholds possibly should not be described in a binary deficient/sufficient
    continuum, but currently the responses between the surveyed soil processes and
    C sequestration are not known quantitatively. Qualitative decision support tools
    have been used in a similar situation to convert management decisions to C sequestration
    estimates (van de Broek et al., 2019). Another approach is to compare the identified
    limitations with the estimated C sequestration at the end of the 5-year experiment.
    In any case, more research is needed to map the significance of each limitation.
    Our scoping study demonstrated that agricultural fields have many limiting factors,
    which can be connected to reduced C sequestration based on a simplified conceptual
    model. The results can probably be generalized to various Northern and Western
    European regions with a similar history of excess P fertilization, monocropping
    and increasing soil compaction risks (Mattila, 2023). Dryland regions and nutrient
    poor soils are likely to have their own sets of limiting factors. As an overview,
    the topics that have received the most interest (N and P deficiency, and C saturation)
    were identified as bottlenecks only on a few farms. In addition, factors that
    have received much less emphasis were common: poor structure, waterlogging, S,
    Mn and B deficiency, low microbial activity, and low earthworm numbers. Whereas
    there is very little a farmer can do to mitigate C saturation, there are many
    management actions that a farmer can take to increase microbial and earthworm
    numbers, improve soil structure, and correct nutrient deficiencies. As the major
    bottlenecks were found to be in the photosynthesis of plants, both in the beginning
    and end of the growing season (i.e. cover crop seasons) and also during peak photosynthesis,
    there is a strong synergy for increasing plant productivity while sequestering
    more C to the soil. As improving productivity is a key challenge for agriculture,
    removing these common limiting factors can be highly motivating for farmers. 4.
    Conclusions The surveyed farms had a wide range of agricultural factors that can
    limit both productivity and soil C sequestration. Problems were found in all three
    stages of the C sequestration cycle: photosynthesis, microbial processing, and
    C stabilization. The main limitations were low leaf areas in spring and autumn
    due to crop choice and loss of leaf area during peak photosynthesis in summer.
    Soil structure problems were widespread and microbial activity was limited by
    periodic drought. S, Mn, B, and P deficiencies were common, whereas high P or
    C saturation was observed only in a few fields. Farmers can improve both productivity
    and soil C sequestration by improving soil structure, utilizing more of the incoming
    sunlight and increasing soil microbe and earthworm populations. Although it is
    easy to say, it is much harder to achieve and probably requires a field-by-field
    approach to gradually remove the problems. Fortunately, farmers have hundreds
    of years of experience in this kind of work. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    erosion is a widespread and severe environmental problem in the Mediterranean
    region, especially in Morocco, impacting soil quality, sediment transport, and
    water availability (Chaaouan et al., 2013; Ed-daoudy et al., 2023; FAO, 2019;
    Lamane et al., 2022; Lizaga et al., 2018; Mesrar, 2016; Sadiki et al., 2004; Szczypta,
    2012). Water erosion involves the detachment and movement of soil particles through
    water. This process can manifest at various scales and lead to various types of
    land degradation (Bruun et al., 2015; Tahiri et al., 2014). Within the mountainous
    regions of Morocco, water erosion is more prevalent and problematic due to steep
    slopes, fragile soils, heavy rainfall events, and intensive land use (Bouhlassa
    and Bouhsane, 2023; Simonneaux et al., 2015). In these areas, water erosion can
    cause significant changes in soil properties and functions, including organic
    matter content and nutrient status; reduces the productivity and fertility of
    agricultural lands; and affects the quantity and quality of water resources downstream,
    causing flooding, sedimentation, and siltation of reservoirs (Ait M’Barek et al.,
    2021; Alitane et al., 2022; Aoufa et al., 2022; Aouichaty et al., 2022; Arrebei
    et al., 2020; Bouslihim, 2020; Brahim, 2018; Chadli, 2016; Colazo and Buschiazzo,
    2015; Damnati et al., 2013; Echogdali et al., 2022; Elaloui et al., 2017; Issa
    et al., 2016; Mondal et al., 2018; Quijano et al., 2016; Romanyà and Rovira, 2011).
    These effects have significant implications for the socio-economic development
    and sustainability of the region, which depends mainly on the availability and
    management of soil and water resources. The Rif region in Morocco is grappling
    with significant soil erosion, accounting for an estimated 60% of the country''s
    total soil losses (Ed-daoudy et al., 2023; Manaouch et al., 2021). Various models
    have been utilized to evaluate and forecast erosion risk (Table A1), encompassing
    empirical models, tracer techniques, and process-based approaches (Alitane et
    al., 2022; Aoufa et al., 2022; Belasri and Lakhouili, 2016; Boufala et al., 2022;
    Damnati et al., 2012; Faleh and Maktite, 2014). Among the widely employed models
    are USLE (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978), RUSLE (Renard, 1997), MUSLE (Williams and
    Berndt, 1977), LISEM (De Roo et al., 1996), MMF (Morgan, 2001; Morgan and Duzant,
    2008), WATEM/SEDEM (Van Rompaey et al., 2001), SWAT (Arnold, 1994), WEPP (Flanagan
    and Nearing, 1995), and EUROSEM (Morgan et al., 1998). Gully erosion, a specific
    form of soil erosion, has been studied using diverse methods, including physical-based
    (Alencar et al., 2020), multi-criteria (Arabameri et al., 2019), statistical (Conoscenti
    and Rotigliano, 2020), and machine learning techniques (Arabameri et al., 2020).
    Machine learning models such as Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models (Elith et
    al., 2008), Maximum of Entropy (MaxEnt) (Phillips et al., 2004, 2006), and Random
    Forest (RF) (Segal and Xiao, 2011) have exhibited significant potential for erosion
    hazard assessment, particularly when combined with remote sensing and GIS data
    (Ahmed et al., 2023; Chuma et al., 2023). Table 1. Matrices Used in the modified

    is pivotal in estimating soil movement and redistribution over extended timeframes.
    The 137Cs technique stands out as one of the most widely used methods in Morocco
    (Benmansour et al., 2013; Damnati et al., 2004; Zouagui et al., 2012). With a
    30-year half-life, 137Cs originated from nuclear weapons testing during the 1950s
    and 1960s (He and Walling, 1996). This radionuclide strongly adheres to fine soil
    particles, rendering it highly effective for estimating soil erosion rates and
    changes in soil distribution patterns spanning several decades (Mabit et al.,
    2013). Initially developed by various organizations in collaboration with Mediterranean
    countries for assessing water erosion risk in the region (PAP/RAC, 1997; PNUE/PAM/PAP,
    2000), the PAP/RAC model explores the distribution, interaction, and interdependence
    of four primary causal factors of erosion states: vegetation cover, slope gradient,
    land use, and lithology. The model encompasses three methodological approaches:
    predictive, descriptive, and integrative. Both empirical models and tracer techniques
    have limitations and uncertainties affecting their accuracy and reliability. Empirical
    models are often calibrated and validated for conditions that may not represent
    all regions. They also require a large quantity of data and parameters that are
    only sometimes available or easily obtainable. Tracer techniques are often affected
    by spatial variability and heterogeneity of radionuclide distribution in the landscape.
    They also require expensive equipment and laboratory analysis that may not be
    accessible or feasible for large-scale studies. Consequently, there is a growing
    demand for more precise and reliable methods that address these limitations and
    uncertainties while offering an enhanced assessment and mapping of water erosion
    risk. This paper applies the modified Priority Actions Program/Regional Activity
    Centre (PAP/RAC) model, which is based on GIS and the 137Cs approach, to assess
    water erosion in the Raouz catchment in Morocco. This catchment is characterized
    by a complex physiography, including diverse climatic conditions, geology types,
    topographical features, land use patterns, and vegetation cover types. The modified
    PAP/RAC model is an improved version of the classical PAP/RAC model (PAP/CAR,
    1998) because it includes additional causal factors that allow for a more comprehensive
    assessment of erosion risk. Soil types play a crucial role in determining the
    susceptibility of an area to erosion, as different soil types have varying levels
    of resistance to erosion. The use of GIS and remote sensing (RS) techniques allows
    for the integration and analysis of spatial data related to the above factors.
    GIS enables the creation of digital maps with various overlays to identify areas
    with high erosion risk. Remote sensing techniques, such as satellite imagery,
    provide valuable information on land cover, vegetation density, and land surface
    characteristics, which are important in understanding erosion processes. To evaluate
    the accuracy of the modified PAP/RAC model and document temporal changes in soil
    erosion rates and redistribution patterns, the 137Cs approach is employed in this
    study. The integration of both methods aims to enhance the reliability and accuracy
    of the model, ultimately providing a comprehensive assessment of the risk of water
    erosion. The key contributions of this study are: 1. Development of a modified
    PAP/RAC model that incorporates additional causal factors to provide a more comprehensive
    assessment of water erosion risk. 2. Integration of GIS and RS techniques to analyze
    spatial data and identify areas with high erosion risk. 3. Use of the 137Cs approach
    to validate the modified PAP/RAC model and assess temporal changes in soil erosion
    rates and redistribution patterns. The findings of this study contribute to a
    better understanding of water erosion processes and risk in the Raouz catchment
    and provide valuable insights for developing effective soil and water conservation
    strategies in similar regions. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides
    a brief description of the study area, including its geographical location, climate,
    geology, topography, land use, and soil characteristics. Section 3 presents the
    data and methods used in this study, including the modified PAP/RAC model, 137Cs,
    the GIS and remote sensing techniques, and statistical analysis. Section 4 reports
    the results and discusses soil erosion risk mapping, the model''s accuracy evaluation,
    and temporal changes in soil redistribution rates. Section 5 summarizes this study''s
    main findings and conclusions; it provides future research and management recommendations.
    2. Study area The Raouz catchment, part of the Alpine orogenic belt surrounding
    the western Mediterranean Sea and situated in Morocco''s semi-humid northwestern
    Rif region, encompasses approximately 47 km2. Situated 15 km northwest of Tetouan,
    this region experiences a Mediterranean climate marked by wet winters and dry
    summers, with an average annual rainfall of 600 mm (Fig. 2). Seasonal torrential
    rivers, dependent on rainfall, are the primary influence on the hydrological system
    within the catchment. Two principal rivers in the catchment, Oued Khmiss and Oued
    Raouz, exhibit low or no flows during the dry season but undergo substantial flow
    increases during the wet season. Heavy rainfall in the nearby mountains can trigger
    flash floods. The Raouz River is a crucial water source for the Moulay El Hassan
    Bel Mehdi Dam, supplying Tetouan and its coastal region with water as well as
    supporting agricultural irrigation and flood mitigation. The catchment''s geography
    and geology result from the complex tectonic history of the Rif region, arising
    from the collision between Africa and Eurasia during the Meso-Cenozoic era. The
    Rif comprises three primary tectonic complexes: the Internal Units, Maghrebian
    Flysch Units, and External Units. The Internal Units consist of sedimentary rocks
    dating from the Jurassic to the Early Miocene period, detached from their basement
    during the Alpine collision. The Maghrebian Flysch Units encompass Cretaceous-Eocene
    flysch deposits thrust over the External Units. The External Units include the
    Dorsale Calcaire Complex, the Predorsalian Unit, and the Mauretanian and Massylian
    units, representing distinct paleogeographic domains that experienced deformation
    and stacking during the Alpine orogeny. A series of nappe structures overlay the
    Tangier Unit, which consists of Upper Cretaceous marls, marking the catchment''s
    structural context. These nappe structures encompass the Numidian nappe, considered
    the upper part detached from Massylian nappe structures; the Melloussa-Chouamat
    nappe, belonging to Massylian nappe structures; and the Tisirene and Beni-Ider
    nappes, belonging to Mauretanian nappe structures (Andrieux, 1971; Chalouan et
    al., 2006, 2008; de Lamotte, 1987; Durand-Delga et al., 2000; El Talibi et al.,
    2014; Guerrera et al., 2005; Maate and Didon, 1989; Mattauer, 1964; Michard et
    al., 2014, 2014, 2014; Vitale et al., 2015). The geography within the basin demonstrates
    variance, with terrain spanning from east-northeast to west-southwest. While the
    southern section is relatively level, the eastern and western regions include
    rough scenery with low mountainous terrain. The highest point in the region, reaching
    749 m, is located in the summits of Jbel ElHejjam to the west and Jbel Fahamine
    to the east of the watershed. The slopes in the watershed regularly reach 35%,
    notably in the sandstone, marl-sandstone, and calcareous-dolomitic formations
    dominating the western, northern, and western parts, respectively (Ed-daoudy et
    al., 2023). The structural organization of the examined sector is indicated by
    a stack of units, as seen in Fig. 1. The Tangier Unit spans the center and southern
    portions of the watershed, containing extensive plains and low hills, showing
    the principal outcrops of the Internal Tangier Unit, reflecting Upper Cretaceous
    sediments. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    3. materials and methods 3.1. GIS methodology and modified PAP/RAC model application
    A GIS-based modified PAP/RAC model and a137Cs approach were used to assess water
    erosion in the Raouz catchment, Morocco. A complex physiography with diverse climatic
    conditions, geology types, topography features, land use patterns, and vegetation
    cover types characterizes the Raouz catchment. Water erosion affects the catchment,
    causing soil degradation, sediment transport, and water scarcity. The decision
    to utilize the modified PAP/RAC model rather than the classic version was motivated
    by the need to overcome certain limitations and improve the original model''s
    ability to assess water erosion. The modified model was selected for the following
    reasons: 1. Improved Reliability: The modified PAP/RAC model integrates additional
    variables such as soil moisture index, land surface temperature, and slope length,
    which were not present in the classic model. By accounting for these variables,
    the modified model offers a more reliable and comprehensive assessment of water
    erosion, considering a wider range of factors affecting erosion. 2. Enhanced Predictive
    Capability: Expanded scope of the modified model and inclusion of predictive variables
    enable more accurate predictions of potential trends in soil erosion. This improved
    predictive capability aids in identifing potentially vulnerable areas and more
    accurately assesses erosion susceptibility. 3. Comprehensive Risk Assessment:
    The modified model''s approach to incorporating soil types, climatic factors,
    and slope length contributes to a more comprehensive assessment of causal risk
    factors for soil erosion. This comprehensive risk assessment provides valuable
    insights into the dynamics of erosion and helps identify areas requiring intervention
    to counter the effects of soil erosion effectively and sustainably. 4. Methodological
    Improvements: The modified model resolves methodological shortcomings identified
    in the classic PAP/RAC model, such as the omission of climatic parameters and
    the need for more significant erosion parameters. By introducing these modifications,
    the model aims to improve the efficiency and reliability of the assessment of
    water erosion. The modified PAP/RAC model was chosen over the classical model
    for its ability to overcome limitations, enhance reliability and predictive capability,
    and provide a more comprehensive assessment of water erosion by incorporating
    additional variables and resolving methodological shortcomings. The 137Cs approach
    efficiently evalutes soil erosion rates and alterations in soil distribution patterns
    over many decades (He and Walling, 1996; Ritchie and McHenry, 1990; Zouagui et
    al., 2012). It assesses the accuracy of the modified PA/RAC model and records
    the temporal fluctuations in soil erosion rates and redistribution patterns. 3.1.1.
    The predictive approach The predictive method assesses and incorporates the factors
    governing water erosion, such as slope, lithology, normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI), soil protection, land use, and erodibility (Ouallali et al., 2016).
    The predictive technique creates a map of erosive states that depicts the potential
    and general patterns of soil erosion. A digital elevation model (DEM) was used
    to produce the slope map, and a geological map was utilized to derive the lithology
    map. Landsat 8 satellite imagery was used to determine the NDVI and to identify
    the land use categories. A correlation matrix combines the slope, lithology, NDVI,
    soil protection, land use, and degree of erodibility elements into five classifications
    of erosive states (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Organizational chart of the modified PAP/RAC
    model. In addition to the existing variables of the traditional PAP/RAC model,
    the model was changed by including new causative factors of erosion risk, such
    as soil types, slope length, rainfall erosivity, slope exposure, soil moisture
    index, and land surface temperature. These characteristics may impact the intensity
    and frequency of water erosion processes and the sensitivity of soil to erosion.
    GIS and remote sensing methods were utilized to gather and analyze the data for
    these characteristics and to overlay them with the existing elements of the PAP/RAC
    model. The same logic and matrices of the PAP/RAC directives were followed to
    combine the parameters and to construct the erosive states map. The final erosive
    states map depicts the geographical distribution of water erosion risk in the
    Raouz watershed based on natural and human sources. The map delineates five erosive
    states (Fig. 8 and Table 1). The graphic representation illustrates that water
    erosion risk is most significant in the upstream region of the watershed, where
    steep slopes, thin soils, poor plant cover, and intense land use dominate. Water
    erosion risk is reduced in the downstream portion of the watershed, where gentle
    slopes, dense soils, high plant cover, and moderate land use are prominent. 3.1.2.
    The descriptive approach The descriptive approach to mapping soil erosion relies
    on two main methods: field observations and satellite imagery. It aims to create
    an accurate map illustrating the extent and severity of soil erosion within the
    catchment (Barakat et al., 2023; Faleh and Maktite, 2014). This approach involves
    conducting field surveys and analyzing satellite imagery to identify erosion patterns
    (Fig. 3). The initial step involves conducting field surveys to identify and characterize
    dominant erosion processes and assess their risk levels. The severity and extent
    of erosion phenomena, such as rills, gullies, landslides, and badlands, determine
    these risk levels. Field surveys also help identify the causal factors contributing
    to erosion risk, including slope, soil type, land use, and rainfall. The second
    step involves using high-resolution satellite imagery to identify and outline
    erosion features. Satellite images provide an overall view of the catchment and
    enable spatial analysis of erosion patterns. They are also valuable for confirming
    and complementing field observations. These two procedures are combined using
    a correlation matrix (Table 1 and Fig. 3) to classify erosion forms into five
    categories: Very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The PAP/CAR (1998),
    a regional initiative for desertification prevention and control in Africa, established
    the criteria for this correlation matrix. While the descriptive approach produces
    a map that shows the spatial distribution of water erosion features within the
    catchment, it has limitations. It is subjective, qualitative, and dependent on
    the availability and quality of satellite images. Additionally, this approach
    needs to provide insights into the temporal dynamics of water erosion or the factors
    influencing its variability. Nevertheless, the descriptive approach offers a realistic
    qualitative assessment of soil erosion in the catchment. It helps identify areas
    most vulnerable to water erosion and suggests appropriate soil conservation and
    restoration measures. 3.1.3. The integrative approach The integrative approach
    combines predictive and descriptive methods, creating a map that illustrates erosion
    trends, taking into account both potential and observed erosion factors (Fig.
    3) (Dallahi et al., 2020; Diani et al., 2023). The PAP/RAC of the Mediterranean
    Action Plan (MAP) developed tools known as the PAP/RAC matrices to evaluate soil
    erosion risk in the Mediterranean region (Medwaves E-Newsletter, 2007). These
    tools employ a combination of biophysical and socio-economic factors to assess
    land sensitivity and vulnerability to water erosion. They also offer a straightforward
    and practical way to map soil erosion risk at various scales and identify priority
    areas for soil conservation measures. Matrices defined by the PAP/RAC directives
    (refer to Table 1) connect the input parameters. Climatic factors are categorized
    into A (Mx-3) and B (Mx-4), primarily based on Mediterranean climatic conditions.
    The same logic governing the PAP/RAC directives is followed. In this case, soil
    erodibility is emphasized as a critical factor due to its significance in determining
    sensitivity to erosion. The methodological approach was guided by the organizational
    chart (Fig. 3). It commenced with the classic PAP/RAC model, considering slope,
    lithology, land use, and vegetation cover density. Subsequently, changes were
    made: the slope was replaced with slope length (LS), and lithology was substituted
    with soil type. Climatic factors were introduced in two sections: (a) included
    precipitation erosivity (R) and slope exposure, while (b) covered the land surface
    temperature (LST) and the soil moisture index (SMI). The output characteristics
    (refer to Table 2) are divided into five categories, from low sensitivity with
    minimum risk to high sensitivity, signifying significant sensitivity (Fig. 4).

    contributing to erosion in the Raouz catchment. 3.2. Assessing the relationship
    between erosion factors and erosive states: pearson correlation analysis The study
    utilized Pearson''s correlation coefficient to examine and evaluate the relationships
    between erosion factors and erosive states. Equation (1) was applied to various
    variables in the modified PAP/RAC model, including soil types, rainfall erosivity,
    slope exposure, plant cover density, slope length, land use, soil moisture, slope,
    and soil surface temperature. This technique enables a comprehensive investigation
    of the connections between these parameters and erosion. (1) Pearson''s correlation
    coefficient (r) measures the linear relationship between an erosion-related variable
    (xi) and an erosive states variable (y), where xi and (yi) represent their respective
    values. 3.3. Using 137Cs measurements to validate and enhance the modified PAP/RAC
    model In Moroccan catchments, the application of traditional methods for soil
    erosion assessment has been the norm (Ed-daoudy et al., 2023). Recently, radionuclides
    such as 137Cs, excess Lead-210 (210Pb_ex), and Beryllium-7 (7Be) have been recognized
    for their efficacy in studying soil erosion and sedimentation processes. It was
    not until after 2017 that the method of using radioelements, specifically 137Cs
    in tandem with resampling, was piloted in Morocco to evaluate alterations in soil
    erosion and deposition rates across different timespans (Moustakim et al., 2019,
    2022). This method marks a significant advance in radiometric techniques for the
    temporal analysis of soil erosion and deposition within agricultural and forested
    landscapes. Furthermore, as part of this project, 137Cs measurements helped determine
    sedimentation rate changes in the water reservoir downstream of the Raouz watershed.
    3.3.1. Sampling strategy for 137Cs measurements Following the protocols established
    by Ed-daoudy et al. (2023); Ibrahimi et al. (2005), and Moustakim et al. (2022),
    the study revisited the site for resampling in 2018 and 2021. Soil samples, twenty
    in total, were systematically collected from predefined points spaced at 1.5 m
    intervals for lateral samples and 5 m for samples along the direction of the slope
    across four parallel transects (R-T1, R-T2, R-T3, and R-T4), chosen to encompasses
    the diverse site terrain. Additionally, samples were gathered from a reference
    field, REF3, strategically selected following the area''s slope gradient and water
    runoff path. On slopes averaging 11% and 13%, with predominantly clayey soil,
    collections were made using a motorized 1-m-long cylindrical tube with a diameter
    of 9 cm, penetrating depths of 40–50 cm. A critical sediment core was also obtained
    at the confluence of the watershed and the downstream water reservoir. After careful
    preparation, radioisotope concentrations were gauged employing gamma spectrometry,
    harnessing high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors with 30%–45% efficiency. Estimations
    of soil erosion and deposition rates derived from 137Cs surface activity measurements
    were computed using the ‘Mass Balance Model II’. 3.3.2. Assessing 137Cs activity
    in the Raouz Watershed with gamma spectroscopy A meticulous and systematic protocol
    was adopted for sample preparation and determining 137Cs activity through gamma
    spectroscopy in the Raouz watershed. Initiated within CNESTEN''s (National Center
    for Nuclear Energy, Sciences, and Technology) facilities, the soil and sediment
    profiles were extracted using a \"core-cutter\" to obtain 15 evenly thick layers
    without disturbing stratification. These samples were then carefully cleaned,
    packaged, and marked for future reference. The subsequent oven-drying at 105 °C
    for 48 h preceded the sieving process, isolating the <2 mm fraction to secure
    adequately representative samples for analytical procedures. Encased in a Petri
    dish, the fraction was ready for 137Cs activity measurement using the Canberra
    model p-type high-resolution low-energy coaxial HPGe detectors of 45% relative
    efficiency. Instrument calibration was undertaken with LABSOCS software and a
    multi-gamma source, assuring precision through counting durations extending from
    80,000 to 240,000 s based on preliminary activity estimates. The quantification
    of gamma-ray spectra and consequent activity (Bq/kg) was facilitated by identifying
    the 662 keV peak. Notably, the standardization of 137Cs measurements was implemented
    until the end of 2021 to maintain consistency, given that no substantial rainfall
    early in 2022 could potentially modify sediment composition. This meticulous protocol
    yielded highly accurate radionuclide concentration data, facilitating precise
    calculations of erosion and deposition rates through the MBM2 process and interlinking
    sampling fidelity with analytical accuracy essential for managing and comprehending
    soil dynamics within the catchment area. 3.3.3. 137Cs technique: a holistic approach
    to soil redistribution assessment - advantages and limitations The 137Cs technique
    offers extensive advantages for assessing soil redistribution. This method provides
    a comprehensive perspective, encompassing all soil particle movement processes,
    including those driven by water, wind, and tillage erosion. It facilitates the
    quantification of soil loss and deposition, particularly from sheet and rill erosion,
    with estimates derived from individual sampling points. As a result, detailed,
    spatially distributed data regarding soil redistribution rates and patterns can
    be generated. Additionally, the 137Cs technique, unlike other methods, obviates
    the need for expensive and labor-intensive long-term monitoring programs, offering
    the convenience of acquiring results via a singular site visit for soil sampling.
    However, the technique also presents certain limitations that need careful consideration.
    For instance, 137Cs inventories can be exceptionally low in areas, particularly
    in the southern hemisphere, necessitating extended gamma analysis count times
    to achieve measurement precision. The fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl accident
    has introduced additional 137Cs deposits in certain regions, necessitating adaptations
    to conversion models during soil redistribution assessments. Primarily, the 137Cs
    technique is adept at estimating average erosion rates over a medium-term span
    (approximately 50 years) and may lack the sensitivity needed to reflect short-term
    changes in erosion rates caused by alterations in land use and management practices.
    Furthermore, accurate determination of the reference inventory is critical. Variability
    in environmental conditions, such as in mountainous regions with variable rainfall,
    stony soil terrains, intensively cultivated areas, locales with significant snowfall
    and drift, and arid zones with limited vegetation, can challenge the establishment
    of a representative local reference inventory due to the potential accumulation
    of 137Cs labeled sediment driven by the Aeolian processes. 4. Results and discussion
    This section synthesizes the findings from applying the modified PAP/RAC model
    and supplements them with insights from the 137Cs approach. Maps delineating erosive
    states and forms, trends in soil redistribution, and changes in watershed management
    practices are discussed in the context of their implications for water erosion
    dynamics within the study area. 4.1. Investigating soil erosion vulnerability
    and erosive dynamics in the raouz catchment: a comprehensive approach 4.1.1. Factors
    of water erosion risk This study aims to delineate soil types of the Raouz region
    and assess their susceptibility to water erosion. This work contributes to a better
    understanding and management of soil resources in the region, which faces various
    environmental and human pressures. The study is based on rigorous fieldwork, laboratory
    investigations, and data analysis, with some findings presented in our initial
    publication (Ed-daoudy et al., 2023). The methodology and data used to create
    the soil map of the region were explained in that publication. The research employed
    the modified cartographic PAP/RAC method to assess soil erosion risk in the region,
    considering multiple parameters. These parameters include slope angle, length,
    lithofacies resistance, land use, rainfall erosivity, cover density, slope exposure,
    land surface temperature (LST), and soil moisture. The results are shown in Table
    2 and Fig. 4. Table 2 and Fig. 4 reveal that the region is primarily characterized
    by moderate and steep slopes, covering 30.90% and 34.58% of the area, respectively.
    Following them are gentle and extreme slopes, accounting for 17.45% and 15.11%,
    respectively. These two categories are mainly located in the upstream, central,
    and southern watershed regions. Roughly 2% of the land comprises flat areas located
    downstream in the Raouz catchment. These slopes are attributed to the irregular
    terrain, increasing water erosion vulnerability. The LS-factor analysis reveals
    that the most prevalent slope classes in the study area are extremely low and
    low, covering approximately 49.98% and 40.55% of the total area, respectively.
    However, the remaining LS classes, which account for approximately 10% of the
    area, are primarily concentrated in specific regions such as Fahamine in the east,
    Edaher in the northwest, and Dar Lehjar in the west. Another important factor
    influencing soil erosion is lithological facies, characterized based on their
    cohesion and resistance to water erosion. Fig. 4 provides a visual representation
    of the distribution and friability of these facies. The facies are classified
    into five distinct classes with codes ranging from 1 (representing the hardest)
    to 5 (representing the softest). A summary of their friability is presented in
    Table 2. Moreover, the table delineates the diverse land use types influencing
    soil protection against water erosion. Matorral shrubland vegetation, characterized
    by its dense cover and adaptation to hot, arid climates, provides the highest
    level of protection, reaching 28%. On the other hand, cultivation in dry or bare
    land without any vegetation cover provides the lowest level of protection, with
    only 9% coverage. Additionally, the table demonstrates that tree farming, reforestation,
    and natural forests afford moderate levels of protection, ranging from 16% to
    24%. In contrast, matorral with dense cover offers robust protection, covering
    23% of the area. Importantly, the type and density of vegetation cover play a
    crucial role in determining the risk of soil erosion. Moreover, the table presents
    data on rainfall erosivity, soil moisture, and land surface temperature classes
    derived from satellite images and meteorological data. The study area demonstrates
    high levels of rainfall erosivity, low to average soil moisture, and high to very
    higher land surface temperature, characteristic of the Mediterranean climate.
    These factors vary based on location, slope exposure, and land use, substantially
    influencing the soil''s sensitivity and vulnerability to erosion. 4.1.2. Creating
    a soil erosion susceptibility map Erodibility denotes a substrate''s susceptibility
    soil particle loss when exposed to erosive rainfall. The slope of the terrain
    plays a crucial role in determining how quickly these particles are eroded from
    the soil profile. Traditionally, the classic PAP/RAC method evaluates erodibility
    by considering slope and lithofacies (Mx-1) factors, which provide insights into
    the substrate''s resistance and looseness (refer to Fig. 3 and Table 1). However,
    it has been observed that this method tends to overestimate erodibility (as shown
    in Fig. 5). This estimation does not align with the findings of the RUSLE model,
    which indicates that most substrates exhibit high resistance to water erosion
    (Ed-daoudy et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :

    erodibility in the raouz watershed. The runoff process, responsible for water
    erosion, is significantly influenced by the length and steepness of the slope.
    Steeper and longer slopes result in increased runoff and erosion, as documented
    by Poesen et al. (2003). Therefore, this study proposes a modified approach that
    considers slope length (LS) and soil type instead of the traditional slope and
    lithofacies (refer to Fig. 4). The outcomes of this approach reveal that the majority
    of the Raouz watershed exhibits low erodibility (58%), indicating stable soil
    conditions (refer to Fig. 6). These regions are primarily located downstream,
    in the central and Dar Lehjar regions, characterized by shorter slopes and well-developed
    soils. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    Soil Types and Slope Length (LS); (bottom) Soil Protection Map. Conversely, areas
    with moderate erodibility (24%) are situated in the northern part (Edaher) and
    the eastern area (Dar El Aoukkal), where the length of the slopes is exceptional
    and soils are less developed. The southern and southeastern regions, characterized
    by long slopes and poorly developed soils, exhibit average erodibility (15%).
    High and extreme erodibility (2.22%) are rare and confined to upstream regions
    characterized by steep slopes and coarse, weak soils. This approach effectively
    illustrates how slope length and soil type influence soil erodibility within the
    Raouz watershed. The analysis of classical modeling results indicates that the
    distribution of erodibility in the Raouz watershed depends on the slope and cohesion
    level of the lithological facies. Following the traditional PAP/RAC approach,
    areas with steep slopes and low resistance consistently exhibit high erodibility.
    4.1.3. Creation of the soil protection map The study employs a matrix Mx-2 (Table
    1) to classify soil protection according to land use and vegetation cover density.
    The soil protection map (Fig. 6) illustrates the distribution of soil protection
    classes in the Raouz watershed based on the superposition of the land use map
    and the cover density. The maps indicate that soil protection is very low in nearly
    half of the watershed (49.43%), which means that the soil is highly exposed to
    erosion by water. The very low soil protection areas are located mainly in the
    watershed''s south, southeast, and upstream parts, where the vegetation cover
    is sparse and degraded. The soil protection is low in 10.97% of the watershed,
    mainly in the center and downstream parts, where the vegetation cover is slightly
    better but still needs to be improved. The soil protection is medium in only 4.58%
    of the watershed, mainly in the north and downstream parts, where the vegetation
    cover is moderate and diverse. The soil protection is high or very high in 35.02%
    of the watershed, mainly in the east and north, where the vegetation cover is
    dense and well-developed. The maps illustrate how land use and cover density affect
    soil protection in the Raouz watershed. 4.1.4. Climatic factors: precipitation
    erosivity, soil moisture, and surface temperature Climate significantly influences
    soil erosion, including various factors such as precipitation, temperature, soil
    moisture, and vegetation cover. It is essential to recognize that climate is multifaceted
    and dynamic, subject to spatial and temporal variations. Thus, assessing the impact
    of climate on soil erosion requires the consideration of average climatic conditions,
    spatial heterogeneity, and interactions among different climatic factors. This
    study examines two specific climatic factors relevant to water erosion in the
    Raouz catchment area, a semi-arid Mediterranean watershed in Morocco. The first
    factor (a) refers to precipitation erosivity and slopes'' exposure; it quantifies
    the potential kinetic energy of rainfall in detaching and transporting soil particles.
    The second factor, labeled as (b), focuses on soil moisture and surface temperature,
    which influence the soil''s capacity for infiltration and runoff generation. The
    objective is to analyze the spatial variability of these two factors within the
    watershed and their influence on the susceptibility of land to water erosion.
    Furthermore, there is an aim to compare these factors to elucidate their relative
    importance and interactions. Fig. 7a and b provides a visual representation of
    the impact of these two climatic factors on soil erosion in a semi-arid Mediterranean
    watershed. Precisely, Factor (A) reflects precipitation erosivity and slope exposure,
    while Factor (B) encompasses soil moisture and surface temperature (Mx-3 and Mx-4
    in Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    image Fig. 8. Mapping erosive states in the raouz catchment. Map 7-a, illustrating
    climatic factor (A), elucidates the impact of rainfall and slope orientation on
    soil protection levels. It concentrates on areas with the highest impact factor
    (very high) in the northern segment of the watershed, particularly in the northeast
    and northwest regions. Substantial rainfall characterizes these areas, leading
    to heightened erosion risks. In contrast, areas with the lowest impact factor
    (very low) exist in sheltered and protected regions, spanning from Bou Bardaa
    Village in the northwest to Khliaache and Zaouiat in the southwest. These areas
    receive less rainfall and are consequently less susceptible to erosion. Most of
    the watershed, approximately 49.48% of the total area, falls under the medium
    impact factor classification. Primarily located in the northern parts, from Ain
    Lafkhoukhe Village to Fahamine Mountain in the west, these areas exhibit moderate
    erosivity (Fig. 7a). The map (7-b) portraying climatic factor (B) reveals how
    soil moisture and surface temperature contribute to erosion susceptibility. Areas
    with the highest impact factor (very high) exist downstream of the watershed,
    encompassing a mere 0.09% of the land. These regions experience highly humid and
    cold conditions. I n contrast, areas with the lowest impact factor (very low)
    occupy the eastern section, spanning from Edahar, Dar Lrhjar, to Jbel Hajjam,
    constituting 0.64% of the land. Once again, the medium impact factor prevails
    in the watershed, covering 62.18% of the total area. These areas predominantly
    reside in the central region. Comparing the two maps reveals distinct patterns
    and disparities between the two climatic factors and their impact on soil erosion.
    Both factors have a medium impact factor as the prevalent class in the watershed,
    indicating a moderate erosion risk. However, spatial variations arise due to the
    different aspects of climate they represent. For instance, while factor (A) exhibits
    a very high impact factor in the northern part of the watershed, factor (B) portrays
    a very low or low impact factor in these areas. This suggests that these regions
    experience intense rainfall erosivity but possess insufficient soil moisture and
    higher surface temperatures, potentially influencing their erosion potential differently.
    Scrutinizing these maps provides insights into the intricate relationship between
    climate and soil erosion in a semi-arid Mediterranean watershed. Moreover, integrating
    various climatic factors allows for a comprehensive erosion susceptibility assessment
    across different watershed areas. Ultimately, these maps (7a-b) provide valuable
    information for devising suitable soil conservation measures tailored to each
    watershed area. 4.1.5. Erosive states map: identifying and prioritizing areas
    at risk of water erosion The erosive state map for the Raouz watershed (Fig. 8,
    Fig. 9) results from the predictive approach, combining the erodibility and soil
    protection maps (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). This approach aims to illustrate the varying
    degrees of influence of factors controlling water erosion and to prioritize areas
    in the watershed based on erosion risk. Download : Download high-res image (3MB)

    catchment. The parameters are evaluated by overlaying the soil protection map
    (Fig. 6-b) with erodibility maps (Fig. 5-a). This involves applying the Mx-5 matrix
    to assess the soil''s susceptibility to erosion and considering climatic factors
    (Fig. 7a and b) using the Mx-6 matrix to evaluate soil resistance to climatic
    aggressiveness. Each evaluation showcases the impact of the introduced factor
    (Fig. 3). Three tests were conducted, as depicted in Fig. 8, Fig. 9. Analyzing
    the results reveals the erosive state map of the Raouz watershed: Fig. 8 displays
    the erosive state map, the culmination of the predictive approach integrating
    erodibility and soil protection maps. This map highlights the various combinations
    of factors influencing water erosion and prioritizes areas based on erosion risk.
    The map illustrates that a substantial portion of the watershed (77.38%) experiences
    very low or low erosion risk, indicating significant soil protection and minimal
    erodibility. These areas are primarily forested or have moderate slopes and rainfall,
    represented in green and yellow on the map. In contrast, some parts of the watershed
    (8.14%) exhibit high or very high erosion risk, signifying low soil protection
    and high erodibility. These regions are predominantly bare or degraded, with steep
    slopes and intense rainfall erosivity, depicted in red and purple on the map.
    The remaining 14.47% of the watershed faces a moderate erosion risk, indicating
    moderate protection and erodibility. These areas are typically associated with
    human activity or regions featuring variable slopes and rainfall, shown in orange
    on the map. This map is valuable for identifying and prioritizing areas requiring
    attention and intervention to mitigate soil erosion. It also enhances our understanding
    of how different factors impact land erosion potential. Fig. 9(a and b) presents
    the results of the predictive approach, incorporating erodibility and soil protection
    maps with two distinct causal factors: factor A (rainfall erosivity and slope
    exposure) and factor B (soil moisture and surface temperature). This approach
    aims to illustrate how these factors influence the erosion risk of the Raouz watershed.
    Fig. 9-a shows that introducing factor A reduces the erosion risk for most of
    the watershed (75.98%), implying that this factor has a limited impact on erodibility
    and soil protection. These areas are primarily downstream of the Raouz catchment,
    characterized by gentle slopes and moderate rainfall. However, in some parts of
    the watershed (12.78%), a high or very high erosion risk is evident, signifying
    that factor A significantly influences erodibility and soil protection. These
    regions are mainly in the eastern and western sections of the watershed, featuring
    steep slopes and intense rainfall. Fig. 9-b also illustrates that introducing
    factor B reduces the erosion risk for most of the watershed (82.52%), indicating
    a limited influence of this factor on erodibility and soil protection. These areas
    are primarily characterized by a low state of erosivity, except for specific locations
    with bare soils and significant human activity with medium to high erosivity.
    Only a few parts of the watershed (1.42%) experience high or very high erosion
    risk, signifying that factor B significantly impacts erodibility and soil protection.
    These maps serve as valuable tools for identifying and prioritizing areas in need
    of attention and intervention to mitigate soil erosion. They also contribute to
    a deeper understanding of how various causal factors affect the erosion potential
    of the land. 4.1.6. Erosive forms map: identifying soil erosion features One of
    the objectives of this study includes identifying and mapping erosion forms affecting
    the Raouz watershed. The model uses upper case letters and numbers to describe
    the erosion forms and their degree of severity. Fig. 10 presents the results of
    this methodology. Download : Download high-res image (877KB) Download : Download

    represent Pearson correlation coefficients, ranging from −1.00 to 1.00, where
    −1.00 indicates a strong negative correlation, 1.00 indicates a strong positive
    correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation). Sheet erosion and stripping (L1,
    L2, and L3) constitute the most prevalent erosion form within the Raouz watershed,
    affecting 79.95% of the total area (Fig. 9). This removal of topsoil through diffuse
    runoff results in soil surface variation and nutrient loss. The intensity of sheet
    erosion varies from very low (L1) to slow (L3), contingent on factors like slope,
    soil type, vegetation cover, and rainfall erosivity. Areas with very low erosion
    (L1) are primarily situated downstream and northeast of the watershed, characterized
    by gentle slopes and dense vegetation cover. Areas with low erosion (L2) are mainly
    found in the eastern parts of the watershed, featuring moderate slopes and sparse
    vegetation. Slow erosion (L3) occurs in the central and upstream regions of the
    watershed, characterized by steep slopes and very sparse or absent vegetation.
    Channel erosion and gullies (D1) constitute the second most prevalent erosion
    form in the Raouz watershed, affecting 9.72% of the total area. Concentrated runoff
    erodes soil along rills and superficial slope gullies, resulting in deeper incisions
    and more significant soil loss than sheet erosion. Areas experiencing channel
    erosion and gullies (D1) are the most common upstream and in the southeastern
    section of the watershed, characterized by steep slopes, loose or weak soils,
    and high rainfall erosivity. Erosion in ravines (C1) ranks as the third most common
    erosion form in the Raouz watershed, impacting 17.84% of the total area. Channel
    erosion and gullies progress into more extensive and profound ravines, which traverse
    cultivated land or steeply sloping loose materials, leading to substantial soil
    degradation, land fragmentation, and sediment transport. Areas affected by erosion
    in ravines (C1) are predominantly located in the eastern and western parts of
    the watershed, characterized by weakly resistant or highly altered lithofacies,
    such as gypsum, shale, tuff crust, or molasses. Solifluction erosion (M1) and
    generalized gullying or badlands (MX) represent the least common erosion forms
    in the Raouz watershed, affecting 0.34% and 0.11% of the total area, respectively.
    Solifluction erosion occurs on slopes when muddy materials soften due to increased
    liquid water content, resulting in localized landslides or debris flows that impact
    soil stability and fertility. Areas experiencing solifluction erosion (M1) are
    mainly present in the northern part of the watershed, where soils exhibit hydromorphic
    or vertisols characteristics. Generalized gullying or badlands (MX) is an extreme
    erosion form where gullies strip almost all soil surface horizons, rendering the
    land devoid of vegetation cover and unusable. These regions exhibit very low soil
    protection and very high erodibility. Areas affected by generalized gullying or
    badlands (MX) are mainly situated in the southern part of the watershed, characterized
    by lithofacies consisting of sediments or loose, non-cohesive, and detrital soils.
    4.1.7. Integration phase: consolidated erosion map and trend analysis The final
    erosion trend map of this project (Fig. 11) integrates descriptive and predictive.
    To evaluate this map, it was compared with the erosion state map and forms, using
    the explored variables and referencing erosion forms in matrix Mx-7. The evaluation
    process involved assessing how a specific erosion state in an environment can
    withstand a particular type of erosion, with a focus on prioritizing areas for
    intervention. The erosion patterns identified were categorized into four groups
    based on matrix Mx-6 (see Table 1): ❖ Stable or Regressive Trend: Areas exhibiting
    a tendency to stabilize, retrograde, or restrict the geographical growth of the
    erosion process. They are characterized by high soil protection and low erodibility,
    often with dense vegetation cover and minimal human impact. ❖ Localized Expansion
    or Intensification Trend: Areas demonstrating a localized predisposition to spread
    or increased erosion. Although they may have a high predicted erosive state, they
    exhibit minimal erosion forms, indicating that factors such as traditional plowing
    techniques hinder or counteract erosion. ❖ General Expansion or Intensification
    Trend: Areas exhibiting amplified erosion. They often have a low predicted erosive
    state but more significant actual erosion forms, suggesting that factors like
    upstream runoff or climatic variability contribute to accelerated erosion. ❖ Irreversible
    Deterioration Trend: Areas laying bare patterns of general degeneration nearing
    an irreversible condition. They have low soil protection and high erodibility,
    often near streams or regions with substantial quarry exploitation, resulting
    in severe soil degradation and land fragmentation. Download : Download high-res

    in the raouz catchment. The trend map revealed that most of the watershed (62.62%)
    tends to stabilize or regress, while some parts (29.24%) exhibit a localized tendency
    to expand or intensify. A small segment (6.95%) generally shows expansion or intensification,
    and a tiny fraction (1.19%) displays an overall deterioration trend toward an
    irreversible state. The trend map serves as a valuable tool for identifying and
    prioritizing areas that need attention and intervention to prevent or reduce soil
    erosion. It also aids in understanding how various factors affect the erosion
    potential and trend of the land. Geostatistical methods or additional maps can
    further analyze the spatial variability and distribution of erosion trends in
    the Raouz watershed. The results of the trend analysis were validated and compared
    with 137Cs measurements, which provided quantitative estimates of soil redistribution
    rates in the Raouz watershed. The subsequent section will discuss these results.
    4.2. Associations between factors causing erosion and erosive states: a correlation
    analysis An in-depth analysis of the relationships between diverse variables,
    as presented in Table 2 and Table A2, illuminates crucial factors influencing
    erosive states in the Raouz watershed. Examining these interrelationships within
    the context of erosive states, as depicted in Fig. 4, Fig. 10, significant findings
    emerge, providing valuable insights into the drivers of soil erosion in the region.
    • Erosive State and Soil Protection: the erosive state integrating soil protection
    and soil susceptibility degree has a very high positive correlation between the
    erosive state integrating soil protection and soil susceptibility degree and soil
    protection (r = 0.89067, p < 0.0001). It also has a moderate positive correlation
    with land use (r = 0.31841, p < 0.0001), suggesting that different types of land
    use may affect the erosive state. • Erosive State and Climatic Factors: by introducing
    climatic factors A and B, this study finds erosive states have high positive correlations
    with erodibility (r = 0.76096 and r = 0.54412, respectively, p < 0.0001), indicating
    that higher erodibility corresponds to higher erosive state. They also have high
    positive correlations with slope percentage, length, and exposure (r > 0.5 for
    all pairs, p < 0.0001), suggesting that steeper slopes are more prone to erosion.
    • Erodibility and Soil Characteristics: the erodibility has a very high positive
    correlation with slope percentage, slope length, and slope exposure (r > 0.7 for
    all pairs, p < 0.0001), indicating that these factors are important determinants
    of soil susceptibility to erosion. It also has a moderate positive correlation
    with soil type (r = 0.44598, p < 0.0001), suggesting that different soil types
    have different levels of erodibility. • Cover Density and Environmental Factors:
    the cover density has a moderate negative correlation with LST (r = −0.0048069,
    p = 0.85795), indicating that higher vegetation cover is associated with lower
    surface temperature. It also has a moderate positive correlation with soil moisture
    (r = 0.3629, p < 0.0001), suggesting that higher vegetation cover is associated
    with higher soil moisture. • Rainfall Erosivity and Erosion: the rainfall erosivity
    positively correlates with erosive states upon introducing climatic factors A
    and B (r = 0.61349 and r = 0.46835, respectively, p < 0.0001), suggesting that
    higher rainfall intensity and frequency increase the erosive state. It also has
    a moderate positive correlation with erodibility (r = 0.51386, p < 0.0001), suggesting
    that higher rainfall erosivity increases soil susceptibility to erosion. These
    findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between the factors
    causing erosion and the erosive states in the Raouz watershed. This underscores
    the importance of considering multiple factors when assessing soil erosion risk
    and developing effective soil conservation strategies. 4.3. Comparison and validation
    of the modified PAP/RAC model results with 137Cs data 4.3.1. 137Cs depth profiles
    and erosion rates in Raouz Watershed agricultural fields: climate change implications
    137Cs depth profiles across the Raouz Watershed commonly display distinct patterns.
    In the reference field REF3, for example, 137Cs concentration steadily decreases
    with soil depth, exhibiting an exponential decrease expected within uneroded profiles.
    Complementing these findings, preliminary data indicates a homogenized 137Cs concentration
    within the plowed surface layer (0–15 cm depth) of agricultural field R-T4, likely
    due to the plowing activities, standing at approximately 2.8 Bq kg−1. The reference
    field REF3 presented an average 137Cs inventory of 1633 ± 171 Bq m−2 in 2021,
    noticeably lower than the 2001 inventory of 2651 ± 234 Bq m−2. This reduction
    aligns with the anticipated radioactive decay of 137Cs, whose half-life spans
    30.17 years. Indeed, when we forecast the activity from its 2001 levels, the projected
    2021 inventory stands at 1678 ± 148 Bq m−2, supporting the measured data. For
    agricultural fields, field R-T4''s inventories range from 375 to 1946 Bq m−2 in
    2021, demonstrating a decline from 2001 figures ranging from 1066 to 2138 Bq m−2.
    The data suggest ongoing erosion across these fields, except for one sample suggesting
    deposition. This paper determines gross and net erosion rates and sediment delivery
    ratios using the Mass Balance II model. In 2021, these amount to around 14.9 t
    ha−1 yr−1 for gross erosion and 2.2 t ha−1 yr−1 for deposition, resulting in net
    erosion rates 12.7 t ha−1 yr−1 and an 85% sediment delivery ratio. Compared to
    the 2001 assessment, which reported a 100% sediment delivery ratio due to the
    absence of deposition, this signifies an erosion rate increase of roughly 29%
    and 10% in gross and net values, respectively, over the 20 year period. A closer
    look at field R-T4, which has yet to undergo significant changes in agricultural
    practices, suggests an increase in erosion attributable to climatic shifts. The
    sediment core analysis reinforced this, revealing a pronounced 137Cs peak at the
    17–18 cm layer echoing the residue of mid-20th-century nuclear tests. Calculations
    peg the sedimentation rate within this layer at 0.302 g cm−2 yr−1, equivalent
    to 30.2 t ha−1 yr−1. Continued analyses involving 137Cs and excess 210 Pb are
    expected to enhance our understanding of the dynamics at play. The comparison
    and subsequent validation of the modified PAP/RAC model with the 137Cs findings
    are pivotal for assessing the model''s precision and delving into the temporal
    shifts in erosion and sediment redistribution within the catchment. This analysis
    involves a comprehensive review spanning from statistical tests to spatial visualization.
    4.3.2. Spatial dynamics of soil erosion The spatial distribution of soil loss
    in the Raouz catchment, based on 137Cs measurements, is presented in Table 3 and
    the accompanying figure. The table displays the average erosion rates for each
    transect (R-T1, R-T2, R-T3, and R-T4) calculated using the Mass Balance Model
    2 (MB2) in t ha-1 yr-1. The table provides additional information on the percentage
    of eroded, deposited, and stable areas within each transect. Table 3. Spatial
    distribution of soil loss/gain in raouz catchment based on 137Cs measurements.

    1954 – 2021 1954 – 2021 The majority of the Raouz catchment (77%) experiences
    soil erosion (Damnati et al., 2012; Ed-daoudy et al., 2023; Ibrahimi et al., 2005;
    Moustakim et al., 2022). Transect R-T1 demonstrates the highest erosion rates
    at 19.40 t ha-1 yr-1 in the period 1954–2001 and 16.1 t ha-1 yr-1 for the period
    1954–2018 (Moustakim et al., 2022). Transect R-T2 recorded erosion rates of 8.5
    t ha-1 yr-1 for the period 1954–2001 and 10.3 t ha-1 yr-1 for the period 1954–2018.
    Transect R-T3 recorded a mean erosion rate of approximately 08.50 t ha-1 yr-1
    while having the highest percentage of deposit areas (40%) (Fig. 12). Download

    and 137Cs data effectiveness in predicting soil redistribution rates The correlation
    coefficient between the modified PAP/RAC model results and the 137Cs data for
    the Raouz catchment is 0.96, indicating a strong, positive linear relationship.
    This suggests that the model results and the 137Cs data exhibit similar trends.

    Correlations of modified PAP/RAC model results versus 137Cs data for the raouz
    catchment. 4.4. The modified PAP/RAC model: a reliable tool for erosion rate assessment
    The modified PAP/RAC model has demonstrated its efficacy in evaluating erosion
    rates in the Raouz watershed. The model''s estimated erosion rates closely align
    with those obtained using diverse methodologies, including 137Cs and 210 Pb, RUSLE,
    and SWAT, in similar watersheds. For instance, in the same study area, the RUSLE
    model estimated erosion rates of 16.53 t/ha/year (Ed-daoudy et al., 2023), while
    the 137Cs and 210 Pb method yielded rates ranging from 12 to 41 t/ha/year (Damnati
    et al., 2013). Similarly, in other Moroccan watersheds, such as Loukkos (10 t/ha/year,
    Acharki et al., 2022) and El Grou (11.3 t/ha/year, Ait M’Barek et al., 2021),
    and the Crati catchment in southern Italy (5.8–18 t/ha/year, Porto et al., 2023),
    erosion rates estimated using the modified PAP/RAC model (8.1–20 t/ha/year) align
    closely with those obtained using diverse methodologies. This convergence underscores
    the model''s reliability and robustness, making it a valuable tool for erosion
    rate assessment in diverse geographic contexts and environmental complexities.
    Implementing erosion mitigation strategies that emphasize prevention, sustainable
    land management, and soil conservation is crucial to safeguard soil health, sustain
    agricultural productivity, and fortify ecosystem resilience in fragile watersheds.
    Erosion rates fluctuate over time and space, influenced by factors such as shifting
    rainfall patterns, land use, and management practices. Continuous monitoring and
    assessment of erosion rates remains pivotal for crafting effective erosion control
    strategies and adapting to evolving environmental dynamics. 4.4.1. The significance
    of spatial data in water erosion analysis: challenges and opportunities Incorporating
    spatial data significantly enhances the accuracy of water erosion analysis models.
    This is because spatial data can accommodate intricate geographical nuances, varied
    terrain attributes, and specific land use patterns. By integrating spatial datasets,
    models can effectively identify localized discrepancies in soil composition, topographical
    variations, vegetation distribution, and climatic conditions. This integration
    enables a more refined evaluation of erosion susceptibility across multifaceted
    landscapes, aiding in the identification of areas highly prone to erosion. However,
    addressing geospatial data for water erosion analysis in the Mediterranean region
    presents challenges due to the region''s diverse and heterogeneous characteristics.
    These challenges include data availability, data quality, and the need for harmonization
    and standardization of data from different sources. 4.4.2. Limitations and uncertainties
    of the modified PAP/RAC model: implications for erosion assessment The modified
    PAP/RAC model''s accuracy and suitability have been demonstrated through the use
    of precise input parameters, such as rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope,
    soil moisture content, land management practices, and vegetation cover density.
    Inaccuracies in these factors can significantly affect the model''s predictive
    capability. To mitigate this issue, high-quality datasets, advanced interpolation
    techniques, and on-site measurements are necessary to enhance input data reliability.
    The model may overlook localized or site-specific conditions influencing erosion
    rates, leading to uncertainties in forecasting, particularly in areas with complex
    terrain, heterogeneous soil properties, or diverse land use patterns. Integrating
    additional site-specific variables can help capture these local fluctuations.
    The model''s ability to represent the complete complexity of erosion processes
    is limited, especially in highly dynamic or environments undergoing rapid changes.
    It may not adequately capture the impacts of extreme weather events, such as heavy
    rainfall or wildfires, which can significantly alter erosion rates. Refining the
    model''s algorithms to account for the temporal and spatial variability of erosion
    processes and incorporating dynamic elements are necessary to simulate changing
    environmental conditions. 5. Conclusion The modified PAP/RAC model is a reliable
    and robust tool for estimating soil redistribution rates in the Raouz catchment,
    Morocco. The model results agree with the 137Cs measurements, as shown by the
    strong correlation coefficient (0.96). The modified PAP/RAC model can capture
    the geographical variability and magnitude of soil loss or gain in the catchment
    and the effects of climate change and land use practices on soil erosion. The
    model is also easy to apply and requires only primary input data such as rainfall,
    runoff, slope, soil texture, and land cover. The model can assess soil conservation
    measures and identify priority areas for soil management interventions. Future
    researchers should adopt this model to study soil erosion and deposition in similar
    Mediterranean environments characterized by highly variable and intense rainfall
    and dominated by agricultural land use. This model can offer valuable insights
    for planning and implementing sustainable land management strategies to improve
    soil quality and productivity while mitigating the risk of water pollution and
    sedimentation. Furthermore, it can assess how climate change projected scenarios
    impact soil redistribution rates and formulate adaptation measures to enhance
    the resilience of agroecosystems. However, the modified PAP/RAC model exhibits
    certain limitations and uncertainties that necessitate attention in future studies.
    This model depends on qualitative information, which may not sufficiently encompass
    the intricacies and fluctuations of water erosion processes and contributing factors.
    Moreover, the model demands a great volume of data and parameters, which are not
    consistently accessible or readily obtainable. Similarly, the 137Cs approach has
    limitations and uncertainties, including spatial variability and heterogeneity
    in the distribution of radionuclides across the landscape, the need for expensive
    equipment and laboratory analysis, underlying assumptions, and potential errors
    in the calculation methods. Given these conditions, future studies should improve
    the accuracy and reliability of these methods by using more quantitative data,
    data sources, sampling sites, sampling periods, validation techniques, and statistical
    analysis. The following recommendations outline future research and practice:
    ⁃ Use more quantitative data, such as rainfall intensity, soil texture, soil organic
    matter content, soil bulk density, etc., to better estimate soil erodibility and
    erosivity factors. ⁃ Complement or validate the existing data; use more data sources,
    such as digital soil maps, climate data sets, hydrological data sets, Etc. ⁃ Use
    more sampling sites and periods, especially in the areas with high water erosion
    risk or high variability of radionuclide distribution. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: 'The study explores the intricate interplay between land use land cover
    (LULC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land surface temperature
    (LST) within the Lower Son River Basin in India from 1991 to 2020. The region''s
    ecological balance has been increasingly strained due to rapid urbanization and
    changing land use patterns. Through a combination of Landsat TM & OLI/TIRS satellite
    imageries and geospatial analysis techniques, this study unveils the intricate
    connection between land use and land cover changes, vegetation, and land surface
    temperature variations. The study area is classified into three altitudinal zones
    (Zone I: 39–300 m, Zone II: 301–600 m and Zone III: 601–1,247 m) to examine the
    changes in depth. The area has seen significant changes in LULC, vegetation and
    LST in all the three altitudinal zones. The findings hold significant implications
    for sustainable land management and environmental conservation strategies in the
    Lower Son River Basin. As per the result, 103,438 ha of vegetation was converted
    into agriculture land and 82,572 ha of agricultural land was transformed into
    settlements from 1991 to 2020. This trend shows human pressure on the land resource
    in the study area. Minor increase in water body is seen which is attributed to
    commissioning of Bansagar dam. Zone I has seen highest settlement growth while
    Zone III experienced severe deforestation of around 15%. Zone II and III needs
    attention for holistic sustenance. Analysis of LST shows that it has increased
    by 0.82 °C from 1991 to 2020 which is a red flag. The study underscores the critical
    importance of balanced land use practices to preserve ecological integrity and
    mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization and climate change.'

    • Natural vegetation has seen a decline of 6.74% from 1991 to 2020. • Agricultural
    land has increased by 7% while settlement has increased by 2.6%. • Zone III (601–1,247
    m) has recorded most deterioration in vegetation. • An increase in land surface
    temperature of 0.82 °C is seen from 1991 to 2020. • Positive and weak correlation
    is found between LST and NDVI for the whole area. Abstract The study explores

    The dynamic and uneven nature of land use and land cover (LULC) has led to various
    environmental, ecosystem, water, food security, and climate change problems of
    varying degrees in different portions of the globe (Song et al., 2018; Rahaman
    et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2021). One third of the global land use has seen
    changes either once or on multiple occasions over the past few decades (Winkler
    et al., 2021). The LULC changes are attributed either to natural factors or anthropogenic
    causes (Roy and Roy, 2010; Prasad and Sreenivasulu, 2014). The range and scale
    of these changes determine its consequences on the surroundings and its inhabitants.
    LULC changes have the capacity to alter environmental conditions of that area.
    The surface energy balance is controlled by LULC which can have a huge impact
    on the land surface temperature (LST) (Gogoi et al., 2019, Jain et al., 2017,
    Wang et al., 2018). LST is an effective component for tracking an area’s heat
    balance which varies prominently based on human environment interactions. Liu
    et al. (2016), Mallick et al. (2008), Tan et al. (2010), Grigsby et al. (2015)
    in their studies have pointed out that LST is a scathing factor in moderating
    the physical and chemical processes of our planet. The focal point of their research
    is that if the factors leading to increase in LST are not paid attention to, it
    will create irreversible changes in our surroundings which will be catastrophic.
    According to Qiu et al. (2018), LST is an important variable in climate and environmental
    research. An excellent way of tracking the pattern of LST is by correlating with
    vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Lu and
    Weng, 2006). As vegetation changes seasonally, variations in LST and NDVI is observed.
    The relationship between LST and NDVI has been studied in depth by various experts
    (Smith and Chowdhury, 1990; Gutman and Ignatov, 1998; Goward et al., 2002; Guha
    et al., 2020). Increasing urbanization, population growth, changing LULC dynamics
    with ever changing man environment interaction has led to innumerable researches
    for proper planning and management of all vital resources around us for our sustenance
    (Demuth and Radojevic, 2011; Tim and Jolly, 1994; Huang et al., 2013). Studies
    were developed on Son River Basin but no concrete study with elaborate results
    has been published on Lower Son River Basin which extends over five Indian states
    and play a noticeable role in contributing to Indian economy and culture. Thus,
    this study is one of its kind taking temporal as well as spatial components in
    micro-detail. This micro-zonation of study area would help us analyse whether
    any particular zone needs more attention and conservation than others. The study
    has tried to present observable results in the study area so that policymakers
    and planners can formulate plans and policies accordingly. The study addresses
    the previous research gaps of not studying Lower Son River Basin at minute level.
    No study has focussed on decadal change analysis of LULC, LST for four time periods.
    River basins need to be monitored with acute precision to avoid any shortcomings
    in the long run. For this, continuous monitoring is required. Our study understood
    the gravity of the situation and addressed all the previous research gaps. The
    primary objectives of this study encompass the comprehensive analysis of decadal
    changes in LULC, LST, NDVI, as well as the investigation of the correlation between
    LST and NDVI within the Lower Son River Basin. The temporal scope of the study
    spans from 1991 to 2020, during which the alterations in these key environmental
    indicators would be thoroughly examined and interpreted. The whole area has been
    divided into three altitudinal zones on the basis of elevation, and LULC, LST,
    LST-NDVI correlations have been calculated for each altitudinal zone as well.
    This would give a better context in understanding the changing pattern of the
    study area at micro level and help the planners and researchers in recognising
    the crucial area. By unraveling the relationships between LULC changes, LST, and
    NDVI in densely populated areas, this study can empower local stakeholders to
    formulate targeted strategies for managing urban growth, safeguarding natural
    resources, and enhancing the well-being of the inhabitants. Ultimately, the research
    contributes to the development of sustainable practices that align with the primary
    activities and livelihoods of the community, while also preserving the environment
    for current and future generations. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area Son
    River originates from Amarkantak hills in Chhattisgarh and has its mouth in Patna,
    Bihar where it meets the Ganga River. Son is the largest southern tributary of
    the Ganga. The catchment has been divided into Upper Son River Basin and Lower
    Son River Basin. Lower Son River Basin passes through the states of Chhattisgarh,
    Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar (Fig. 1). The basin extends
    between 22°37′58.6″ N to 25°43′48.12″ N latitude and 80°5′35.68″ E to 84°58′31.47″
    E longitude. The river has two dams built on it. The gradient of the river is
    steep, i.e., 35–55 centimetre per kilometre. It has a very narrow flood plain.
    Two prominent types of land use found in the area are agricultural and vegetation.
    The worrisome part is transformation of vegetation land into other land use categories.
    Urban augmentation and growth of population in the study area has also led to
    stress on water resources. The area inhabits around 14.3 million people (2011
    Census) spanning over 15 districts which has been on a continuous rise. The population
    of the area has grown at the rate of about 20% from 1991 to 2021. Download : Download

    time periods namely 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2020 of November, December and January
    months were acquired from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer
    portal (Table S1). Cloud free data was downloaded to avoid any issues while performing
    any exercise for achieving seamless and accurate results. The satellite data of
    November, December, and January were acquired for all the reference years. All
    images were geometrically corrected after acquisition. 2.3. Methods 2.3.1. Methods
    overview Remote Sensing data files have been used extensively to complete the
    study along with software’s like Erdas Imagine, ArcGIS and Microsoft Excel to
    pre-process and analyse the data and visualise its results. The workflow chart
    (Fig. 2) for completing the research mentions the step by step methodology of
    each objective. The study has been completed with the help of secondary data downloaded
    from USGS Earth Explorer. Data was then processed and analysed in Erdas Imagine,
    ArcGIS, Microsoft Office Word and Excel. Download : Download high-res image (801KB)

    Lower Son River Basin is classified into three altitudinal zones on the basis
    of Digital Elevation Model obtained from Earth Explorer USGS website following
    the method of natural break embedded in ArcGIS software. The study area elevation
    ranges from 39 m to 1,247 m. The categorisation is done in three classes as Zone
    I (39–300 m), Zone II (301–600 m) and Zone III (601–1,247 m), respectively. 2.3.3.
    LULC classification Land use land cover categories are bracketed from remotely
    acquired satellite data with the means of digital classification of images and
    their interpretation (Lee and Lewicki, 2002; Lillesand et al., 2008). Quantity
    and quality of land cover varied in each category as there is a significant elevation
    difference in our region. Landsat TM and OLI data for 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2020
    were downloaded (Table S1) and 6 categories of LULC classes have been developed
    as shown in Table 1. Categorisation aids in examining and assessing change detection
    if it has happened over the years. The focal aim is to group all similar pixels
    of an image into corresponding land cover categories. Before classifying, image
    was pre-processed to remove any complications such as stripping, cloud coverage
    (Zawadzki et al., 2005), etc., in Erdas Imagine software. Various algorithms have
    been applied for better processing of the images such as enhancement of the satellite
    images, extraction of required features, segmentation, fusion, change detection,
    compression, classification and at the end on feature detection. Supervised image
    classification method was used for classifying the image pixels. Around 190–200
    sample pixels were selected from all the categories for accurate classification.
    The supervised classification process used is the Maximum Likelihood Classification
    (MLC) which is based on Bayes theorem (Strahler, 1980; Foody et al., 1992; Maselli
    et al., 1994). Table 1. Description of LULC categories. LULC categories Description
    Agricultural land Agricultural land (cultivated and uncultivated) such as farms,
    crop-land including fallow lands and horticultural areas Barren land This comprises
    bare soil, gravel deposit, rock outcrop and unused land Sediment/Sand Accumulation
    of sediments from river erosional and denudation processes form this category
    Settlement This feature class encompasses built up land within – residential.
    Commercial, industrial, educational and recreation Vegetation Shrubs, grasslands,
    trees make up this category Water body This includes all surface water bodies
    which are visible on the imagery – River, Drain, Stream, Canal. Tank, Pond, Reservoir,
    and Dam All the six types of LULC, i.e., agricultural land, barren land, sediment/sand,
    settlement, vegetation and water body, are notably found in every zone. The degree
    varies from zone to zone which are attributed to changes in temperature, air pressure,
    precipitation and other physical factors. Other factors such as angle of slope
    or aspect of the area, also play a major role. LULC, LST and NDVI for all zones
    have been calculated and after that, correlation amidst LST and NDVI has been
    examined. 2.3.4. Computation of LST LST is the radiative skin temperature of the
    surface land, as computed in the flow of the sensor (Kumar et al., 2018). LST
    is deemed as a valuable indicator in the research of energy balance models on
    regional and global scales. LST affects air temperature directly (Yu et al., 2005;
    Duan et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019). LST is an essential
    tool in studying meteorological, hydrological, climate based studies at local,
    national and global levels (Jiménez-Muñoz et al., 2014; Tomlinson et al., 2011;
    Avdan and Jovanovska, 2016). Numerous studies regarding calculation of LST from
    remotely captured satellite data has been made over the past decades (Jimenez-Munoz
    and Sobrino 2003; Zhang et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2007; Rothery, 1989; Nwilo
    et al., 2012; Oguz, 2013; Zaharaddeen et al., 2016; Jeevalakshmi et al., 2017;
    Deng et al., 2018; Tarawally et al., 2018). The thermal bands 6 of Thematic Mapper
    (TM) for 1991, 2000 and 2010 and Thermal Infrared Sensors (TIRS) band 10 for 2020
    have been used to compute the LST of Lower Son River basin. For 1991, 2000, 2010,
    the Band 6 of Landsat 5, which is the Thermal Band, is mosaicked in Erdas Imagine
    and study area is then clipped. For 2020, Band 10 of Landsat 8 is mosaicked together
    for calculating LST. • Converting Digital Number (DN) into spectral radiance (L)
    (1) where, L(λ) = Spectral radiance, Lmin = Spectral radiance of minimum value,
    Lmax = Spectral radiance of maximum value, DN = Digital number. • Conversion of
    spectral radiance to temperature in Kelvin, as shown in below equation (2) where,
    K1 = Calibration constant 1 (607.76); K2 = Calibration constant 2 (1,260.56);
    R = Radiance values W/m2 SR μm; T = Surface temperature (in Kelvin). • Land Surface
    Emissivity (LSE) is calculated based on values of NDVI. It uses the NDVI Thresholds
    Methods (NDVI THM) by using the formula (Sobrino and Raissouni, 2001): (3) • In
    the final step, Kelvin (T) is converted to Celsius (TB) with the following formula:
    (4) 2.3.5. Calculation of NDVI NDVI has been developed by Rouse Jr. et al. (1973)
    to calculate the amount of biomass. It considers the red and the near-infrared
    bands. The NDVI is a simple arithmetic indicator that is used to examine the remote
    sensing quantifications and assess whether the target being perceived contains
    live green vegetation or not (Adab et al., 2014; Jensen, 2007; Liang, 2005). This
    index in particular is the most popular vegetation index in analysing greenery
    globally. Range of NDVI varies from -1 to +1. Greater value of NDVI is synonymous
    with dense greenery. Value range and its meaning is mentioned as: NDVI = -1 to
    0 depicts water bodies. NDVI = -0.1 to 0.1 corresponds to barren rocks, sand,
    or snow. NDVI = 0.2 to 0.5 describes shrubs and grasslands or senescing crops.
    NDVI = 0.6 to 1.0 displays dense vegetation or tropical rainforest. NDVI is the
    ratio of the variance between the near-infrared band and the red band to the aggregate
    of these two bands (Rouse Jr. et al., 1973). (5) (6) (7) where, NIR denotes reflectance
    in the NIR band, and RED means reflectance in the visible red band. NDVI value
    ranges from -1 to +1. Only positive values correspond to vegetated zones. If index
    value is higher, it means that there is greater content of chlorophyll. A comprehensive
    evaluation of correlation of LST and NDVI was calculated using fishnet technique
    in ArcGIS. Then graphs were plotted for easy analysis in excel. Relationship between
    NDVI and LST was established using linear regression method. NDVI is very sensitive
    to changes and changing NDVI might lead to differences in LST. 3. Results 3.1.
    Land use land cover change detection The LULC change detection has been done on
    multitemporal basis and the following results (Fig. 3) are presented in the form
    of maps. Four LULC maps of 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2020 have been prepared to show
    the changes with clarity (Fig. 3 (a)). Results show that agricultural land has
    increased substantially from 36.648% in 1991 to 43.658% in 2020. An area increase
    of 340,478 ha of land used for agricultural purposes have been observed. Settlement
    category has recorded noticeable expansion of 2.6% from 1991 to 2020 (Table 2).
    Interesting trend observed is that settlement saw major growth during 2010 – 2020
    as compared to previous years of 1991 and 2000. Barren land has decreased from
    143,264 ha in 1991 to 12,390 ha in 2020. Water body has recorded meagre increase
    of 0.25% from 1991 to 2020. Decadal change of area in all LULC classes have also
    been prepared to depict changes with more clarity (Table S2). An alarming signal
    is the decrease of about 6.74% in vegetative surface of Lower Son River Basin
    from 1991 to 2020. Any LULC classification is not deemed verifiable if accuracy
    results are not calculated. In this study, the accuracy reports of all the classification
    years are depicted in Table S3. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    in land use land cover from 1991 to 2020. LULC categories of 1991 are shown in
    columns while those of 2021 are depicted in the form of rows. LULC matrix (Table
    3) shows that 1,943,228 ha of land has changed from 1991 to 2020, whereas 3,283,842
    ha of land is unchanged. 103,438 ha of barren land in 1991 got transformed into
    agricultural land in 2021, as visible in first column’s third row. Likewise, 709,024
    ha of vegetation in 1991 has gotten transferred into agricultural land in 2021.
    48,122 ha of vegetation covered surface in 1991 has been converted into settlement
    in 2021. 36,294 ha of agricultural land in 1990 got reshaped as water body in
    2021. Majority of sediment/sand covered areas of 1991 were transformed into agricultural
    areas. Table 3. LULC matrix, 1991–2020. All the areas are represented in hectares

    change along altitudinal zones Zone I has an elevation from 39 m to 300 m. A statistical
    summary of the extent of each land use land cover class in all the three altitudinal
    zones has been presented in Table 4. All the LULC classes have seen a notable
    difference from 1991 to 2020 except water body (Fig. 3(b)). The most prominent
    change is seen in barren land category which has decreased drastically from 4.19%
    in 1991 to 0.38% in 2020. It is found that barren land got converted into agricultural
    land and settlement as supplemented by matrix table (Table 3). As pointed above,
    the study area experienced an increase in agricultural land of about 1.94% from
    1991 to 2020. The next LULC class to record a major increase is settlement as
    in 1991 it was only 0.63% which increased tremendously to 4.77% in 2020. Vegetation
    has declined by 2%. Table 4. Altitude wise LULC change detection from 1991 to

    from 301 m to 600 m and it recorded steep increase in cultivated land as well
    as settlement. Vegetation has registered deterioration in this zone showing a
    decline of around 10.67%, i.e., 67.10% to 56.43% from 1991 to 2020 which is a
    point of serious concern (Fig. 3(b)). However, this decline is still less in Zone
    II as compared to Zone III. Agricultural land recorded a rise of 11.24%, i.e.,
    29.70% in 1991 to 40.94% in 2020. Zone III ranges from 601 m to 1,247 m and follows
    closely the LULC pattern of Zone II (Fig. 3 (b)). Vegetation has seen a humongous
    decline of 14.20%, i.e., 78.56% in 1991 to 64.36% in 2020. There has been almost
    double increase in agricultural land from 19.51% to 34.65%. Destruction of natural
    vegetation for creation of arable land and pastoral activities as well as for
    construction has serious repercussions. It is noteworthy to mention that loss
    of vegetation is highest in third zone as compared to the first and second zones.
    Agricultural land has also seen a huge rise of 15.14% which is the highest among
    all the three zones. This needs to be checked at the earliest else it would affect
    the nature of runoff of the river and other hydrological characteristics would
    be compromised and events like flash flood and drought might occur in future.
    3.2. Land Surface Temperature (LST) 3.2.1. Changes in LST in Lower Son River Basin
    The minimum and maximal temperatures in 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were calculated
    to be 11.67 °C, 34.54 °C; 11.83 °C, 34.69 °C; 12.35 °C, 34.87 °C and 12.77 °C,
    35.66 °C, respectively (Table S4). The mean temperature in 1991 was 23.10 °C,
    which increased to 23.26 °C in 2000, 23.61 °C in 2010, and 23.92 °C in 2020. Thus,
    mean temperature rose by 0.82 °C from 1991 to 2020 (Fig. 4 (a)). This shows a
    continuous increase in temperature of the region which is an alarming signal.
    However, the greatest rise in temperature was from 2000 to 2010 which was followed
    by 2010 to 2020. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    wise land surface temperature, 1991–2020. 3.2.2. Altitudinal variation of LST
    The minimum temperature in Zone I was 12.67 °C and the maximum was 34.54 °C in
    1991 which increased to 13.77 °C and 35.16 °C in 2020, respectively (Table S5).
    Fig. 4(b) shows zone wise calculated values of LST from 1991 to 2020. In Zone
    I, mean temperature was calculated to be 23.60 °C in 1991, 23.76 °C in 2000, 24.10
    °C in 2010 and 24.46 °C in 2020. Likewise, mean temperature in Zone II varied
    from 23.10 °C in 1991 to 23.19 °C in 2000, 23.55 °C in 2010 and 23.52 °C in 2020.
    Zone III had mean temperature of 22.64 °C in 1991, 22.27 °C in 2000, 22.58 °C
    in 2010 and 23.10 °C in 2020. The mean temperature from 1991 to 2020 increased
    by 0.86 °C in Zone I. Zone II and Zone III recorded temperature increase of 0.42
    °C and 0.46 °C which is relatively lower than in Zone I. 3.3. Analysis of NDVI
    Vegetation shows an increase in 2020 which is credited to the increase in agricultural
    land (Fig. 5). This increase should not be considered positive because natural
    vegetation cannot be replaced by man-made green fields as far as stable ecosystems
    are concerned. Also, as mentioned in LST calculation, for the year 2020, mean
    surface temperature has increased since 1990. The spatial distribution of vegetation
    cover area has shown continuous change from 1991 to 2020. Green area was larger
    in 1991 and after that it has gradually seen a decline till 2020. This change
    has also been validated with LULC change detection analysis and matrix table.

    rate of change in vegetation from 1991 to 2020 has deteriorated by 6.74% which
    has led to the increase in LST of the area. Download : Download high-res image

    in Lower Son River Basin Zone I depicts a positive yet very weak relationship
    between LST and NDVI in the area (Fig. 6(b)). This means that in Zone I, positive
    association between LST-NDVI exists but it is too weak to make any strong decision.
    Zone II (Fig. 6(c)) illustrated fairly better R2 value in 1991 and 2001 but in
    2020 it declined steeply. This again shows a positive correlation between the
    two variables. However, the relationship is weak as demonstrated in Fig. 6. In
    Zone III (Fig. 6(d)), R2 value has varied from 0.28 in 1991, 0.19 in 2000. 0.36
    in 2010 and 0.04 in 2020. 4. Discussion 4.1. Analysis of changes in LULC As per
    the results obtained, the area has seen significant changes in LULC pattern from
    1991 to 2020. Agricultural land has seen an increase of 7%. This increase is attributed
    to the increase in population which has also led to an expansion in agricultural
    occupancy of the people living over there. Rouse Jr. et al. (1973) pointed out
    in their study that changes in land use land cover is related to population change
    happening in that area. This is validated in our study. Major crops cultivated
    in the area are rice, wheat, maize, jowar, barley, bajra, lentils and sugarcane.
    Kumari et al. (2022) pointed in their study that rice is the dominant crop in
    the area followed by wheat and maize. The exponential increase in the population
    of study area led to the increase in land acquired for agricultural purposes.
    The study area shows a minor increase in water body in the extreme west part in
    2020, which was very narrow in 1991. The reason for increase in water body is
    building an extensive line of canals in the study area as well as commissioning
    of Bansagar dam in September 2006. It is a Multipurpose River Valley Project on
    Son River which is situated in the Ganga Basin in Madhya Pradesh, India, with
    both irrigation facility and 435 MW of hydropower generation. This dam has contributed
    immensely to irrigation as well as hydropower generation. Rohtas district which
    lies in the study area is known as Rice belt of Bihar. Agricultural crops are
    cultivated smoothly as there is good network of canals in the region. Decrease
    in vegetation cover of 6.74% is also noticed. Matrix table shows that this decrease
    is because of transformation of vegetation surface into agricultural land followed
    by settlement. This is because of rising pressure on resources to meet the needs
    of increasing population in the area. Sediment/sand category has seen a decrease
    because of its conversion into agricultural land and some getting submerged in
    water. Settlement has increased about 3% in the area because of population increase.
    It becomes pertinent to discuss the LULC changes along the altitudinal zones to
    see if all the zones are following the same pattern or if any one or two has degraded.
    Abebe et al. (2022) has discussed about the in depth analysis of LULC to map sustainable
    ecosystem services of any area. The altitudinal classification is to mark the
    detailed study about the landscape of the study area. Results show that all the
    three zones have experienced changes in all LULC categories. However, Zone I has
    experienced increase in agricultural land and decrease of barren land. The most
    evident cause for this transformation is the availability of riparian high-yielding
    land in this zone. This is justified as population has increased in the region
    considerably and to meet the food needs, more land was acquired for agricultural
    purposes. Increase in settlement in Zone I is also attributed to the rise in population
    over the time period. The first zone has seen a marked transformation in settlement
    class and barren land as shown in results section. The second zone has seen more
    deterioration in vegetation (11% decrease) as compared to Zone I (2% decrease).
    Agricultural land in Zone II increased by 11%. However, Zone III has seen the
    most decline in vegetation (14.2%) as compared to other two zones. Agricultural
    land has also increased considerably in Zone III from 19.51% in 1991 to 34.65%
    in 2020, seeing an increase of 15.14%. Several studies such as Scott et al. (2018),
    Stoy (2018) and Prevedello et al., (2019) have depicted that any change at the
    cost of deforestation is bound to create unfavourable circumstances in the future
    which leads to threat on the environment, ultimately causing livelihood limitations
    on the population inhabiting the particular area. As it is shown in various studies,
    vegetation cover plays a very integral role in water and energy cycles and hence
    forms the backbone of river ecosystems. Anthropogenic activities are to blame
    for this loss in green cover as agricultural activity and settlements have increased
    at the expense of vegetative land. Declining vegetation has adverse effects on
    soil quantity and soil quality leading to accumulation of sediments along river
    banks and other areas as put forth by Price et al. (2013) and Schultz et al. (2017).
    Undoubtedly, to sustain a large population, food is required but at the same time
    for sustainable management of river ecosystems, care should be taken to not cross
    the threshold limit to avoid any disastrous effects in the long run. Monitoring
    and analysing changes in LULC offer crucial information about shifts in land utilization,
    which can impact crop production, rural development, urban expansion, green spaces,
    and even water resources. These findings can aid urban planners, policymakers,
    and resource managers in making informed decisions to ensure sustainable development
    and the preservation of critical ecological balances. 4.2. Analysis of changes
    in LST The region as well as the three zones recorded an increase in surface temperature
    in the last three decades. This can be correlated with the fact that vegetation
    has been on a continuous decline in the region to meet the needs of mankind. Studies
    by Stoy (2018); Swann et al. (2012) and Unger (2014) have brought to our notice
    that declining natural vegetation is directly proportional to rise in temperature
    over an area. All the three zones have seen an increase in mean temperature. Zone
    I has recorded almost double increase in mean temperature as compared to second
    zone. These figures prove that climate of Lower Son River Basin has got hotter
    over the last three decades. This increase (0.82 °C) is, however in compliance
    with IPCC reports (IPCC, 2007) but river basins are very fragile ecosystems and
    even minute changes can disturb the whole area and its people. The reasons for
    these temporal and spatial variations in LST have to be explored in combination
    with changing LULC pattern of the region. It has experienced an abnormal decrease
    in green cover because of man-made activities. Review of literature has suffixed
    that deforestation, expanse in cultivated land, increase in built up area coupled
    with climate change leads to increase in land surface temperature. All these changes
    have taken place in Lower Son River Basin which has increased the temperature
    considerably. This needs to be regulated at the earliest else devastating impact
    on human-environment processes would be observed. Also, increase in LST can have
    several significant impacts on the local people, the economy of the area and people’s
    livelihoods such as – reduction in the yield of crop, water scarcity and decreased
    revenue because of adverse impacts on agriculture, biodiversity loss and soil
    erosion which can cumulatively lead to climate induced migration. Thus, proper
    mitigation measures need to be adopted to control this rise otherwise survival
    of river ecosystem and mankind in the region will be put at stake. 4.3. Analysis
    of LST-NDVI correlation The coefficient of determination ranges from 0.038 in
    1991 to 0.008 in 2020. The values of R2 from 1991 to 2020 are positive but noteworthy
    point to mention that these values are fluctuating. From 1991 to 2000, R2 value
    has decreased to almost half while from 2000 to 2010 it has recorded almost four
    times growth and from 2010 to 2020, the value saw a steep decline to a level equating
    to 2000. These values simply mean that there are other factors in the study area
    which would explain the increasing rate of LST from 1991 to 2020. Studies have
    depicted an R2 value of 0.4 or more than it is ideal for making any remarks about
    the association. The correlation LST-NDVI is indeed positive in the whole region
    as well as in all the three zones but it is very feeble to establish any analysis.
    The significance level of this analysis is low but since the relationship is positive,
    we put forth that any changes in NDVI will lead to changes in LST. Furthermore,
    studying changes in LST and NDVI in such an area provides a comprehensive understanding
    of the thermal environment and vegetation health in studies by Walker et al. (2020)
    and Williams (2021). Rising LST can indicate heat island effects caused by urbanization,
    potentially affecting the quality of life for residents and leading to increased
    energy consumption for cooling purposes. Meanwhile, variations in NDVI reflect
    alterations in vegetation cover and health, impacting local air quality, biodiversity,
    and overall ecosystem resilience. 4.4. Limitations of the study The limitations
    of the study are few but notable as per our best understanding is the lack of
    continuous and yearly analysis of Land Use and Land Cover variation as satellite
    data for multiple years becomes too heavy to process. However, if done yearly,
    LULC changes could be observed more clearly and aid us in better understanding
    the changes taking place in the study area. This is the reason decadal study has
    been done. The second limitation can be the extent of the study area. Lower Son
    River Basin has been chosen as area of interest instead of Son River Basin. This
    has been done as previous studies have taken Son River Basin but very few studies
    on Lower Son River Basin have been done. The third limitation is the resolution
    of satellite imagery used in the study which is around 30 m. The LULC classes
    of study area were categorised into six classes. Further division could not be
    identified because of coarse resolution of the images. 5. Conclusions River Basins
    are fragile ecosystems and a minute change in atmospheric conditions persisting
    over longer period of time has the potentiality of drastically altering the landscape.
    Our research aimed at establishing LULC, LST, NDVI changes at multi temporal and
    spatial scales and the relationship with each other to better understand the physical
    and environmental health of the study area. There has been substantialdecline
    of vegetation and increase of agricultural land in the study area. All these changes
    especially transformation of vegetation into other LULC classes act as a trigger
    for initiating unwanted physical and ecological changes which can lead to impacting
    communities adversely in the long run. Changes are observed in all the three classes
    categorised on the basis of elevation. The alarming signal can be seen in Zone
    III and Zone II which have experienced a decrease in vegetation. Changes in LULC
    lead to changes in LST as depicted by results in this study. LST has increased
    by 0.82 °C from 1991 to 2020 which is equally disturbing. The significance level
    of LST-NDVI correlation is very low to put forward any claim in the area. The
    same trend is observed in all the three altitudinal zones. People inhabiting this
    area are engaged in primary activities and any variation in LULC and LST will
    have direct consequences on their livelihood opportunities. The policy implications
    of this study can be utilised in framing sustainable land use practices, restoration
    of degraded lands, plan for equitable sharing of water resources and holistic
    use of local resources in the study area. This study will open more avenues for
    researchers not only from geography but its allied disciplines to add other related
    dimensions. The study is empirical and scientific tools and algorithms have been
    applied to obtain the results. Audience from social sciences as well as sciences
    have their share to take away from this paper. Holistic and sustainable development
    of the basin and its people is intertwined with economy, environment and society,
    hence, making scope for readers and researchers from allied disciplines. Declaration

  description: Changes in land use and land cover are imperative drivers of climate
    change in urbanization. The conversion of land use modifies the physical and thermal
    characteristics of the land surface and also has an impact on the air quality.
    This study aims to assess the potential impact of land use and land cover (LULC)
    on the air quality in Gujarat state, India for 6 years, 2018, 2020, and 2023.
    Six land-use types, water bodies, forest, agricultural land, built-up, barren
    land, and scrubland obtained from the Landsat 8 land cover product processed in
    Google Earth Engine (GEE), where LULC of each category was estimated. The analysis
    findings indicated that variations in pollution response to LULC change exhibit
    distinct differences across different regions, influenced by natural factors or
    human activities like deforestation and urbanization. Over the years 2018–2023,
    agricultural land seems to consistently decrease in area, but urban areas saw
    exponential growth. The combined percentage of agricultural land and forest area
    slightly decreased from 61.08% to 60.7%, while the water spread area increased
    from 4.07% to 5.13%. The category of bare land decreased from 29.59% to 27.56%,
    mainly due to urbanization converting bare soil into built-up areas. The Sentinel-5P
    satellite data was used to estimate atmospheric pollution i.e., carbon mono-oxide
    (CO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Methane (CH4), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and formaldehyde
    (HCHO). Over the past decade, a significant portion of land use land cover has
    transitioned from forest to vegetation areas in the western region, while urbanization
    has rapidly expanded in the eastern and central-western parts.

    in the population, urban sprawl, deforestation, and the adaptation of new technologies
    by industries have highly impacted the usage of the Earth''s surface/natural resources
    , transforming major metropolitan cities into pollution hotspots due to anthropogenic
    activities led to changes in the land use and land cover (LULC) of a particular
    region [1,2]. The changes in LULC have a significant impact on the loss of biodiversity
    and mankind, the changes in LULC lead to an increase in urbanization, and deforestation
    and a decrease in the air quality index, which would consequently increase land
    surface temperature (LST)[[3], [4], [5]]. Deforestation leads to a drastic decrease
    in the population of birds, animal, and their habitat, which ultimately leads
    to climate change which has an adverse effect on the environment, causing deterioration
    in human health and leading to vectors of malaria [[6], [7], [8]], which makes
    LULC monitoring an important parameter for the nation to regulate urbanization
    and maintain environmental emissions effectively [9,10]. However, distinct studies
    have concluded urban sprawl is a major source of air pollution by acknowledging
    LULC and landscape pattern changes [11]. Some of the impactful mobile sources
    of air pollution are automobiles contributing almost 70–75% of the total air pollution,
    while stationary sources mainly include power plant which contributes to the rest
    20–25% of the total air pollution sources, the remaining 2–5% is contributed by
    forest fires, open crops burning, etc. [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. Many environmental
    issues are stimulated by air pollution including major effects on human health
    which have led to significant changes in the mortality rate of various developed
    and developing countries [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. According to World Health
    Organization (WHO) air pollution can be defined as the contamination of the surrounding
    environment by the means of physical, chemical, or biological factors that lead
    to notable changes in the normal characteristics of the air [21], however, industrial
    areas all over the world are held majorly responsible for the air pollution, particulate
    matter (PM) and deteriorating human health [13,22,23]. Some of the pollutants
    contributing to air pollution are particulate matter (PM)[24], nitrogen dioxide
    (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), etc., a drastic increase in
    the concentration of such compounds leaves mankind in an alarming situation as
    these greenhouse gases portray heat-trapping ability which has increased the average
    surface temperature [25,26] of the earth''s by 1.1 °C (from the year 1880) and
    major changes can be quantified after 1975 with an increase in the rate by 0.15–0.20
    °C per decade [27]. The increase in the average surface temperature has resulted
    in the rise of the speed and severity of the water cycle globally, hence contributing
    to destructive droughts [[28], [29], [30]], floods [31,[32], [33]], and storms
    [34,35]. Various studies examine the link between deforestation, urbanization,
    and air pollution [36]. reported that climate change may increase the concentration
    of ground-level ozone but the magnitude of the effect remains uncertain. Deforestation
    and urbanization are the major causes of air pollution and greenhouse gases, which
    play a major role in climate change, anthropogenic activities lead to the LULC
    changes causing air pollution from moving vehicles, toxic gases from industries,
    coal power plants burning wood or other material in open air, landfills in the
    urbanized area, which is majorly caused due to deforestation. The air quality
    in Gujarat improved greatly when the country was on lockdown during the COVID-19
    pandemic as many factories, and large mills were non-functional, and vehicular
    emissions were also reduced [37]. The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Gujarat is monitored
    by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), which provides accurate information
    on the levels of air pollutants, according to Ref. [38] major cities of Gujarat
    like Ahmedabad, Bharuch, Gandhinagar have high AQI ranging above 150 while Ahmedabad
    is ranked the fourth most polluted city of India with an AQI of 160. Presently,
    cloud computing systems are used significantly to monitor alteration in the LULC
    of any particular region, an intensifying study can be carried out by using Google
    Earth Engine (GEE) as a platform [39]. GEE is a cloud-based spatial analytics
    platform launched and hosted by Google in 2010, open to all having geospatial
    data associated with a variety of satellites with notably high accuracy [40].
    Remote sensing has gained importance recently as it helps in the administration
    of LULC, and changes in the health of the vegetation, soil, and water bodies,
    etc. [[41], [42], [43]]. The intensity of the analyzed data can be harnessed by
    deploying multispectral analysis, passive microwave, thermal infrared analysis,
    etc. [[44], [45], [46]] which would thereby provide higher spatial resolution
    at a low cost and data can be analyzed repeatedly [[47], [48], [49]]. Using the
    data provided by the Landsat-8 satellite early prediction of the Air Pollution
    Index (API) can be generated by using the average comparative value of the present
    scenario and the standards available for the particular pollutant [50]. Machine
    learning techniques can be used for predicting air quality and its relation with
    meteorological parameters [51,52]. Hence it becomes mandatory to measure the atmospheric
    parameters and levels of pollutants along with their variation over a while, as
    analysis of various scenarios would help in developing early warnings and a forecast
    system. Despite some research on the impact of changes in the landscape characteristics
    on air quality in some parts of India. However, the research on Gujarat state
    is yet scanty, as no studies have been conducted for assessment of air quality
    due to alteration in LULC. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the potential
    impact of LULC on air quality in the state of Gujarat, India for the years 2018,
    2020, and 2023. The main objectives of the research are: (i) To identify the LULC
    change by processing Landsat 8 using GEE. (ii) To assess the air quality parameters
    by processing Sentinel P-5 & MODIS satellite data using GEE. (iii) To assess the
    potential impact of LULC on air quality parameters. A comprehensive understanding
    of the spatial and temporal variation of various air quality parameters with LULC
    change can facilitate the implementation of strategies to reduce pollution. 2.
    Study area Gujarat state is geographically situated on the northwest coast of
    India, with its western border facing the Arabian Sea whereas, the north and northeast
    share its border with Rajasthan, and the south and southeast, share its border
    with Maharashtra [53] and illustrated in Fig. 1. The state extends its coordinates,
    latitude from 20°60′ N to 24°42′ N and longitude from 68°10′E to 74°28′E. The
    state covers a land area of about 196,024 square kilometers and a coastline of
    particularly 1600 km which makes it one of the most extensive among all the states
    [[13], [54],55]. Climate conditions in Gujarat showcase distinct conditions with
    hot and humid summers, temperatures ranging from 49 °C during the daytime and
    up to 30 °C at night, whereas winters are cold and dry with an average temperature
    of 29 °C in the day and 12 °C during the night [56]. The study area is home to
    72.7 million individuals, it is one of the largest hubs for chemical industries
    and has shown a significant development in the past couple of years. Download

    Location of Gujarat on the geographical map (study area). The state is classified
    into three major regions, by its geography. 1. The Saurashtra peninsula is, a
    rocky terrain with low-lying mountains consisting of major cities like Jamnagar,
    Rajkot, Morbi, etc. 2. Kutch is present in the northeastern part of the state,
    which is barren and has a rough and rocky terrain. Kutch is accompanied by Raan
    which expands in the northern and eastern parts of Gujarat and various namely
    cities like Mundra, Bhuj, Gandhi Dham, etc. 3. The mainland of Gujarat which lies
    between the Rann of Kutch and the Daman Ganga River, this patch of land is fertile
    and composed of alluvial soil Major cities of Gujarat like Vadodara, Ahmedabad,
    Bharuch, Surat, etc. Lie in this patch. 3. Materials and method 3.1. Datasets
    The concentration of various pollutants is predominantly dependent on various
    factors like climatic conditions, topographic conditions, land surface temperature,
    LULC in the region, various human activities, etc. For identifying the potential
    impact of LULC on air quality in Gujarat state, the selection of Sentinel-5P,
    MODIS, and Landsat 8 satellite sensors was used. Sentinel-5P provides high-resolution
    measurements of atmospheric composition, including pollutants such as nitrogen
    dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and aerosols. MODIS
    offers moderate-resolution imagery suitable for monitoring land surface characteristics,
    vegetation dynamics, and land cover changes. Landsat 8 provides high-quality multispectral
    imagery with moderate spatial resolution, enabling detailed mapping of land surface
    features. The combination of Sentinel-5P, MODIS, and Landsat 8 sensors allows
    for a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of LULC on air quality
    in Gujarat state. By leveraging the strengths of these satellite datasets, researchers
    can gain valuable insights into the relationships between land use changes, atmospheric
    pollution, and environmental health, ultimately supporting informed decision-making
    and policy development efforts. Various data sets (Table 1) were used for the
    analysis of the concentration of different pollutants and LULC of the study area,
    as listed below. 1. Sentinel 5-P - It utilizes the onboard TROPOMI instrument
    which operates in the passive mode of remote sensing, operating in the 270 nm–500nm
    (UV–visible) and 2305 nm–2385nm (Shortwave Infrared) electromagnetic spectrum.
    The datasets provided by the satellite were utilized to analyze parametric concentrations
    of CO, NO2, CH4, SO2, and HCHO [57]. 2. MODIS - The onboard instrument provides
    global land cover types at yearly intervals with a spectral resolution of 1 km,
    and was used to train the LULC model. State ([58] n.d.). 3. Landsat-8 -The datasets
    provided by the onboard instrument were used for the classification of land use

    Methodology The evaluation of air quality in Gujarat state, India comprised different
    stages that require the involvement of different tools for the generation of shapefile,
    collecting necessary datasets for the study area, processing of datasets, and
    converting them into quantifiable outputs in the form of maps. The different stages
    are elaborated on below. The first involves the generation of the shapefile for
    the study area was done using different tools available in ArcGIS, which is a
    Geographic Information System (GIS) software, that helps in generating the maps
    that become useable for further stages. Following this, the shapefile is integrated
    into GEE an open-source Java-based online platform for accessing various satellite
    datasets available within its catalog. The shapefile for the study area was incorporated
    as a base map. GEE provides the code editor function wherein specific Java scripts
    were created for each pollutant and other feature identification for the shapefile.
    The datasets for 2018, 2020, and 2023 years were collected, and classified into
    subcategories based on the different pollutants such as CO, NO2, SO2, CH4, and
    Formaldehyde (HCHO) which were analyzed using, the earth''s radiance with different
    spectral regions, hence helped in generating the data in the form of the vertically
    integrated column density of each pollutant as mentioned earlier and the output
    data represents the concentration in mol/m2 while for CH4 the data provided was
    in the form of column volume mixing ratio and the output after processing the
    data would give the concentrations in ppb (parts per billion) of methane. Lastly,
    it involves analyzing the LULC which was LULC refers to the classification of
    natural elements and human activities in the study area within the predefined
    time frame with the help of statistical and scientific methods for analysis. The
    following years were used to analyze the changes that took place pre-, during,
    and after post COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown due to COVID-19 was imposed in
    March 2019 and found a drastic change in air pollution. Therefore, the following
    period from 2018 to 2023 was considered for the research, considering the pre-COVID
    (2018), during COVID (2020) and post-COVID (2023). The changes in LULC for the
    region of Gujarat are mandatory to be monitored distinctly due to the rapid changes
    taking place in the environment. The development of the LULC map for a particular
    period can be generated using various satellites like Landsat 8 using the GEE
    platform and trained with MODIS satellite datasets and with the help of kappa
    coefficient and correlation matrix validation of the data was done—the captured
    datasets by the satellite work on the principle of surface spectral reflectance.
    For the determination of LULC in this study Landsat 8 datasets were used, which
    utilizes surface reflectance along with land surface temperature monitoring for
    the analyses of the LULC data. For air quality analysis periodical information
    on CO, SO2 NO2, CH4, and Formaldehyde can be obtained via Sentinel-5P achieved
    in GEE while LULC can be obtained from Landsat 8. 4. Results and Discussion Changes
    in LULC play a pivotal role as drivers of climate change within rapidly expanding
    urban areas. The transformation of land use has profound effects on the physical
    and thermal characteristics of the land surface, consequently impacting the air
    quality of urban environments. Conversion of land into barren land due to deforestation
    leads to exposure of land which causes a rise in LST [[59], [60], [61]] and which
    causes the emission of various pollutants mainly volatile organic carbon (VOC).
    This research aims to evaluate the potential influence of LULC on air quality
    in the Indian state of Gujarat. Utilizing Sentinel-5P satellite data spanning
    nearly six years (2018, 2020, and 2023), atmospheric particulate pollution was
    estimated. Six distinct land-use categories, namely water bodies, forests, agricultural
    land, built-up areas, barren land, and scrubland, were identified using Landsat
    8 land cover data processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The study revealed that
    variations in particulate pollution in response to LULC changes exhibit significant
    disparities across different regions, influenced by natural factors and human
    activities such as deforestation and urbanization. The conversion of land use
    significantly altered air quality parameters, particularly in urban and suburban
    areas. Over the past decade, substantial land use conversions have occurred, with
    forested areas transitioning to vegetation in the western part, while urbanization
    has rapidly expanded in the eastern and central-western regions. 4.1. LULC analysis
    Gujarat state has sustained its pattern of expansion and land cover change from
    2018 to 2023 as shown in the produced map (Fig. 3). The LULC map was prepared
    in the GEE platform using Landsat 8 satellite by employing a Random Forest machine
    learning algorithm. It was observed that agricultural land (Vegetation) was the
    most dominant LULC class among the other classes for all the respective years
    2018, 2020, and 2023. However, over time, the growth of urban areas increased
    exponentially. Agricultural land and forest area decreased from 61.08% (2018)
    to 60.7% (2023). Water spread area increased from 4.07% in 2018 to 5.13% in 2023,
    Bare land (Barren and Scrub) decreased from 29.59% (2018) to 27.56% (2023) with
    a net decrease of 2% approx. due to the gradual conversion of bare soil into built-up
    areas due to urbanization. This establishes changes in the land use patterns in
    Gujarat state over the years. However, the year 2020 was the lockdown period and
    there was an increase in the water spread area, forest cover, and built-up area
    whereas decrease in barren and scrubland (Table 2). Overall LULC classification
    accuracy level of 98.92% percent for Landsat 8 satellite imageries was collected,
    with a Kappa coefficient of 0.96. Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download

    assessment TROPOMI on the Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P) satellite is designed to
    measure carbon mono oxide (CO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Methane (CH4), Sulfur
    Dioxide (SO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO), and other various atmospheric constituent
    abundance using clear-sky and cloudy-sky earth radiance observations in the 2.3
    μm spectral area of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) sector of the solar spectrum.
    4.2.1. Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide is a component generated by the incomplete
    combustion of hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline, coal, etc it has a greater capability
    of trapping the heat in the surrounding atmosphere which thereby leads to an increase
    in the average temperature of the earth''s surface. The Sentinel-5P data utilizes
    a 2.3 μm spectral range of shirt-wave infrared which helps in determining the
    amount of CO present in the troposphere. The spatial variation map and annual
    variation of CO in the years 2018, 2020, and 2023 are illustrated in Fig. 4. The
    concentration of CO ranges between 0.030 mol/m2 and 0.040 mol/m2 with the distribution
    of the component ranging between 0.03 and 0.034 mol/m2 in the western regions
    having cities like Rajkot, Jamnagar, etc. while the central and southern regions
    of Gujarat have a notable concentration of 0.035–0.038 mol/m2 includes the major
    metropolitan cities that are Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Bharuch, and Valsad (Table

    from various chemical industries, combustion of fossil fuels, and other man-made
    activities that lead to notable consequences like ground-level ozone formation,
    particulate matter, acid rain, and even contribute to global warming. The spatial
    variation map and annual variation of NO2 in the years 2018, 2020, and 2023 are
    illustrated in Fig. 5. The distribution of NO2 over the territory of Gujarat ranges
    from 0.00005 mol/m2 to 0.00019 mol/m2 with the minimum concentration varying from
    0.000005 mol/m2 to 0.00002 mol/m2 in the northern region of Gujarat that includes
    Kutch, Patan, Banas Kantha while the maximum concentration varying from 0.00005
    mol/m2 to 0.00019 mol/m2is recorded in the western, central and southern regions
    of Gujarat that include cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Jamnagar, etc.
    (Table 4), however, the concentration seems to vary concerning time due to the
    Covid-pandemic 2019, from 2018 to 2020 the concentration seems to decrease while
    it was seen increasing during 2022-23. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    the overall emissions of CH4 due to anthropogenic emissions by agricultural activities,
    emissions by industrial activities, and combustion of fossil fuels like coal.
    Urbanization has a prominent effect on the surrounding environment and consequently,
    on human beings, a notable effect can be depicted through an increment in ground-level
    ozone formation. The spatial variation map and annual variation of CH4 in the
    years 2018, 2020, and 2023 are illustrated in Fig. 6. Quantifiable values for
    the concentration of CH4 can be analyzed from the figure where major peak values
    ranging from 1920 ppb to 1960 ppb are observed in cities like Ahmedabad, and Vadodara
    in the central region and southern regions which include cities like Surat and
    cities like Rajkot and Jamnagar in the western region, contradictorily lower levels
    of methane ranging from 1800 ppb to 1920 ppb are observed in the cities like Patan,
    Kutch etc in the northern regions (Table 5). Download : Download high-res image

    Sulfur dioxide is one of the main components responsible for the contamination
    of the soil and water bodies due to its high affinity towards water hence leading
    to acid rain, one of the major sources responsible for an increase in the concentration
    is SO2 is the combustion of sulfur containing fossil fuels such as Coal or oil
    in powerplants for the generation of electricity. The spatial variation map and
    annual variation of SO2 in the years 2018, 2020, and 2023 are illustrated in Fig.
    7. The concentration of SO2 over the terrain varies from 4x10−5 mol/m2 to 2.8x10−3
    mol/m2, with the northern region of Gujarat Kutch, Banaskantha, and Patan recorded
    the lowest values of SO2 concentration in the range of 4x10−5 mol/m2 to 1x10−4
    mol/m2, while the western region of Gujarat that includes cities like Rajkot and
    Jamnagar has recorded values in the range of 1.2x10−4 mol/m2 to 2.6x10−4 mol/m2
    while the maximum concentration of SO2 in Gujarat region is observed in the central
    and southern region in the range of 1.3x10−4 mol/m2 to 4x10−4 mol/m2that includes

    Formaldehyde gas is a major source of indoor pollution and plays a significant
    role in promoting various respiratory diseases and ground-level ozone development,
    it can also be categorized as a volatile organic component (VOC). Major emission
    sources include petrochemical industries, emissions by the shipping industry,
    and domestic emissions such as the burning of cooking. The spatial variation map
    and annual variation of HCHO in the years 2018, 2020, and 2023 are illustrated
    in Fig. 8. Concentration distribution of formaldehyde over the territory varies
    between 2x10−5 mol/m2 to 2.8x10−4 mol/m2, with the lowest concentration observed

    classes and pollution parameters LULC classes can have a significant correlation
    with various pollution parameters. Understanding these correlations is crucial
    for effective environmental management and planning. Urban and industrial areas
    are highly correlated with air pollution parameters such as NO2, SO2, CO, and
    VOCs. Agricultural areas also contribute to air pollution through ammonia emissions
    from fertilizers and CH4 emissions from livestock. Forests and green spaces have
    a negative correlation with air pollution parameters due to the absorption of
    pollutants and emission of oxygen by vegetation that improves air quality in surrounding
    areas. Water bodies contain pollutants from various sources including industrial
    effluents, agricultural runoff, and urban sewage. Understanding these correlations
    can aid policymakers and urban planners in making informed decisions regarding
    land use planning, pollution control measures, and sustainable development initiatives.
    It emphasizes the importance of integrated approaches to address environmental
    challenges while promoting socio-economic development. The correlations between
    different pollutants such as CO, NO2, CH4, HCHO, and SO2 with various LULC categories
    are demonstrated in Table 8. The matrix incorporates the concentration of various
    pollutants found in various land types, such as barren land, agricultural land,
    forest, water bodies, built-up areas, and scrubland. Positive values in the matrix
    suggest that there is an increase in land use for the respective land type as
    well as the pollutant levels are also increasing at the same time, suggesting
    a possible direct correlation. On the other hand, negative numbers indicate an
    inverse relationship in which the amount of pollutants decreases with the decrease
    in land use. Understanding the relationship between pollutant concentrations and
    land use patterns can be rendered easy with the help of this correlation matrix.

    1 *Correlation matrix scale: 2 to 2. 4.4. Potential impact of LULC on air quality
    Gujarat is a diverse state with various land uses, majorly classified as urban
    land, agricultural land, forest, and water bodies [62]. The rapid expansion in
    urban areas due to changes in LULC, along with factors like industrialization,
    deforestation, coal burning and vehicular emission leads to an increase in the
    release of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), NO2[63], SO2, and VOCs,
    contributing to poor air quality [[64], [65]]. Moreover, the burning of crop residue
    and agricultural activities including the use of fertilizers and pesticides can
    contribute to the release of ammonia and other agricultural pollutants [[66],
    [67]]. Improper waste disposal and management practices, especially in urban areas,
    can result in the release of methane and other harmful gases from landfills. Formaldehyde
    is considered an indoor air pollutant as it originates as off-gas from certain
    building materials and furniture, contributing to indoor air pollution. The accuracy
    and reliability of the obtained results were thoroughly validated using the Gujarat
    Pollution Control Board (GPCB) dataset. This dataset, known for its comprehensive
    and diverse environmental data, served as a robust benchmark to assess the performance
    and effectiveness of the applied methodologies. The validation process not only
    ensured the consistency of the findings but also affirmed the relevance and applicability
    of the results within the context of environmental analysis [68]. The utilization
    of the GPCB dataset in the validation process contributed to the overall credibility
    of the study, reinforcing the confidence in the accuracy of the obtained outcomes.
    Data obtained from GEE is highly efficient and illustrates exceptional results
    after training with the AI-ML model, but still, the accuracy of the data cannot
    be met with on-field data, as the spatiotemporal resolution of the sensors used
    on the field has better resolution when compared with the satellite data, it was
    not feasible to proceed for ground measurement due to larger area but reports
    from the statutory bodies were considered for the analysis. 5. Conclusion The
    research work aims to investigate the concentration distribution of various pollutants
    over the region of Gujarat, particularly emphasizing the work on the effect of
    LULC on concentration levels of various pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO),
    sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane (CH4), and formaldehyde
    (HCHO). The study employs various datasets collected from Sentinel-5P, MODIS/006/MCD12Q1,
    and Landsat-8 to statistically evaluate and map the concentrations throughout
    2018, 2020, and 2023. The datasets available from the MODIS/006/MCD12Q1 satellite
    were used to train the LULC model and were implemented over the datasets provided
    by the Landsat-8 satellite and the results were validated by implementing the
    Kappa coefficient and Correlation matrix. The LULC map was analyzed and correlated
    with the concentration of various pollutants, to study the influence of LULC on
    the air quality over the study area. Agricultural land and forest area decreased
    from 61.08% (2018) to 60.7% (2023). Water spread area increased from 4.07% in
    2018 to 5.13% in 2023, Bare land (Barren and Scrub) decreased from 29.59% (2018)
    to 27.56% (2023) with a net decrease of 2% approx. due to the gradual conversion
    of bare soil into built-up areas due to urbanization. However, the year 2020 was
    the lockdown period and there was an increase in the water spread area, forest
    cover, and built-up area whereas decrease in barren and scrubland. Overall LULC
    classification accuracy level of 98.92% percent for Landsat 8 satellite imageries
    was collected, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.96. The finding indicates the varying
    concentration levels of pollutants in different regions of Gujarat over the period,
    carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations show higher levels in central and southern
    regions of Gujarat, particularly in urban areas like Surat, Vadodara, Ahmedabad,
    and Bharuch, among others. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were also recorded
    at more intense levels in the areas having high population density. Similarly,
    Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) show increased concentrations in
    urbanized regions, pointing to their direct correlation with human activities,
    industrialization, and combustion of fossil fuels. Whereby a significant greenhouse
    gas Methane (CH4) recorded uniform distribution over the study area. The research
    study provides a comprehensive overview of concentration levels of these pollutants
    and their spatial distribution across Gujarat, and the findings hold significant
    implications for environmental and public health in the state, indicating areas
    where concentrations of these pollutants are notably higher. Ethics approval and

  description: The Yangtze River Basin was among the areas most severely affected
    by the widespread extreme drought in the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. Drought
    conditions in this basin extended into the wintering season, significantly influencing
    waterfowl habitat availability. Exploring how waterfowl distributions and ecological
    niches respond to these changes in wetland environmental conditions and the underlying
    ecological mechanisms are important for biodiversity conservation and understanding
    wetland ecological processes. By integrating field observations, remote sensing,
    and ecological niche modelling, we analysed habitat changes over the past decade
    and investigated how extreme drought affected the distribution patterns and spatial
    niches of two waterfowl guilds, ducks and geese, in the Dongting Lake Region,
    a key wetland ecosystem in the Yangtze River Basin. The extreme drought led to
    a drastic reduction in the waterbody area of natural habitats and caused vegetation
    to enter the wilting stage prematurely. In response, a substantial proportion
    of waterfowl shifted to adjacent managed wetlands with stable water levels, especially
    the ducks, whose distribution pattern was fundamentally altered. The proportion
    of both waterfowl guilds in the managed wetland showed a significant correlation
    with the proportion of the waterbody area. Further, we compared the spatial niche
    of waterfowl in 2022 with that in the former year, which represented a typical
    year with normal hydrology. The spatial niche of ducks underwent a substantial
    contraction, while that of geese remained large in both years but shifted inward
    in 2022 towards areas with lower elevation, and foraging resource use was altered.
    Therefore, for both waterfowl guilds, the extent of habitat overlap between the
    two years was small. This study has important implications for understanding the
    impact of extreme climatic and hydrological events on wetland ecosystems. Furthermore,
    our results emphasise the importance of water level-managed wetlands for biodiversity
    conservation.

    crucial for biodiversity, especially in extreme hydrology. Abstract The Yangtze
    River Basin was among the areas most severely affected by the widespread extreme
    drought in the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. Drought conditions in this basin extended
    into the wintering season, significantly influencing waterfowl habitat availability.
    Exploring how waterfowl distributions and ecological niches respond to these changes
    in wetland environmental conditions and the underlying ecological mechanisms are
    important for biodiversity conservation and understanding wetland ecological processes.
    By integrating field observations, remote sensing, and ecological niche modelling,
    we analysed habitat changes over the past decade and investigated how extreme
    drought affected the distribution patterns and spatial niches of two waterfowl
    guilds, ducks and geese, in the Dongting Lake Region, a key wetland ecosystem
    in the Yangtze River Basin. The extreme drought led to a drastic reduction in
    the waterbody area of natural habitats and caused vegetation to enter the wilting
    stage prematurely. In response, a substantial proportion of waterfowl shifted
    to adjacent managed wetlands with stable water levels, especially the ducks, whose
    distribution pattern was fundamentally altered. The proportion of both waterfowl
    guilds in the managed wetland showed a significant correlation with the proportion
    of the waterbody area. Further, we compared the spatial niche of waterfowl in
    2022 with that in the former year, which represented a typical year with normal
    hydrology. The spatial niche of ducks underwent a substantial contraction, while
    that of geese remained large in both years but shifted inward in 2022 towards
    areas with lower elevation, and foraging resource use was altered. Therefore,
    for both waterfowl guilds, the extent of habitat overlap between the two years
    was small. This study has important implications for understanding the impact
    of extreme climatic and hydrological events on wetland ecosystems. Furthermore,
    our results emphasise the importance of water level-managed wetlands for biodiversity
    conservation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Hydrologic

    Lake 1. Introduction Wetlands ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate variability
    (Johnson et al., 2005, Jr et al., 2022). The ongoing climate crisis has heightened
    the vulnerability of inland wetlands to potential future drought (Werner et al.,
    2013). The extreme heat and drought that occurred in the Northern Hemisphere in
    2022 were significant historic events that had a profound impact on wetland ecosystems.
    Waterfowl serve as effective bioindicators of ecological conditions and play an
    important role in the health of these systems (Green and Elmberg, 2014). Additionally,
    waterfowl usually migrate between their breeding and wintering sites annually.
    They need sufficient high-quality food resources on their wintering grounds for
    survival and subsequent reproductive success on their breeding grounds (Norris
    et al., 2004). Therefore, exploring how their distributions and niches respond
    to changes in wetland environmental conditions in the wintering grounds and the
    underlying ecological mechanisms are important for biodiversity conservation and
    understanding wetland ecological processes. In addition to the large-scale geographical
    shifts observed in response to climate change and shifts in temperature regimes
    (Bosco et al., 2022, van Wijk et al., 2012), the distribution and niche of waterfowl
    at the local scale may also be affected by climate change; however, little attention
    has been paid to this phenomenon (Pöysä, 2023). Climatic factors affect wetland
    hydrological conditions and may directly or indirectly affect the habitat phenology
    of waterfowl (Huang et al., 2022). For example, the occurrence of climatic and
    hydrological droughts can result in decreased water levels and diminished wetland
    areas, potentially leading to a decline in the biomass of aquatic and planktonic
    organisms or reduced meadow grass quality, thereby impacting the availability
    of food resources for waterfowl (Lake, 2003, Petrie et al., 2016). By adopting
    various strategies, such as changes in spatial distribution, feeding patch selection,
    and resource utilisation, waterfowl demonstrate their ability to acclimate to
    changes in habitats and food availability (Cong et al., 2012, Hou et al., 2020).
    The Yangtze River Basin in China was one of the region most severely affected
    by the extreme drought in 2022. This area is uniquely characterised by extensive
    freshwater wetlands that are recharged by summer monsoonal rainfall, followed
    by a subsequent autumn water level recession. This highly dynamic landscape holds
    global importance as a wintering region for migratory waterbirds. Approximately
    80 % of the Anatidae in eastern China overwinter in wetlands of the middle and
    lower Yangtze River floodplains (Cao et al., 2008). Over the past few decades,
    hydrological drought events have occurred frequently in the Yangtze River Basin
    and have intensified since the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (Li et al.,
    2023, Shi et al., 2022), causing adverse effects on wetland habitats and biodiversity
    (Wu et al., 2020). Despite the importance of understanding wetland habitat changes
    and waterfowl responses under extreme drought conditions for comprehending wetland
    ecological processes, this area has not been fully studied. Furthermore, the impact
    of the 2022 extreme drought on waterbird distribution and ecological niche has
    yet to be determined. The distribution of species is the result of the complex
    expression of their ecological niche. However, large-scale distributions may not
    reflect changes in microscale feeding patch selection and food resource utilisation.
    In the case of similar spatial distributions, there may be significant differences
    in ecological niche. Ecological niche models (ENMs, also referred to as species
    distribution models) are effective tools for quantifying species’ ecological niches
    using both empirical and mathematical methods (Murphy and Smith, 2021, Sillero,
    2011). They combine environmental and species occurrence data and have a high
    ability to predict geographical distributions, mapping the probability of species
    occurrence and predicting potential suitable habitats (Santini et al., 2021, Scales
    et al., 2016, Sillero et al., 2021). Various types of ENMs have been used to predict
    spatial niche overlap between species distributions (Fourcade et al., 2017, Maslo
    et al., 2016). However, studies on the temporal dynamics of spatial niches based
    on ENM in the context of habitat change, especially extreme climatic events, are
    scarce. Dongting Lake is a typical river-connected lake located in the middle
    reaches of the Yangtze River. It is the second largest freshwater lake and one
    of the first designated Ramsar sites in China, thus playing a crucial role as
    a wintering ground for migratory birds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway
    (Lei et al., 2019b). Owing to large differences in water levels throughout the
    year and across different years, the natural wetland landscapes and environments
    in Dongting Lake show strong seasonal and annual patterns (Gao et al., 2020, Geng
    et al., 2021). The main Dongting Lake is surrounded by numerous small- and medium-sized
    lake wetlands resulting from historical lake reclamation and agricultural activities.
    These lakes are locally managed or overseen by relevant agencies. Due to the presence
    of levees or sluices, these lakes maintain relatively stable habitat characteristics,
    unlike Dongting Lake. Under the impact of extreme drought, we postulated that
    the spatial distribution and ecological niche of the wintering waterfowl may have
    shifted significantly and waterfowl, especially those that rely heavily on waterbodies,
    may have moved from their natural habitats to adjacent managed habitats. The lack
    of ecological research on the impacts of the extreme drought in 2022 on wintering
    waterbirds in the Yangtze River Basin has hindered our understanding of the ecological
    effects of this major historical event. In the present study, we analysed habitat
    changes over the past decade and investigated how extreme drought affected the
    distribution and spatial niches of two waterfowl guilds to determine spatial and
    resource use changes. Given the diverse ecological guilds within the waterfowl
    community, it was expected that different guilds exhibit distinct responses. We
    here focused on two major waterfowl guilds in Dongting Lake, ducks and geese,
    which belong to the family Anatidae. ENM was used to quantify the occurrence probability
    of waterbirds in response to environmental variables and map their habitat extent
    in geographic space to estimate the spatial niche. Our study provides important
    insights into the impact of extreme climatic and hydrological events on waterbirds.
    2. Methods 2.1. Study area The study area encompassed East Dongting Lake, a natural
    wetland with an area of 1308.8 km², and the adjacent Caisang Lake wetland, which
    has a managed water level and an area of 7.8 km². East Dongting Lake is a seasonally
    inundated wetland that is naturally connected to the Yangtze River. It has high
    water levels in the wet season, typically from May to October, and low water levels
    in the dry season, typically from November to April. The annual variance in the
    water level can exceed 16 m. It is the largest and most significant component
    of Dongting Lake wetland, where waterbird species are dominant in terms of both
    diversity and abundance. Caisang Lake is the closest managed wetland to Dongting
    Lake and is separated from East Dongting Lake by an embankment (Fig. 1). The water
    level in Caisang Lake remains relatively stable (around 26 m) during the wintering
    period because of proper management and aquaculture activities. In the study area,
    the habitat types that are important for wintering waterbirds mainly include open
    water, mudflats, and wet meadows. The dominant plant in the East Dongting Lake
    wetland is the sedge Carex (Li et al., 2018), which offers major food resources
    for wintering geese. Download : Download high-res image (308KB) Download : Download

    and species distribution data processing Wintering waterbirds typically arrive
    at Dongting Lake from late October to early November and depart in March of the
    following year. In this study, we collected bird survey data from the wintering
    periods of 2013/2014–2022/2023 (data for 2017/2018 were lacking). The data for
    the first four years were collected around January, during the mid-wintering period,
    while the data for the last five wintering periods were collected in November,
    during the early wintering stage. Surveys were simultaneously conducted by trained
    personnel following a standard protocol, and birds were observed using a 20–60×
    spotting scope or 10 × 42 binoculars. Our study focused on two waterfowl guilds,
    ducks and geese. A detailed species list is shown in Table S1. We calculated the
    relative distributions of each waterfowl guild in both natural and managed wetlands,
    instead of their abundance, to eliminate the impact of annual fluctuations in
    wintering waterfowl populations. Given the significant differences in habitat
    conditions and waterfowl distributions between the extreme drought year and other
    years (see Results), we selected 2022, the extreme drought year, and the preceding
    year 2021, which represents a typical normal hydrological year (Zhang et al.,
    2023), for comparison when analysing spatial niche changes. When conducting waterbird
    surveys, locations of flocks with over five individuals were recorded. The occurrence
    records for the species were pooled to generate presence data for each guild for
    further ENMs. Furthermore, to mitigate spatial autocorrelation and reduce potential
    bias from variation in sampling effort, the occurrence records were spatially
    rarified such that a maximum of one record for each guild was retained within
    each 90 m × 90 m grid cell (resolution for environmental predictors). 2.3. Environmental
    predictors Eight environmental predictors were gathered from different sources
    to build the ENMs for each waterfowl guild (see Section 2 in Supporting Information
    for further details). Specifically, five predictors were used for ducks (i.e.
    area of water, area of mudflat, normalised difference water index (NDWI), distance
    to waterbody, and distance to channel) and five predictors were used for geese
    (i.e. area of grass, area of mudflat, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI),
    distance to waterbody, and wetness). Our previous studies have demonstrated the
    effects of these variables on the distribution of waterbirds in Dongting Lake
    (Zhang et al., 2023, Zou et al., 2019). All predictors were rescaled to 90 m resolution
    with the same origin and extent. We also checked the correlations between all
    pairs of predictors to evaluate multicollinearity. No r value in the Pearson''s
    correlation matrix was greater than 0.8; accordingly, all predictors were retained
    for further analyses. Based on the methods for obtaining the distance to waterbody
    and NDVI, the waterbody extent and average NDVI in the study area were calculated
    for the month of November from 2013 to 2022, a period when mudflats and meadows
    are usually completely exposed and food availability is high. 2.4. Models and
    evaluation ENMs were fitted using three common methods: maximum entropy (Maxent),
    general linear models (GLMs), and general additive models (GAMs). The GLM and
    GAM are two classical regression models used to model species distributions (Guisan
    et al., 2002) and need to be fit with presence and absence (background) data.
    Therefore, we randomly selected 5000 background points across the entire study
    area. The GAMs were computed using a smoothing spline with three degrees of freedom.
    Based on the data characteristics, ‘logit’ was used as the link function for both
    models. Maxent is the most widely used ENM algorithm with excellent performance
    and uses a nonparametric flexible regression model that requires only species
    presence data (Phillips et al., 2006). The final waterbird records for 2021 included
    95 and 54 locations for ducks and geese, respectively, and 67 and 81 locations,
    respectively, for 2022. The data were divided into two random sets using k-fold
    data partitioning with k = 5 (Guisan et al., 2017). Hence, 80 % of the dataset
    was used to train the models and the remainder of the dataset was used to test
    the models; this procedure was repeated five times. To evaluate the accuracy of
    each model, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
    (AUC), which is a simple and generally applicable measure of the accuracy of each
    model (Newbold, 2018, Visconti et al., 2016). The predicted values of the three
    models were converted to the same scale between 0 and 1 through min–max normalisation.
    The predictions of the three models, weighted by their AUC values (Table S3),
    were then combined. Models with AUC values lower than 0.8 were not included. Weighted
    values were obtained as (AUC – 0.5)2 to give further weight to higher AUC values.
    To create binary presence/absence maps to visualise the spatial niche of the waterfowl,
    we adopted a sensitivity-specificity equality approach as the threshold selection
    method (Liu et al., 2005). We further combined all binary maps of the three models
    to create a final binary map for each waterfowl guild in each winter, using the
    weighting method described previously, to reflect the spatial niche of the waterfowl.
    For the final binary map, we applied 0.5 as the minimum occurrence probability
    for the waterfowl. In addition, we identified areas of overlap between the two
    years to estimate the spatial niche shift under the impact of extreme drought.
    Modelling was performed in R 4.3.0 using the packages ‘dismo’ (Hijmans et al.,
    2022) and ‘mgcv’ (Wood, 2011). 2.5. Statistical analysis Daily water level data
    of East Dongting Lake were obtained from the Hydrology Inquiry System of Hunan
    Province. An independent samples t-test was employed to assess the significance
    of the differences in daily average water levels for October, November, and December
    between 2022 and each of the years from 2013 to 2021. The level of significance
    was set at 0.05. Owing to the generally stable water level in the managed Caisang
    Lake and the absence of actual water level measurements, the analysis solely investigates
    the water level variations in East Dongting Lake. Linear regression analyses were
    used to evaluate the relationships between the proportion of waterbody area in
    managed wetland and the waterfowl relative abundance. The response curves of the
    occurrence probability of waterfowl to key environmental variables were fitted
    using the package ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham, 2016) in R. 3. Results 3.1. Changes in typical
    wetland habitat conditions over the past 10 years Fig. 2s shows the monthly average
    water levels of East Dongting Lake from October to December for the past decade
    (2013–2023). Generally, the water levels exhibited a gradual decline across these
    three months, revealing a progressive exposure of habitat as waterfowl transition
    from early to mid-wintering. However, monthly average water levels were significantly
    lower in all three months in the extreme drought year of 2022 than in 2013–2021
    (P < 0.05). The maximum difference in water levels reached 9.3 m in October (29.4 m
    in 2021 and 20.1 m in 2022). Notably, November and December of 2022 were the only
    instances in the data set where water levels fell below 20 m. The area of the
    waterbody also reached its lowest recorded value in 2022 (Fig. 2b), covering merely
    142.7 km², which is only 27.2 % of the maximum area recorded over the past decade,
    observed in 2014. However, the waterbody area in the managed Caisang Lake remained
    relatively stable over the past years. The extent of the waterbody during the
    extreme drought of 2022 and its preceding year, 2021 (with normal hydrology),
    are presented in Fig. 2d and e. Waterbodies in 2022 were primarily concentrated
    in the managed wetland and the channels within the natural wetland. NDVI is an
    effective and widely used indicator of food availability for herbivorous geese
    (Hogrefe et al., 2017). We calculated the average NDVI of the study area, and
    found that the NDVI value in November 2022 was the highest over the past 10 years,
    reaching 0.41 (Fig. 2c). Download : Download high-res image (353KB) Download :

    differences compared to all the previous corresponding months. Waterbody area
    and NDVI are the composite values in November. 3.2. Changes in distribution patterns
    of the two waterfowl guilds During our study period, the natural wetland, which
    has a substantially larger area than that of the managed wetland, served as the
    primary habitat for wintering waterfowl, particularly for geese. However, in the
    extreme drought winter of 2022, the proportion of waterfowl in the managed wetland
    exceeded that of other years notably (Fig. 3). The ducks largely moved to the
    adjacent managed habitat, resulting in a pivotal shift in their distribution pattern
    in 2022. For the first time, the majority of ducks were observed in the managed
    Caisang Lake, accounting for 68.2 % of the total abundance in the study area (Fig.
    3a). Wintering geese predominantly occupied natural habitats, maintaining an abundance
    of over 90 % across all study years. However, in the extreme drought conditions
    of 2022, there was a notable increase in the proportion of geese found in managed
    habitats, reaching 7.3 % (Fig. 3b). Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    (a, b) in natural and managed wetland areas and the relationship between the distribution
    of waterfowl and waterbody in the managed wetland (c, d). The wintering period
    of 2013/2014 is abbreviated 2013 for simplicity, and other wintering periods are
    abbreviated in a similar manner. Further, we analysed the relationship between
    the percentage of water area and the percentage of total waterfowl abundance in
    the managed wetland. There was a significant positive correlation between the
    distribution of water area and the distribution of both ducks (R² = 0.59, P <
    0.05) and geese (R² = 0.77, P < 0.01). This suggests that a larger proportion
    of waterbody area in the managed wetland was associated with a higher proportion
    of waterfowl abundance (Fig. 3c, d). 3.3. Shifts in the spatial niche of the two
    waterfowl guilds The occurrence probabilities of both waterfowl guilds decreased
    obviously during the extreme drought year, although an increase in the occurrence
    probability of geese in managed wetland was observed (Table 1). The occurrence
    probability maps are shown in Fig. 4. Based on the sensitivity-specificity equality
    approach threshold, the models demonstrated that the habitat extent for ducks
    in the entire study area in 2021 was approximately 15 times larger than that in
    2022, with the decrease predominantly occurring in the natural wetland (Fig. 4c,
    Table 1). The overlapping area of suitable habitat for ducks during the two years
    was largely distributed in managed habitats. For geese, the suitable habitat was
    predominantly distributed in natural habitats in both years. Although the habitat
    extent in both years was large, the area of overlap was small and completely distributed
    within natural habitats (Fig. 4f). The habitat range of the geese tended to move
    toward the interior of the lake. Table 1. Summary of the ecological niche model

    reflected their shift in habitat use. Despite the relatively stable distribution
    pattern of geese throughout the study period, their foraging habitat preferences
    exhibited new characteristics during the extreme drought of the 2022 wintering
    season. They shifted to feeding in the periphery of the meadows and adjacent mudflats
    and grubbed for belowground plant parts rather than Carex leaves (Fig. 5). This
    contrasted with their typical behaviour, as observed in the 2021 wintering season,
    when they predominantly foraged within meadows and utilised Carex spp. as their
    main food resource. Download : Download high-res image (813KB) Download : Download

    probability to key habitat variables Distance to waterbody had the highest contribution
    to the occurrence probability of ducks in both years, followed by distance to
    the channel (Fig. S2). NDVI had the highest contribution to the occurrence probability
    of geese in 2021, whereas the area of mudflat had the strongest influence in the
    extreme drought of 2022. The responses of the occurrence probabilities of the
    two waterfowl guilds to the key variables were analysed (Fig. 6). The occurrence
    probabilities of ducks and distance to a waterbody showed a negative linear correlation,
    indicating that areas closer to waterbodies showed a higher probability of duck
    occurrences. Overall, the occurrence probability in geese increased with increasing
    NDVI in November 2021, indicating that they prefer to feed in patches with higher
    NDVI during the early wintering period. Fig. 6d shows the preference of geese
    for areas with moderately sized peripheral mudflats. Download : Download high-res

    Discussion Many species shift their range boundaries in response to global warming
    and track suitable climate conditions (Littlefield et al., 2019). Species also
    shift their distribution and niche at the local scale to track suitable resource
    conditions in response to local environmental changes. In the present study, we
    explored changes in the distribution pattern and spatial niche of two typical
    waterfowl guilds under the impact of extreme drought in the Dongting Lake Basin
    and explained the ecological mechanisms driving these changes. Based on field
    observations and modelling approaches, we found a significant shift in the distribution
    pattern and a substantial contraction in the spatial niche of ducks and a significant
    transition in the spatial niche of geese, indicating changes in spatial range
    and resource utilisation. 4.1. Effect of extreme drought on habitat elements Hydrological
    processes are the key drivers of floodplain wetland ecosystems (Bunn and Arthington,
    2002). Significant within-year variation in the water level is a distinctive characteristic
    of Dongting Lake, which typically undergoes four hydrological stages throughout
    the year: low-water-level, rising-water-level, high-water-level, and receding-water-level
    periods. October to November usually signifies the water level receding phase;
    however, 2022 showed a deviation from this pattern. The duration of the high-water-level
    period was exceptionally short, and by October, the lake had already transitioned
    into its low-water-level phase (Fig. 2 & Fig. S3). The drought in 2022 aligned
    with the findings of Li et al. (2023), who reported an increased intensity of
    drought in Dongting Lake after the Three Gorges Project, especially during the
    autumn months. Such alterations in hydrological conditions could lead to a cascade
    of ecological consequences and impact habitat and food availability for wintering
    waterfowl. Fig. 2d shows a typical normal waterbody distribution in November.
    In November 2022, however, the central region of the natural habitat experienced
    a tendency towards desiccation. Due to the prolonged drought, the hydrological
    connectivity in the natural habitat was severely disrupted, resulting in a nearly
    complete loss of surface water in previously perennially watered areas. Only the
    eastern channel displayed noticeable water coverage (Fig. 2e). Accordingly, the
    meadow grass was of high quality and fresh in November 2021, while in 2022, peak
    growth was observed in late September, followed by a withering trend throughout
    the early wintering season of the waterfowl (Fig. S4). The drastic changes caused
    by extreme drought would inevitably impact waterfowl, which rely heavily on water
    and vegetation habitats. 4.2. Effect of extreme drought on the distribution and
    niche of ducks Extreme drought had a significant impact on the waterfowl distribution
    pattern, most notably prompting ducks to transition from natural to managed wetlands.
    Despite its small size, accounting for <1 % of the area of the natural East Dongting
    Lake, the managed Caisang Lake sustained a duck population that was three times
    larger than that of East Dongting Lake in 2022. We postulate that this phenomenon
    was directly caused by a change in the distribution of the waterbody. The movement
    patterns of mallards, the most abundant duck species worldwide, are strongly linked
    to the availability of freshwater habitats, and the spatial scale of movement
    could be best predicted by the number of waterbodies in the landscape (Kleyheeg
    et al., 2017). In line with this study, our results also indicated that duck distributions
    are closely aligned with the prevailing distribution patterns of waterbodies.
    Spatial niche analyses based on ENMs revealed that the distance to water was the
    primary factor contributing to the occurrence probability of ducks in both years
    (Fig. S2). This is also one of the most important variables in ENMs overall (Bradie
    and Leung, 2017). The smaller the distance to a waterbody, the higher the probability
    of occurrence. Therefore, the habitat extent of ducks in managed habitats, where
    waterbodies were not significantly influenced by extreme drought, remained relatively
    large in both years of the study. However, in natural habitats in 2022, the habitat
    extent decreased substantially and the species showed a sporadic distribution.
    Although there was a concentrated water area in the natural habitat in 2022, this
    area serves as a navigational channel, and the distance from it was another crucial
    factor affecting duck occurrences (Fig. S2). As a typical anthropogenic disturbance,
    ships passing through channels can cause significant disturbances to wintering
    waterbirds (McFadden et al., 2017). Finally, the level of spatial niche overlap
    between the two years was high in managed habitats but low in natural habitats,
    and the area of overlap was largely concentrated in managed habitats. 4.3. Effect
    of extreme drought on the distribution and niche of geese We expected extreme
    drought to have an adverse effect on wintering geese because an early water level
    recession would be unfavourable for food availability (Guan et al., 2016). The
    change in the distribution pattern of geese between the natural and managed habitat
    in 2022 was not as significant as that observed in ducks. However, in the managed
    wetland, there was a highly significant relationship between the proportion of
    geese and changes in the waterbody area. This also suggests that under drought
    conditions in the natural wetland, geese exhibit a tendency to shift to peripheral
    lakes. Furthermore, the geese exhibit another adaptive mechanism in response to
    extreme drought in their habitat, which involves adjusting their foraging behaviour
    and expanding their spatial niche. Previous studies have shown that when there
    is reduced food availability and declining habitat quality, individuals may actively
    search for food to meet their energy and nutritional requirements, taking actions
    such as seeking alternative potential food sources, altering foraging behaviour
    and strategies, and expanding their habitat range (Burnham et al., 2017, Zhang
    et al., 2020). In this study, the geese utilised the edges of the meadow and mudflats
    to sever aboveground Carex plants and searched for belowground plant parts in
    2022. However, herbivorous geese usually prefer high-quality fresh grasses in
    their wintering grounds in the Yangtze River Basin (Zhao et al., 2012). This is
    consistent with the observations for 2021 in this study, showing that the occurrence
    probability of wintering geese was closely associated with increased vegetation
    productivity during the early wintering period (Fig. 6c). Under normal hydrological
    conditions, the recent emergence of wet meadows suggested a favourable growth
    trajectory and enhanced availability for geese utilisation. In contrast, in November
    2022, NDVI was too high, and the geese abandoned their feeding activities on the
    long-exposed overgrown swards in the meadow. In general, the niche breadth of
    animals in terms of spatial use may increase as resource diversity decreases (Morellet
    et al., 2013). In this study, the adjustment in the ecological niche of geese
    was spatially manifested by an inward expansion in the habitat range in areas
    of natural habitat where the elevation is relatively low. This resulted in a low
    degree of spatial overlap between the two years. The \"source-sink\" theory suggests
    that when the quantity of source habitats is limited compared to relatively abundant
    sink habitats, the latter becomes attractive to species (Massol et al., 2011,
    Morris, 2003). Hence, species may utilise a broader range of environmental conditions
    than their fundamental niche, thus appearing in unsuitable habitats (Pulliam,
    2000, Pulliam, 1988). This is crucial for understanding the results of ENMs. We
    postulate that in 2022, the geese inhabited suboptimal habitats. The habitat expansion
    observed in 2022 did not necessarily imply that the suitable habitats were more
    favourable for geese in 2022 than in 2021. Instead, it reflects a microscale shift
    as an adaptation to unsuitable environments, highlighting their behavioural plasticity;
    this is consistent with the findings of previous studies in the area showing a
    trophic niche shift of geese in response to habitat alteration (Lei et al., 2019a).
    The threshold-setting method used to convert numerical predictions into binary
    predictions can also influence the analysis results; however, this was not the
    focus of this study. Nevertheless, the significant decrease in the occurrence
    probability of geese in natural habitats indicates that habitat suitability was
    lower in 2022. 4.4. Role of external managed lakes and conservation implications
    Globally, managed and restored wetlands constitute the core habitat network for
    waterfowl when natural wetlands are in a degraded state (Casazza et al., 2021,
    Czech and Parsons, 2002, Zhang et al., 2021), especially during drought conditions
    (Schaffer-Smith et al., 2017). In this study, the managed Caisang Lake wetland
    also emerged as an extremely important habitat for overwintering waterfowl during
    the drought period. Even though it experienced dramatic habitat alterations after
    the planting of lotus and culturing of crab since the 2013/2014 wintering period,
    this expansion of cultivation and aquaculture activities increased the waterbody
    area. Combined with human interventions maintaining the stability of Caisang Lake''s
    water level, the situation remains beneficial for certain omnivorous duck species
    (Zou et al., 2017). Therefore, extreme drought did not significantly affect its
    water surface area or habitat conditions. Due to historical land reclamation activities,
    there are many small and medium-sized lakes and wetlands surrounding Dongting
    Lake, which may also play crucial roles in the conservation of waterbird biodiversity
    in this region. Our results imply the need for increased attention to these external
    wetlands around Dongting Lake. Future studies could prioritise examining the diversity
    and distributions of waterbirds in these wetlands during wintering periods with
    different climatic and hydrological conditions. Our results emphasised the importance
    of managed and regulated wetlands as vital alternative habitats in biodiversity
    conservation. 5. Conclusions Our study identified significant impacts of extreme
    drought on the habitat conditions and thus the distribution pattern and niche
    of wintering waterfowl. In the past decade, the extreme drought year had the lowest
    water levels, smallest waterbody area, and highest NDVI value. The distribution
    of waterfowl, particularly ducks, was significantly impacted by severe drought
    conditions, resulting in a transition towards habitats unaffected by the drought.
    The distribution pattern of ducks was fundamentally altered. Geese demonstrated
    microscale shift in foraging habitat utilisation during the extreme drought year,
    indicating foraging plasticity to cope with decreased food availability. Both
    waterfowl guilds exhibited a low degree of spatial niche overlap between the two
    years. The low degree of overlap in ducks was primarily attributed to a significant
    contraction in their habitat extent in 2022, whereas for geese, the low degree
    of overlap was due to a substantial shift in their resource utilisation, as demonstrated
    by an overall inward shift in their habitat extent. Furthermore, the roles of
    natural and managed wetlands in biodiversity conservation, especially duck guilds,
    varied across different wintering periods with different hydrologies. This has
    important implications for wetland management and biodiversity conservation. Our
    research contributes to an enhanced understanding of the impact of extreme climatic
    and hydrological events on wetland ecosystems. CRediT authorship contribution

    sensingLand use/land cover 1. Introduction Land use and land cover (LULC) maps
    are fundamental source of information for numerous studies related to earth system
    including biodiversity, climate change, public health and carbon cycling around
    the globe (Luo et al., 2022). LULC maps are extensively utilized as essential
    input for numerous models related to hydrology (Salem et al., 2023), carbon storage
    (Fernandes et al., 2020) and other numerical models. Additionally, LULC maps are
    the provider of vital information for the planning of urbanization expansion,
    ecosystem services management and natural resources management (Ammann et al.,
    2022, Gao and O’Neill, 2020, Rayner et al., 2021). Remote sensing technology is
    providing data for large scale land cover (LC) studies for decades. Remote sensing
    technology can give coverage on different levels (Region, Continent and Global),
    which make this technology a primary choice for researchers to study the LC variations
    on different scales (Wang et al., 2022). Likewise, fusion of multitemporal and
    multi-source remotely sensed data can improve the results for continues monitoring
    LC types and natural resources (Cavender-Bares et al., 2022). In contrast, processing
    of multitemporal and multi-source remotely sensed data for large scale exhibits
    challenges such as high complexity of computation, heavy storage and high-tech
    resources (Song et al., 2022). Conversely, freely available cloud-based platforms,
    such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), efficiently offers a solution for the computational
    and storage challenges to process the remotely sensed data. GEE is huge platform
    containing remotely sensed geospatial data from multiple sources, GEE offers a
    high-speed processing of planetary scale remote sensing data with a storage capacity
    to store the processed results online (Benhammou et al., 2022). Additionally,
    huge consolidated library of free satellite imagery provided by GEE have make
    the continues monitoring of LC changes very access able through acceptable temporal
    and spatial resolution (Tamiminia et al., 2020). GEE offers a web-based development
    environment which can perform parallel and rapid processing of analysis and visualization
    of large-scale geospatial data. In addition to remotely sensed data, useability
    of GEE has been broadly adopted in numerous analyses of big data related to LC,
    like river monitoring (Riggs et al., 2022), forest changes (Ram et al., 2021),
    monitoring of burned areas (Roteta et al., 2021), cropland land variations (You
    et al., 2021), urban areas mapping (Zafar et al., 2023a), mapping of flood areas
    (Tripathy and Malladi, 2022), land surface temperature (LST) (Al-Khakani and Al-janabi,
    2023, Yousif and Shneen, 2015) and mapping of other types of LC (Roteta et al.,
    2021, Shafi et al., 2023, Zafar et al., 2023b). Machine learning approaches are
    common choice of researchers for LULC classification and results utilizing remotely
    sensed data and machine learning algorithms like random forest (RF), support vector
    machine (SVM), and classification and regression trees (CART) exhibited exceptional
    accuracy in recent studies (Le et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022).
    RF is the one of the most extensively utilized machine learning algorithm (Kong
    and Yu, 2018), this algorithm can be used for regression purpose in addition to
    its classification ability (Saha et al., 2023). The dual ability of RF made it
    a primary choice for numerous applications in Earth sciences including land use
    modeling (Gounaridis et al., 2019), land cover modeling (Masiliūnas et al., 2021),
    and change in forest cover (Kumar and Sinha, 2020). Researchers from India applied
    RF in Kolleru lake area to map the land use, RF showed a kappa value of 0.94 and
    over all accuracy of 95.9% (Kolli et al., 2020), RF exhibited 91% accuracy with
    0.89 Kapa value for LULC mapping of Thanh Hoa province of Vietnam (Le et al.,
    2022). SVM is also from one of the mostly used machine learning algorithms, it
    is also utilized and tested for many regions around the globe. According to recent
    studies, SVM showed 90.8% of accuracy in mapping of paddy rice in China (Mansaray
    et al., 2020) and 93.8% of accuracy for Sentinel-2 for Munneru River Basin, India
    (Loukika et al., 2021). CART is a state of the art machine learning algorithm,
    CART exhibited overall 83% accuracy over Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for LULC
    mapping in Canada (Basheer et al., 2022) and for mapping of LULC of east coast
    of India CART showed the accuracy score of 84% (Priya et al., 2022). Classification
    of LULC using machine learning algorithms gained a significant importance as various
    environmental changes such as deforestation, expansion in agriculture area and
    urbanization can be monitored conveniently by these algorithms. Additionally,
    in context of increase in processing of remotely sensed data over GEE for reliable
    LULC maps of large areas, it is utmost need of time to test the performance and
    reliability of machine learning algorithms on GEE. The majority of the previous
    studies emphases applying single classifier for LULC classification, few studies
    focused comparing the classifiers but with conventional applications instead of
    using GEE. The primary focus of this study is (i) to accurately map the LULC of
    Lahore city of Pakistan, (ii) to use data from different sensors of Landsat satellite
    for LULC classification, (iii) to check the best performing machine learning algorithm
    from three most famous machine learning algorithms. Below is the representation
    of characteristics that were utilized and tested by this study. • Methods o SVM,
    CART, RF. • Accuracy Comparison Indicators o Kappa Coefficient, Overall Accuracy,
    User''s Accuracy, Producer''s Accuracy. • LULC Classes o Water Bodies, Vegetation
    Cover, Urban Land, Barren Land. 2. Data and methodology 2.1. Study area Lahore
    is the second most populated city of Pakistan and this city is most populated
    and capital city of province of Punjab (Mehmood et al., 2022). The dynamic change
    in land LULC has become a major concern in Lahore, causing a variety of socioeconomic
    and environmental issues relating to air quality (Ahmad et al., 2023). Thus, accurate
    LULC mapping of Lahore is need of the hour. Lahore is situated between 31° 32′
    N and 74° 20′ E, with river Ravi on its west side and India on East side, city
    consists of flat terrain with average elevation of 217 m above sea level (ASL)
    (Rana and Bhatti, 2018). According to census of 2017, population of Lahore jumped
    to 11.2 million which was recorded as 6.3 million in 1998 and 98% of this huge
    population is living in urban areas of Lahore (PBS, 2017) Additionally, being
    a megacity Lahore has a vast area of 1684 km2 and is the center of cultural, academic
    and economic activities, this city often known as heart of Pakistan (Fahad et
    al., 2021). Lahore lies in less humid zone (Zafar et al., 2023a) of Pakistan,
    this city has extreme weather conditions in summer and winter. Months of April
    to September are considered as summer seasons and average daytime temperature
    for summer seasons remains between 40 °C to 48 °C, months of May and June are
    the hottest months in which temperature normally touches 48 °C. Months of November
    to March are considered as winter season, in which December and January are most
    cold months in which temperature touches the 0 °C. Lahore received average 600
    mm rainfall annually and most of the rainfall observed during the months of July
    and August (Monsoon season) (Abbas, 2022). Fig. 1 showed the geographical location
    and a general reflection of LULC of Lahore city. Download : Download high-res

    with Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 imagery. 2.2. Satellite data GEE offers
    a massive amount of remotely sensed data from well-known satellites like Landsat,
    MODIS and Sentinel for last four decades. Landsat satellite is very common choice
    for LULC extraction due to its acceptable spatial and temporal resolution (Kafy
    et al., 2021, Leta et al., 2021, Soomro et al., 2021). This study utilized surface
    reflectance Tier 1 data from two sensors (Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Operational
    Land Imager (OLI)) of Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 to extract LULC maps
    of years 2008, 2015 and 2022. Additionally, cloud cover and malfunctioning (e.g.,
    the Landsat 7 scan line corrector malfunction) has always been hindering the optimal
    use of the Landsat data for LULC mapping (Robinson et al., 2017). Hence, to enhance
    the quality of the results, images with less than 5% cloud were selected for classification,
    and gap filling algorithm was applied. Afterwards, selected images were combined
    to a single image for further processing. Study utilized band 1–7 for all three
    satellites but in case of Landsat-7 band 6 (Thermal band) was excluded. 2.3. Methodology
    This study utilized a framework for the comparison of three different machine
    learning methods using GEE for two different sensors (Fig. 2). We developed four
    major classes (Water Bodies, Vegetation Cover, Urban Land, Barren Land) for classification,
    details about classes are given in Table 1. For purpose of input to classifier,
    total 846 training samples for four classes were generated using high resolution
    imagery from Google Earth, from which 70% of samples used for training purpose
    and remaining 30% were used as testing of algorithms. Download : Download high-res

    and regression tree (CART) classifier CART, first developed by Breiman in 1984
    (Breiman et al., 1984), based on simple decision-making logic (If-else) and regression
    analysis. CART build a decision tree by dividing training data into successive
    subsets. This dividing of data is recursive and based on a predefined threshold,
    this phenomenon continued until CART achieved non dividable leaf nodes on tree.
    Afterwards, these leaf nodes on decision tree are used as output for predictions
    and the decision tree is then utilized in test phase to evaluate the performance
    of the algorithm. CART is highly sensitive about the training dataset and very
    minor variation in training dataset can lead to a totally different result. This
    heavy dependency on training dataset is considered as foremost disadvantage of
    CART. Nevertheless, CART is a simple model and proved it remains robustness in
    modern times. This study utilized “classifier.smileCart” method already embedded
    in GEE to apply CART classification. 2.3.2. Random forest (RF) classifier RF is
    most commonly used classifier for classification of LULC, RF is known as collective
    classifier that contains many autonomous trees to execute the classification.
    RF generates multiples random decisions trees by utilizing predictions of previously
    defined trees. A subset of inputs given to RF are used for training purpose and
    remaining input data is used for unbiased validation. Final result of classification
    is calculated by taking the average of probability of each class by individual
    tree. RF is considered as very stable classifier which can efficiently handle
    the issues like over fitting and noise, RF has also ability for handling the high
    dimensional data (Teluguntla et al., 2018). There are many parameters those can
    affect the final classification from RF. Two most effecting parameters for RF
    classifiers are number of total trees and number of variables in each node (Khan
    et al., 2021). 2.3.3. Support vector Machine (SVM) classifier SVM is supervised
    learning method commonly used for LULC classification and regression analyses.
    This algorithm creates an optimal decision boundary which is known as hyperplane
    and this hyperplane separates the on the base of minimum misclassified pixels
    from training data. The SVM adopted the iterative approach to create the optimum
    hyperplane to differentiate the patterns of training dataset. To create an optimal
    hyperplane SVM select the extreme points (support vectors). To determine the support
    vectors, cost parameter, Kernel Function and GAMA are the key parameters. By utilizing
    nonlinear kernel function, SVM can also applicable for nonlinear. SVM has a complex
    training mechanism which primarily depend upon size of the dataset, this training
    complexity made SVM not much suitable for large data. Nevertheless, SVM is very
    useful for complex data due to its kernel approach. 2.4. Accuracy assessment Accuracy
    of any classifier is dependent upon amount of input data, study area and satellite
    sensor. Several studies found different LULC accuracies for different classifier
    in different study area (Puttinaovarat et al., 2023, Soomro et al., 2021, Vivekananda
    et al., 2021). After performing the LULC classification, efficiency of any classifier
    can be evaluated through accuracy assessment. The most frequently adopted indicators
    for accuracy assessment are kappa coefficient and overall accuracy. Kappa coefficient
    evaluate the ability of a classifier in view of the forecasted values. Kappa coefficient
    has a value range from 0 to 1, where 0 value of kappa denotes no ability and 1
    denotes the perfect ability of classifier. In contrast, over all accuracy is the
    indication of ratio between number of pixels correctly classified and total number
    of pixels classified. GEE has an embedded confusion matrix algorithm. This study
    utilized a GEE embedded confusion matrix approach for validation and evaluation
    of classification accuracy. Equations for overall accuracy and kappa coefficient
    calculation are given below (Basheer et al., 2022): (1) where Cp is indicating
    correctly classified pixels and Tp is indicating the total pixels. (2) where N
    is the total number of observations, cr is the representation of total number
    of column and rows, is denotation of the total observations in row j and column
    k, represents marginal total of row j, and marginal total of column j is denoted
    by . Additionally, user’s accuracy for each class is calculated by taking the
    ratio of correctly classified pixels of class and total classified pixels of class,
    equation for user’s accuracy is given below: (3) Basically, user''s accuracy is
    the possibility for a pixel to exist in its corresponding forecasted class. Correspondingly,
    producer’s accuracy is calculated by the ratio of correctly classified pixels
    to the total reference pixels in a class, given below is the equation to calculate
    producer’s accuracy: (4) Producer’s accuracy is the possibility for a class being
    classified properly. Fig. 2 is the representation of complete methodology adopted
    for this study. 3. Results 3.1. LULC classification This study examined the four
    different types of LULC (water bodies, vegetation cover, urban land and barren
    land) of Lahore city for three different years (2008, 2015 and 2022) using Landsat-7,
    Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 imagery. Study utilized three commonly used machine learning
    algorithms (CART, RF, SVM) and every algorithm has produced results slightly different
    from other. Fig. 3 showed the spatial distribution of all LULC classes done by
    three machine learning algorithms using Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 imagery.

    for CART, RF and SVM, (b) Kappa coefficient of CART, RF and SVM. According to
    the results from overall accuracy and kappa coefficient, RF classifier outperformed
    both of the classifier in all case of all three images. RF classifier showed maximum
    overall accuracy of 95.2% for Landsat-9 image, 92.35% overall accuracy for Landsat-7
    and 91.6% accuracy for Landsat-8 imagery, which is above both of the classifier.
    Additionally, CART showed least overall accuracy which is below the both classifiers.
    In case of sensors of Landsat satellite, OLI sensor from Landsat-9 showed maximum
    performance for all three classifiers. Landsat-9 showed overall accuracy of 89.7%
    for CART classifier, 89.8% for SVM and 95.2% accuracy for RF classifier. Additionally,
    OLI sensor from Landsat-8 performed least from all three sensors. Fig. 8 showed
    the user’s accuracy of each class for every classifier using Landsat-7, Landsat-8
    and Landsat-9 imagery. In case of class accuracy vegetation cover showed maximum
    user’s accuracy and barren land showed least user’s accuracy. With comparison
    of other sensors, OLI sensor from Landsat-9 showed better performance than OLI
    of Landsat-8 and ETM+ of Landsat-7. RF classifier performed best in term of machine
    learning classifier. Moreover, almost same results have been observed in case
    of producer’s accuracy. RF preformed best among the classifiers and vegetation
    cover also showed maximum producer’s accuracy. Results for producer’s accuracy

    4. Discussion This study utilized the machine learning algorithms for LULC classification
    of Lahore city to identify the best suit machine learning algorithm for classification
    of LULC in unplanned cities like Lahore. Results of user’s and producer’s accuracy
    showed that barren land and urban land showed minimum values. Lahore has is a
    city with unplanned urbanization and Lahore has very few high-rise structures
    in urbanized areas. This caused the a very slight misclassification of these classes
    and effect their accuracies. Lahore city is currently under a stress of air pollution
    and very low air quality index (AQI) (Ali et al., 2022) and one the reason for
    this problem is very minimum vegetation and tree cover within the city (Khan et
    al., 2022). Low AQI also affect the quality of satellite imagery as, the quality
    of satellite images is affected due to the scattering and absorption of sunlight
    by atmospheric molecules and aerosols. Aerosols are major constituents for the
    formation of haze and thus responsible for degradation in the satellite images
    (Joshi et al., 2020). Vegetation cover of Lahore is mostly separated from urban
    areas and that made the machine learning classifier to classify vegetation cover
    more correctly, spatial separation of urban areas and vegetation cover made it
    easy to collect correct samples for the training of classifier and also scarce
    of urban vegetation help to avoid mixing of signature to classify the different
    classes accurately. Generally, Lahore contains only one water body (Ravi River)
    which is also suffering from water pollutants from city waste (Aslam et al., 2022),
    which caused the very tine misclassification of water pixels with barren and urban
    land. Overall, RF performed way better than in every LULC class but SVM gave almost
    same accuracy for vegetation cover land and even for Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 SVM
    surpass the RF for vegetation class, SVM also surpassed RF in user’s accuracy
    of barren land class. It is quite challenging to exactly distinguish between classes
    like barren land and urban land with 30 m spatial resolution in city like Lahore.
    Satellite with better spatial resolution may give better results for classification
    with machine learning algorithms. Every machine learning has some advantages and
    disadvantages. For instance, CART and SVM misclassify between LULC classes but
    SVM performed very when a small training dataset is available which made him and
    perfect choice for classification with little number sampling points (J. Wang
    et al., 2022). In contrast to SVM, RF is more robust and less dependent upon parameters
    (Lin and Doyog, 2023). In general, RF associate many soft linear boundaries at
    the surface of the decision and utilized previously defined predictions for classification.
    In this study, RF outperformed both classifiers (CART and SVM), irrespective of
    size of training data, SVM is performed well but a bit less than RF and CART performed
    less than both classifiers. A recent study from Kerala (India) also indicates
    that RF outperformed SVM and CART for LULC classification with 89.5% accuracy
    (Kulithalai Shiyam Sundar and Deka, 2022). A study from Munneru River Basin (India)
    also endorsed the results from this study, as study suggested RF as best performing
    machine learning algorithm with 94.5% accuracy (Loukika et al., 2021). RF also
    outperformed SVM for LULC classification in Greater Gaborone Planning Area of
    Botswana (Ouma et al., 2023). However, some study suggested that SVM performed
    better than RF, for example a recent study from El-Fayoum Governorate (Egypt)
    (Atef et al., 2023) suggested that SVM produced most accurate LULC maps with kappa
    coefficient of 0.916 compared to RF (0.909). Studies also suggested that CART
    outperformed SVM for LULC classification (Goldblatt et al., 2016). SVM also outperformed
    RF with accuracy of 91.4% in Urmia Lake Basin (Iran) (Feizizadeh et al., 2023).
    Different researchers found different machine algorithms best to apply for LULC
    classification in different areas. Thus, it is recommended to adopt latest, less
    sensitive and fastest machine learning algorithm for classification of LULC. The
    accuracy of a machine learning algorithms for LULC classification does not only
    vary with study area but also with study period. This is possibly due to the influence
    of atmospheric, surface and illumination variations. Accuracy of machine learning
    algorithms are also dependent on training samples. Thus, it is essential to maintain
    the quality of input samples and recommended to adopt latest, less sensitive and
    fastest machine learning algorithm for classification of LULC. 5. Conclusion Data
    from remote sensing satellite is suitable option for detection of LULC changes
    in an urbanized city Lahore analysis. Results showed the useability of machine
    learning algorithms with use of Landsat data for LULC analyses. Major findings
    and conclusion of this study are listed below: • RF is the best performing machine
    learning algorithm with overall accuracy of 92.7% for Landsat-7, 91.6% for Landsat-8
    and 95.2% for Landsat-9 imagery. • Sensor from Landsat-9 showed best overall accuracy
    of 89.7% for CART, 95.2% for RF and 89.8% for SVM. • According to the best performing
    algorithm (RF), urban Land area of Lahore city increased by 34.9% in last fifteen
    years. In case of LULC classifications various studies found different results
    based on selected satellite, study area and selected algorithms. Furthermore,
    studies also suggested that different classifiers performed differently in different
    climatic zones and geographical locations. Hence, future researchers should try
    to explore LULC by using high resolution imagery, more detailed classes, field
    gathered input data and adopting variety of sophisticated and modern machine learning
    algorithms designed for LULC classification. This study can be helpful for policy
    making, planning of city services, betterment of management practices, and additional
    LULC classification in urbanized cities. Current study is preliminary and has
    limitation with regards to (i) study area, (ii) the study duration, (iii) selected
    datasets and (iii) selection of machine learning algorithms for LULC extraction,
    any change in study area or study duration can affect accuracy of machine learning
    algorithms and in same way any change in adopted machine learning algorithms or
    datasets can lead to different results. Thus, a vigorous study may need more continues
    data, less sensitive machine learning algorithms and data from satellites having
    high spatial resolution. CRediT authorship contribution statement Zeeshan Zafar:

  description: Despite dealing with numerous challenges, the agricultural sector in
    Bangladesh is consistently growing every year because of the crop intensification
    efforts in many areas to ensure food security. However, the effect of intensive
    cropping on land use changes remains unclear due to the lack of systematic monitoring.
    This study assesses Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics, particularly in Bhanga
    Upazila (a subdistrict), Bangladesh, using remote sensing and GIS technologies.
    Landsat 5 and 8 satellite imagery to understand the impact of agricultural intensification
    from 1988 to 2023. This study showed that agricultural land utilization was increased
    by more than five times (551.8%) and the built-up area was expanded by 155.6%
    during the study period. This substantial land conversion was expected due to
    the significant decrease of barren and waterbodies by 63.1% and 72.4% at the same
    time respectively. Despite the fact that Bhanga was a typical rural place where
    agriculture had only a 5% (1012 ha) share of its total land (20,309 ha) back in
    1988, Bhanga experienced a notable surge in agricultural land utilization over
    the past three decades from 5.0% in 1988 to 32.5% by 2023, with a temporary dip
    to 2.4% post a devastating flood in 1999. The Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) analyses justify the
    increase of agricultural and built-up zones, contrasting significant decrease
    in waterbodies and barren areas as detected by RF (Random Forest) machine learning
    algorithm. These findings reveal that crop intensification initiatives convert
    waterbodies and barren lands into croplands. Government policies and supports
    such as various agriculture extension activities, availability of irrigation facilities,
    adaptation of technologies, and improved regional connectivity likely contributed
    to this positive transformation. This study offers crucial insights for policymakers
    to take region-specific customized agricultural strategies to ensure food security
    and sustainability.

    1. Introduction Transformation of land use is a global concern with far-reaching
    implications for food security and ensuring sustainability [1]. In Bangladesh,
    Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics are impacted by a complex interplay among
    agricultural intensification, urbanization, environmental vulnerabilities, and
    socioeconomic factors [2]. The country is densely populated with a land-scarce
    landscape. In addition, the escalating population and rapid urbanization have
    led to substantial changes in land utilization patterns. The transition from rural
    to urban areas, coupled with rapid industrialization put pressure upon agricultural
    lands [3]. To meet the high demand of food for its large population, the Government
    of Bangladesh has taken a series of policy measures and provided numerous financial
    incentives for agricultural intensification. Conversion of agricultural land to
    non-agricultural is common, but in many places, positive transformation is also
    taking place. For instance, due to the inadequate rainfall during the monsoon,
    many waterbodies are coming under agriculture especially in the dry seasons [4].
    In addition, a large area of barren lands is also transformed into crop land by
    utilizing government incentivized technologies and resources such as irrigation
    pumps, fertilizers, high yielding, climate resilient varieties, trainings, and
    demonstration [5,6]. However, to ensure food security with sustainable land utilization,
    proper land management is crucial [7]. Bangladesh, historically an agrarian society,
    relies heavily on agriculture which is also the backbone of its economy [8]. The
    situation is particularly acute due to its limited land availability compared
    to a densely populated landscape. Agricultural activities have traditionally occupied
    around 60% of the total land area [9]. The rich deltaic plains and fertile soil
    provide an ideal environment for rice and other crops cultivation [10]. Additionally,
    this agricultural landscape undergoes continuous evolution due to various factors,
    including technological advancements, changing market demands, and improved transportation
    systems [11]. Adding to the complexity, Bangladesh is susceptible to climate change
    influence, contributing to annual conversions of nearly 1% of agricultural lands
    to non-agricultural uses [9]. This transformation is a direct threat to the nation''s
    food production objectives. On the contrary, agricultural land has increased in
    certain areas in Bangladesh due to multiple factors [12]. For instance, one study
    reported that 73% of fallow land was transformed into agriculture, and waterbodies
    were severely impacted by gradual sand deposition and soil erosion [5]. However,
    population growth remains a primary driver that increases the demand for food,
    prompting the expansion of cultivable lands by converting forests, wetlands, and
    marginal areas into agricultural lands. Technological advancements have also played
    a crucial role, empowering farmers to utilize fallow lands by adopting improved
    irrigation, resilient crop varieties, and better farming practices [13]. Furthermore,
    government policies encouraging agricultural development, including land reclamation
    initiatives, dissemination of advanced agricultural technologies, development
    and distribution of climate-resilient varieties, and subsidies, also contribute
    to this agricultural expansion [14]. Market demands for specific crops often lead
    to the conversion of non-agricultural land to meet these needs. Infrastructure
    development, such as new roads, facilitates access to remote areas and encourages
    agricultural farming [15]. Climate change-induced events like riverbank erosion
    or salinity intrusion decrease arability and sometimes force populations to abandon
    affected areas [16]. Livelihood diversification among rural communities also drives
    the conversion of non-agricultural land to cropped land to generate supplementary
    incomes [17]. Nonetheless, crop intensification meets immediate food demand, and
    it poses some environmental risks like deforestation, biodiversity loss, and soil
    degradation [18]. Sustainable land management policies and practices are crucial
    to mitigate these risks and ensure food security while preserving environmental
    sustainability [19]. Thus, proper monitoring of land use transition and impact
    of crop intensification is essential. Regular monitoring of land use and change
    detection of LULC is foremost for analyzing the dynamics of land use change over
    time and understanding the socio-economic and environmental consequences [20].
    Land use denotes anthropogenic land utilization and land cover represents the
    bio-physical infrastructures or settings on the earth surface which includes the
    distribution of vegetation, croplands, soil, waterbodies, and any other physical
    features [[21], [22], [23]]. LULC maps facilitate to ensure proper spatial planning,
    management, and monitoring of natural resources at local, national, and regional
    levels [12,24,25]. Remote sensing together with GIS are effective tools to produce
    detailed land cover maps [26]. In addition, remote sensing applications have been
    recognized for land monitoring, especially for monitoring of agricultural land
    use change [27]. In contrast, field-level data collection is expensive and time-consuming
    and there is a possibility of erroneous visual interpretations on collected information
    [[27], [28], [29], [30]]. Studies on assessing land use transition using GIS and
    remote sensing technology are still limited in Bangladesh [31]. Previous land
    use transition studies mostly evaluated the impact of climate change in coastal
    areas [32,33], salinity-induced change [34], land use change on the ecosystem
    [35,36], flooding [5,37], urbanization and industrialization [38] monitoring of
    reserve forests including mangrove forests [[39], [40], [41]], and dynamics of
    land surface temperature (LST) [42,43]. These studies represented land use change
    in the classified hot-spot areas and/or on specific man-made or natural events.
    To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the impact
    of crop intensification on land use change dynamics in the non-classified areas
    which represent significant lands in Bangladesh. Therefore, undermining this vast
    area with the underlying change in land use remains unclear for the policymakers
    to take appropriate policy measures. To bridge this knowledge gap, we assessed
    the impact of agricultural intensification on land use change in Bhanga Upazila
    (a subdistrict), Faridpur, Bangladesh over the past three decades by using advanced
    geospatial technology. It is the first study of the detection of spatiotemporal
    change of different LULCs for the low-lying heterogeneous south-central region
    of Bangladesh. In this regard, remote sensing data provide accurate and reliable
    information in a short interval with low cost [44]. The freely available and processed
    remote sensing data play a key role in assessing, mapping, identifying, and monitoring
    the geospatial and temporal change of different surface features over a short
    and long period [45,46]. For instance, the Landsat imagery is a freely available
    online-based remote sensing dataset which is continuously monitored the global
    land use change since 1972 [30]. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8
    Operational Land Imager (OLI) provide satellite data for detecting changes in
    LULC, NDVI, and NDWI [44]. Google Earth Engine is a big geodata processing platform
    that has better computational capacities and is used for geospatial data processing
    over a wide area [47]. In addition, Random Forest (RF) is one of the renowned
    classification algorithms applied in remote sensing for multispectral and hyperspectral
    image classification. RF classification has higher accuracy and shows its strength
    against the overfitting training data [12]. GIS is an integrated approach to collecting,
    storing, analyzing, and finally presenting geographically referenced information
    for decision-making purposes [24]. NDVI and NDWI indices are also used to verify
    the accuracy of LULC classification [48]. The specific objectives of the study
    were: 1) To identify how different types of land use changes happened over the
    specified period. 2) To determine the spatial and temporal changes in agricultural
    landscapes over the past three decades. 1.1. Study area Bhanga Upazila, a sub-district
    of Faridpur district, Bangladesh, was selected for this study due to due to its
    unique combination of rural landscapes and robust agricultural settings. Bhanga
    serves as a representative sample of the broader regions of Bangladesh. Bhanga
    is located in the south-central of Bangladesh with an area of approximately 216.34
    km2 between 23°17′ and 23°28′ north latitudes and 89°55′ and 90°06′ east longitudes,
    approximately (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (878KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location map of the study area (Bhanga subdistrict,
    Faridpur district, Bangladesh). Bhanga is surrounded by the river Padma on its
    north and east sides. This region experienced extensive infrastructure developments
    such as the six-lane Dhaka-Bhanga Expressway and the construction Padma Multipurpose
    Bridge (length 6.15km) [49]. These mega infrastructures facilitate substantial
    agriculture development aimed at better communication and nationwide marketing
    opportunities [49]. Especially, Bhanga is a highly agriculture-friendly area due
    to its clay loam soils. It is located in the Arial Khan River floodplain which
    causes silt or alluvial deposition and makes the low-lying areas fertile [50,51].
    The annual average rainfall is 1546 mm, the maximum temperature is 35.8 °C in
    May and the minimum temperature is 12.6 °C [52]. Agriculture contributes 48% of
    the income source, with rice as the primary crop, followed by onion, vegetables,
    fruits, mustard, jute, and sugarcane [53]. Through the adoption of new crop varieties
    and technologies, farmers in Bhanga have aimed for higher productivity, especially
    in Boro and Aman modern rice varieties [54,55]. This intensified cropping system
    has increased multiple cropped areas, agricultural productivity, strengthening
    food security and economic development in the community [56]. Therefore, the findings
    derived from this study can contribute significantly by providing informed land-use
    policies, agricultural strategies, and sustainable development initiatives not
    only for Bhanga but also for similar regions facing comparable challenges. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Satellite data source, data acquisition, and time selection
    Landsat offers extensive, continuous, and high-resolution (30 m) data capturing
    the Earth surface over 40 years [27]. For this study, we utilized satellite imagery
    including Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 (Operational Land Imager
    (OLI) reflectance multispectral temporal images in Google Earth Engine (GEE) through
    USGS Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). During winter, submerged
    low-lying regions are utilized for agriculture, and thereby Bangladesh experiences
    the highest cropping intensity for diverse crop cultivation [57]. Additionally,
    favorable weather conditions and technological advancements facilitated extensive
    crop production during this period. To mitigate the impact of seasonal variations,
    February was specifically chosen for this study. Additionally, February offers
    the advantages of diverse crop coverage across fields and a relatively cloud-free
    sky, enhancing the suitability of imagery for analysis. Table 1 provides a detailed
    description of the data as well as the acquisition dates. We analyzed the data
    over thirty-five years (from 1988 to 2023) to understand the land use transition.

    from collected satellite imagery. Fig. 2 depicts the methodological framework
    for this study. The collected Landsat images were divided into five LULC classes,
    such as i) Agriculture, ii) Vegetation, iii) Built-up, iv) Waterbodies, and v)
    Barren lands. Detailed descriptions of each class are shown in Fig. 3. Download

    of LULC classification 2.3.1. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform The research
    took advantage of the GEE platform''s amazing capabilities for satellite imagery
    collecting and processing to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of geospatial
    analyses. Landsat 5 TM and the Landsat 8 OLI reflectance images were collected
    from the GEE platform for 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. In the beginning, the filter
    date and study area (region of interest) were set with cloud cover <3% to remove
    cloud interference (shadow) on the images. The imageries were collected from February
    2023 with the path 137 and row 044. The band combinations (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5
    and B7) were selected for Landsat-5 imagery and the band combinations (B2, B3,
    B4, B5, B6 and B7) were selected for Landsat 8 imagery collection. Then the collected
    imageries were stacked using a mosaic of collected imagery and clipping of roi
    (region of interest). High-resolution satellite imagery were used for generating
    500 training data in the form of points collection for the five different classes.
    We acquired training samples (random 75%) and validation samples (random 25%).
    The training points were collected from the whole area for each study period.
    Then the points were overlayed to obtain training samples. For overall accuracy
    assessment, confusion matrix, kappa coefficient, consumer accuracy, and producer
    accuracy were used for 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. 2.3.2. Random Forest (RF) machine
    learning The RF machine learning algorithm is one of the most common techniques
    to enhance the precision and accuracy of satellite image classification for land
    cover analysis [58]. This method utilizes bagging, producing multiple predictors
    that collaboratively reach a final decision by aggregating votes of predictors.
    A random selection of training datasets and variables was used for generating
    multiple decision trees by RF. To establish a proper split for building a tree,
    RF selects variables at random from training samples at each node [59]. A simplified
    structure of an RF tree is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image
    (287KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of an RF Tree adopted
    from [63]. We used the “smileRandomForest” as RF classifier machine learning algorithm
    for supervised image classification. Supervised classification utilizes the spectral
    signatures that are labelled training data which were obtained from training samples
    for classifying an image. The supervised learning model produces more accurate
    results than the unsupervised classification [60]. Here we used “ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(numberOfTrees,
    variablesPerSplit” algorithm for classifier model building. We performed supervised
    classification and data validation using 70% of training data and 30% of testing
    data, respectively. We used different coloured palettes such as yellow for agriculture,
    green for vegetation, red for built-up, blue for waterbodies, and grey for barren
    lands. Subsequently, LULC classified maps were prepared for the years 1988, 1999,
    2011, and 2023 from GEE with distinct five classes. 2.4. Accuracy assessment of
    LULC maps Accuracy assessment involves verifying classified images to determine
    the quality, precision, and suitability of the produced maps [48]. Most common
    metrics like training error matrix, overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, producers
    accuracy, consumers accuracy, validation accuracy, and validation error, are employed
    to assess the accuracy of the classified images [27]. For example, the Kappa coefficient
    determines the classification quality by comparing it against a randomly generated
    image. Kappa coefficient value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0.61–0.80 refer to significantly
    accurate, while values from 0.81 to 1 indicate nearly perfect [21]. Meanwhile,
    the error matrix provides insight into whether the sample classification for each
    LULC class is performed correctly or incorrectly. 2.5. LULC map generation using
    ArcGIS We utilized ArcGIS 10.8 software for image processing to produce geo-referenced
    maps for this study. At first, we imported the LULC classified tiff images into
    the ArcGIS catalogue. Then we changed the symbology from stretched to unique values
    to get five distinct classes such as agriculture, vegetation, built-up, waterbodies,
    and barren lands, and to obtain LULC maps for 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. Then
    we convert the raster image into a vector (polygon) using the conversion tool
    ‘Raster to Polygon’ tool. We projected the dissolved feature in the coordinate
    system (WGS 1984 UTM Zone 45 N) to produce the LULC maps. Finally, we calculated
    the area of five classes in the attribute table. Finally, we changed the colour
    ramp in the tiff images to produce NDVI and NDWI maps with the desired colours
    for the same period. 2.6. NDVI and NDWI analysis The NDVI which is a globally
    recognized tool, has been extensively utilized in previous studies to monitor
    seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations of crop growth [27,61]. On the other hand,
    the NDWI is a remote sensing-based indicator that can determine vegetation water
    content. It is particularly useful to identify open water sources [27]. NDWI also
    provides valuable indices for monitoring drought, water stress, and land degradation
    [62]. Both NDVI and NDWI are dimensionless, with values ranging between −1 and
    + 1 [48]. Higher NDVI values denote robust vegetation coverage, while negative
    values indicate the presence of water. Elevated NDWI refers to high water content
    in the soil, whereas lower values suggest reduced moisture content in the soil.
    NDVI and NDWI are calculated from the following equations (1), (2) [63]: (1) (2)
    In the case of NDVI, NIR is the reflection in the near-infrared, and RED is the
    red region of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). On the other hand, for NDWI,
    NIR and GREEN are the reflections in the near-infrared and GREEN range of EMS.
    NDVI predominantly maps vegetation, whereas NDWI maps the water content of vegetation
    [27]. Specific bands from the images were utilized to derive NDVI and NDWI as
    described in Table 2. Table 2. Specific bands used in NDVI and NDWI equations.

    3.1. LULC change detection The LULC maps were produced from the Landsat satellite
    imagery using the RF algorithm for the years 1988 (Fig. 5a), 1999 (Figs. 5b),
    2011 (Fig. 5c), and 2023 (Fig. 5d). The results revealed significant changes in

    full-size image Fig. 6. LULC classes change over time (in 1988, 1999, 2011, and
    2023) a) change in hectares; b) transformation in percentage. During the study
    period, the agriculture area substantially changed from 1012 ha to 6594 ha, indicating
    an incredible increase of 551.8% over 35 years. This huge growth of agricultural
    area shifts from 5.0% in 1988 to 32.5% of the total land in 2023. In addition,
    the built-up area also increased by 155.6%. However, the rate of change was not
    always linear for all types of lands. In 1988, the agricultural area was 1012
    ha which constituted 5.0% of the total land. From 1988 to 1999, the agriculture
    area decreased to 492 ha which was reasonable due to the devastating flood in
    1998 [66]. However, from 1999 to 2011, there was a drastic increase from 492 ha
    to 6197 ha and a 6.4% increase in the following interval 2011–2023 to make it
    five times than the initial agriculture area that constituted 32.5% of the total
    land. This remarkable increase in the agriculture area was expected due to the
    numerous policy measures, technological supports, and economic incentives to expand
    crop intensification in the region [67]. On the other hand, the built-up area
    increased by 57.6%, 26.7%, and 28.0% for the period of 1988–1999, 1999–2011, 2011–2023
    respectively. This steady increase in the built-up area is attributed to recent
    infrastructure development in that region, notably the impact of the new mega
    infrastructures such as the six-lane Dhaka-Bhanga Expressway and Padma Multipurpose
    Bridge [68,69]. Meanwhile, vegetation, waterbodies, and barren lands decrease
    significantly to transform into agricultural lands. For instance, during the study
    period, waterbodies went through substantial changes that showed a reduction from
    2441 ha in 1988 to 675 ha in 2023, reporting a 72.4% decline. In addition, barren
    lands were recorded at 7753 ha (in 1988) which reduced to 2864 ha in 2023, reflecting
    a 63.1% decrease over 35 years. Similarly, vegetation area slightly decreased
    from 1988 to 2023 and was recorded as 8334 ha, and 8209 ha, indicating a reduction
    of 1.5%. A similar decrease pattern was reported in a previous study for the period
    of 1990–2017 [12]. This change in waterbodies can be ascribed to landfilling of
    waterbodies, sand deposition in the rivers, low annual rainfall, rapid population
    growth, and other anthropogenic factors [70,71]. Hence, even though notable agricultural
    land was converted into the built-up area in many places, a substantial surge
    in agriculture was achieved due to the gain from large fallow and waterbodies
    [20]. 3.2. Accuracy assessment of LULC maps Several metrics, such as training
    error matrix, Kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, producer accuracy, consumer
    accuracy, validation accuracy, and validation error were used to assess the accuracy
    level of the classified images in 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023. 30% of validation
    reference points were randomly selected from the total samples for the assessment.
    The accuracy of the classified LULC maps was evaluated using Kappa statistics
    and overall accuracy, as described in Table 3. Notably, the overall classification
    accuracy was verified at 99% for each of the years: 1988, 1999, 2011, and 2023.
    The overall accuracy above 85% indicates excellent precision in the LULC classification
    [72]. Table 3. Overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for year-wise training samples.
    Year Overall accuracy Kappa Coefficient 1987 99% 0.99 1999 99% 0.99 2011 99% 0.99
    2023 99% 0.99 3.3. Trend analysis of LULC categories Linear regression analysis
    is an effective tool to understand the correlation between dependent and independent
    variables [44]. Fig. 7 indicates that independent variables such as waterbodies,
    barren lands, and built-up areas collectively account for around two-thirds of
    the variation in the dependent variable, agriculture. Download : Download high-res

    barren lands and agriculture; b) Correlation between waterbodies and agriculture;
    c) Correlation between built-up and agriculture Additionally, low R2 values indicate
    the nonlinear LULC change during the study period. To evaluate the relationships
    with agriculture versus barren lands, waterbodies, and built-up, correlation coefficient,
    R2 values were derived from the linear equations, resulting 0.82, 0.64, and 0.74
    respectively. In general, regression analysis confirms that the decrease in barren
    lands and waterbodies facilitates agriculture to flourish. 3.4. Spatial distribution
    of NDVI Two indices, NDVI and NDWI, were used to enhance LULC identification and
    improve the accuracy of the classification. These indices effectively distinguished
    the selected five land cover features. NDVI is widely used for monitoring vegetation
    health [41]. Fig. 8 showcased the spatial distribution of NDVI values for four
    specified years, ranging from −0.36 to 0.73. Particularly, forest, shrubs, and
    agriculture areas were visible in the NDVI map, characterized by dark and light
    green hues, with values hovering around 0.4 or higher. In contrast, permanent
    waterbodies and temporary waterbodies appeared as light red to dark red with values
    below zero, while built-up areas appeared whitish to light red, indicating values
    slightly above zero. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    2011 (8c) and 2023 (8d). Fig. 8a depicted lower NDVI values across most of the
    study area, indicating the LULC in 1988, while random higher values denote winter
    crops. Fig. 8b revealed increased areas with sparse vegetation of light green
    colour, alongside pockets of dark green indicating crops, possibly affected by
    the devastating flood in 1998. Fig. 8c and d illustrate expanded agriculture zones,
    with minor barren lands in the central and western sectors of the study area.
    The NDVI analysis highlighted a significant increase in agriculture and built-up
    areas over time. Similar findings were reported from another study utilizing the
    NDVI index [73]. Table 4 outlines the highest and lowest NDVI values recorded
    annually. Table 4. Year-wise highest value and lowest value of NDVI and NDWI.
    Year NDVI NDWI Highest Lowest Highest Lowest 1988 0.73 −0.36 0.51 −0.61 1999 0.67

    distribution of NDWI NDWI serves as a significant indicator to represent crop
    water stress and helps to specify wetland change [41]. The study area was also
    assessed with the NDWI and found similar to those from NDVI. Fig. 9 illustrates
    the spatial distribution of NDWI values across four specified years, ranging from
    −0.61 to 0.51. These values indicated the presence of agricultural areas, vegetation
    coverage, barren lands, and areas with shallow or deep water. Download : Download

    of NDWI for 1988 (9a), 1999 (9b), 2011 (9c) and 2023 (9d). Agriculture areas and
    vegetation appeared in white to light blue hues, indicating values from −0.61
    to just below zero. Meanwhile, waterbodies were shown in dark blue, with values
    above zero, and built-up areas occurred in white to blue, with values slightly
    above zero. The spatial variability of NDWI values exhibited distinct fluctuations
    across different years. In 1988, NDWI values were lower across most areas, except
    in the center and southeastern parts of the study area. By 1999, widespread areas
    were identified with sparse vegetation, reflected in lower values represented
    by light blue shades. In 2011 and 2023, NDWI values were consistently aligned
    with the LULC maps, showcasing transformations from barren lands and vegetation
    to agriculture. 4. Discussion GEE is the most powerful freely accessible tool
    to acquire, process, and analyze geospatial data for the study area. To categorize
    LULC maps accurately, various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest
    (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
    are used. In this study, RF efficiently classified different land use land cover
    types with >99% accuracy. RF showed a similar highest accuracy in previous investigations
    [74,75]. In addition, previous studies reported that the SVM and CART erroneously
    categorized forests, waterbodies, and barren lands as vegetation and built-up
    areas [58,59]. To validate RF outputs, NDVI and NDWI were also utilized in this
    study to accurately classify the land types [76]. NDVI and NDWI involved the creation
    of training points and polygons for each class. Each pixel within the polygon
    serves as a training sample, with a known assigned value. This allows for a comparison
    with classified pixels, enabling the assessment of errors and precision [77].
    Although the accuracy level was high, the agriculture land surge was compared
    with the historical field data to rationale the findings especially the increase
    of agricultural lands. Historical ground data support this significant land transformation.
    For instance, irrigated Boro rice cultivation has been increasing enormously since
    the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 [53,56]. In the last few decades, huge
    areas were brought under agriculture due to the wide access to shallow and deep
    tube wells for proper irrigation [78] which boosted crop production in 2020–2021
    compared to 2010–2011 as shown in Fig. 10. In addition, the introduction of new
    and sustainable stress-tolerant crop varieties (rice, mustard, wheat onion, etc.),
    crop diversification, modern machinery availability, and government subsidies
    and support for fertilizers and seeds availability have a substantial impact on
    crop intensification [56,79]. Despite the lack of historical data for the whole
    study period, Bangladesh experienced 3% growth in cropped land and 23.4% increase
    in selected crop production from 2010-2011 to 2020–2021 (Table S2 and Table S3),
    while Bhanga showed 6.4% increase in agriculture land from 2011-2023 (Table S1).

    Fig. 10. a) Actual cropped area change (national) and b) Actual production increase
    statistics (national) for 2010-11 Vs 2020–21 [56,80]. Another significant change
    has been recorded in the built-up areas, which increased by around 155.6% from
    1988 to 2023. Almost at the same time, from 1991 to 2022, population growth in
    Bhanga was recorded by 36.4% as the population census reports [[81], [82], [83]].
    Therefore, crop intensification was obvious to ensure the food security of the
    growing population, and the expansion of built-up areas indicated the livelihood
    pattern change among the inhabitants in the study area. Although built-up areas
    improve local livelihoods, ongoing land monitoring is essential for sustainable
    land usage and to mitigate any potential adverse impact of rapid urbanization.
    Hence, it is imperative to implement appropriate policies that ensure effective
    land use, thereby ensuring food security and fostering the economic development
    of the community. 5. Conclusion The study employed GIS and spatiotemporal Landsat
    satellite imagery, along with NDVI and NDWI indices to analyze the land use and
    land cover dynamics in the Bhanga subdistrict, Bangladesh, spanning from 1988
    to 2023. The quantitative assessment revealed an upward trajectory in agricultural
    lands and built-up areas, contrasted with a declining trend in vegetation, waterbodies,
    and barren lands. This transformation indicates the direct impact of agricultural
    intensification in the study. The large expansion of agricultural lands owes credit
    to government support, and the introduction of high-yielding and climate-resilient
    new crop varieties and technologies disseminated by the Department of Agricultural
    Extension (DAE). This crop intensification significantly boosted crop production,
    ensuring greater food self-sufficiency. In contrast, more than half of the waterbodies
    were disappeared, which could be alarming for biodiversity and the ecosystem.
    It could also be noted that remaining barren land utilization might be a way forward
    to reduce future load on waterbodies and vegetation area coverages. This research
    highlights the crucial role of ongoing GIS and remote sensing-based monitoring
    to understand the land use change over the time to facilitate informed policymaking
    decisions for sustainable agricultural planning. Most past studies were focused
    on climate-vulnerable regions, where agricultural land predominantly experienced
    a significant decline. That trend, however, does not represent the entire landscape
    of the country. Hence, the current study reports an opposite but positive trend,
    emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring of land use change to tailor region-specific
    initiatives instead of adopting generalized strategies to ensure food security
    and sustainability. By offering valuable insights, this study proposes actionable
    recommendations for policymakers. This finding can pave the way for sustainable
    agricultural development in Bangladesh. It is also imperative to adopt proper
    policies that account for region-specific variations in land use to ensure resilience
    and sustainable growth in the face of evolving environmental consequences. Although
    there are many other methods to determine the LULC change, our methods have been
    demonstrated to produce comparable results with minimum efforts that can be adopted
    for a similar scope around the world. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the importance
    of utilizing other methods with onsite validation. To prepare a more realistic
    decision-making inputs, continuous LULC change monitoring using geospatial technologies
    needs to continue with bigger samples including severely climate-vulnerable and
    less vulnerable regions. Funding The authors did not receive support/funding from

  description: Monitoring crop growth, soil conditions, and hydrological dynamics
    are imperative for sustainable agriculture and reduced environmental impacts.
    This interdisciplinary study integrates remote sensing, digital soil mapping,
    and hydrological data to elucidate intricate connections between these factors
    in the state of Ohio, USA. Advanced spatiotemporal analysis techniques were applied
    to key datasets, including the MODIS sensor satellite imagery, USDA crop data,
    soil datasets, Aster GDEM, and USGS stream gauge measurements. Vegetation indices
    derived from MODIS characterized crop-specific phenology and productivity patterns.
    Exploratory spatial data analysis show relationships of vegetation dynamics and
    soil properties, uncovering links between plant vigor, edaphic fertility, and
    nutrient distributions. Correlation analysis quantified these relationships and

    spatiotemporal relationships of nutrient pollution and stream discharge. By synthesizing
    diverse geospatial data through cutting-edge data analytics, this work illuminated
    complex interactions between crop health, soil nutrients, and water quality in
    Ohio. The methodology and findings provide actionable perspectives to inform sustainable
    agricultural management and environmental policy. This study demonstrates the
    significant potential of open geospatial resources when integrated using a robust
    spatiotemporal framework. Integrating additional measurements and high-resolution
    data sources through advanced analytics and interactive visualizations could strengthen
    these insights.

    in Australia Chapter © 2023 Introduction The increasing availability of spatial
    data from diverse sources, including satellite imagery and sensors, has provided
    the academic community with unprecedented opportunities to gain valuable insights
    into the environment, make informed decisions, mitigate nutrient loss, and promote
    environmental safety through hazard prevention. Spatial data have found diverse
    applications, such as in weather Ahmad and Zeeshan (2022); Peng et al. (2016),
    soil minerals Demattê et al. (2018); Palmer et al. (2021), monitoring floods Fisher
    et al. (2016), preventing fire hazards Navarro et al. (2017), informing population
    decisions Azar et al. (2013), water, building, land cover, and information management
    Yaman et al. (2021). These examples highlight the wealth of information that holds
    extensive potential for monitoring and analyzing agricultural environments. In
    recent years, researchers have used geospatial techniques using satellite imagery
    to monitor vegetation growth Jackson et al. (2004). The widely employed Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from data sources such as MODIS, Landsat,
    or Sentinel Rouse et al. (1974a, b); Waring et al. (2006), has been instrumental.
    Aside from NDVI metrics, Leaf Area Index (LAI) has been used in canopies and transpiration
    Fang and Liang (2014); Chen (2018), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)
    has been used to minimize the influences of soil on canopy Huete (1988). Through
    examining the spectral reflectance of vegetation, NDVI provides a valuable indicator
    of plant health and vigor Huang et al. (2021); DeFries and Townshend (1994); Pettorelli
    et al. (2005). Other indices include Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) Jiang et
    al. (2008), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) Gao (1996), Green Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) Shaver et al. (2006), Chlorophyll Index (CI)
    Shibayama and Akiyama (1986); Shrestha et al. (2012), and Water Index (WI) Peñuelas
    et al. (1997). Most of these indices have NDVI as the baseline. While progress
    has been made in crop monitoring using satellite data from the NDVI, challenges
    persist in relating vegetation patterns to key soil factors impacting plant growth
    and vigor. Most of these challenges hinge on integrating diverse multi-modal data.
    Digital soil mapping and analysis of soil surveys have been valuable for understanding
    soil nutrients, texture, fertility, and more Subburayalu et al. (2014); Arshad
    et al. (1997); Mallah et al. (2022). In addition, hydrological data such as stream-flow
    measurements enables the characterization of water quality issues such as agricultural
    runoff and nutrient pollution Michalak et al. (2013); Smith et al. (2015). In
    particular, the flow of excess contaminants, including nitrate and nitrite, into
    water streams has contributed to serious environmental and health problems Schlossberg
    (2017); Sinha et al. (2017). In addition, increased flow of nitrate and nitrate
    into waterways has encouraged eutrophication, a depletion of oxygen in water,
    leading to the suffocation of marine life Singh et al. (2022). High concentrations
    of nitrate and nitrite found in drinking water have caused methemoglobinemia (“blue
    baby syndrome”) in infants Manassaram et al. (2010); Coffman et al. (2021). Because
    of its impact on the health and well-being of people and the environment, it is
    of interest to determine how to model and predict the behavior of nitrate and
    nitrite, besides other contaminants, in watersheds. Many features can affect the
    presence of nitrate and nitrite in watersheds, such as soil characteristics and
    nutrients, agricultural practices, and discharge Dubrovsky and Hamilton (2010).
    Discharge, or stream-flow, is defined as the speed a volume of water has as it
    crosses a specific reference point. Linking water contamination spatiotemporally
    to land management practices can inform conservation efforts. Integrating data
    on crops, soils, and water can provide a holistic perspective not attainable through
    isolated data sources. A spatiotemporal approach leveraging these interconnected
    domains has immense potential for novel and interdisciplinary insights into complex
    agricultural and environmental systems Chen et al. (2004); Wang et al. (2003).
    However, significant challenges persist in effectively tracking crop health over
    time, capturing spatial variability within fields, and linking vegetation dynamics
    to key soil factors that impact plant growth, yield, and vigor. While significant
    progress has been made in crop monitoring using geospatial data, challenges persist
    in effectively integrating diverse data sources of varying spatial and temporal
    resolution and conducting Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) simultaneously
    in space and time Hamdi et al. (2022). The integration and correlation of multi-modal
    data from different sources and databases are crucial for understanding the intricate
    relationships between these features. However, platforms that offer comprehensive
    data management often lack capabilities for flexible exploratory analysis. Although
    platforms like IBM’s Physical Analytics Integrated Data Repository and Services
    (PAIRS) Lu et al. (2016); Lu and Hamann (2021); Klein et al. (2015) offer comprehensive
    data management and analytic capabilities, challenges remain in effectively integrating
    and correlating diverse data and conducting ESDA. While IBM offers curated data
    spanning multiple petabytes, effectively harnessing its potential for exploratory
    analysis remains a complex task. To address the ongoing challenges in data integration
    and ESDA, we leveraged the capabilities of the IBM Environmental Intelligence
    Suite (EIS). EIS is a suite of tools and services built on IBM PAIRS, tailored
    for environmental monitoring and analysis. Our aim is to integrate data from multiple
    sources in different formats with different spatial and temporal resolutions,
    including MODIS satellite imagery MODIS (2019), USDA crop planting data United
    States Department of Agriculture (2019), soil databases (SSURGO and WoSIS) Staff
    (2019); Batjes et al. (2019), Aster GDEM elevation data Tachikawa et al. (2011a,
    2011b), and USGS stream-flow measurements Survey (2019), to conduct a comprehensive
    analysis of crop growth, health, and water/nutrient flow in Ohio during 2019.
    Effective crop monitoring through integrating data sources can support improved
    yield forecasting, targeted field-specific interventions, and optimized inputs
    to manage plant growth. In addition, a greater understanding of water and nutrient
    behavior can aid in reducing the effects of pollution from contributing factors,
    such as agricultural land use. Ohio was selected as a baseline state and region
    of interest for this analysis given its significance in the Center for Advancing
    Sustainable and Distributed Fertilizer Production (CASFER), a National Science
    Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) Botte et al. (2023); Ai et
    al. (2023). This state has major importance and serves as a baseline location
    where CASFER technologies will be implemented and validated for creating a nitrogen-circular
    economy. This study aimed to leverage the wealth of data and expertise in this
    state before extending the analysis to other states across the United States.
    Advanced analyses are needed to fully harness the wealth of insights that can
    be derived from integrating multi-modal geospatial data. By integrating data spanning
    satellite imagery, soil surveys, land use, and hydrological data, researchers
    can gain a multifaceted understanding of agricultural ecosystems. Fig. 1 Overview
    of the key data used in this research, including MODIS Aqua satellite imagery,
    soil data, and USDA crop data Full size image Most prior work has focused on analyzing
    one data type in isolation. An integrated spatiotemporal analysis approach could
    capture intricate connections between crop health, edaphic factors, and water
    dynamics. One of the key challenges in geospatial analysis is the storage and
    scalability of large amounts of data. With the Common Research Analytics and Data
    Lifecycle Environment (CRADLE), we can overcome this challenge. CRADLE, our Distributed
    and High-Performance Computer (D/HPC) integrated Hadoop Cluster Hu et al. (2013);
    Khalilnejad et al. (2020), provides the infrastructure to handle and analyze big
    geospatial data effectively and efficiently. By leveraging the capabilities of
    CRADLE, we successfully downloaded and ingested a vast amount and variety of geospatial
    data from IBM EIS and other sources, ensuring efficient storage and processing.
    With this infrastructure, we aimed to explore the correlations between vegetation
    patterns, soil properties, and nutrient distribution. In this study, we show the
    potential for leveraging open geospatial data and exploratory analysis techniques
    to achieve a more holistic perspective on agricultural and environmental management
    Lnenicka and Nikiforova (2021); Coughlan (2020). Our primary aim is to integrate
    multi-modal data from multiple sources in different formats with different spatial
    and temporal resolutions, including satellite imagery, soil databases, elevation
    data, and stream-flow measurements, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of crop
    growth, health, and water/nutrient flow in Ohio during 2019. By doing so, we seek
    to improve crop monitoring, enhance yield forecasting, target field-specific interventions,
    and optimize inputs to manage plant growth effectively. We shed light on the current
    state of geospatiotemporal analysis in agriculture, emphasize the significance
    of integrated approaches, and contribute to ongoing efforts to promote sustainable
    agricultural practices and environmental management. This research will explore
    data science methodologies, present comprehensive analysis findings, and discuss
    the implications derived from our study, providing valuable insights into the
    field of agricultural and environmental science. The advanced spatiotemporal analysis
    techniques provide unique holistic insights into agricultural and environmental
    systems not attainable from isolated data sources. The computational framework
    leverages high-performance computing capabilities to handle massive datasets efficiently.
    The approach links crop growth dynamics, soil properties, and nutrient transport
    in streams at broad geospatiotemporal scales. The following sections of this paper
    will provide an in-depth exploration of the data science methodologies employed,
    present the analysis findings comprehensively, and discuss the implications derived
    from our study. While this manuscript focuses on presenting the methodology and
    results for Ohio, supplementary results for Texas and Florida were analyzed using
    the same framework and are provided in the Appendices for reference. Datasets
    Soil and Crop Datasets Figure 1 shows the data used in this work as obtained from
    IBM EIS. These data encompass a diverse range of spatial and temporal resolutions,
    which include daily MODIS Aqua 250 m resolution imagery, USDA historical crop
    planting data at 30 m resolution, and soil databases such as SSURGO and WoSIS.
    Both soil data have a spatial resolution of 250 m. All these data were collected
    for the year 2019. MODIS Aqua 250 m Resolution Imagery The MODIS Aqua data comprises
    remotely sensed imagery captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite. The data were collected at a spatial
    resolution of 250 m and provide daily observations. For this research, we used
    the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands for the analysis. USDA Historical Crop Planting
    Data (30 m Resolution) The USDA historical crop planting dataset provides detailed
    information on crop types and their spatial distribution across the study area.
    The data has a finer spatial resolution of 30 m. Soil Databases (SSURGO and WoSIS)
    at 250 m Resolution The soil databases used in our study include the Soil Survey
    Geographic Database (SSURGO) and the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS). These
    databases provide comprehensive information about soil properties and characteristics.
    Both SSURGO and WoSIS have a spatial resolution of 250 m, matching the resolution
    of the MODIS Aqua imagery. WoSIS provides data on soil pH, soil nitrogen, organic
    carbon, and soil types, while SSUR-GO offers data on water-holding capacity and
    soil texture. These soil properties are crucial for understanding the soil’s composition
    and suitability for various applications. As shown in Fig. 1, by combining the
    MODIS Aqua imagery, USDA historical crop planting data, and the soil databases
    (SSURGO and WoSIS), we can gain insights into the dynamic interplay between agricultural
    practices, soil conditions, and environmental factors within the study area. Water
    and Elevation Datasets To evaluate hydrologic properties and how their behavior
    varies across space and time, three different data sets were considered. The data
    collected include Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM Version 3) data collected
    from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)
    METI and NASA (2019), the United States Geological Survey National Water Information
    System (USGS NWIS) Survey (2019) stream flow data, and nutrient information got
    from The Water Quality Portal (WQP) Survey et al. (2019). ASTER GDEM The ASTER
    GDEM dataset provides elevation information obtained from the Advanced Spaceborne
    Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument aboard Terra, a
    NASA satellite. These data contain elevation information for over 99% of the Earth’s
    surface, with each GeoTIFF image covering 1 x 1 degree (111 km x 111 km) surface
    area. The spatial resolution is 30 m and there are about 12,967,201 pixels or
    estimated elevation values per GeoTIFF. In this study, Version 3 was used, which
    contains data collected in 2019. USGS NWIS The USGS NWIS data contains in situ
    stream water gauge measurements. Over 22,000 features were measured. For this
    study, nitrate and nitrite concentrations and discharges were analyzed. Data was
    collected every 15 min for 2019. WQP The WQP provides nutrient content information
    from stream water gauges collected by the EPA and USGS. The data was collected
    daily for 2019. In situ, water gauge measurements, both on water characteristics
    such as discharge and nutrient content (e.g., nitrates and nitrites), provide
    important information on the state of water quality at a time. This, in combination
    with elevation data, can provide insights into the behavior of these water features
    in relation to the location of river networks over time. In the following sections,
    we will discuss the data preprocessing steps, integration techniques, and analytical
    methods employed to extract valuable information and derive meaningful conclusions
    from these data. Methodology This research was divided into two distinct sections,
    each focusing on different aspects of geospatial analysis. The first section was
    dedicated to the analysis of soil-related factors, including soil properties and
    crop growth, while the second section centered on the analysis of water-related
    factors. Crop and Soil In this study, we conducted a geospatial analysis of soil
    properties and crop growth patterns to gain insights into the relationships between
    soil attributes, vegetation dynamics, and nutrient distribution. The methodology
    involved the following steps: Fig. 2 Step 1: Pipeline to extract stream networks
    from digital elevation model data Full size image Data Acquisition and Integration
    We acquired geospatial data relevant to land and crop analysis from IBM EIS, including
    MODIS satellite imagery, USDA crop planting data, and soil databases (SSURGO and
    WoSIS). The data were downloaded as zip files, with each file containing layered
    GeoTIFFs Ritter and Ruth (1997); OGC (2023). To ensure compatibility and consistency
    across various sources, these GeoTIFFs were subjected to preprocessing steps,
    including unzipping, stacking, masking, cropping, and resampling. The data were
    integrated by aligning spatial and temporal dimensions, addressing inconsistencies,
    and standardizing coordinate systems. Fig. 3 Step 2: Pipeline to extract stream
    networks from digital elevation model data Full size image Fig. 4 Step 3: Pipeline
    to extract stream networks from digital elevation model data Full size image Fig.
    5 Step 4: Pipeline to extract stream networks from digital elevation model data
    Full size image Fig. 6 Step 5: Pipeline to extract stream networks from digital
    elevation model data Full size image Fig. 7 Result: Pipeline to extract stream
    networks from digital elevation model data Full size image To integrate the multi-modal
    data analyzed in this work, including the MODIS, soil, and crop data layers, resampling
    and aggregation techniques were used to align the data spatially and statistically.
    For instance, the 250m resolution of the soil data and MODIS imagery were upscaled
    to the 30m resolution of the crop planting maps. This integration process helped
    ensure the data layers matched spatially for coherent analysis while preserving
    the fundamental integrity of the data patterns. As is typical of such up-scaling
    and aggregation approaches, the integrated data maintained the overall statistical
    distributions and relationships critical for the correlation analysis while aligning
    spatially across sources. Geospatial Analysis of Soil and Crop Parameters To analyze
    soil properties, we leveraged IBM Environmental Intelligent Suite to retrieve
    publicly available national soil databases and extract relevant parameters, including
    soil classification, organic matter content, pH, and nitrogen levels. For vegetation
    dynamics, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from
    the MODIS Aqua satellite data. The NDVI quantifies vegetation health and vigor
    by contrasting red and near-infrared reflectance using the following equation:
    $$\\begin{aligned} \\text {NDVI} = \\frac{\\text {NIR} - \\text {Red}}{\\text
    {NIR} + \\text {Red}} \\end{aligned}$$ (1) NIR is the near-infrared reflectance,
    and Red is the visible red reflectance. NDVI values range from -1 to 1, but noise
    and cloud contamination are removed by scaling to \\(-\\)0.2 to 1 Zhu et al. (2013).
    The NDVI time series enabled the characterization of vegetation phenology. Spatial
    analysis of NDVI patterns was conducted in relation to soil parameters in order
    to examine correlations between crop growth, soil nutrients, and related factors
    across the study area. Acquisition of Water Data Streamwater features were collected
    and extracted from three different sources. Elevation information used to calculate
    slope and stream networks was obtained from ASTER GDEM as satellite imagery provided
    as a grid of pixels. In situ water gauge measurements were collected from USGS
    NWIS, measuring over 22,000 parameters, including discharge, temperature, pH,
    etc., every 15 min. Lastly, nutrient content information from water gauges was
    obtained from the Water Quality Portal (WQP), which serves as a portal to access
    data collected from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and USGS. Water
    gauge data was collected in tabular form. Geospatial Analysis of Water Parameters
    From ASTER GDEM data, hydrographic features and stream networks can be extracted.
    A Python package, pysheds, was used to implement the pipeline used for extracting
    stream networks Bartos (2023). This pipeline involves, first, determining the
    direction of water flow on land based on elevation using the D8 algorithm Jones
    (2023). This algorithm determines the steepest descent for each cell based on
    the elevation difference between the current cell and its neighboring cells. Once
    the direction of flow is determined, cell accumulation can be calculated. Cell
    accumulation allows one to see how many cells will accumulate or flow into a particular
    cell based on flow direction. This allows one to see where the streams, rivers,
    lakes, and oceans are located, as these are areas where water will accumulate
    or flow. From here, stream networks (or D8 channels) can be extracted, allowing
    one to see both the shape and location of these streams or bodies of water. For
    this analysis, digital elevation model GeoTIFFs covering the region of Ohio were
    selected. The area outside of Ohio was masked, and stream networks were extracted
    following the methodology, as seen in the steps shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
    and 7. The pipeline to extract stream networks from GDEMs can be applied to new
    versions of GDEMs, allowing the model to update as new information is obtained.
    Besides elevation, in situ water gauges offer detailed spatial and temporal insights
    into the behavior of water features. Spatial and temporal analyses were conducted
    to understand the behavior of nutrient and water flow in streams over various
    time periods. Improved Methodology The methodology presented here improves on
    data integration approaches. It uses the powerful capabilities of the R programming
    language R Core Team (2023) and specialized geospatial analysis packages, specifically
    the terra and raster packages Hijmans et al. (2023a, 2023b), to efficiently process
    and analyze satellite imagery and soil data. The raw images were obtained from
    the IBM EIS as GeoTIFF layers embedded in zip files representing distinct data.
    For a given data, each individual GeoTIFF layer corresponds to a distinct point
    in time. As an example, the daily MODIS red band data contains 365 layers for
    the year 2019, with each layer representing measurements for a single day. By
    leveraging R and these geospatial tools, the multivariate spatiotemporal satellite
    and soil data were analyzed to draw insightful conclusions. While the terra and
    raster packages offer similar functionalities for raster analysis, in this context,
    they are used complementarily. Specifically, the terra library is employed for
    the efficient processing of multi-temporal satellite data series, including reading,
    cropping, masking, and stacking. On the other hand, the raster library is used
    for conducting geospatial multi-layer correlation analysis across both the soil
    and satellite raster images. The integrated use of both packages allows for streamlined
    data processing through terra along with customized analysis workflows via raster.
    Fig. 8 Schematic Overview of the methodology for integrating and analyzing satellite
    imagery and soil data across space and time using R packages Full size image In
    the spatial correlation analysis, we employed the corLocal() function from the
    raster package. This function determines correlations for each pixel between two
    raster layers. While Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman correlation coefficients are
    all viable choices based on data distribution, we opted for the Pearson coefficient
    for this study. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient for this analysis
    because the data was normally distributed and a linear relationship exists between
    the variables. Pearson is appropriate when these assumptions hold, as it assesses
    the linear dependence between two continuous variables. It was preferable to the
    Spearman or Kendall correlations, which are non-parametric measures not requiring
    normally distributed data. Using Pearson allowed us to quantify the strength and
    direction of the linear relationship between the soil and satellite raster layers.
    Additionally, the magick package was used to create GIFs for better data visualization
    Ooms [aut and cre (2023). Figure 8 presents a visual representation of the key
    steps involved in integrating and analyzing crop and soil data spatially and temporarily.

    Spatial Integration The data have been synchronized based on their temporal and
    spatial dimensions to facilitate a comprehensive through-time analysis. By sequentially
    overlaying the data based on their distinct features, this study provides a uniform
    assessment of non-stationary attributes. Cloud and Noise Removal To enhance the
    reliability of the data, a “clamp” process is applied to mitigate the impact of
    cloud cover and other potential noise effects present in the satellite imagery.
    Iterative Analysis The methodology adopts an iterative approach, analyzing data
    layer by layer to extract crucial information from each piece of data while ensuring
    the overall completeness of the study. Integration with Additional Data Emphasizing
    a holistic approach, the geospatial data is seamlessly integrated with other relevant
    data. This integration involves employing resampling and masking procedures to
    ensure spatial alignment and coherent correlation analysis. Correlation Analysis
    The methodology conducts spatial and temporal correlation analysis to explore
    the intricate relationships between soil properties, crop growth patterns, and
    nutrient distribution. Established indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) are used to assess vegetation dynamics and their connection to soil
    attributes. Fig. 14 Winter: Crop-specific monitoring of corn growth in Ohio during

    and High-Perfor-mance Computing (HPC) to store and analyze large amounts of data,
    ensuring efficiency and reliability in the computational process. Specifically,
    the added parallel processing capability facilitates working with data-intensive
    time series analysis. Fig. 22 Average seasonal growth profiles of corn and soybean

    in Ohio at 0–200 cm depth Full size image Limitations While the raster or terra
    package enables efficient analysis of geospatial data, some limitations exist
    when working with extensive raster time series, as with the daily MODIS NDVI data.
    Conducting computations on the full 365 daily NDVI layers requires substantial
    memory to store and analyze the data. Even with HPC resources, memory constraints
    may necessitate subsetting or aggregating the data for certain processing steps.
    Additionally, processing the massive time series is computationally intensive,
    often taking hours to run certain workflows. Visualizing and exploring the outputs
    also poses challenges because of the large file sizes. This highlights the computational
    and visualization challenges of big data analysis using R packages on a local
    computer. The improved methodology establishes a clear and rigorous framework
    for conducting geospatiotemporal analysis, integrating advanced tools and approaches
    to derive valuable insights from satellite and soil data. The transparency and
    attention to detail in the methodology contribute to the credibility and reproducibility
    of the research outcomes. Fig. 24 Silt proportion in Ohio at 0–200 cm depth Full

    Flow The research workflow, as depicted in Fig. 9, guided the entire process from
    data query and downloads to the final results for the soil-related data. The initial
    steps involved querying and downloading geospatial data from IBM EIS to our D/HPC
    CRADLE, encompassing data for Ohio during the year 2019. The subsequent steps
    included data preprocessing, vegetation classification, and crop healthiness mapping
    using the calculated NDVI. Correlation analysis with soil properties was also
    conducted. The final outputs comprise GIFs that provide valuable insights into
    vegetation patterns, crop healthiness, and correlations with soil attributes across
    the studied region and during time periods. For the water analysis, the initial
    steps involved querying tabular and raster data from USGS, WQP, and NASA/METI
    to be stored in CRADLE D/HPC. Subsequent steps included data preprocessing and
    extracting features of interest, including stream networks, discharge, and nitrate
    and nitrite information. Nitrate and nitrite information was classified into levels
    to better understand its effect on the environment. Plots were created to help
    further understand the behavior of discharge nitrate and nitrite. Results Vegetation
    Classification Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13 display seasonal NDVI maps for Ohio,
    selected from 365 daily NDVI maps generated in 2019. The maps showcase the seasonal
    variations in vegetation greenness across the state, with each map showing winter,
    spring, summer, and fall. The seasonal NDVI maps reveal a distinct shift in vegetation
    density between seasons. Fig. 26 Maximum occurrence of sand, silt, or clay in
    Ohio at 0–200 cm depth Full size image Crop Monitoring Figures 14, 15, 16, 17,
    18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 demonstrate the ability of MODIS NDVI time series data
    to distinguish the seasonal growth patterns of corn and soybeans in Ohio. The
    NDVI maps shown for each crop are selected from 365 daily NDVI maps generated
    in 2019, with one map displayed per season. The profiles reveal similar growth
    trajectories for corn and soybeans, peaking in the summer. Soil Analysis Soil
    Types Figures 23, 24, 25, and 26 verify higher silt/clay soil content in northwest
    Ohio compared to predominantly sandy fractions in other parts of the state, as
    revealed by the soil type classification maps. Soil Physical Properties The maps
    in Figs. 27 and 28 showcase the soil physical properties of water holding capacity
    and texture in Ohio. Lower moisture storage is evident in the northwestern region,
    while moderate capacity is seen elsewhere. Soil texture appears finer towards
    Lake Erie and coarser in southern Ohio. Soil Chemical Properties Figures 29, 31,
    and 30 show the maps of soil pH, organic carbon, and nitrogen levels in Ohio,
    revealing distinct spatial patterns. Soil pH is higher in northwestern Ohio and
    lower in the southeast. Organic carbon content is elevated in eastern Ohio. Soil
    nitrogen distributions match vegetation density, with higher levels in northwestern
    Ohio near Lake Erie and the Maumee watershed. Fig. 27 Soil water holding capacity

    maps between soil nitrogen and crop NDVI are presented, with one map selected

    positive relationships between soil nitrogen content and crop health and greenness
    for corn and soybeans in Ohio. One Time-Stamp Correlation In Figs. 34 and 35,
    spatial correlation maps illustrate the relationships between soil nitrogen and
    factors, including organic carbon and pH levels in Ohio at a single point in time.
    The organic carbon correlation analysis shows the expected positive association
    with soil nitrogen content, while the pH correlation is negative. Fig. 33 Correlation

    Figures 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43 display the seasonal variation of different
    water features in Ohio in 2019. More specifically, nitrate, nitrite, and discharge
    were analyzed in relation to the stream networks extracted from the digital elevation
    model discussed in Section 2.2. Fig. 40 Winter: Seasonal variation of discharge
    across Ohio in 2019 Full size image Fig. 41 Spring: Seasonal variation of discharge
    across Ohio in 2019 Full size image Fig. 42 Summer: Seasonal variation of discharge
    across Ohio in 2019 Full size image Concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were
    grouped into four categories: less than 4 mg/L representing the baseline amount
    of nitrate and nitrite expected in water (normal), 4–7 mg/L representing above-normal
    concentrations (high), 7–10 mg/L representing concentrations approaching toxic
    levels and may need close monitoring (warning), and greater than 10 mg/L representing
    toxic levels of nitrate and nitrite that can lead to health problems (toxic).
    A numerical summary of the nitrate and nitrite concentrations by season can be
    seen in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4. Toxic levels of nitrate and nitrite were seen in
    winter, spring, and fall, with the most sites in the toxic range present in the
    fall in the lower west. Fall also had the highest concentrations of nitrate and
    nitrite at 22.99 mg/L (Table 4). Fig. 43 Fall: Seasonal variation of discharge

    Full size table Figures 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43 also display discharge
    per season. Visually and based on Table 5, winter had the highest discharge, while
    fall had the lowest amount of discharge on average. Between winter, summer, and
    fall, the locations with the greatest discharge were in relatively the same locations,
    such as the southwestern and northeastern parts of Ohio. Discharge had a bimodal
    distribution early in the year, with the highest peak occurring in February and
    the second peak occurring in May, according to Fig. 44, while nitrate and nitrite
    concentrations were stable during that period (Fig. 45). Nitrate and nitrite concentrations
    peaked later in the year, around late October, while discharge was stable during
    this time. Discussion Interpretation of Vegetation Classification Results The
    vegetation classification results in Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13 provide an informative
    baseline characterization of seasonal variations in vegetation density across
    Ohio in 2019 using MODIS NDVI. As noted by Huang et al. (2021), NDVI is widely
    used to examine vegetation patterns and dynamics across large regions. Aligning
    with previous studies DeFries and Townshend (1994); Pettorelli et al. (2005),
    our results show NDVI’s capability to capture phenological shifts corresponding
    to the state’s seasonal weather and temperature patterns. The lower winter NDVI
    values in Ohio likely reflect colder temperatures inhibiting plant growth, consistent
    with prior work showing sparser canopy cover in temperate regions during cold
    periods Chen et al. (2004); Jenkins et al. (2007). Overall, these baseline vegetation
    maps validate the use of MODIS NDVI time series for delineating regional and seasonal
    distinctions in vegetation density and phenology, consistent with previous studies
    DeFries and Townshend (1994); Dragoni and Rahman (2012). The results establish
    an informative foundation for future crop monitoring, climate change, or land
    cover change analysis across these major agricultural states. Implications of
    Crop Monitoring Results The crop-specific temporal monitoring results in Sect.
    4.2 and Figs. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 provide valuable insights
    into the growth profiles and phenological patterns of key crops in Ohio during
    2019. The distinct seasonal NDVI signatures exhibited by corn and soybean in Ohio
    (Figs. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21) demonstrate MODIS data’s potential
    for capturing crop-specific growth stages and phenology, an essential application
    as noted by prior research Dragoni et al. (2011); Lu and Zhuang (2010). Corn displayed
    vigorous NDVI growth from June through September, aligning with its typical summer
    cultivation period Suyker and Verma (2012). Soybeans also showed more moderate
    NDVI increases during June-September, corresponding to their growth cycle Setiyono
    et al. (2007); Bradley et al. (2007). Studies have validated the use of MODIS
    NDVI for monitoring corn and soybean development across the Midwest, including
    Ohio Sakamoto et al. (2010); Zhong et al. (2016); Wardlow et al. (2007). The higher
    winter crop NDVI in northern Ohio likely reflects the concentrated summer growing
    period enabled by a shorter temperate season, while the warmer climate in southern
    Ohio allows for a longer cultivation period and summer crop planting Hatfield
    et al. (2014). Regional variations in climate and growing season length underpin
    these geographic crop patterns within the state. In conclusion, the white regions
    evident in the crop monitoring maps show locations where those particular crops
    are not grown, aligning with known regional agricultural distributions. The crop
    monitoring results across Ohio underscore MODIS NDVI data’s capability to capture
    regional variations in crop phenology and development patterns Ko et al. (2009);
    Piccinni et al. (2009); Abedinpour (2015). The distinct temporal signatures enable
    differentiation between crops within a state based on their geography-specific
    growing seasons and climate suitability. These findings highlight the potential
    of MODIS time series for scalable vegetation monitoring and classification in
    agricultural regions. Applications could aid crop type mapping, growth stage modeling,
    and yield prediction at state and national scales to support food security assessments.
    However, validation with higher-resolution data would be required to translate
    these methods to field-level precision agriculture. Significance of Soil Analysis
    Findings Soil Types The soil type classification maps depicted in Figs. 23, 24,
    25, and 26 validate and further explain the established patterns of soil texture
    variations throughout Ohio Subburayalu et al. (2014). Northwestern Ohio, with
    its pronounced silt and clay content, has fine-textured soils that trace back
    to their origins as glacial lacustrine deposits Conrey (1941); Easterly (1964).
    Conversely, sandy soils dominate a significant portion of the state, a reflection
    of the coarser alluvial, glaciofluvial, and loess (a type of very fine-grain,
    windblown sediment) parent materials present in these regions. Prior work has
    mapped such geographic distinctions in soil texture at the state scale using digital
    soil data. Previous studies have delineated these distinctions in soil texture
    at the state’s scale using digital soil data Arshad et al. (1997); Mallah et al.
    (2022) and have underscored the pivotal role of soil composition in agricultural
    land management Lindbo et al. (2012). These maps provide an updated baseline understanding
    of soil textural patterns relevant to crop planning and other applications. Soil
    Physical Properties The reduced water retention observed in sections of northwestern
    Ohio, as illustrated in Figs. 27 and 28, is because of the presence of coarser
    sandy soils. These soils are associated with the glacial beach ridge deposits
    found along Lake Erie Conrey (1941); Easterly (1964). Research shows that coarse-textured
    soils tend to have reduced moisture retention capabilities Subburayalu et al.
    (2014). Concurrently, the higher surface soil texture in this area is associated
    with a greater silt-clay content. This composition provides structural stability
    and fertility, which are crucial for agricultural practices Arshad et al. (1997);
    Extension (2023); Saxton and Rawls (2006). However, the medium-textured soils
    across much of Ohio provide favorable physical conditions for crop cultivation,
    as underscored by the state’s ranking among national leaders in corn and soybean
    production USDA (2022). Soil Chemical Properties The observed geographic patterns
    in key soil chemical properties, including nitrogen, organic carbon, and pH (Figs.
    29, 30, and 31) agree with documented spatial distributions attributed to environmental
    factors. Soil nitrogen levels often correspond to fertilizer inputs and land management,
    with croplands showing elevated concentrations Jarecki and Lal (2005). Soil organic
    carbon relates to vegetation, parent material, and climate Jung and Lal (2011).
    Regional soil pH is influenced by native vegetation, drainage, and other soil-forming
    factors Beery and Wilding (1971). Notably, northwestern Ohio exhibits high soil
    nitrogen content that implicates multiple interconnected factors. The intensive
    corn and soybean agriculture provides abundant nitrogen inputs, while flat topography
    and prevalent tile drainage facilitate nitrogen transport from fields Michalak
    et al. (2013); Smith et al. (2015). Coarser sandy soils with lower organic matter
    offer reduced natural nitrogen retention Heathwaite et al. (2000); Mohammadpour
    and Grady (2023). Freeze-thaw cycles may speed up nitrogen release and nitrate
    leaching Fouli et al. (2013). Climate patterns driving Lake Erie’s hypoxia relate
    to soil nitrogen accumulation Bosch et al. (2013). The heightened levels of nitrogen
    observed in the Maumee River watershed hold a critical implication. They hint
    at the presence of significant nitrogen reservoirs that possess the potential
    to be mobilized, ultimately finding their way into the intricate network of rivers
    and, ultimately, into Lake Erie Scavia et al. (2014). The relevance of this observation
    gains clarity when considering two crucial aspects of soil composition and behavior.
    First, the indication of lower organic carbon content carries the implication
    of diminished capacity for nutrient retention. In this context, it implies that
    soils with lower organic carbon content are less effective at holding onto essential
    elements like nitrogen, thus facilitating their movement through the landscape.
    Second, the interactions delineated within soil pH relationships elucidate another
    dimension: the potential for nitrogen volatilization losses Malhi and Nyborg (1991).
    This signifies that variations in soil pH can trigger the release of nitrogen
    compounds into the air, a process that subsequently contributes to the departure
    of nitrogen from the soil ecosystem. Unveiling this nexus provides a crucial link
    between soil dynamics and the larger ecological context, particularly in relation
    to Lake Erie. The amalgamation of heightened nitrogen concentrations diminished
    retention capacity due to lower organic carbon, and the potential for nitrogen
    loss through volatilization points to a pathway through which the elevated nitrogen
    in the Maumee River watershed could impact Lake Erie’s ecosystem Ai et al. (2023).
    Relating the soil data to hydrologic pathways could help quantify nitrogen fluxes
    from vulnerable fields into Lake Erie. This could inform conservation practices
    targeting key areas. In summary, these soil chemical maps establish an informative
    baseline understanding of nutrient status and environmental impacts. They offer
    insights into spatial factors influencing nitrogen availability and transport
    risks. Discussion of Spatial Correlation Results The spatial correlation analysis
    in Sect. 4.4 offers valuable insights into the relationships between soil factors
    and crop growth by harnessing the multi-source integrated geospatial data. The
    spatiotemporal crop NDVI-nitrogen correlation maps reveal positive Pearson correlation
    coefficients ranging from 0.3 to 0.8, showing locations where higher NDVI is associated
    with higher soil nitrogen content. The organic carbon-nitrogen correlation analysis
    shows strong positive coefficients between 0.6 and 0.9, reflecting the link between
    soil organic matter and nitrogen supply. Meanwhile, the pH-nitrogen correlation
    exhibits negative coefficients from \\(-\\)0.5 to \\(-\\)0.8, corresponding to
    reduced nitrogen availability in acidic soils. The correlation analysis provides
    valuable insights into the complex relationships between soil fertility, crop
    growth, and associated water quality impacts. The crop-nitrogen correlations suggest
    field-specific interventions could optimize plant nutrition based on soil nitrogen
    content mapped across space and time. For instance, variable-rate nitrogen fertilizer
    applications could target areas with lower soil nitrogen availability within fields
    to promote vigorous crop growth. Temporal Correlation Analysis The spatiotemporal
    crop NDVI-nitrogen correlation maps (Figs. 32 and 33), provide valuable insights
    into the evolution of soil nitrogen-crop relationships over the growing season.
    The positive correlation values show locations where higher NDVI is associated
    with higher soil nitrogen content, representing a positive relationship between
    crop greenness and soil fertility. Meanwhile, negative values correspond to areas
    where higher NDVI coincides with lower soil nitrogen content, indicative of an
    inverse relationship between the two layers. The correlation coefficients denote
    the strength of these relationships, with values closer to -1 or 1 representing
    stronger correlations. As documented in prior studies, adequate soil nitrogen
    availability promotes vegetation growth and crop yields Johnson and Raun (2003).
    The positive correlations observed across the season validate this fundamental
    connection between soil nitrogen stores and crop vigor. However, the strength
    of the correlations varied over time, with the highest correlations evident during
    the peak summer months. This aligns with the crop growth stages, as corn and soybeans
    have the greatest nitrogen requirements later in the season when rapid biomass
    accumulation occurs Tremblay et al. (2012); Russell (1973); Shahandeh et al. (2005).
    Capturing this temporal variability provides nuanced insights into the nonlinear,
    dynamic nature of crop-soil nitrogen linkages over the cropping cycle. One Time-Stamp
    Correlation Analysis The spatial correlation maps at a single point in time (Figs.
    34 and 35) further explain relationships among key soil properties. As expected,
    soil organic carbon exhibited a strong positive correlation with total nitrogen,
    as soil organic matter contains nitrogen that is mineralized into plant-available
    forms through microbial decomposition Liptzin et al. (2022). Notably, higher soil
    carbon in eastern Ohio (Fig. 30), likely increased organic nitrogen reserves that
    slowly mineralize to support crop productivity Wang et al. (2017). This aligns
    with the positive carbon-nitrogen correlation, suggesting a stable soil nitrogen
    supply in high-carbon areas. In contrast, the negative pH-nitrogen correlation
    corresponds to chemical losses in acidic soils. Lower pH in northwestern Ohio
    (Fig. 29), promotes nitrogen leaching and volatilization, reducing availability
    Russell (1973); Ding et al. (2014). This suggests manure pH change could optimize
    nitrogen retention in acidic soils Guo et al. (2016). This implies greater nitrogen
    loss risks that could impact downstream water quality. Adjusting manure pH could
    optimize retention in sensitive areas. Meanwhile, the soil carbon-nitrogen links
    show manure or compost additions to low-carbon soils could improve organic nitrogen
    retention and prevent losses. The soil pH patterns underscore the need for better
    management of acidic soils to reduce nitrogen leaching and volatilization losses.
    Relating these findings to hydrologic pathways could help model downstream nitrogen
    delivery and prioritize conservation efforts in critical source areas. Overall,
    these spatial relationships provide a nuanced biogeochemical-carbon perspective
    that could inform agricultural best practices. The integrated methodology could
    be applied to additional regions to model soil-crop interactions and forecast
    water quality outcomes under various climate and land management scenarios. This
    systems-level understanding will become increasingly valuable for tackling the
    complex sustainability challenges associated with food production. Discussion
    of Water Feature Analysis Figures 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43 show the
    spatial relationship of nitrate and nitrite and discharge in 2019 across four
    seasons in Ohio. The highest concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were seen in
    the fall, with 7% of the gauges reporting toxic levels (>10 mg/L) coming from
    southwest Ohio. Prime farmlands are in the west of Ohio. The watershed draining
    into the river can carry water from these farmlands and also the urban area adjacent
    to the Great Miami River. Given this, the observed increase in nitrate and nitrite
    could be because of sewage and fertilizer, the two main causes of the increase
    in nitrate and nitrite levels in water Service et al. (1997); Dubrovsky and Hamilton
    (2010). Plant growth during the spring and summer months involves increased uptake
    of nutrients, which are later released back into the environment once plants reach
    the end of their life cycle. In addition, water runoff from the post-harvested
    field may also contribute to an increase in nitrate and nitrite levels Gale et
    al. (2006). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) can contribute to higher nutrient
    concentrations Zouboulis and Tolkou (2015). A preliminary investigation into the
    surroundings of some gauges that reported toxic and non-toxic levels of nitrate
    and nitrite shows toxic gauges are almost always near WWTPs. A more systematic
    investigation is required to quantify their contribution to nitrate and nitrite
    concentrations. Lastly, some gauges displaying high nitrate and nitrite concentrations
    are along the same river, showing that a specific watershed in the southwest may
    need closer inspection. Discharge was found to increase in the winter, spring,
    and summer months, with the highest values found in the winter. This could be
    attributed to snowmelt and precipitation during these months Van Metre et al.
    (2016). It is also noted that the discharge was higher in some sites irrespective
    of the seasons (Figs. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43). This could be attributed
    to the presence of dams Liu et al. (2014). Figures 44 and 45 highlight the relationship
    between discharge and nitrate and nitrite during 2019. A notable pattern is present
    where lower discharge corresponds to higher nitrate and nitrite concentrations.
    This is a known behavior reflecting the settlement of nutrients due to lower flow
    rates in streams. The spatiotemporal patterns within and between nitrate and nitrite
    and discharge reflect potential avenues to explore how other additional features,
    such as agricultural land use and soil types, can be integrated to further understand
    the behavior of nutrient flow. Conclusion This research shows the significant
    potential of leveraging publicly available geospatial data through an integrated
    spatiotemporal analysis framework. Synthesizing multi-source satellite, crop,
    soil, and hydrological measurements revealed intricate connections between agricultural
    productivity, soil fertility dynamics, and nutrient loss risks. The multi-faceted
    perspective attained via advanced data fusion and analytic techniques provided
    actionable insights to guide sustainable agricultural management practices and
    environmental policy decisions. Quantifying complex relationships through correlation
    analysis offered valuable perspectives. While moderate-resolution data sufficiently
    characterizes regional crop growth and soil patterns, high-resolution data could
    enable field-scale monitoring and personalized interventions. Expanding the geographic
    scope across more agriculturally significant areas would provide broader contextual
    insights. Incorporating longer-term records alongside weather, climate, management,
    and socioeconomic data would further inform the analysis of seasonal variability
    and drivers. Transitioning such integrated platforms into operational use for
    stakeholders would multiply their impact. Enhanced computing capabilities, along
    with interactive data visualization and modeling tools, could empower dynamic
    exploratory analysis. Machine learning methods could extract deeper insights from
    multiplying data streams. This work makes key contributions through the novel
    integration of multi-modal geospatial data and advanced spatiotemporal techniques.
    The methodology provides a foundation to guide sustainable agricultural practices
    and environmental monitoring. If transitioned into predictive modeling and tools
    for stakeholders, the approach could support critical decision-making. The framework
    offers a unique holistic perspective by linking crop, soil, and water dynamics
    using advance spatiotemporal integration approach and Distributed High-Performance
    Computing. As data availability and analytical capabilities continue advancing,
    such holistic approaches will become increasingly vital for ensuring productivity,
    sustainability, and resilience for agricultural systems. Supplementary Information

    Land managementMachine-learning techniquesSentinel-2 1. Introduction Different
    land use land cover (LULC) types have varying effects on earth-atmospheric processes
    (Horne et al., 2017). For example, urbanization, characterized by the extensive
    development of impervious surfaces like buildings, roads, and concrete areas,
    directly impacts water quality by introducing harmful materials that become incorporated
    into surface runoff, thereby contributing to water quality degradation (Cheng
    et al., 2022). On the other hand, agricultural activities also have a major influence
    on surface water quality, due to the extensive use of fertilizers and chemicals,
    which become major pollutants, (Cheng et al., 2022). In addition, LULC changes
    also influence land degradation. For example, the changes from grasslands to bare
    promote soil loss through erosion, thereby leading to the deterioration of soil
    quality. Similarly, soil erosion results in river sedimentation, thereby reducing
    the capacity of the rivers to hold water. This affect water availability. The
    impacts of LULC changes on surface water quality have been extensively studied
    over the years (Cheng et al., 2022; Namugize et al., 2018a, 2018b; Ighalo et al.,
    2021; Park and Lee, 2020). Different land use and cover types have varying effect
    on water quality, due to local topographical and climatic variations. For example,
    Cheng et al. (2022) provide a detailed review of the relationship between varying
    land use land cover on water quality. Overall, the review noted that land use
    change affects various ecological preprocess, surface run-off, infiltration which
    in turn affect water quality. In a recent study, Baltodano et al. (2022) reported
    relationship between urban expansion for the Katari River Basin in the Bolivian
    Andes and chlorophyl and turbidity, for Lake Titicaca in South America, using
    remote sensing, field-based water quality assessment and water indices. In another
    study, Gorgoglione et al. (2020) assessed the relationship between LULC and water
    quality in the Santa Lucía catchment of Uruguay, in South America. The findings
    indicated a strong correlation between total phosphorus concentration and agriculture-land,
    high corelation between nitrogen and urban-land use, as well as inverse correlation
    between total phosphorus concentration and forest-land use. The application of
    remote sensing techniques for LULC monitoring and change detection remains a critical
    issue (Yuh et al., 2023). Remotely sensed data allows for the extraction of high-resolution,
    multispectral information covering large inaccessible areas in real-time, making
    the process more cost-effective and time efficient (Yuh et al., 2023; Mhanna et
    al., 2023). These techniques enable the mapping of land cover changes and provide
    insights into their influence on various earth-atmospheric processes (Butt et
    al., 2015). Moreover, this information is crucial for developing strategies for
    spatial planning, utilization, and conservation of vital land resources to accommodate
    the exponential growth of human populations and address increasing land degradation.
    Traditional approaches remain time-consuming, expensive, and lacked updated information
    on the dynamics of various LULC patterns (Phiri et al., 2020; Yuh et al., 2023).
    On the other hand, advancements in remote sensing technologies, such as the launch
    of Sentinel-2 in 2015, have revolutionized LULC monitoring. Sentinel-2, with its
    multispectral capabilities, high spatial and temporal resolution, and the availability
    of timely and free access data over large-scale areas, has significantly enhanced
    the monitoring of land use land cover (Phiri et al., 2020). In addition, the use
    of advanced machine learning techniques is gaining popularity in image classification
    using remotely sensed data for LULC change analysis ((Yuh et al., 2023; Talukdar
    et al., 2020). For example, Random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM),
    have shown great potential in LULC detection and mapping over time (Jamali 2021;
    Yuh et al., 2023; Phiri et al., 2020). For example, Jamali (2020) proved the potential
    of RF and SVM with deep learning techniques and Landsat 8 in mapping land cover
    types in the Shiraz city of Iran for the 18th of August 2022. Findings reported
    that all machine learning performed well with accuracies above 98 % and the use
    of deep learning was reliable when Landsat 8 was used at 15m spatial resolution,
    compared to 30m. Similarly, Jamali (2021) used Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper
    (ETM) and Landsat 8, to compare K-nearest Neighbour (KNN), SVM, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and RF in detecting LULC changes for November 2000 and November
    2020, in Cameroon. All the machine learning produced accuracies above 80 %. Although
    LULC mapping is has been conducted using remote sensing, the seasonal changes
    at catchment scale have received limited attention. Thus, most LULC change focuses
    on longer time such as 20 years (e.g., Yuh et al., 2023, Jamali, 2021). This has
    not been possible due to the use of medium spatial resolution sensor, such as
    Landsat (e.g., Mhanna et al., 2023; Obeidat et al., 2019), as well as low spatial
    resolution sensors, such as MODIS (e.g., García-Mora et al., 2012; Mhanna et al.,
    2023) and AVHRR. García-Mora et al. (2012) provide a detailed review of application
    of MODIS for LULC mapping, including its limitations. These datasets have been
    reported to fail to detect LULC changes within short times, such as on annual
    or seasonal basis. However, the availability of Sentinel 2 and advanced machine
    classification techniques allows for a better detection and mapping of LULC changes
    at short intervals. In this regard, this study evaluated the effectiveness of
    Sentinel 2 multispectral remote sensing in mapping and detecting changes in LULC
    within the Heuningnes catchment in South Africa. In addition, the study assessed
    the rainfall and temperature variations during the period of study to see if there
    are any links with LULC changes. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The
    study was conducted in the Heuningnes catchment, located in the Overberg District
    of the Western Cape Province, South Africa (Fig. 1). The catchment encompasses
    an area of approximately 1,401 km2, including towns such as Bredasdorp, Napier,
    and Elim. Within the Heuningnes catchment, there are sub-catchments formed by
    the Droe, Kars, Poort, and Nuwejaars Rivers (Clark et al., 2015). The Nuwejaars
    River eventually flows into the Soetendalsvlei, which is 3 km wide and 8 km long
    (Mkunyana et al., 2019). The Heuningnes River, on the other hand, feeds into the
    Heuningnes River estuary, which extends over 19 km and encompasses 1,475 ha of
    open water along the South Coast (Estuarine and Plan, 2019). Two tributaries,
    the Kars River and the Nuwejaars River, join the river estuary. The topography
    of the catchment is described as mountainous in the upper reaches and gradually
    becomes flatter as it reaches the lower-lying areas near the coast. The sub-catchments
    within the Heuningnes catchment exhibit a mix of steep, flat, and undulating terrain.
    The geology of the region consists of shales and sandstones from the Table Mountain
    Group. The soil characteristics shallow, medium, and moderate sandy clay loams
    (Clark et al., 2015). The catchment experiences a Mediterranean climate and receives
    an average annual rainfall of about 450 mm along the coast and 650 mm inland along
    the foothills. Maximum temperatures reach 27 °C in January, while minimum temperatures
    occur in July and August, dropping to 8 °C. Download : Download high-res image

    images were used to assess the land use land cover in the Heuningnes catchment,
    Cape Agulhas, South Africa. Images were obtained from the USGS earth explorer
    website (https://www.usgs.gov), and represented the period between July 2017 and
    July 2018, as well as October 2017 and March 2018, covering the wet and dry periods,
    respectively. Images were selected with a 10 % less cloud coverage. Table 1 displays

    Studies (IWS) to observe rainfall and temperature variation across the Heuningnes
    catchment. LULC Rainfall and temperature have been reported to influence LULC
    changes (e.g., Mngube et al., 2020). In this regard, the study used the data to
    compare how it varies in relation to LULC changes. 2.4. Image pre-processing and
    classification These images were pre-processed in Quantum GIS, for atmospheric
    correction by applying the dark object subtraction (DOS1) correction tool, which
    considers and corrects shaded objects, and is an essential step in obtaining true
    colour of inland water bodies (Bi et al., 2018; Rumora et al., 2020). Atmospheric
    correction is vital as it ensures accuracy in classification results. Additionally,
    image segmentation was applied as pre-processing step for the preparation of the
    image classification. The segment means shift algorithm groups pixels of a similar
    spectral and spatial characteristic, to reduce noise effects, because of overlapping
    pixels causing inaccuracies within the final classification result. Furthermore,
    segmentation is the process of using similar smaller units together to produce
    larger regions, where different land cover classes can be discerned. Further processing
    was done in a GIS environment, where bands 5, 6, 7, 8a, 11 and 12 were resampled
    from a 20m resolution to a 10m resolution. The resampled bands were mosaicked
    resulting in a single complete image of the study area. For image classifications,
    five different land use classes were observed namely: surface waterbodies and
    streams; vegetation collective including indigenous, grasslands, invasive plants,
    and agricultural land; bare rock and soil; urban and other, which includes hill
    shade. Classifications was achieved by applying the supervised classification
    method, Support Vector Machine (SVM). As stated by (Rudrapal, 2015), SVM can function
    regardless of having a small training dataset, it is less prone to noise and continues
    to produce accurate results. For preparation of SVM, training samples were prepared
    by creating polygon signatures where a class is assigned to pixels representing
    the various land use land cover classes. 2.5. Accuracy assessments Accuracy assessments
    was done to evaluate the accuracy of image classifications. Datasets used were
    acquired through digitization in Google Earth Pro. A total of 350 points were
    created in Google Earth Pro, with 70 points per class. An error matrix was created,
    to demonstrate the classified pixels against the reference pixels. These reference
    points were compared to the classified image to see whether there is correspondence
    between them. The accuracy assessments measurements used were the overall accuracy
    (OA), user''s accuracy (UA), producer''s accuracy (PA), and Kappa coefficient
    (Kc). The producer accuracy refers to the correctly classified pixels for each
    class, in relation to the total reference points created for each class and indicates;
    whereas user accuracy represents the correctly classified pixels proportionate
    to validated points for each class (Tselka et al., 2023). The overall accuracy
    refers to the number of correctly classified pixels proportionate to the incorrectly
    classified pixels, whereas the kappa statistic represents the overall agreement
    of the classification technique (Olofsson et al., 2013; Rwanga and Ndambuki, 2017;
    Zhen et al., 2013). Accuracy assessment equations are presented in Table 2. Table

    97 % and user accuracies ranged between 52 % and 96 %, for the wet season. For
    the dry seasons, October 2017 and March 2018, the overall accuracy ranges between
    55 % and 66 %, with kappa coefficients of 0.43 and 0.58 respectively. The different
    LULC classes had producer accuracies, ranging between 0 % for vegetation in October
    2017, and 100 % for other classes, whereas the user accuracies ranged between
    40 % for urban areas and 96 % for other LULC. Table 3. Accuracy assessment results

    March 2018. Fig. 4 further highlights the area coverage for the different LULC
    types, within the catchment. Vegetation was the dominant land cover class, with
    a total of 77 % coverage in July 2017. October 2017 holds the lowest vegetation
    cover of 33 %. For 2018, March had the highest water coverage of 12 %, and October
    2017, the lowest water coverage with only 1 %. Urban and other, has a 29 % and
    35 % coverage respectively, and was recorded as the period with the highest urban
    and other land cover. These land cover types are predominantly along the western
    part of the catchment, and along the coast, for October 2017. The other land cover
    type is predominantly present within the mountain range area, at the centre of
    the catchment, as most of the other land cover type consists of hill shade effects.
    In March 2018 and July 2018, bare rock and soil has increased from 2 % in October
    2017, to 17 % in March 2018 and then a further increased to 18 % in July 2018.

    Fig. 5. Climate variations for 2017 and 2018 across the study catchment. 4. Discussion
    The primary objective of this study was to determine seasonal land use land cover
    changes within the Heuningnes Catchment in Cape Agulhas, South Africa. The analysis
    was conducted during both the wet season (July 2017 and July 2018) and the dry
    season (October 2017 and March 2018). The results revealed that the wet seasons
    exhibited the highest percentage of vegetation cover. This could be expected,
    as the climatic conditions, such as rainfall and temperature during the wet season
    promote vegetation regrowth, health and expansion. The study by. The spatial distribution
    maps have shown that vegetation class was the most dominant across the catchment
    covering approximately 77 % of the study area in July 2017, which is the wet season,
    whereas the lowest areal coverage of vegetation was detected in October 2017,
    covering only 33 % of the study area. The vegetation class comprise both agricultural
    and natural vegetation. Previous studies have reported different vegetation classes
    within the catchment including plantations, invasive species and farms (e.g.,
    Mtengwana et al., 2020; Shoko et al., 2020; Mtengwana et al., 2021). In this regard,
    the changes in vegetation greenness and farming activities between the wet and
    dry seasons results in a reduction in the area covered by vegetation. For example,
    natural vegetation might shed their leaves, and farms cleared, thereby appearing
    bare or classified as other. It was observed that water bodies are quite limited
    within the study area, only covering up to 12 %. For the wet seasons, July 2017
    and July 2018, the overall accuracy is 75 %, with a kappa coefficient of 0.69.
    According to (Rwanga and Ndambuki, 2017), this kappa value indicates a substantial
    level of agreement, within the SVM classification algorithm used. For the dry
    seasons, October 2017 and March 2018, the overall accuracy ranges between 55 %
    and 66 %, with kappa coefficients of 0.43 and 0.58 respectively, indicating moderate
    level agreement (Rwanga and Ndambuki, 2017). Therefore, the classification during
    the dry period resulted in lower accuracies compared to the wet season. Classification
    results during the dry season can be influenced by various factors. One common
    error observed in the classification results was the occurrence of mixed pixels,
    particularly between waterbodies and vegetation cover, which was prominent in
    the Voelvlei and Soetendalsvlei areas. To address this issue, an object-based
    classification technique, such as image segmentation, was applied. Image segmentation
    involves aggregating spectrally similar objects into specific classes, helping
    to correct the error of mixed pixels (Y. Chen et al., 2018). Also, the spatial
    resolution of the satellite used also result in mixed pixel problems (Foody, 2008).
    The classification results for October 2017 indicated an overestimation of urban
    areas and hill shade, with 100 % producer''s accuracy, while no pixels were classified
    as vegetation, resulting in a user''s accuracy of 69 %. In March 2018, waterbodies
    within the catchment appeared to be overclassified. The use of support vector
    machine (SVM) for land cover mapping proved to be more suitable compared to other
    classification algorithms such as maximum likelihood classification. SVM does
    not assume normal distribution of data and can accommodate a wider range of values,
    allowing for better representation of land cover classes. Moreover, SVM achieves
    accurate results even with smaller training sets (Kang et al., 2018). The overall
    classification accuracy using SVM ranged between 55 % and 75 %, with kappa coefficients
    ranging between 43 % and 69 % for the period from July 2017 to July 2018. However,
    it is important to note that the overclassification error observed could be attributed
    to the image segmentation technique employed, as the algorithm may result in over-segmentation
    with low spatial resolution images and under-segmentation with high-resolution
    images (Y. Chen et al., 2018; Liu and Xia, 2010). The use of Sentinel 2 also proves
    its potential in detecting LULC on an annual basis. This allows the detection
    of seasonal, intra-annual, annual changes in LULC. This provides basis for future
    studies to focus at local scale on a seasonal basis. Previous studies have also
    provided the potential of Sentinel 2 to identify, detecting and mapping various
    land use land cover, and specific vegetation species, within the present catchment
    (Chiloane et al., 2023; Mtengwana et al., 2020, 2021; Shoko et al., 2020), as
    well as beyond (Mishra et al., 2020; Akyürek et al., 2018). In these studies2,
    Sentinel proved more beneficial in detecting LULC patterns. One of the key benefits
    of Sentinel 2 is the accessibility of data, particularly for developing countries,
    due to the economic advantages of the Sentinel-2 mission. Sentinel-2''s red-edge
    band 5 is useful for mapping various LULC. The availability of high-resolution
    and timely data from Sentinel-2 enables the monitoring of dynamic environmental
    changes over large areas (Astola et al., 2019; Phiri et al., 2020). 4.1. Implications
    of the study on land and water resources management The application of a suitable
    image classification algorithm for land use land cover analysis in the Heuningnes
    Catchment has significant implications for water security, the achievement of
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and community livelihoods. Accurate land
    cover mapping provides valuable information on the distribution and extent of
    vegetation, waterbodies, and urban areas, which are crucial components for assessing
    water resources and their availability for human needs, agriculture, and ecosystem
    health. Water security, as a fundamental aspect of sustainable development, relies
    on effective management and conservation of water resources. By accurately mapping
    land cover and detecting changes over time, decision-makers can assess the impact
    of land use practices, such as irrigation and urban expansion, on water availability
    and quality. This information enables the formulation and implementation of targeted
    strategies for water resource management, ensuring sustainable water use, reducing
    water stress, and improving resilience to water-related challenges. Furthermore,
    the findings of the study have direct relevance to several SDGs, including Goal
    6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and Goal 15 (Life on Land). Accurate land cover
    mapping supports the monitoring and evaluation of progress towards these goals
    by providing data on the status of water resources, urbanization patterns, and
    ecosystem integrity. It allows policymakers to identify areas at risk of land
    degradation, prioritize conservation efforts, and implement measures to enhance
    community livelihoods and ecosystem services. The integration of land cover information
    with water security, SDGs, and community livelihoods is essential for informed
    decision-making and sustainable development planning. The identification of appropriate
    image classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine, and the utilization
    of satellite data, such as Sentinel-2, contribute to improved land cover mapping
    accuracy, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the landscape and its implications
    for water resources, SDGs, and community well-being. By promoting effective land
    management practices and supporting the achievement of water-related targets within
    the SDGs, this research ultimately aims to enhance water security, foster sustainable
    development, and improve the livelihoods of local communities. 5. Conclusion In
    conclusion, this study demonstrated the successful application of Sentinel-2 data
    for land use land cover mapping in the Heuningnes Catchment, Cape Agulhas, South
    Africa, during the period of July 2017 to July 2018. The classification accuracies
    ranged from 55 % to 75 %, and the kappa coefficients ranged from 43 % to 69 %,
    using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. This technology offers valuable
    insights into the spatial patterns and trends of land use, allowing for better
    monitoring and management of natural resources in the Heuningnes Catchment and
    similar regions. However, there were a few limitations observed, such as mixed
    pixels between waterbodies and vegetation cover, as well as over-classification
    of hill shade and urban cover, the overall results highlight the potential of
    Sentinel-2 for retrieving high-resolution and timely information on the dynamic
    changes in land cover. Therefore, further research should be conducted to address
    and improve the misclassification between waterbodies, hillshade, and vegetation
    cover. Additionally, incorporating ancillary data, such as field measurements,
    could enhance the accuracy of land use land cover mapping. Furthermore, the application
    of Sentinel-2 data should be integrated into land management and planning strategies
    in the Heuningnes Catchment and other similar areas. This will enable policymakers
    and stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding land use, conservation efforts,
    and sustainable development. Regular monitoring using Sentinel-2 can provide valuable
    information on the impact of land cover changes on water resources, ecosystems,
    and biodiversity, facilitating the implementation of appropriate management practices
    and policies. By harnessing the capabilities of remote sensing technology, we
    can gain a comprehensive understanding of the changing landscape and work towards
    more sustainable and environmentally conscious land management practices. Declaration

  description: Uganda with its fragile ecosystem, large-scale human activities, and
    increasing population pressure, all of which combined, make this region increasingly
    susceptible to climate variation. This study examined the long-term trends of
    annual, seasonal, and monthly distributions of rainfall and temperature from 2001
    to 2021 together with crop-wise agricultural productivity. For the analysis, we
    obtained CHIRPS-V2.0 (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station
    Data version 2.0) rainfall, Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface
    Temperature (LST), DMSP nighttime lights, ESA land cover attribution, and international
    crop production assessment records. Subsequently, several non-parametric statistical
    applications were applied to check the long-term spatio-temporal trends of climate
    parameters and their inter-relationship at higher significance using the Google
    Earth Engine platform. The investigation reveals an annual increase in LST, averaging
    0.01 °C/year along with decreasing rainfall (1.89 mm/year). However, regional
    climate trends are largely elevation-dependent, which are predominantly subjected
    to the northern part of the study area witnessing a slight decrease in LST and
    thereby increased rainfall. Moreover, the long-term spatial nexus estimation divulges
    a potent inverse association between rainfall and temperature in the north and
    northeastern regions of the study area. Concurrently, changing patterns also have
    led to a decline in crop production and deterioration in water availability, which
    is accompanied by various other abnormalities, including the scarcity of water
    resources and anthropogenic activities. Changing climate has had significant implications
    on crop production, largely on corn and soybean as long-term shifts influence
    it in average rainfall and temperature, yearly fluctuations, and disturbances
    during various growth stages.

    Climate change has had an adverse impact on regional water resources and agricultural
    productivity. • Satellite data records and web-based remote sensing platform (GEE)
    provide ample scope to explore regional variability. • Anthropogenic improper
    activities have serious implications on regional water and crop availability.
    Abstract Uganda with its fragile ecosystem, large-scale human activities, and
    increasing population pressure, all of which combined, make this region increasingly
    susceptible to climate variation. This study examined the long-term trends of
    annual, seasonal, and monthly distributions of rainfall and temperature from 2001
    to 2021 together with crop-wise agricultural productivity. For the analysis, we
    obtained CHIRPS-V2.0 (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station
    Data version 2.0) rainfall, Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface
    Temperature (LST), DMSP nighttime lights, ESA land cover attribution, and international
    crop production assessment records. Subsequently, several non-parametric statistical
    applications were applied to check the long-term spatio-temporal trends of climate
    parameters and their inter-relationship at higher significance using the Google
    Earth Engine platform. The investigation reveals an annual increase in LST, averaging
    0.01 °C/year along with decreasing rainfall (1.89 mm/year). However, regional
    climate trends are largely elevation-dependent, which are predominantly subjected
    to the northern part of the study area witnessing a slight decrease in LST and
    thereby increased rainfall. Moreover, the long-term spatial nexus estimation divulges
    a potent inverse association between rainfall and temperature in the north and
    northeastern regions of the study area. Concurrently, changing patterns also have
    led to a decline in crop production and deterioration in water availability, which
    is accompanied by various other abnormalities, including the scarcity of water
    resources and anthropogenic activities. Changing climate has had significant implications
    on crop production, largely on corn and soybean as long-term shifts influence
    it in average rainfall and temperature, yearly fluctuations, and disturbances
    during various growth stages. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    Earth EngineUganda 1. Introduction Climate change is a global problem, considering
    its natural and human-induced effects on modifying regional biodiversity and ecological
    processes (Malakar et al., 2023). Since the Industrial Revolution, the planet''s
    average yearly temperature has been steadily rising (Mhlanga, 2023). Industrial
    and economic activities are causing high emissions of greenhouse gasses like carbon
    dioxide, methane, etc. Global warming and its resultant increase in environmental
    temperature is becoming a matter of concern due to the rising extreme events (Wani
    et al., 2023). The rising impact of climate change is already a massive challenge
    for the environment. Moreover, anthropogenic activities leading to the increase
    of greenhouse gasses are one of the major environmental concerns in recent decades,
    posing challenges to terrestrial ecosystems. The atmospheric composition, regional
    and global climatic settings, and changes in land use and land cover are all caused
    by human-induced disturbances. Temperature, precipitation, along with additional
    environmental factors are changing as a result of increasing levels of carbon
    dioxide in the atmosphere (Fernández-Raga et al., 2023). Water availability and
    runoff in the rivers and streams depend upon the trends and patterns of precipitation.
    Due to changes in precipitation patterns, modifications in runoff are observable,
    however, responses are regionally specific (Hamududu and Killingtveit, 2017).
    Climate uncertainties are also triggered by population growth, improper land utilization,
    and deforestation due to increasing trends of urbanization (Banerjee et al., 2023;
    Chen et al., 2015; Zamani et al., 2021). Although climate change knows no political
    boundaries, African countries are paying a high price for its impact - in terms
    of scarcity of water and food, and political and economic instability - despite
    being the least environmental polluters. Water and food shortages in Africa have
    already given rise to unrest and tensions which is an obstruction to achieving
    the UN''s sustainable development goals (Leal Filho et al., 2023). Most people
    in Africa rely on primary activities for their livelihood, agriculture being one
    of the most significant. Agriculture is heavily dependent on annual rainfall and
    is heavily affected by both flood and drought events. Variability in rainfall
    affects food production and is a challenge for food security in African nations.
    Furthermore, temperature variations have a minor influence on food security, although,
    are significant for the regional rainfall patterns across countries (Pickson and
    Boateng, 2022). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ((IPCC
    report 2021)), areas that experience poverty, poor governance, and inadequate
    access to essential resources and services are more vulnerable to the effects
    of climate change (Ahmad et al., 2022). Areas with climate-sensitive livelihood,
    violence, and conflict, are highly vulnerable to climate hazards, notably in Central
    and East Africa, and South Asia. Low and middle-income countries in Africa are
    the global hotspots for climate change impact (Atwoli et al., 2022). Over the
    last decades, almost all the regions in northern Africa have experienced a warming
    trend, which is more pronounced in the summer and with minimum temperatures (Donat
    et al., 2014). Since the 1970s, large parts of western Africa have witnessed a
    decrease in rainfall during the wet season along with winter-time drying (Hertig
    and Tramblay, 2017; Tramblay et al., 2013; Zittis, 2018), with the implication
    of increasing water scarcity and high population growth (Janpeter et al., 2020).
    Like most other African countries, Uganda''s economy is mainly dependent on agriculture,
    where the share of agriculture to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is 24.9% (Janpeter
    et al., 2020). Uganda''s agriculture is primarily rainfed (Zittis, 2018), where
    only 3% of agricultural croplands are under irrigation and the majority of crops
    are sensitive to water availability, thus climate change has an adverse impact
    (Sridharan et al., 2019). Rainfall patterns determine the agronomical practices
    such as time for sowing of crops, and water availability (Adhikari et al., 2015;
    McDowell et al., 2016), which in turn impacts fragile ecosystems like wetland
    regions (Gebrechorkos et al., 2019; Souverijns et al., 2016). Land use/land use
    cover influences water resource availability in inland valleys, wetlands, and
    catchments in East Africa and impacts hydrological processes (Waithaka et al.,
    2013). In addition, slight changes in seasonal rainfall occurrence can also shift
    the cropping pattern and productivity (Bwambale and Mourad, 2022). A series of
    previously published literature has reported a strong spatial relationship between
    climate parameters and regional crop productivity along with water resources as
    long-term rainfall and temperature dynamics collectively control water availability
    and demand for primary activities, resulting in irregular irrigation systems (Banerjee
    et al., 2023; Pathak et al., 2024). Large-scale global atmospheric circulations,
    changes in regional temperature, fluctuations in the Congo airmass, mainly in
    western Uganda, and increased sea surface temperature (SST) inclusively change
    properties of Hadley cell and equatorial trough, which are responsible for negative
    rainfall trends in Uganda during the biannual peaks (Jeremy E. Diem et al., 2019;
    Jury, 2018). The climate change dilemma and its negative impacts on the inhabitants
    of Uganda have been the subject of numerous studies. However, recent research
    is scarce concerning the uncertainty of climate and its connection to water resources
    and agricultural production at a local level in Uganda. The present study aims
    to investigate the long-term patterns and trends of rainfall and temperature across
    different time scales (annual, seasonal, and monthly) including evaluating their
    impact on water resources and crop productivity. The following objectives are
    identified: 1. To map the annual, seasonal, and monthly rainfall and temperature
    distributions and trends using high-resolution remotely sensed datasets. 2. To
    examine the spatio-temporal relation between rainfall and temperature together
    with the availability of local-level water resources and regional agricultural
    productivity. 3. To map anthropogenic activities and their adverse impact on climate
    uncertainty. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area Uganda is a landlocked country
    in Eastern Africa that shares borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo
    (DRC) to the west (Karamage et al., 2017), South Sudan to the north, Rwanda and
    Tanzania to the south, and Kenya to the east. It extends from 4°12′ N to 1°28′
    S latitude and 29°34′ E to 35°00′ E longitude (Fig. 1a). Elevation varies between
    580m and 4656m, with maximum elevation in the northeastern portion of the study
    domain (Fig. 1b). Climatologically, the country experiences a tropical and humid
    equatorial condition, which is further categorized by downpours, and thunderstorms
    in the afternoon. The weather of Uganda is influenced by its position and altitude
    along with other factors like the Indian monsoon, Congo air mass, Indian Ocean
    Dipole, and the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Moreover, the El-Nino
    Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a significant role in inter-annual rainfall
    variability (Yang et al., 2015). Average annual rainfall and temperature ranges
    between 900 mm and 1600 mm and 20–30 °C, respectively. Uganda has many lakes,
    such as Lake Victoria, Lake Edward, Lake George, Lake Kyoga, and Lake Albert (Bwire
    et al., 2020). Lake Victoria provides an indispensable source of water for agricultural
    practices and associated human demand (Fig. 1c). Socio-economically, this country
    developed swiftly over the last two decades by some 1.7% per year (24.7–47.4 million)
    between 2002 and 2021 and is projected to increase up to 58–61 million by 2030
    (Odongtoo et al., 2020b). This rapidly increasing population trend is crucial
    for regional environmental management, social services, water demand, improper
    land utilization, and enhanced climate risk (Ezeribe et al., 2012; Sridharan et
    al., 2019). Additionally, increased population pressures and unregulated urbanization
    trends are leading to land degradation and thereby intensification of flood occurrences
    (Odongtoo et al., 2020a). In the last two decades, the country has witnessed five
    major landslide events, 20 floods, and nine droughts, which resulted in 20000
    deaths and huge economic losses (Oyebola et al., 2021). Collectively, it is identically
    important to illustrate the regional scenario of climate dynamics and associated
    socio-economic status by managing future water resources and agricultural practices.

    Dataset To carry out the present study several satellite images together with
    a reanalysis dataset were utilized to estimate long-term climate dynamics in the
    study area (Table 1). To estimate annual, seasonal, and monthly surface temperature,
    the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) LST (Land Surface Temperature)
    dataset was employed with less than 10% cloud cover along with CHIRPS-V2.0 (Climate
    Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data version 2.0) reanalysis
    data by employing ‘CFmask’ cloud removal algorithm for measuring spatio-temporal
    rainfall distributions and trends with higher spatial accuracy and less systematic
    bias along with regional orographic effects (Banerjee et al., 2020; Ngoma et al.,
    2021). Moreover, this CHIRPS V2 reanalysis precipitation product was mainly produced
    in African countries with five selected regional climate models (RCMs), and several
    in-situ observations collectively provide high-quality gridded precipitation information
    with less bias (Funk et al., 2015). Subsequently, the high-resolution night-time
    light dataset was also taken to display spatio-temporal distributions and trends
    of urban agglomeration and human-induced land alterations after replacing the
    cloudy images with zero values (Sengupta et al., 2019). Additionally, the global
    projected gridded population dataset at 100m spatial resolution was obtained using
    GEE (Google Earth Engine) (Sorichetta et al., 2015). Moreover, to check the agricultural
    productivity, region-wise yearly crop production data of Uganda was taken from
    the International Production Assessment Division from 2012 to 2023. Subsequently,
    The European Space Agency (ESA) World-Cover data product was obtained to illustrate
    the land cover distribution of 2021 at 10m spatial resolution, which was prepared
    using Sentinel-1 and 2 (Chaaban et al., 2022). This dataset provides a total of
    11 land cover classes, which have been generated for the ESA (European Space Agency)
    WorldCover project as part of the 5th Earth Observation Envelope Programme (EOEP-5)
    of the ESA. Table 1. Datasets used for this study from 2001 to 2021. Dataset Product

    To estimate annual, seasonal, and monthly distributions and trends, the Lag-1
    autocorrelation technique was applied to check the homogeneity and serial seasonality
    of the datasets using Matlab programming language (Banerjee et al., 2023). Moreover,
    daily datasets were then aggregated into monthly and seasonal scales as there
    are two wet seasons and two intermittent dry seasons in Uganda. March, April,
    and May are high wet season months and September, October, and November are relatively
    low wet seasons. In addition, June, July, and August are high dry seasons, and
    December, January, and February are comparatively low dry seasons in Uganda. Furthermore,
    the bi-cubic interpolation technique was employed to fix all the datasets into
    a single spatial scale before applying the trend statistics using GEE algorithms.
    Additionally, the Mann-Kendall and Sen''s slope estimator have been used to check
    the long-term alterations of rainfall and temperature at a 95% significance level
    using the GEE algorithms, by considering the utility to reveal the long-term magnitude
    of trends (Nanda and Banerjee, 2021; Streletskaya et al., 2020). Moreover, the
    Spearman correlation coefficient technique was applied to check the spatio-temporal
    relationship between rainfall and temperature (alpha <0.05). 3. Results 3.1. Distribution
    of rainfall and temperature (2001–2021) The present study estimates annual, seasonal,
    and monthly distributions of rainfall and temperature from 2001 to 2021 (Fig.
    2). Annually, the maximum rainfall occurs in the south-eastern part of the study
    area, followed by north and north-east (Fig. 2a). Throughout the study period,
    the wet season saw the most rainfall, with the south-eastern part of the Lake
    Victoria region receiving the most. Moreover, a significant amount of rainfall
    was also observed during wet season 2, with rainfall being more widespread in
    a large part of the study area except in the northeastern part (328 mm). Similarly,
    substantial rainfall is depicted in the northern part during dry season 1, while
    the south-eastern parts of the study area witnessed maximum rainfall during dry
    season 2. Long-term rainfall research further highlights that average annual rainfall
    is 1251 mm per year, with 804 and 447 mm during the wet season and dry seasons,
    respectively. Seasonal exploration reveals maximum rainfall during wet season
    1 (422 mm per year) followed by wet season 2 (382 mm), dry season 1 (303 mm),
    and dry season 2 (144 mm) (Fig. 2c). In addition, monthly estimation reveals maximum
    rainfall in April (168 mm) followed by May (147 mm) and October (143 mm), while
    January shares the minimum amount of rainfall (35 mm) followed by February (43
    mm) and December (66 mm) (Fig. 2d). Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download

    distribution graphs. Subsequently, the present study also highlights annual, seasonal,
    and monthly spatio-temporal distributions of LST between 2001 and 2021, whereas
    maximum temperature, spatially noticed in the north-eastern part of the study
    area keeps on decreasing to lowest in the southeastern part. During wet season
    1, the highest temperature was observed in the northern and northeastern parts
    of the study area, while the northwestern portion exhibited the highest annual
    temperature during wet season 2. A significant proportion of the study area exhibits
    relatively higher temperatures during dry seasons (Fig. 2b). The temporal mean
    annual temperature distribution of the study domain in the last two decades was
    29 °C. Seasonally, the maximum temperature was noticed during wet spells, averaging
    28 °C, whereas relatively lower LST counts were perceived during the dry season
    (27 °C) (Fig. 2e). Monthly investigation at temporal-scale highlights maximum
    temperature counts in March (32 °C), followed by April and May, averaging 29 °C,
    albeit, December to February similarly witnessed substantial temperature records,
    at around 31 °C (Fig. 2f). 3.2. Trends in rainfall and temperature (2001–2021)
    The present study also incorporates annual, seasonal, and monthly spatio-temporal
    trends of rainfall and temperature at a higher significance level, demonstrating
    an increased tendency of annual rainfall, while temperature experienced heterogeneity
    in a mixture of spatial trends in the last two decades (Fig. 3). Annually, an
    increasing trend of rainfall was noticed in the eastern part of the study area
    while the western part exhibits decreasing trend. Both seasons show an increasing
    trend in rainfall, however, the increase is more pronounced during the dry season,
    most notably in the southern part of the study area, while, a slight decrease
    was observed in the northern side (Fig. 3a). Long-term rainfall trend analysis
    further highlights an increasing trend of rainfall, averaging 1.08 mm/year. Seasonal
    exploration reveals an increasing trend in rainfall, averaging (0.04 mm/year,
    p > 0.05) in wet and (0.50 mm/year) in dry seasons (Fig. 3c). In addition, monthly
    analysis reveals the highest increasing trend occurs in February (0.47 mm/year)
    followed by March (0.47 mm/year) and July (0.41 mm/year), although May witnessed
    a marginal decrease in rainfall (−0.37 mm/year) followed by November (−0.32 mm/year)
    and December (−0.30 mm/year) (Fig. 3d). Annual, seasonal, and monthly spatio-temporal
    trends of LST depicts the maximum increase in the south-central portion, but a
    slight decrease in the northeast. During wet season 1 and dry season 2, a significant
    portion of the study area exhibits a decreasing trend in temperature except for
    the south-central parts. During wet season 2 and dry season 1, the majority of
    the study area experienced an increasing tendency, except in the northeastern
    parts. (Fig. 3b). Further investigation demonstrates an annual increase in LST,
    averaging 0.01 °C/year. Seasonally, maximum changes were observed during both
    dry seasons (0.35 °C/year), while wet seasons witnessed a significant reduction
    in mean LST (−0.07 °C/year). Moreover, a monthly exploration of trends revealed
    slight warming patterns mostly in January, December, and September (0.01 °C/year)
    (Fig. 3f). Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download : Download full-size

    relationships between temperature and rainfall The present study reveals a 95%
    significance level at an annual and seasonal spatio-temporal long-term relationship
    between LST and rainfall (Fig. 4). Annual coherence portrays a potent inverse
    relationship in the north and north-east portion of the study area (R2 = −0.9,
    p < 0.05), whereas western parts have a comparably moderate proportional association
    (R2 = 0.5, p > 0.05). Seasonal explorations exhibit maximum spatial nexus, albeit
    inversely proportional in the northeastern portion of the study area during the
    wet season, whereas southern regions of the study area have witnessed proportional
    nexus (R2 = −0.7, p < 0.05). Moreover, during the dry season, most of the study
    area experienced strong negative spatial correlation except south-western parts
    (R2 = 0.4, p < 0.05). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    parameters. 3.4. Regional water availability and agricultural production The study
    further highlights regional-scale water availability, land cover, and allied agricultural
    production from 2012 to 2023. Fig. 5a discloses the spatial distribution of water
    bodies, where Lake Victoria contains the largest amount of water in Uganda followed
    by other small-scale lakes and river channels. These water bodies provide an indispensable
    water supply throughout the country and deliver local irrigation supplies. In
    addition, Fig. 5b portrays land cover in Uganda, whereas the maximum cropland
    was observed in the central, northeastern, and southwestern parts of the country.
    Yearly region-wise crop production distribution reveals the maximum proportion
    was occupied by corn followed by sorghum, peanut, millet, and rice (Fig. 5c).
    A total of eight types of crops were selected to check the spatio-temporal production
    in the last 10 years, where central Uganda witnessed maximum crop production (38%)
    followed by eastern and northern. The yearly crop productivity illustrates a sharp
    decreasing tendency in the last decade, where maximum changes were observed in
    sorghum, peanut, and millet, with a minor increase in cotton production. Download

    of rainfall and LST in Uganda The key aim of this study was to estimate spatio-temporal
    long-term distributions and trends at annual, seasonal, and monthly scales using
    remotely sensed datasets and GEE algorithms. Generally, recent research has found
    that there is a steady rise in rainfall and temperature in the study area (Obubu
    et al., 2021). This variability in temperature and rainfall is controlled by many
    drivers like the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), its location on the equator,
    monsoon winds, subtropical anticyclones, westerly winds from the Congo basin,
    large water bodies, topography and anthropogenic activities (Nsubuga et al., 2011).
    The present study found that there is an increase in the average annual rainfall
    averaging 1.08 mm/year, this tendency is observed in the eastern part of the study
    area while the western part exhibits a decreasing trend. This increasing tendency
    in the eastern part could be related to the influence of the Indian monsoon, Positive
    Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and El-Nino phenomena. The Indian monsoon, which occurs
    from June to September, brings heavy rainfall to the eastern parts of Uganda,
    which is further triggered by the positive IOD events and El-Nino effects, leading
    to above-average rainfall (Chu et al., 2014; Onyutha et al., 2021). A significant
    number of relative factors influence regional rainfall and temperature variations
    at long-term scales, which include Congo Air Mass from April to October and equatorial
    oscillation collectively bringing warm and moist air into the region. Our study
    highlights a slightly increased tendency in the south-central part, which could
    be attributable to the fluctuation of hot and humid air masses. Furthermore, with
    changes (position and intensity) in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
    during wet seasons, Uganda witnessed an increasing amount of seasonal rainfall
    in the last two decades (Onyutha, 2016). Previous studies have reported changes
    in ocean sub-surface currents, and an increased frequency of extreme events, which
    resulted in considerable changes in the East African climate system due to a westward
    shift in warm air currents from the Indian Ocean (Lim and Hendon, 2017). These
    extreme events eventually affected millions of people as a result of floods, landslides,
    and drought scenarios (Aparna et al., 2012). To understand the adverse effects
    of changing trends in long-term temperature and precipitation, it is also necessary
    to estimate associated regional modifications (Banerjee et al., 2021). 4.2. Effect
    of rainfall changes on regional agricultural productivity and water resources
    Uganda, owing to its regional significance in Africa, is severely affected by
    contemporary climate change, predominantly by agriculture and water resources.
    Our study perceived a significant amount of changes in regional agricultural productivity
    since the last decade, whereas water availability was also declining to confine
    regional agricultural efficiency. Out of the total selected crops, maximum deviations
    were detected in sorghum, peanut, and millet, although with little increase in
    cotton production from 2012 to 2023. A significant amount of previously published
    studies reported a potent spatial connection between climate change and agricultural
    productivity (Nuwagira and Yasin, 2022; Twongyirwe et al., 2019), where they highlighted
    a reduction in rainfall affected water availability, especially for agriculture,
    domestic use together with higher temperature trends and associated more evaporation
    rates and related groundwater depletion, causing less surface water availability.
    Spatially, southwest and northeast parts of Uganda witnessed drought conditions
    due to less rainfall and prolonged dry spells resulting in food insecurity and
    livelihood concerns, while the north-central shores of Lake Victoria are the wettest
    areas (Gabiri et al., 2020). Moreover, irregular rainfall patterns and trends
    lead to lower crop yields as Uganda''s crop productivity is directly reliant on
    annual and seasonal rainfall (Mubiru et al., 2017). Apart from the climate change
    impacts, the enhanced occurrence of pests and diseases also restricts crop productivity
    (Landaverde et al., 2023). Contrary to this, increased rainfall trends at annual
    and seasonal scales induced more intense rainfall events and caused floods as
    our findings demonstrated considerably higher rainfall in the north and south-eastern
    sides of Uganda, averaging 3.5 mm/year. Nkuba et al. (2023) and Jacobs et al.
    (2016) reported a strong spatial relationship between increased temperature and
    Rwenzoris'' glacier ice melting and accelerating flood frequencies, eventually
    causing a significant reduction in regional water supply in coming decades, resulting
    in lower agricultural productivity. 4.3. Regional anthropogenic activities and
    resultant environmental variation Along with climate change, regional human activities
    also play a substantial role in modifying environmental settings and thereby raising
    annual temperature (Saturday et al., 2021). Our outcome depicts nighttime light
    trends and maximum concentration in the capital district (Kampala) along with
    Jinja and Mbalc (Fig. 6a and b), which comprises rapid urban expansion and associated
    land use changes (Gani et al., 2023; Sengupta et al., 2020). Moreover, yearly
    population growth from 2001 to 2021 reveals a drastically increased tendency (particularly
    after 2010), notably concentrated in the southeastern parts of Uganda (Fig. 6b
    and d). Increased improper human activities resulted in environmental changes
    that have serious implications in producing greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2),
    sulfur dioxide (SO2), and methane (CH4) concentrating in the atmosphere which
    traps heat and leads to increased LST (Banerjee et al., 2023). The rising temperature
    also impacted seasonal rainfall patterns and associated atmospheric circulation
    leading to shifts in rainfall distribution and intensity, which caused enormous
    changes in regional crop productivity (Obubu et al., 2021). With increasing urbanization
    trends in Uganda, i.e. construction of buildings, pavement, and infrastructure
    absorbs heat, leading to local temperature increase due to the urban heat island
    effect (Bwire et al., 2020). A recently published study reported a declining tendency
    in regional vegetation cover in Uganda (Bamwesigye et al., 2022), which could
    be associated with decreased rainfall and increased LST in the last two decades.
    In addition, activities such as land use changes linked with unplanned urbanization
    along with an expansion of intensive agricultural practices in the wetlands have
    a negative impact on water availability and ecosystem functioning (Chu et al.,
    2014; Nagawa et al., 2018). Odongtoo et al. (2020b) reported that unsustainable
    land use practices such as deforestation, overgrazing, use of agricultural chemicals,
    and uncontrolled urbanization (Turyasingura et al., 2023), are negatively affecting
    the water resources and natural drainage systems of Uganda. Download : Download

    and agriculture are significantly impacted by anthropogenic activities and climate
    change. Using a variety of non-parametric statistical methods, this study intends
    to provide insights into the long-term distribution and trends of rainfall and
    temperature, and how they are associated with water resources and agricultural
    productivity in Uganda from 2001 to 2021. The sustainability of water resources
    and agricultural applications has been negatively influenced by these issues in
    the following ways. I. Rainfall patterns have changed as a result of climate change,
    causing variations in the time, intensity, and distribution of rainfall. This
    has led to water shortages or surpluses in some areas, which has an impact on
    the amount of water available for agricultural activities. Mean annual rainfall
    witnessed a significant increase, albeit with lower absolute values (1.08 mm/year).
    Moreover, regional LST trends experienced a slight increase in the last decades,
    averaging 0.01 °C/year. II. The water availability has decreased, especially in
    regions that depend on rainfall for irrigation due to an increase in temperature
    and altered rainfall patterns. This has had a direct effect on crop yield and
    production. Moreover, variations in temperature and rainfall can have an impact
    on the quality of the water, increasing the dangers of pollution and salinization.
    Most of the central and northern regions were subjected to a significant loss
    in crop productivity (mainly corn, rice, and Soybean) together with higher spatial
    coherence with rainfall (R2 = −0.9, p < 0.05) and temperature (R2 = 0.4, p < 0.05).
    III. Extreme weather events including droughts, floods, and storms are on the
    rise as a result of climate change. These occurrences have the potential to disrupt
    agricultural processes, hasten crop failures, animal losses, and soil erosion,
    and have a further negative influence on water supplies and agricultural output.
    IV. Regional human activities like deforestation and changes in land use have
    a direct impact on agriculture and water resources and contribute to climate change.
    Deforestation reduces the amount of forest cover, which results in less rainfall
    and more soil erosion. Increased rapid population growth and nighttime light trends
    near the Kampala region resulted in a massive loss in the regional ecosystem and
    environmental patterns, thereby significant reduction in water resources and crop
    productivity in the last two decades. Implementing sustainable practices, such
    as water conservation, enhanced irrigation methods, watershed management, and
    land-use planning, is necessary to address the effects of climate change and anthropogenic
    activities on water resources and agriculture. In order to reduce climate change
    and develop adaptive water resource management and agricultural resilience measures,
    legislation and international cooperation are also required. Moreover, to overcome
    the paucity of observed station data records, remotely sensed high-resolution
    gridded products are sufficient to check the long-term patterns of climate change
    and associated regional environmental dilapidations by employing the Google Earth
    Engine web-based cloud computing facilities. Funding This research was funded

    • Impact of several factors on SAR backscatter based cut detection is assessed.
    • Grass height and biomass are identified as the main limiting factors. • No clear
    impact of species distribution and the salvage timing was found. Abstract Several
    studies utilized C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter time series
    to detect cut events of grasslands. They identified several potential factors
    hindering the detection: Vegetation characteristics, precipitation, and the timing
    of salvage of the harvested grass. This study uses a comprehensive in situ database
    to assess the impact of those factors on the detection rate of cut events by performing
    a cut detection based on Sentinel-1 backscatter time series and relating the accuracy
    to the potentially limiting factors. The results can be summarized in the following
    key findings: (i) The detection rate decreases significantly with grass heights
    below 35 cm and a biomass of less than 2100 kg/ha. As the grass of the first growth
    is typically characterized by greater height and higher biomass, first cuts achieved
    a higher accuracy with 85% compared to re-growth cuts with 65%. (ii) False positive
    cut events were related to higher precipitation amounts, but adding precipitation
    data to the model led only to a slight increase of the accuracy of re-growth cuts,
    but a decrease of the overall accuracy. (iii) No relation was found between the
    timing of salvage and the backscatter behaviour. These insights contribute to
    a better utilization of C-band backscatter for vegetation analysis and agricultural
    applications, including cut detection. Further research with dense in situ measurements,
    including Vegetation Water Content (VWC) is required to fully understand the behaviour

    learningTime series MSC 00001111 1. Introduction With an area of almost 1.34 million
    hectares, grassland accounts for almost 50% of agricultural land in Austria, making
    it the most important crop in terms of area (Pötsch et al., 2011). Especially
    in the alpine regions of Austria, its protective effect against soil erosion is
    essential to prevent landslides. In addition, grasslands have an important function
    for the environment. They contribute to biodiversity as a habitat for various
    species and, thanks to their filtering and storage capacity, improve water quality
    and water supply (Jankowska-Huflejt, 2006). Moreover, grassland is also an indispensable
    net oxygen producer and an important carbon sink and thus provides positive effects
    to mitigate climate change (Hörtnagl et al., 2018; Bai and Cotrufo, 2022). From
    an agricultural point of view, the most important function of grassland is the
    supply of fodder for milk, meat, and energy production. The quantity and quality
    of the yield is influenced by several factors. These include on the one side management
    practices such as maintenance, fertilization, and intensity of use and on the
    other hand, environmental conditions including weather, soil, location, and the
    condition and composition of the grassland sward (Neuwirth and Hofer, 2013; King
    et al., 2012). Whereas these site factors can be evaluated regionally, this is
    not the case for management factors, as they take place individually on each farm
    (Schaumberger, 2011). Here, remote sensing is a key technology for measuring the
    intensity of use by detecting cut events and subsequently, the yield per cut event.
    Austria''s small-scale alpine meadows in combination with a high cutting frequency
    lead to high requirements on the spatial and temporal resolution of the data.
    The Copernicus Sentinel mission with optical and radar satellites fulfils these
    requirements due to its high revisit time and very high spatial resolution imaging
    sensors. Numerous studies have been carried out using either optical or microwave
    data or a combination of both for the detection of grassland cut events (Lobert
    et al., 2021; De Vroey et al., 2021, 2022; Schwieder et al., 2022; Reinermann
    et al., 2022; Komisarenko et al., 2022; Watzig et al., 2023; Holtgrave et al.,
    2023). Most of the studies utilizing optical data use Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) as an input feature, either solely or in combination with other features
    (Lobert et al., 2021; De Vroey et al., 2022; Schwieder et al., 2022; Reinermann
    et al., 2022; Komisarenko et al., 2022; Watzig et al., 2023; Holtgrave et al.,
    2023). These studies achieved F1-scores between 70% and 94% for cut detection
    of grassland, proving the general suitability of optical data. However, their
    data availability is dependent on cloud-free conditions during the acquisition
    time. In Austria, this is often not the case. In May, when the first cut event
    often takes place, the cloud coverage is up to 60% in some regions (WeatherSpark.com
    and accessed, 2022). In contrast, radar sensors operate independently of daylight
    and weather conditions. Thus, their seamless and dense time series can provide
    valuable information for a cut detection. Several studies already investigated
    the potential of C-band SAR observations for cut detection (Lobert et al., 2021;
    Reinermann et al., 2022; De Vroey et al., 2021; Curnel, 2015; Schuster et al.,
    2011; Voormansik et al., 2013; Holtgrave et al., 2023). The studies used either
    Interferometric Synthetic Aperature Radar (InSAR) Coherence (Lobert et al., 2021;
    Reinermann et al., 2022; De Vroey et al., 2021; Holtgrave et al., 2023) by exploiting
    the decreasing sensitivity of grasslands to wind after a cut event or backscatter
    measurements and their sensitivity to plant growing stages of crops and grasslands
    (De Vroey et al., 2021; Reinermann et al., 2022; Komisarenko et al., 2022; Schuster
    et al., 2011; Voormansik et al., 2013; Zalite et al., 2016). Overall lower accuracy
    was achieved with SAR observations compared to optical data, and coherence led
    to higher detection rates compared to backscatter (De Vroey et al., 2021; Holtgrave
    et al., 2023). However, the calculation of coherence comes with a higher computational
    effort and is more challenging to use in combination with optical data as it is
    based on two consecutive observations. Yet, the use of SAR backscatter for cut
    detection also comes with challenges and limitations. De Vroey et al. (De Vroey
    et al., 2021) identified in their study the size, shape, and slope of grasslands
    as well as grazing as main factors limiting the detection of mowing events with
    Sentinel-1 backscatter and coherence. Potential limiting factors were also identified
    in other studies: First, grasslands are a very heterogeneous land cover with significant
    differences in plant composition and management. Depending on those conditions,
    more vertical or horizontal plant structures dominate grasslands. This can lead
    to significant differences in the backscatter signals (Stiles and Sarabandi, 2000;
    Stiles et al., 2000) and might be a main cause why previous studies have observed
    significant differences in the behaviour of the backscatter before and after a
    cut among investigated fields (De Vroey et al., 2021; Reinermann et al., 2022).
    Second, the backscatter signal is composed of a soil and vegetation component,
    and is influenced by both the water content and structure of these components.
    Changes in the signal can thus be related to changes in soil or VWC or the vegetation
    biomass. Furthermore, the density of the vegetation determines the soil contribution
    to the total backscatter. This again greatly depends on vegetation characteristics
    and differs from field to field. Lobert et al. (2021) and Curnel (2015) therefore
    suggest the utilization of precipitation data and other meteorological data in
    cut detection models. Lastly, management practices are a limiting factor in cut
    detection accuracy. After a cut event, the grass is often not immediately removed
    from the field, but remains there for drying. In this case, the backscatter signal
    reflects the grass lying in the field and shows a different pattern compared to
    a combined cutting and salvage event (Reinermann et al., 2022; Curnel, 2015).
    However, the impact of these factors on backscatter-based cut detection has not
    yet been comprehensively evaluated. Therefore, we aim to consistently evaluate
    to what extent the following factors impact the accuracy of SAR backscatter cut
    detection: ● vegetation characteristics (height, biomass, and species distribution)
    ● precipitation ● timing of salvage The modelling and evaluation is based on a
    comprehensive in situ data set consisting of field samples of vegetation parameters
    and salvage dates, as well as precipitation data. We assess the impact of those
    factors by performing a cut detection using a Deep Learning (DL) model. Afterward,
    we statistically evaluate the results by relating the cut detection accuracy to
    the outlined limiting factors. Moreover, based on these findings, we aim to provide
    a clearer picture under which conditions a detection of cut events in C-band backscatter
    time series is possible, and which factors lead to false detection. In addition,
    we see this work to be relevant not only for the application of cut detection
    but also as a contribution to a better physical understanding of the interaction
    of microwaves and low vegetation, including grasslands. 2. Background: Interaction
    of microwaves with grasslands To evaluate the influencing factors for SAR backscatter-based
    cut detection of grasslands, an understanding of microwave remote sensing of vegetated
    surfaces is required. The interaction of active microwaves with a vegetated surface
    is a complex process influenced by several factors. One approach to describe this
    is the Water Cloud model (Attema and Ulaby, 1978). The total backscatter is composed
    of the backscatter from the ground and the vegetation. The latter is here considered
    a random arrangement of water droplets. Different interaction mechanisms between
    microwaves and the ground and vegetation are described in literature (Chiu and
    Sarabandi, 2000; Monsivais-Huertero et al., 2010; Stiles et al., 2000): 1. direct
    scattering 2. ground-plant scattering 3. plant-ground scattering 4. ground-plant-ground
    scattering 5. second-order (multi-path) scattering among the plant particles 6.
    stem rough ground scattering The contribution of the mechanisms to the total backscatter
    signal strongly depends on the density and height of the vegetation covering the
    ground, and can thus change during a vegetation season due to plant growth or
    management practices (Veloso et al., 2017). In addition, the amount of water bound
    in the plant (VWC) and free water in the form of surface canopy water (SCW) significantly
    impact the backscatter (Pfeil et al., 2020; Khabbazan et al., 2022). The impact
    of the latter, in the form of dew and interception, is again strongly dependent
    on the wavelength of the radiation and the characteristics of the prevailing vegetation,
    i.e. density, leaf size, structure (Hornbuckle et al., 2006). For C-band radar
    and grassland, an increase in backscatter under the presence of SCW of 4.5 dB
    was reported (Herold et al., 2001). Fig. 1 shows a backscatter time series and
    the grass height for an intensively managed field in Austria. In April, at the
    beginning of the vegetation season, diffuse scattering from the ground dominates
    the signal. After the onset of grass growth, around mid of April, when grass height
    and density are still low, scattering mechanisms 2–4 dominate the signal. During
    May, with increasing biomass, multi-path scattering between plant particles dominates
    the signal (mechanism 5) and Vertical-Vertical (VV) and Vertical-Horizontal (VH)
    backscatter decrease with increasing backscatter attenuation (Stiles et al., 2000).
    Due to the simultaneous increase in depolarization by the plant components, the
    decrease in VH is less pronounced, leading to an increase in the Cross-ratio (CR).
    The cut event at the end of May results in a sudden significant increase in both
    VV and VH backscatter. Fig. 2 explains this increase: Before the cut event, direct
    and multi-path scattering from the plant (subfigure a) dominate the backscatter,
    whereas, after the cut event, diffuse scattering from the soil (subfigure b) dominates
    the signal again (Schuster et al., 2011). After the cut event, scattering mechanism
    6 can be observed, which collocates with the depolarization of the transmitted
    wave and leads to high VH values. The degree of depolarization hereby depends
    on the roughness of the soil, as well as the structure of the contributing vegetation.
    Backscattering from the soil is further significantly influenced by soil moisture
    (SM). When other impacts are ignored, backscatter is assumed to increase linearly
    with increasing moisture (Woodhouse, 2006). The same applies to the vegetation
    water content, where dry vegetation is more permeable to incident radiation and
    moist vegetation leads to higher backscattering in most cases. The backscatter
    dynamics in VH and VV polarization after the first cut at the beginning of June
    are most likely related to changes in SM as they correlate with patterns observed
    in precipitation data. The second and third cut events during re-growth at the
    beginning of June and mid of August are barely visible in the time series. Due
    to the lower grass height during this period, the soil contribution to the signal
    is higher during this period, and no major shift in the backscatter mechanism
    is associated with a cut event. Download : Download high-res image (474KB) Download

    3. Materials 3.1. Study area The study area covers Austria, and includes fields
    from all federal states except Vienna, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Austria is characterized
    by different climatic conditions, shaped by its alpine topography. Favourable
    and unfavourable sites are often closely intertwined, resulting in great regional
    diversity of grassland use intensity. To provide a representative reference data
    set, ground truth data covering all climatic regions, topographic sites, and with
    different management intensities are considered. The fields in the study range
    from a minimum height a.s.l. of 278 m to a maximum height a.s.l. of 1440 m. Austria''s
    unique grassland production system is characterized by small-structured and diverse
    fields. The grasslands in Austria are comparatively rich in species and have high
    proportions of herbs. Common representatives of the species are listed below:
    ● Grass: Orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), timothe (Phleum pratense), english
    raygras (Lolium perenne), tall oat grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), and golden oat
    grass (Trisetum flavescens). ● Herbs: Ribwort (Plantago lanceolata), dandelion
    (Taraxacum officinale), and broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius). ● Legumes:
    Various species of clover including red clover (Trifolium pratense), white clover
    (Trifolium repen), and horned clover (Lotus corniculatus) (Pötsch and PötschÖsterreichische,
    2015). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    extensive data set consisting of several thousand in situ measurements which were
    collected within the Austrian Research Promotion Agency SatGrass project. The
    data were collected on managed grasslands with at least one cut per year and fields
    larger than 0.5 ha for the years 2020–2022. Ley farming, which involves growing
    grass on arable land, is not strongly represented in the data. Purely grazed areas
    were not included in the data, and post-grazing in autumn was not counted as utilization,
    but may have occurred on the fields. The selected fields can be divided into two
    groups, depending on the reliability of the data and the availability of in situ
    data: Partner fields and external fields. The partner data were collected by well-trained
    and experienced staff, agricultural supervisors, and experts from agricultural
    colleges. In addition to cut and salvage dates, here also the in situ measurements
    outlined in Table 1 were collected on an approximate bi-weekly basis. Samples
    were taken from three representative 1 m2 plots. The grass height was determined
    using a plate meter, the cut grass was weighted for biomass and Leaf Area Index
    (LAI) was determined using a field spectrometer (AccuPAR Ceptometer). Ground coverage
    and species distribution were both estimated. External data on the other hand
    consists only of cut dates and could be entered by anyone using a dedicated app.
    This smartphone app provides automatic geolocation by using the integrated Global
    Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and the field boundaries from the European
    Union''s Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) dataset. The collected
    data was uploaded to a server and quality checked after every season. The exact
    numbers of the fields and the available cut events per season are outlined in

    from Sentinel-1, a radar satellite mission operated by European Space Agency (ESA)
    using a C-band (5.4 GHz/5.6 cm) SAR imaging sensor. The mission consisted of the
    satellites Sentinel-1A (launched in April 2014) and Sentinel-1B (launched in April
    2016) which had a 12-day repeat cycle (Torres et al., 2012). On December 23rd,
    2021 Sentinel-1B experienced a power supply problem, which prevented further radar
    data from being acquired. In August 2022, ESA officially announced the retirement
    of the satellite, leaving only Sentinel-1A with a reduced revisit time in operation
    (E. S. Agency, 2022). In this study, Ground Rage Detected (GRD) high-resolution
    Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) data at 10 m spatial sampling from the Austrian
    Data Cube (ACube), described in (Navacchi et al., 2020), was used. In IW mode,
    data is available in VV and VH polarization. Backscatter expressed as Radiometric
    Terrain-flattened Gamma Nought (GMR) was used to mitigate distortions in the challenging
    terrain of grasslands. Here, the local illuminated area is computed, projected
    into the radar geometry, cumulatively summed up, and applied as a reference area
    during radiometric normalization (Small, 2011). Ingestion into the data cube was
    conducted using the SAR Geophysical Retrieval Toolbox (SGRT v2.4) demonstrated
    in (Naeimi et al., 2016), which invokes several modules from the Sentinel Application
    Platform (SNAP). The pre-processing of the data was performed on the Austrian
    supercomputer VSC-4 and included the following steps: 1. Apply precise orbit data
    2. Border-noise removal 3. Radiometric calibration 4. Radiometric terrain-flattening
    5. Range-Doppler terrain correction on Sentinel-1 IW GRD scenes. A national high-resolution
    terrain model based on airborne laser scanning data at 10 m pixel spacing was
    utilized during steps (3) and (4) allowing the mitigation of terrain effects in
    GMR. The final step of the pre-processing routine is the resampling and tiling
    of the scenes to the Equi7Grid (Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2014). 3.4. Precipitation
    data To assess the impact of precipitation on cut detection, the study uses precipitation
    data from the INCA model, a gridded analysis data set with a spatial resolution
    of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 15 min. It uses station data and assimilated
    remote sensing information (Haiden et al., 2011). The data were extracted for
    the pixel locations closest to the centroids of the fields (nearest neighbour
    search) and aggregated to daily composites as kilograms per square meter. 4. Methodology
    The cut detection approach in this study is designed to evaluate the impact of
    various factors on the detection rate of cut events. In order to do so, an experimental
    set-up is required that allows us to relate in situ measurements to accuracy metrics
    of the cut detection. For this reason, and to increase the sample size, we pre-processed
    backscatter time series, sliced them for entire seasons into sub-sequences, and
    assigned a single label to the entire time series, indicating if a cut happened
    in this period or not. Subsequently, we associated all in situ measurements acquired
    in the same period to this sequence as well. In the next step, we trained and
    tested a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with the extracted sequences and performed
    a statistical evaluation. The following sections describe the data preparation,
    the implemented model, and the model training and evaluation approach in detail.
    4.1. Data preparation To mitigate the impact of the limiting factors identified
    by De Vroey et al. (De Vroey et al., 2021), the following processing steps were
    performed: 1. subtracting a buffer of 20 m from the grassland field polygons to
    reduce the impact of adjacent objects (buildings, trees, or fence) on the backscatter
    signal. 2. applying a backscatter-based shadow masking algorithm developed within
    the frame of the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) project (Salamon et al., 2021).
    A pixel is classified as being in radar shadow if the mean of the respective relative
    orbit is lower than −15 dB and the mean of the opposite orbit direction is greater
    than −10 dB. Both thresholds were defined empirically for different regions of
    interest scattered all over the globe. 3. performing a linear backscatter-incidence
    angle normalization to a reference incidence angle of 40°, similar to (Bauer-Marschallinger
    et al., 2021). 4. masking pixels contradicting the global distribution of backscatter
    over grassland based upon the mean and standard deviation over time. The distribution
    of VH polarised GMR backscatter provided the best separation between grassland
    and non-grassland pixels, which is located around −17 dB for the mean and 5 dB
    for the standard deviation. 5. ignoring fields covering less than 20 pixels to
    ensure a stable estimate within the subsequent step and the final time series
    aggregation. 6. masking outlier pixels of the local VV polarised GMR backscatter
    distribution. Outliers were discarded by using the two-sigma boundaries of the
    distribution, which allowed to remove the disruptive contribution of objects like
    trees or huts within the field from the overall signal. After these pre-processing
    steps, the CR was computed as an additional Sentinel-1 input layer. Per field,
    the features mean and backscatter range were calculated. The former is calculated
    by simply averaging all pixels in a field. The latter represents the maximum backscatter
    difference per field, calculated by subtracting the highest and the lowest observed
    value within one time step. In a next step, this field-based data set was extended
    with the meteorological data described in Section 3.4. Finally, a time series
    smoothing by means of a rolling average with a window of±six days was applied
    to the data. In a final step, the resulting time series were visually inspected
    to check their plausibility and quality. In addition, for every available in situ
    observation day, the measurements from the three sampling plots were averaged
    to a single value and stored in the data set. The complete data preparation pipeline

    4.2. Time series slicing After the data preparation step, the reference data consisted
    of time series per field that indicate for every six daily time steps whether
    a cut occurred during this time. In a next step, these time series were sliced
    into sub-sequences as illustrated in Fig. 5. These sub-sequences consist each
    of seven time steps and are assigned a single label indicating if a cut was performed
    at the centre time step T0 or not. To extract those sequences, the following two
    rules were applied: Time series samples for the label “no cut” contain only time
    steps with no cut events. Time series samples for the label “cut” consist of exactly
    one cut event at the centre time step T0. Second, every time step is used only
    once within a label category, which means that there is no overlap between consecutive
    sequences of the same category. Due to the availability of in situ measurements
    only for the year 2021, this year was used for model testing. The remaining years
    2020 and 2022 for model training. After the time series slicing, the data set
    had an imbalanced number of samples, as the class “no cut” is significantly over-represented.
    During the training process, this could lead to the problem that the model always
    predicts the majority class. To account for this, the class “cut” was oversampled
    and the class “no cut” was randomly undersampled in the training set to the same
    number of samples. After this step, the training data set consisted of 500 samples
    for each class and the test data set of 499 samples for each class. Download :

    shows the extraction of two “cut” samples and one “no cut” sample based on the
    rules outlined in section 4.2. The x-axis represents the six daily time steps,
    with cut events coloured in dark grey. 4.3. Gated Recurrent Unit In this study,
    a GRU was used as the model of choice. GRUs were introduced by Cho et al. (2014)
    and have been successfully applied in several remote sensing time series applications
    (Chhetri et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Bi et al., 2020). They
    are a further development of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), designed to process
    sequential data like time series. By using feedback loops, they forward information
    in the form of the hidden state from the previous time step to the next time interval.
    However, during the training process, this complicates the adjustment of the gradients.
    In addition to the number of nodes and layers, they have to be adjusted in the
    additional time dimension, which is referred to as backpropagation through time.
    Especially for very long time series, the error portion at the beginning of the
    time series can get so small that the gradients are barely adapted. This is called
    the vanishing gradient problem (Hochreiter, 1998). To overcome this problem, GRUs
    use two gating functions that control the flow of information through the network.
    The update gate defines if the previous hidden state is to be updated. The reset
    gate on the other hand determines if the previous state has to be reset. Thus,
    in contrast to the widely used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, they have
    one gate less and also fewer model parameters. Therefore, they have been shown
    to work better on small data sets (Yang et al., 2020), making them an appropriate
    choice for this study. 4.4. Model design and training A grid search was carried
    out to identify the best model parameters. In the end, a bidirectional GRU model
    with 142,901 trainable parameters was used in this study. The model was implemented
    using the Python library “Keras” (Chollet, 2015). We used two GRU layers followed
    by a recurrent dropout as a regularization mechanism to prevent over-fitting.
    We trained the model from scratch using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate
    of 0.0001. Hereby, the maximum number of training epochs was set to 200 with an
    early-stop monitor with patience of eight. Early stopping ensures that the training
    process is stopped if the validation loss has not decreased over eight epochs.
    Binary cross-entropy was used as a loss function and the F1-score as an accuracy
    metric. 4.5. Evaluation approach For the evaluation of limiting factors, all cut
    samples from Section 4.2 were linked to the in situ measurements. Here, the closest
    measurement in the sequence before a cut event was selected and associated with
    the sample. The experiments in the results section also distinguish between first
    cuts and the re-growth as the vegetation characteristics differentiate for the
    two as outlined in Section 2. Therefore, all extracted sequences were assigned
    to one of the two categories. All cut sequences that contain the first cut of
    a grassland as well as all “no cut” sequences that were extracted before the first
    cut event are categorized as first cuts. All other “cut” and “no cut” sequences
    are assigned to the category re-growth. The model training and all experiments
    were repeated over 11 runs using the same model configurations and input data.
    Afterward, samples were assigned a label (cut/no cut) based on the majority vote
    from those runs, and the in 4.6 introduced accuracy metrics were calculated subsequently.
    As the range of observed ground coverage is very small (majority of values lie
    between 92% and 100%) and previous studies observed no correlation between C-band
    backscatter and coverage of narrow-leaf crops (Nasirzadehdizaji et al., 2019;
    Liao et al., 2018) we did not consider this parameter for the following experiments.
    4.6. Accuracy assessment Precision, Recall, and F1-score were used as accuracy
    metrics to measure the model performance. Precision is defined as the fraction
    of relevant instances among the retrieved instances and calculated using Equation
    (1). Thus, expressing the rate of true positive (TP) cut events among all predicted
    cut events (TP and false positive (FP)). Recall (also known as Sensitivity) on
    the other hand is the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved and calculated
    using Equation (2). It represents the rate of detected cut events (TP) of the
    reference cut events (TP and false negative (FN)). Finally, the F1-score is defined
    as the harmonic mean and calculated using Equation (3) (Zeugmann et al., 2011).
    These metrics were calculated per class and overall as the weighted arithmetic
    mean. (1) (2) (3) 5. Results In the following section, the results of the study
    are presented. First, the results of the cut detection are outlined. Afterward,
    these results are related to vegetation characteristics, salvage timing, and precipitation
    to evaluate the impact of these factors on the detection of cut events. 5.1. Baseline
    accuracy To provide a baseline accuracy for the following experiments, first,
    the cut detection results without precipitation data are introduced. As can be
    seen in Table 3, the model achieved an F1-score of 0.71, a Precision score of
    0.72, and a Recall score of 0.70. In total, out of 499 cut events, 348 events
    were correctly detected and 151 were misclassified as “no cuts”. Notably, all
    metrics are approximately 20 percentage points higher for the first cuts compared
    to re-growth cuts. Precision and Recall values are almost identical for all groups.

    investigated the impact of vegetation characteristics on the detection rate of
    cut events, by looking at height, biomass and species composition for TPs and
    FNs. Here, the in situ measurements of correctly classified samples were compared
    to misclassified sequences of cut events. Fig. 6 illustrates these for the variables
    grass height and biomass. Subfigure a) shows the distribution of grass height
    of correctly (TP) and wrongly classified (FN) cut events. With values of 43 cm
    respectively 40 cm, both the mean and the median value are approximately 5 cm
    higher for TP compared to FN samples. Moreover, around 50% of the FNs have a grass
    height lower than 35 cm, whereas this applies to only around 25% of the TPs. Subfigure
    b) illustrates the biomass in kg/ha for FN and TP cut samples. The mean and median
    values for FNs are 2393 kg/ha respectively 2223 kg/ha. In contrast, the mean and
    median values for TP samples are significantly higher, with a value of 2783 kg/ha
    and 2581 kg/ha. Here, around 50% of the FNs have biomass lower than 2100 kg/ha.
    For the TPs, this is the case for approximately 30% of the samples. Download :

    for both categories, with TPs showing a slightly higher median value. For legumes,
    the median for TPs is with 18% significantly higher compared to the median value
    of FNs (13%). In contrast, FNs show a higher fraction of herbs with a median of
    around 19%, whereas the median of TPs is around 12%. Download : Download high-res

    timing Previous studies observed inconsistent behaviour of the backscatter after
    cut events, with some showing a sudden increase and some a decrease in backscatter
    (Reinermann et al., 2022; Curnel, 2015). The studies raised the hypothesis that
    a delayed salvage of the harvested grass for drying after a cut is the causality
    for this inconsistency and hinders the detection of cut events. In order to assess
    this hypothesis, we compared in a first step the detection rate of cut events
    where the salvage was done during the same time step as the cut event versus events
    where the salvage was performed during a later time step. Cuts in the former group
    achieved a Recall score of 0.71, the latter a Recall score of 0.69. Additionally,
    we used the salvage dates and times (morning or afternoon) provided by farmers
    and compared the difference of the first backscatter measurement after a cut to
    the one before the cut, and grouped this into cut events with a simultaneous salvage
    (salvage is done on the same day as the cut) and events with a delayed salvage
    (salvage is performed at least one day later). In cases where the SAR backscatter
    observation could not be unambiguously assigned to one of the groups because it
    was taken within the same time interval as the salvage, we excluded it. Fig. 8
    shows VV and VH polarized backscatter values for the two groups in a scatter plot.
    No distinct behaviour of the backscatter can be observed for either of the groups.
    For delayed as well as simultaneous salvage events, there are cases where the
    backscatter increases and decreases. In both groups, the increase in VV polarized
    and VH polarized backscatter is almost equally pronounced, with differences up
    to 5 dB. In almost all cases, both polarizations either increase or decrease.
    Instances where one polarization increases and the other decreases are very rare
    but more frequent for an increase in VH but a decrease in VV. Download : Download

    showing the differences between measurements of VV and VH polarized backscatter
    from before and after a cut event for cases where the salvage was done simultaneously
    or delayed. 5.4. Impact of precipitation Previous studies raised the hypothesis
    that precipitation might impact the detection rate of cut events by affecting
    SM, VWC or SCW. The changes in SM, VWC or SCW in turn lead to changes in backscatter
    and could be interpreted as cut events. Thus, adding precipitation data to the
    model might allow the model to learn the relation between variations in SM, VWC
    or SCW and backscatter and therefore increase the accuracy of cut detection. To
    assess this, in a first step, the impact of precipitation on the cut detection
    was assessed. As a first indicator, the precipitation sums per time step were
    illustrated for TP and FN cut events as violin plots. As can be seen in Fig. 9,
    the mean and median precipitation sums for TPs and FNs are almost equal for all
    time steps and no major differences can be observed. However, when looking at
    Fig. 10 for no cut events, i.e. FP and true negative (TN) samples, the picture
    changes. Here, the mean and median precipitation sums for FPs are significantly
    higher compared to the corresponding values for TNs. For the time steps −3 to
    −1 they are most profound with a 20 kg/m2 higher mean value and an even 30 kg/m2
    higher mean for the time step T0. For the time steps 1–3 the differences in precipitation
    are less pronounced. Thus, indicating that high precipitation sums potentially
    causes wrongly classified cut events (FPs). To further evaluate whether precipitation
    has a measurable impact on the accuracy of cut detection, we added the precipitation
    data introduced in Section 3.4 as an additional feature to the model. Subsequently,
    we trained and tested the model from Section 4.4 again over 11 iterations. Fig.
    11 illustrates the achieved accuracy metrics. Overall, the model achieved lower
    scores than the model without precipitation data. For first cut events, the metrics
    are significantly lower, with an F1-score of 0.76 and Recall and Precision values
    of 0.77 respectively 0.76. In contrast, the Re-growth values slightly increased,
    with values of 0.68 for Precision and 0.67 for Recall and F1-score. Download :

    Web version of this article.) 6. Discussion 6.1. Achieved cut detection accuracy
    The achieved classification accuracy of 71% in this study is significantly higher
    than the metrics achieved in previous studies (Lobert et al., 2021; De Vroey et
    al., 2021) when using only C-band backscatter data. Due to the different study
    areas, models, data processing, and time series slicing, it is generally difficult
    to compare results between studies. However, possible factors explaining the increase
    are the use of radiometric terrain-corrected SAR backscatter, the extensive cleaning
    of the backscatter field values (outlined in Section 4.1), and the combined use
    of the mean and range backscatter values. What is notable about the results are
    the significant differences in the detection rate between first cuts and re-growth
    cuts, which were also observed in previous studies (Watzig et al., 2023; Holtgrave
    et al., 2023). The reason for this is directly related to the results from Chapter
    5.2, which showed a clear impact of the grass height and biomass on the cut detection
    accuracy. 6.2. Sensitivity of C-band backscatter towards vegetation characteristics
    Looking at the characteristics of first cuts and re-growth, significant differences
    become visible. The grass at the first cuts has a significantly taller height
    of 51 cm (median = 50 cm) and higher biomass of 3702 kg/ha (median = 3587 kg/ha)
    than the grass at re-growth with 36 cm (median = 35 cm) and a biomass of 2195
    kg/ha (median = 2196 kg/ha). This way our findings align with observations from
    Bartsch et al. (2020) who observed no sensitivity of C-band backscatter for tundra
    heights below 30 cm. The influence of grass height and biomass on the detection
    rate can be explained by the influence of grass height and biomass on the backscatter
    behaviour. Previous studies have shown a significant correlation between the height
    and biomass of short to medium vegetation, especially before the emergence of
    heads (Nasirzadehdizaji et al., 2019; Harfenmeister et al., 2019; Ndikumana et
    al., 2018; Vreugdenhil et al., 2018). Assuming almost uniform grass height and
    biomass after the cut, the grass height before the cut determines the height and
    biomass reduction. This reduction in biomass and height is also reflected in the
    backscatter behaviour. Fig. 12 shows the relation between grass height before
    a cut and the difference between backscatter measurements before and after cutting.
    A correlation can be observed, especially for cases where VH backscatter increases
    after a cut. This indicates that with increasing height and biomass reduction,
    backscatter changes are more pronounced. As a consequence, the detection rate
    is higher for cut events with higher changes in grass height and biomass. Only
    minor differences were found in the species distribution for TP and FN cut events.
    It is evident from Fig. 7 that overall grasses dominate, and other species have
    only a small share. Therefore, it is questionable if a minor difference in the
    already underrepresented herbs and legumes can impact the backscatter signal.
    Furthermore, height, biomass and species composition are co-dependent. During
    re-growth the fraction of herbs in the species distribution is on average five
    percentage points higher compared to the first cut, but height and biomass are
    lower. It is thus not necessarily the higher percentage of herbs leading to FNs,
    but the fact that higher percentages of herbs occur during re-growth which were
    related to lower height and biomass. Furthermore, the characteristics that cause
    differences in the interaction with microwaves such as orientation and thickness
    of the leaves and growth form cannot be directly attributed to the individual
    species. Although grasses tend to have a vertical growth habit and herbs tend
    to have a bushy vertical growth habit, there are significant differences within
    the individual species and other factors such as vegetation height, density, and
    water vegetation content also play a significant role. Download : Download high-res

    Factors determining the backscatter behaviour after cut events The differences
    in backscatter behaviour after a cut illustrated in Fig. 8 show mainly a positive
    difference, but in some cases also a negative one. This inconsistency was attributed
    in previous studies (Reinermann et al., 2022; Curnel, 2015) to delayed salvage
    of the harvested grass that is kept for drying in the meadow. This hypothesis
    was evaluated in Section 5.3 by comparing the detection rate and backscatter behaviour
    after cut events with simultaneous salvage or delayed salvage. The analysis on
    the impact of timing in salvage includes some uncertainties, because of the types
    of different practices of grass drying in the field (such as tower or swath) which
    are presumably associated with different backscattering behaviour. However, significant
    differences in backscattering behaviour, i.e. an increase or decrease after cutting,
    are also seen for cut events with simultaneous salvage. These results indicate
    that the timing of salvage is not the decisive factor in the backscatter response.
    In contrast, we see two factors as the main drivers for the backscatter behaviour
    after the cut. First, the decisive factor for cuts causing an increase or decrease
    in backscatter is seen in the leaf size and structure of plants, as outlined in
    previous studies (Bargiel et al., 2010; Macelloni et al., 2001). Broad leaf plants
    cause a decrease in backscatter after a harvest, whereas an increase is observed
    for fields with dominating narrow leaf vegetation. This is related to the stronger
    absorption caused by narrow leaf plants (Macelloni et al., 2001). Within the group
    of fields that show a backscatter increase after the cut, we can observe a correlation
    between the backscatter value before the cut and the backscatter increase after
    the cut (Pearson R −0.38). This is directly related to the change from backscatter
    attenuation by vegetation to diffuse backscattering from the soil surface, as
    outlined in Section 2. Thus, the degree of attenuation before the cut is a second
    decisive factor and determines the backscatter level before the cut and as a consequence
    the change of backscatter after the cut. The main drivers of attenuation are the
    density of the vegetation, the structure of the plants, as well as the SCW and
    VWC. 6.4. Impact and added value of precipitation data Section 5.4 shows that
    adding precipitation data does not result in a higher overall detection accuracy,
    thus confirming findings from a previous study (Holtgrave et al., 2023). However,
    the results indicate that it has a different effect on the accuracy of first cuts
    and cuts of the re-growth. While the accuracy for first cuts decreases significantly,
    it increases slightly for re-growth samples. This is due to the different backscatter
    mechanisms that dominate before the first cut and during the re-growth. Due to
    the high grass height and biomass of the grass before the first cut, the vegetation
    dominates the backscatter in the form of multi-path scattering and direct scattering
    from the canopy (Fig. 2a). In turn, the grass during re-growth has significantly
    lower biomass and height. Thus, the transmission of the microwave increases and
    the soil contribution in the backscatter is higher, as well as the influence of
    SM (Romshoo et al., 2002). The changing sensitivity of backscatter from vegetation
    to soil contribution can be demonstrated by relating backscatter to vegetation
    height and precipitation (as an indicator for soil moisture conditions) before
    the first cut and during the re-growth. Fig. 13 illustrates the correlation of
    all grass height measurements with the CR of the closest backscatter observation.
    As can be seen, the Pearson R of CR to grass height before the first cut is 0.4,
    but drops to 0.15 during the re-growth. The opposite is true for the correlation
    between VV polarised backscatter and precipitation as shown in Fig. 14. Here,
    the correlation for the period before the first cut is 0.07 and increases to 0.2
    during the re-growth. This indicates the changed backscatter behaviour from a
    vegetation-dominated backscatter before the first cut to a higher soil contribution
    in the backscatter during the re-growth. This also explains why adding precipitation
    data only improves the cut detection rate of re-growth cuts, as during re-growth,
    backscatter variations are more strongly influenced by SM changes. Potentially,
    a model only trained and tested with re-growth cuts would benefit more from the
    addition of precipitation data (see Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res image

    re-growth (b). In order to be able to understand the backscatter behaviour over
    grasslands even more precisely in future studies, more extensive in situ data
    tailored to understanding radar measurements would be necessary. In particular,
    in situ measurements of SM, SCW, VWC, images, and descriptions of the growth form
    of the plants, and denser time series on vegetation parameters (especially also
    after cuts) is needed. 7. Conclusion and outlook In this study, we performed a
    cut detection of grasslands based on C-band SAR backscatter time series and used
    a rich in situ database to assess the impact of several vegetation characteristics,
    precipitation, and salvage timing on the cut detection. Our results showed that
    the first cut can be reliably detected (F1-score of 0.85), whereas, cuts during
    the re-growth show a significantly lower detection rate (F1-score of 0.65). As
    the main limiting factor for the detection rate, we identified the grass height
    and biomass at the cut event. These factors are also the main reason for the lower
    detection rate of re-growth cuts. Results further indicated higher precipitation
    sums for FP “no-cut” samples. However, adding precipitation as input to the model
    led to a significant decrease in accuracy for first cuts and only to a minor increase
    in accuracy in the classification of re-growth samples. The main reason for this
    lies in the different contributions and mechanisms dominating the backscatter.
    Before the first cut, the vegetation dominates, whereas, during the re-growth
    the soil contribution to the backscatter increases. Based on this, a distinct
    model for the first cut and re-growth might increase the overall detection rate
    further. No dependency was found for the salvage timing and for the species distribution
    of the grasslands. To fully understand the signal behaviour of grasslands and
    suggest further model improvements, denser in situ data sampling timed with the
    Sentinel-1 acquisitions and especially directly after a cut event would be required.
    In addition, a sampling explicitly designed to relate to backscatter signals would
    be required. Species categorization based on plant structure, SM, SCW, VWC are
    potential variables to be named here. Author responsibilities Felix Reuß: Formal

    the White method for estimating groundwater evapotranspiration: a consideration
    of sunset and sunrise timings Article 15 July 2019 Estimating Groundwater Evapotranspiration
    in Thiaroye Aquifer (Western Senegal) Chapter © 2019 Introduction Groundwater
    is the most reliable water source for most of the ecosystems in India, especially
    in tropical savanna regions [1]. India has two major groundwater systems, i.e.,
    (i) deep aquifers and (ii) shallow aquifers. In shallow aquifers, the saturated
    zone below the water table gets penetrated by plant roots and the roots extract
    water from the groundwater system [2]. Moreover, in many parts of the country
    with a shallow aquifer system during monsoon, the groundwater table rises to intersect
    the root zone. When the hydrological processes of a watershed is considered, evapotranspiration
    (ET) is a vital component in the hydrologic cycle at various spatiotemporal scales
    and is about 70% of the global annual precipitation [3]. Approximately 40% of
    the rainfall in India returns to the atmosphere as ET [4, 5]. It is observed that
    in the total ET, a reasonable portion of the groundwater also contributes which
    is termed groundwater evapotranspiration [ETG; 51]. In some cases, ETG exceeds
    85% of potential ET for shallow groundwater regions [6]. Thus, the estimation
    of ETG carries fundamental importance in water balance and management studies,
    sustainable water use in agriculture, as well as groundwater flow simulation studies
    at various spatiotemporal scales, and policy development for the sustainable use
    of groundwater resources. In the diverse ecosystem for sustainable water use and
    planning, considering the full range of ET losses becomes important [7,8,9]. In
    many reported groundwater balance studies, the ETG parameter has been either taken
    constant or ignored, which leads to uncertainty in the model predictions [8, 10,11,12].
    In drylands, the water table rises mainly due to deforestation resulting ETG of
    30–40% of the total recharge [13]. Further, as the water table depth increases
    the value of ETG decreases [14], and ETG becomes zero at a certain depth, demarketing
    the extinction depth [ED; 42]. ETG and the ED have both varied spatially and temporally
    corresponding to changes in vegetation cover, physical properties of soil, and
    aquifer properties [15,16,17]. Estimating the ETG and ED has great significance
    in groundwater resource management and precise water budgeting. However, very
    limited literature has been reported to investigate these two parameters in varying
    atmospheric settings and groundwater levels, also with heterogeneous land-use
    conditions at the basin scale [6, 18, 19]. It has always been challenging to quantify
    ETG directly because it includes complex physical processes and spatiotemporal
    variability [1, 20]. Few researchers have studied ETG from shallow water tables
    hypothetically, experimentally, and/or in situ. Isotopic tracers were used to
    determine the fraction of groundwater consumption by vegetation when water was
    isotopically differentiated from other sources [21, 22]. However, the method for
    estimating transpiration must be used in combination with the isotopic method.
    A water balance residual approach estimated groundwater evapotranspiration where
    the other components of water balance were calculated from monitored data [23].
    However, there were uncertainties regarding inflows and outflows. Lubczynski [8]
    modeled the ETG using the SEBAL model for semi-arid regions of Botswana and detected
    uncertainty in total recharge computation due to an error in ETG estimation resulting
    in depleted actual recharge. Another approach used mostly to quantify ETG is introduced
    by the [24] which analyzes the groundwater fluctuations in a shallow aquifer.
    Researchers have recognized this method as it refers to evapotranspiration from
    the groundwater as the daily groundwater consumption by the vegetation. The White
    method considered that the plants transpire in the daytime, leading to an upward
    groundwater flow as the plants consume it during that period, this consumption
    is more than groundwater recharge; therefore, the decline in groundwater level
    is observed. Additionally, according to White, at night time the photosynthesis
    process ceases (midnight to 4 A.M.), and gradually the water level increases.
    Thus, the diurnal fluctuation pattern in the water table is the combination of
    groundwater recovery and plant water use. Due to groundwater consumption by phreatophytes,
    the loss in water is directly measured through the change in water level, which
    is stated as the major advantage of employing diurnal water table fluctuations
    to estimate ET [25,26,27]. Moreover, this method was found to be reliable, cost-effective,
    and involves simple calculations [16, 28, 29]. Various studies accounted water
    table fluctuation method to estimate ETG for various land use types and arid regions
    like the recent study by [27], which investigated the forest ecosystem and they
    inferred that the water table fluctuation method was efficient and suitable for
    long-term ETG estimates. They observed that the riparian forest uses groundwater
    during the late growing stages. Similarly, [15] used the water table fluctuation
    (White) method to estimate ETG at different land uses for the semi-arid region.
    It was found that higher actual ET values were obtained where the water table
    was shallow suggesting it was due to groundwater consumption by grass vegetation.
    Considering the temperate region (Canada), [30] estimated ETG, which shows that
    tree-dominated areas consumed more groundwater than grass, indicating that the
    ignorance of ETG may lead to mismanagement of water resources in tree-dominated
    areas. Furthermore, many works of literature have presented the efficacy of the
    White method for wetlands [16, 18, 31], and areas with coarse soil [25, 26, 31],
    but studies on ETG estimation for Indian tropical regions with distinct wet and
    dry periods in the agriculture dominated watershed is limited. Although, the White
    method is more straightforward and has advantages, but consists of uncertainties
    reported in different studies. This is mainly related to the specific yield calculation
    [26, 32, 33] and consideration of smaller recovery time intervals [34]. Thus,
    the White method was modified by using the time-series function for a 24-h window,
    which estimates ETG on a monthly and weekly interval concomitant with water table
    fluctuations [34, 35]. In recent times, there has been an increase in the availability
    of spatiotemporal data with the help of satellites. The remote sensing approach
    provides long-term data (total terrestrial ET, soil moisture, precipitation, and
    energy fluxes), which can be further adapted to estimate ETG. High spatiotemporal
    resolution data provided by the satellites can be used to quantify ETG on a much
    finer scale and more accurately for a large area [8, 36, 37]. However, the direct
    measurement of ETG using remote sensing is difficult and impractical except in
    arid regions [8, 38]. In this study, we applied the modified White method to estimate
    groundwater evapotranspiration (ETG) and compared it with the original White [24]
    model for performance evaluation using diurnal water table fluctuation data in
    agriculture-dominated tropical savanna regions of Eastern India which is unexplored
    in the context of groundwater evapotranspiration estimates. Additionally, the
    use of remotely sensed soil moisture data with physical-based modeling was also
    adopted to determine the ETG at various land use/land cover (LULC) classes over
    the study basin to investigate spatially varying extinction depths of ETG for
    various LULC classes. In this process, we also compared the efficacy of the White
    [24] and modified White methods with the physical-based model for ETG predictions
    for agricultural lands. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this investigation
    is the first of its kind in an agriculture-dominated tropical savanna region with
    a shallow water table condition in the Indian subcontinent. The overarching objectives
    of the study were to (i) conduct a performance evaluation of White and modified
    White methods to estimate ETG in agriculture-dominated shallow water table conditions;
    (ii) compare both empirical methods with physical-based model prediction for agriculture
    land use; and (iii) determine the spatial variability of extinction depths for
    ETG for various LULC classes. Methodology Study Basin The study basin, Rana basin,
    is located in Eastern India at the middle reach of the Mahanadi River basin extending
    from 85°23′E to 85°38′E and 20°07′N to 20°25′N with an area of 424.13 km2 Fig.
    1; [39, 40]. This basin underlies the watershed of the last tributary of the Mahanadi
    River, which is seasonal and flows from south to north. The selection of the basin
    was based on the climatic conditions, LULC pattern, and depth to the water table
    [groundwater level (GWL)] distribution. According to Koeppen’s classification,
    this region falls under the tropical savanna type of climate with very hot temperatures
    in summer, ranging between 35 and 40 °C, and the minimum temperatures are usually
    between 12 and 14 °C. The rainfall varies from 100 to 200 cm/year [41] with distinct
    wet and dry periods. Around 70% of the average annual rainfall occurs in 3–4 months
    of the year [42]. Surface water availability is therefore limited to those 3–4
    months of the monsoon season followed by the dry season during the remaining months
    of the year. Therefore, the only alternative left is to use groundwater for agriculture
    as well as domestic purposes. The observed data of GWL fluctuation in 46 observation
    wells showed that the GWL in the area fluctuates between 0 to 12 m in the monsoon
    and 4 to 21 m in the non-monsoon periods [42]; Fig. 2. This tropical savanna region
    gains water during wet periods (monsoon) and loses water during drier periods
    (winter, post, and pre-monsoon). Since there is a reasonable portion of the basin
    with shallow GWL in the wet and dry period of the year, estimation of ETG for
    such conditions is imperative, which is limited due to the non-availability of
    suitable diurnal GWL data. The agriculture area covers approximately 73% of the
    total basin area. The main crop grown in these areas is rice (paddy). The agriculture
    here is primarily rainfed. Fig. 1 Study groundwater basin with the LULC patterns,
    ED estimation locations, and observation stations (red circles): Observatory #1
    and #2 Full size image Fig. 2 The GWL seasonal variability in the Rana groundwater
    basin. The rows a–d represent the four different seasons, namely winter (Jan.
    to Mar.), pre-monsoon (Apr. to June), monsoon (July to Oct), and post-monsoon
    (Nov. to Dec.), respectively. The blue circles are the observation wells monitored
    on a fortnightly basis Full size image Data Used Two observation wells were installed
    at Observatory #1 (20.367°N, 85.557°E) and Observatory #2 (20.439°N, 85.666°E)
    in the agricultural land use of the study basin (Jena et al., 2021). This study
    utilized the groundwater fluctuations observed for the year 2016 to estimate groundwater
    evapotranspiration (ETG). GWL below ground level (m bgl) were logged in 30-min
    intervals using conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors (CTD-10 Sensor, Decagon
    Devices, 2365 NE Hopkins Ct/Pullman, WA 99163, USA) that were installed in two
    observatories developed in the aforementioned locations (Fig. 1). This data had
    a few missing values and needed to be pre-processed before using them for analysis.
    Filling missing data was performed using a Fourier transform approach which proved
    to have higher accuracy than multiple imputations and expectation means for estimating
    missing values [43]. In this study, MATLAB R2015a was used to perform the computational
    part of the Fourier transform method. Additionally, the distributed monitoring
    of GWL at 46 observation wells was also carried out on a fortnightly basis between
    2015 and 2018 and was utilized in this study. Figure 2 shows the seasonality in
    GWL of the study basin. It can be very well felt that the GWL in the study basin
    was shallower, and during monsoon, it was within approximately 1 m bgl in the
    significant portion of the study basin. This study utilized the specific yield
    (Sy) values that were determined through its own pumping test and collected data
    from Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, for the whole
    study basin (Fig. 3). Specific yield values for Observatory #1 and Observatory
    #2 were 0.31 and 0.35, respectively. Thus, in this study, the more reliable solution
    for the estimation of specific yield problems mentioned in previous studies has
    been taken care of. Topsoil moisture data were obtained from SMOS Level 2 soil
    moisture product with a spatial resolution of 15 km [44], which was used in Hydrus
    1D-based modeling. The weather data required were obtained from the installed
    weather station in the two observatories, such as solar radiation, temperature,
    and precipitation. Fig. 3 The spatial distribution of aquifer Sy values obtained

    CGWB and our own pumping tests. The red triangles are the locations of CGWB with
    Sy values, and green circles present our pumping test points (in the continuous
    monitoring observatories) Full size image Diurnal Water Table Fluctuation Method
    (White Method) As proposed by a study in 1932 [24], diurnal trends of the water
    table from wells can be used to estimate the consumptive use of groundwater by
    phreatophytes. As plants transpire water during the day, causing an upward flow
    of groundwater due to consumption by the plants which is much more than groundwater
    recovery. This leads to the decline of groundwater level. According to this method
    $${ET}_G={S}_y\\left(24r\\pm s\\right)$$ (1) where Sy is the specific yield, r
    is the rate of water table rise at night-time (00:00 to 04:00) (mm h−1), and s
    is the net change in water table over 24 h (mm). The influx rate of groundwater
    throughout the day was assumed as constant in this method. However, in real scenarios,
    groundwater recovery rates vary within 24 h [35], leading to uncertainties with
    this method. Majorly, the methodology was conducted only for coarse sediments
    such as sand and gravel [15, 26] and not for fine-grained soil types. Also, when
    the land-use type is considered, this method has been majorly implemented on wetlands
    [6, 18, 28, 31], grasslands [15], and forests [32] but not in agricultural-dominated
    areas. Initially, in the present study, the monthly average ETG values were evaluated
    using the White method, and later in the study ETG from different methods was
    compared. The observed water table fluctuation data for the study site was collected
    from the two observatory wells as discussed in the data section for the year 2016.
    The specific yield values used were 0.31 and 0.35 for two observatory wells respectively
    obtained from pumping test and CGWB. Modified White Method Recently, a modified
    White method has been proposed which expresses the groundwater with the periodic
    nature of diurnal fluctuations in shallow GWL [34]. Most of the previous literature
    is based on analyzing the GWL fluctuations for wetlands but limited studies have
    focused on the diurnal variation approach. Thus, the modified White method [34]
    was applied in an agriculture-dominated shallow water table with tropical savanna
    climatic conditions in this case study. The diurnal fluctuation offers a practical
    and simplified alternative method for estimating ET. White [24], initially established
    a relation between specific yield and groundwater recovery to estimate ETG. White
    stated that the time rate of change in groundwater storage in the vicinity of
    the well is equal to the time rate of change in water table depth times the specific
    yield [35]. This storage is controlled by the net flow of groundwater to/from
    the vicinity of the well [r(t)] and the groundwater consumption rate ETG. Some
    assumptions were considered in this study as recommended by [35] to ensure the
    validity of Eq. 2. Quantification of ETG was done using the following governing
    equation suggested by White: $$\\frac{S_yd{Z}_{wt}}{dt}=r(t)-{ET}_G(t)$$ (2) where
    Sy is the specific yield; r is the groundwater recovery; Z is the height of water
    table Eq. (1) is integrated over a time interval ∆t to solve for total ETG: $${ET}_G={S}_y\\left({r}_{gw}\\pm
    s\\right)$$ (3) where ETG was the daily total ETG rate (mm/day), rgw was estimated
    between midnight and 4:00 A.M. as the hourly rate of water table rise when transpiration
    was assumed to be negligible, and s was estimated as the net rise or fall of the
    GWL during the 24-h period (i.e., the daily change in storage). Positive or negative
    signs in Eq. 3 were used when the water table fell or rose, respectively. Czikowsky
    and Fitzjarrald [45] studied diurnal streamflow signals and suggested that the
    Fourier methodology (a sine function) could further be used to describe diurnal
    variations as a modification in the conventional White method. Soylu et al. [34]
    suggested that the diurnal fluctuations often follow a periodic and sinusoidal
    nature in shallow groundwater levels, which can be represented in the sinusoidal
    wave function considering the overall rise and fall in the groundwater table.
    In the present study, the weekly and monthly ETG were represented by the diurnal
    variations of groundwater. A sine function defining the streamflow was presented
    as a time series function (Eq. 4) by [45], and the various coefficients were calculated
    by empirically fitting the data. $$Z(t)= At+D+ Bsin\\left[\\frac{2\\pi \\left(t+E\\right)}{24}\\right]$$
    (4) where Z is the discharge or stage (L), t is time (in hours, T), A is the 3-day
    trend (LT−1), D is the mean bias (L), B is the diurnal amplitude (L), and E is
    the diurnal signal phase (T). $${S}_y\\Delta {Z}_{wt}(t)={S}_y\\left[{Z}_{wt}(t)-{Z}_o\\right]={\\int}_{\\Delta

    dt=D+ At+ Bsin\\left[\\frac{2\\pi \\left(t+E\\right)}{24}\\right]$$ (6) Using
    this approach, the estimation of ETG was done by relating Eq. 5 to the governing
    equation for shallow GWL fluctuations, Eq. 3. In Eq. 6, D represents the initial
    GWL. The combined effects of both groundwater recovery and plant transpiration
    are accounted for under the observed water level At, whereas, the ETG term∫ETGdt
    is represented by the sine function. The water level trend was majorly contributed
    by ETG, depicting the whole trend as the result of ETG. The detrending process
    was executed on the water level time series (removing D + At) in Eq. 6, which
    will remove a significant share of the ETG signal. After the detrending, the term
    that remains on the right-hand side of Eq. 6 was the sine function with amplitude
    B (peak-to-trough = 2B). Equating the daily total transpiration to Sy(2B) might
    result in a significant underestimation of ETG. So a correction factor was introduced,
    i.e., scaling factor (k) is a function of solar radiation. In this, the hourly
    solar radiation values were accrued over multiple days, and the scaling factor
    was evaluated [34]. The simplified ETG model as a function of specific yield and
    the scaling factors were established. $${ET}_G={S}_yk(2B)$$ (7) Weekly and monthly
    average ETG was estimated using Eq. 7 and utilizing groundwater fluctuation data
    for the year 2016 at Observatory #1 and Observatory #2 wells where the sensors
    were installed in the observation wells. The obtained ETG results of Observatory
    #1 and Observatory #2 sites were compared with the crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    that was obtained using crop coefficient and potential evapotranspiration (ETo).
    The Penman-Monteith equation was adopted for the calculation of daily ETo that
    combines the energy balance equation with mass transfer [46] The crop coefficient
    (Kc) value used was 0.75 for the rice crop and sub-humid conditions [47]. Meteorological
    data (solar radiation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature,
    relative humidity, and wind velocity) were collected from the weather station
    installed in the observatory. Estimation of ETG and Extinction Depth Using Physical-based
    Modeling The Hydrus-based ETG was also estimated using soil moisture (SM) data
    obtained from SMOS Level 2 soil moisture products with a spatial resolution of
    15 km. The study considered four soil layers at 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–60 cm, and
    60–100 cm. The vegetation root depth in the upper 1 m of soil varies with land
    use type. Simulation using Hydrus-1D was performed to estimate moisture variations
    in the soil profile [15, 48, 49]. Richard’s equation is used in Hydrus-1D model
    to simulate the variably saturated flow. The equation is given as follows: $$\\frac{\\partial
    \\theta }{\\partial t}=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\left[K\\left(\\frac{\\partial
    h}{\\partial x}+\\cos \\beta \\right)\\right]-S$$ (8) where h is water pressure
    head, θ is volumetric water content, t is time, x is spatial coordinate, β is
    angle between the flow direction and the vertical axis, K is unsaturated hydraulic
    conductivity, and S represents the sink term. The Mualem-van Genuchten functions
    [15, 50, 51] were used to describe the relationship between θ, K, and h. The sink
    term “S” in Eq. 8 describes the volume of water removed from a unit volume of
    soil due to plant water uptake and was defined as follows [15]: $${S}_h={\\alpha}_h{S}_p$$
    (9) where α(h) is the root water uptake function and Sp is the potential water
    uptake rate. The potential rate characterizes the water uptake rate when the plant
    is not experiencing any stress, i.e., α(h) is equal to one. Vegetation extracts
    water for ET both from the vadose zone and the saturated zone [52, 53]. It was
    assumed that the total ET loss in the area is equivalent to the crop ET loss determined
    using potential evapotranspiration. Thus, it can also be said that total ET loss
    is due to ETG and vadose zone contribution (VZET), which need to be evaluated
    individually. Here, the VZET was estimated using soil moisture (SM) data (Eq.
    10) for the entire column at different time steps and by subtracting two sequential
    values of modeled SM [50]. The groundwater consumption by vegetation is obtained
    as the difference between total evapotranspiration and VZET Eq. 11. Evapotranspiration
    or vadose zone loss: $$VZC\\ or\\ ETL\\mid {t}_i={\\int}_{\\Delta s}{\\theta}_{model}\\
    dz\\mid {t}_i-1\\kern0.5em -{\\int}_{\\Delta s}{\\theta}_{model}\\ dz \\mid {t}_i$$
    (10) where θmodel is the simulated water content at depth z from the land surface
    at time ti. ∆s is the length of a soil column. $$GWC= TETL- VZC$$ (11) where TETL
    is the total ET loss; GWC is the groundwater contribution. Groundwater evapotranspiration
    for time interval Δt is calculated as follows: $${ET}_G=\\frac{GWC}{\\Delta t}$$
    (12) The ratio of groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspiration
    is calculated and the depth at which the ratio is less than 0.5% that level of
    the water table is said to be extinction depth (ED). Results and Discussion Estimation
    of ETG Using White and Modified White Method The groundwater fluctuation data
    which was obtained using the CTD sensors installed in Observatory #1 and #2 for
    the year 2016 was used to estimate daily ETG. From Fig. 4, it can be observed
    that there is an upward trend in the groundwater level before and after the growing
    season in the study region that starts in July and ends in September. During this
    period of July-September, the water table rose to 3.5–4.5 m and from 3.5 to 7
    m for Observatory #1 and #2, respectively. In Oct-Nov, the transpiration demands
    are satisfied by the surface and unsaturated zone moisture as the GWL can be seen
    decreasing during this period. Whereas, it can also be observed that during the
    dry season of the year (February-April), great variation in the GWL depth was
    observed between the two observatories, with Observatory #1 having a GWL of 3–5.5
    m whereas Observatory #2 with 7–8 m. Fig. 4 Daily GWL (m bgl) for the year 2016
    at Observatory #1 (blue) and Observatory #2 (orange) Full size image Initially,
    the ETG for both stations was estimated using the White (1932) method. The results
    obtained can be seen in Fig. 5 with daily ETG values for Observatory #1 varied
    from 0 to 8.84 mm/day during Jan-Dec 2016 (Fig. 4). Similarly, at Observatory
    #2, daily ETG values vary from 0 to 5.12 mm/day using the White method for 2016
    (Fig. 5). The mean daily ETG value for Observatory #1 and Observatory #2 was found
    to be 3.08 mm/day and 0.95 mm/day, respectively. In the growing season of India
    (July-Oct), the ETG values increased for both observatories. The ETG values are
    less for the dry periods of the year, i.e., December and May-June for Observatory
    #1. This method gave reasonable estimation for this study, which is similar to
    the study by [31]. However, the model struggles with fine-grain materials and
    the associated specific yield [31]. Fig. 5 Daily groundwater evapotranspiration
    (mm/day) for the year 2016 at Observatory #1 (blue) and Observatory #2 (green)
    stations Full size image Further, the modified White method was implemented in
    the study to estimate ETG on a monthly time scale. The seasonal trend of ETG values
    matches with the trend obtained by the White method with lesser values of ETG
    during the April-June (mostly dry) months of the year. The average, maximum, and
    minimum ETG values for Observatory #1 were 2.25 mm/day, 3.91 mm/day, and 0.84
    mm/day, respectively (Fig. 6). Similarly, at Observatory #2, the average, maximum,
    and minimum monthly ETG values were 2.03 mm/day, 2.37 mm/day, and 1.74 mm/day,
    respectively. Subsequently, similar to [28] the performance was compared among
    the White and modified White methods. Fig. 6 Monthly groundwater evapotranspiration
    (mm/day) for the year 2016 at Observatory #1(blue bars) and Observatory #2 (green
    bars) station Full size image Estimation of ETG Using Hydrus-1D Using Hydrus-1D
    and remote sensing soil moisture turned out to be a useful and convenient method
    for spatial analysis of groundwater evapotranspiration (ETG) in the Rana basin.
    The results showed that ETG using Hydrus-1D follows the pattern observed using
    the modified White method. The average monthly ETG value for the year 2016 was
    obtained to be 2.82, whereas the maximum was observed in the driest month of the
    year, i.e., April (5.03 mm/day), and the minimum monthly ETG was in September
    observed to be 1.68 mm/day (Fig. 7). The monthly ETG presented in Fig. 7 highly
    correlates with the wetting and drying cycle corresponding to the tropical savanna
    climate with monsoon as the major source. The study conducted by [35, 37] has
    also a similar conclusion on the periodicity of the estimation. Fig. 7 Monthly
    groundwater evapotranspiration (mm/day) for the year 2016 at Observatory #1 station
    Full size image The spatial distribution of ETG for eight different points selected
    based on soil and land use type is presented in Fig. 8. The figure illustrates
    that the average ETG is low (1.5–2 mm/day) for the month of June-Sept (wet period),
    which supports the fact that groundwater contribution will be less to total ET.
    This period of monsoon is the cultivation period of rice which has a maximum root
    depth of 60 cm which will lead to more vadose zone contribution to total ET. The
    values of ETG vary with time and spatially due to the heterogeneity of the study
    area. Maximum ETG is observed in the northern part of the basin which is near
    the riverbank, for all three periods. The southern region of the basin contributes
    very little to the ET. The major portion of the basin has a continuous contribution
    to ETG owing to the agricultural activities and shallow GWL (Figs. 2 and 8). Comparing
    Figs. 2 and 8, it can be observed that there is a spatial correlation between
    the GWL and the amount of ETG been contributed by the areas with shallow GWL regions.
    It can be observed from Fig. 8 that in the major portion of the year, the southern
    regions of the Rana basin with deeper GWL contribute the minimum to ETG. Fig.
    8 Spatial distribution of average groundwater evapotranspiration (mm/day) for
    the year 2016 in the Rana groundwater basin Full size image Comparison of ETG
    Estimation Methods A comparison of ETG from White, Modified White, and Hydrus-1D
    is presented in Fig. 9. It was observed that the White method was over-estimating
    in some months with values higher than the Hydrus-1D ETG. This can also be summarized
    by calculating the departure of White and modified White ETG from the Hydrus-based
    ETG for the year 2016. The departure value obtained for the White method is −0.603,
    as it is over-estimating. On the other hand, the departure value is 0.56 for the
    modified White method. This suggests that the modified White method performed
    considerably better than the White method. Fig. 9 Groundwater evapotranspiration
    (ETG) for the duration of Jan-Dec 2016 at Observatory #1 (monthly average) using
    White, modified White, and Hydrus-1D Full size image At Observatory #1, statistical
    comparisons of estimated ETG and observed ET values were performed using the coefficient
    of determination (R2) and RMSE values. The modified White method produced higher
    R2 values (0.88) compared to the White method (0.40) for the weekly time scale.
    The modified White method also reduces ETG RMSE from 0.64 in the White method
    to 0.27. Thus, the results indicate that the modified White method provides an
    improved alternative to the White [24] method in estimating groundwater evapotranspiration
    using GWL fluctuations in agriculture-dominated regions. The relationship between
    monthly averages of potential evapotranspiration (ETo) and ETG is shown in Fig.
    10 for Observatory #1. It can be concluded from Fig. 10 that the modified White
    method for Observatory #1 station gives considerably accurate results as ETG obtained
    was nearly 50–70% of ETo, which is also the case for Hydrus-1D ETG and is reasonable
    for the actual condition. Whereas, in some cases the White method overestimated
    ETG values, resulting in undesirable results. It is also evident that the pattern
    of estimated ETG and the potential ET has a strong correlation. A similar relationship
    was also observed for Observatory #2 with ETG obtaining nearly 40–70% of ETo.
    The percentage contribution of ETG to ETo was observed to be significant and this
    may lead to prediction uncertainty if the ETG is ignored in the groundwater water
    balance modeling. Fig. 10 Monthly average evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspiration
    at Observatory #1 for the year 2016 Full size image Estimation of Extinction Depth
    Using Soil Moisture Data The spatial variation of extinction depth for groundwater
    evapotranspiration and GWL are presented in Fig. 11, and it can be observed that
    during the pre-monsoon period, i.e., January to May, the GWL was below the extinction
    depth in the southern part of the basin, which indicated that this area has negligible
    contribution to the ETG. This finding was also in line with the findings presented
    in the “Estimation of ETG Using Hydrus-1D” section. A reverse scenario was witnessed
    in the upper region, where the GWL was shallower (1–3 m) than the extinction depth
    (5–9 m) indicating the region’s contribution to the ETG. A similar condition was
    observed in the middle region with a significant amount of ETG contribution from
    this region, which can also be seen in Fig. 7. During the monsoon period, i.e.,
    the months of June-September, it always contributes some amount to ETG, but the
    value of ETG was less as compared to another period of the year, as it was a cultivation
    period of rice with a maximum root depth of 60 cm and water-logging condition,
    which leads to more vadose zone contribution than groundwater. High variation
    in extinction depth was found in the post-monsoon period from October to December.
    It was also found that the lower portion of the region which is a hard rock area
    attained the extinction depth of 1–3 m, but the GWL is much lower than that; indicating,
    less ETG values in this region. During the January to May period, the basin’s
    southern region GWL was lower than extinction depth, indicating no contribution
    to ETG. The prior studies with study regions having deeper GWL have also shown
    no intersection of GWL and extinction depth producing similar contributions [15,
    50]. Fig. 11 Spatial distribution of maximum extinction depth (m) and average
    GWL (m) for the year 2016 in Rana basin Full size image Conclusions Groundwater
    evapotranspiration for varying soil-LULC types in tropical savanna with shallow
    water tables was analyzed using White, modified White, and physical-based (Hydrus-1D)
    approaches. Due to rainfall in the monsoon season, the GWL of the region rises,
    and during the non-monsoon period, the GWL declines. According to the White theory,
    the pattern of diurnal fluctuations in the GWL was caused majorly due to groundwater
    recovery and plant water use. This theory was applied to estimate ETG, and it
    is observed that the White method sometimes overestimates the ETG, which may induce
    uncertainty in groundwater flow models. On the other hand, the modified White
    method gave reliable and accurate results. The ETG obtained was nearly 50–70%
    of ETo. In the dry period, as the topsoil moisture level was reduced, ETG values
    obtained were higher than in the wet period of the year, showing lesser vadose
    zone contribution and an increase in the consumption of groundwater by the plants.
    In contrast, during the wet period, the surface and vadose zone satisfy the transpiration
    demands of plants. The modified White approach used in this study had a higher
    R2 value (0.88) than the original White method (0.40) for a seven-day timeframe,
    improving the accuracy of ETG estimation. The daily to monthly fluctuations in
    ETG can also be calculated using this method. Physical-based estimation of ETG
    using remote sensing data produced reliable results for data-scarce and remote
    regions. Extinction depth values that identified areas contributing to ETG showed
    large spatial variability. For the Rana basin, the extinction depth ranged from
    1 to 3 m in certain areas with hard rock and from 5 to 9 m in other parts. Conclusively,
    the adopted methodology can be applied in similar hydroclimatic conditions, and
    the same can contribute to a basin to regional-scale water management. The modified
    White method can be a reliable, accurate, and cost-effective alternative to data-intensive
    physical-based approaches for the precise estimation of ETG taking monitored water
    table fluctuation data in the tropical savanna regions with similar groundwater
    systems. Many vegetation types with deep root systems depend upon groundwater
    for their transpiration requirements, thus the investigation of the groundwater
    consumed by vegetation as evapotranspiration is necessary for the reliable management
    of groundwater and overall water resources at a regional scale. The effects of
    varying cropland over years where ETG changes with crop growth and irrigation
    schemes could be explored in the future along with the inclusion of various soil
    properties. Additionally, The reliability of the modified White method for the
    deep-rooted forest covers of different categories will be an interesting future
    study. Using remote sensing data is reliable for data-scarce and inaccessible
    regions, which gave considerable estimates for ETG. Additional studies should
    be performed to test these methods in different climatic conditions. The framework
    proposed through this study for shallow and agriculture-dominated regions is associated
    with ground observations at high temporal scales, which is often challenging for
    developing countries. However, the magnitude of contribution the ETG is making
    for total ETO demands sagacious attention to the parameter. References Orellana

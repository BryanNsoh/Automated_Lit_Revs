    IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and its relevant
    market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration of multiple
    devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal and external
    states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT has become the
    megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the whole business
    spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity of end devices,
    system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple applications
    such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic congestion
    industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work has been
    done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming solutions
    [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by examining
    multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with the advancement
    of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists and technologists
    are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer are facing such as
    shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues [6], [7]. State-of-the-art
    IoT technologies have detected all these issues and provide solutions to increase
    productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made on wireless sensors networks
    enable us to collect data from sensing devices and send it to the main servers
    [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information about different environmental
    condition to monitor the whole system properly. Monitoring the environmental conditions
    or crop productivity is not only the factor for the evaluation of crop but there
    are many other factors which effect the crops’ productivity, e.g. field management,
    soil and crop monitoring, movement of an unwanted object, attacks of wild animals,
    and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover, IoT provides a well-organized scheduling
    of restricted resources which makes sure that the best use of IoT enhances the
    productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram showing the agricultural trends
    which provide easy and cost effective interactions through a secure and unblemished
    connectivity across individual Greenhouse, Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring.
    Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks using the wireless devices enable real
    time crop and animal monitoring. The figure shows that two sensor kits (Libelium
    Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit)
    have been implemented which monitor the soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature,
    humidity, productivity, and air flow. While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal
    health, fertility, feeding, ruminating and resting. The agricultural servers,
    gateways, and agriculture database play an important role to store agriculture
    records and provide on demand agricultural services to authorized users. FIGURE
    1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole, in agriculture field there are multiple
    applications, protocols and prototypes. IoT agriculture research trends include
    network platform, network architecture, applications, security, and challenges
    among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many countries and organizations over globe
    different IoT policies and guidelines have been implemented in agriculture field.
    However in IoT agricultural environment a reasonable amount of work has been done
    and there is a need of thorough study on IoT in agriculture context to understand
    the current research status. To transform agriculture technologies via IoT innovation
    this paper analyzes various issues and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research
    as a contribution following IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature:
    Present major components of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies
    in Section II. Section III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture
    of IoT that involves network architecture and layers, network topologies used;
    and devices and protocols used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains
    and relevant smart phone and sensor based applications have been discussed in
    Section IV. The security and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been
    discussed in Section V. The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI
    that provides the details related to top technology industries investing in this
    area. The IoT agricultural policies made by different countries for the standardization
    of IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section VII. This section also
    presents few success stories in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges
    to improve IoT based agricultural technologies from many aspects have been presented
    in Section VIII. SECTION II. Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT
    Based Smart Farming A. Major Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart
    farming consist of four major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major
    components of IoT based smart farming. Show All These four major components are
    physical structure, data acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The
    physical structure is the most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid
    any unwanted happening. Whole system is designed in such a way which controls
    the sensors, actuators, and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil
    sensing, temperature sensing, weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing.
    Similarly devices perform many control functions like, node discovery, device
    identification and naming services etc. All these functions are performed by any
    device or sensor which is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling
    operation is performed by any remote device or a computer which is connected through
    the Internet. Data Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely:
    IoT data acquisition and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition
    component consists of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT), Websocket, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can
    be used for the implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data
    acquisition ZigBee, WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS
    protocols have been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are
    image or video processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining
    as shown in Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be
    added that may work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists
    of two main features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves
    three main application in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field
    Monitoring, and Green house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock
    via multiple sensors which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like
    temperature, heart rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications
    intend to report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature,
    humidity, gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring
    [12], [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    ABSTRACT \nIn the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply\
    \ \nchains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many global\
    \ \nproblems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate \nchange,\
    \ and weather disasters. It has known that technological \nopportunities are available\
    \ for human beings to get out of these \npredicaments, solving the interconnections\
    \ between food-water-energy- \nclimate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional \nto digital. \n \nThe aim of this review is to gain holistic\
    \ solutions in a systematic \nview, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural\
    \ digital \ntransformation that will play role in sustainable development. The\
    \ \ntransition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering \nagricultural\
    \ and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital \nagriculture\
    \ combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are \nhandled based\
    \ on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and \nlogistics. Digital\
    \ technologies are explained with application examples \nsuch as the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial \nintelligence, decision\
    \ support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, \nreal-time monitoring systems\
    \ tracking whole conditions of animals in \nlivestock, the IoT-based irrigation\
    \ and fertilization systems that help \nenhance the efficiency of irrigation processes\
    \ and minimize water and \nfertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses,\
    \ blockchain-based \nelectronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and\
    \ robotics that \nreduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.\
    \ Moreover, \nrenewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between \n\
    technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and \nenergy\
    \ production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and \ndrip irrigation\
    \ systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a \nresult, for a sustainable\
    \ future, technological innovations that increase \ncrop productivity and improve\
    \ crop quality, protect the environment, \nprovide efficient resource use and\
    \ decrease input costs can help us facing \nin agriculture of today overwhelm\

    \ Faculty of Agriculture \n \n1. Introduction \n \nAgriculture producing food,\
    \ feed, fibers, fuel, and raw materials by cultivating plants and breeding livestock\
    \ is one of the oldest \nand most vital sources in the civilization of human beings\
    \ and in the economic growth of each country that forms the backbone. \nThe latest\
    \ FAO report (FAO 2017a) emphasized that the world's population will be near 10\
    \ billion by 2050, and agriculture will \nbe a more deeply key role each day for\
    \ the continuation of life and socio-economic development. It has been predicted\
    \ that \nincreases in food, water and energy demands will be 60% (FAO 2012), 55%\
    \ (OECD 2012) and 50% (EIA 2019) by 2050, \nrespectively. \n \nAt global level,\
    \ while consuming approximately 30% of the total energy in during agri-food production,\
    \ this causes nearly \none third of GHG emissions (FAO 2020; Platis et al. 2019).\
    \ Global food systems are responsible for about 25% to 42% of all \nglobal greenhouse\
    \ gas (GHG) emissions emitted during production, processing, transportation, packaging,\
    \ consuming, and \ndisposing of food according to a study carried out for the\
    \ years 1990-2015 (Crippa et al. 2021). \n \nWhile agriculture is the pillar of\
    \ food security, it is the largest user of freshwater that affects energy security\
    \ (Tian et al. \n2018). Global projections indicate that the demand for clean\
    \ water, energy, and food will increase significantly in the coming \nyears (Hoff\
    \ 2011).  \n \nToday, agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater use and\
    \ 34% of land use, putting unsustainable pressure on our \nnatural resources (Lee\
    \ 2019). Also, water use is 80-90% in the agri-food sector including irrigation\
    \ (FAO 2016; Bundschuh et \nal. 2107). But irrigation only amounts can reach as\
    \ much as 95 percent in some developing countries (Mohtar & Daher 2016; \nFAO\
    \ 2017b). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n374 \n \nWater plays a key role in socioeconomic\
    \ development that strongly connects food and energy (Daher et al. 2019). Industry\
    \ \nconsumes 22% of water resources, most of which is used for cooling thermal\
    \ processes in electricity generation (EIA 2016). If \naction is not taken now,\
    \ such expanding gap between resource supply and demand would be further occurs\
    \ deep problems related \nto continuous population growth, climate change and\
    \ extreme climatic events, socio-economic development.  \n \nBoth agricultural\
    \ activities and production of food consume at large amounts of water and energy\
    \ (Roidt & Avellán 2019). \nTherefore, water, energy, and food (WEF) are three\
    \ strategic resources for the sustainable development of national economies \n\
    (Purwanto et al. 2019). It is becoming increasingly difficult to ensure sufficient\
    \ WEF with the impact of climate change, \npopulation growth, changing diets,\
    \ urbanization, and aging (Zhang et al. 2018; Alcon et al. 2019).  \n \nAgriculture\
    \ is also a major source of water pollution from nutrients, pesticides, and other\
    \ contaminants, which if unmanaged \ncan lead to significant social, economic,\
    \ and environmental costs (FAO 2017). In the recent decades, agriculture is beset\
    \ by two \nmajor discrepancies: the first conflict is between resources supply\
    \ and demand, while the second conflict is between economic \ndevelopment and\
    \ environmental protection (Yue & Guo 2021). \n \nIn recent years, global climate\
    \ change has caused many irregular and extreme weather events in many parts of\
    \ the world (Li \net al. 2021). As a result of global warming, intense drought,\
    \ severe hurricanes and storms, and extreme floods have begun to be \nexperienced\
    \ intensely in different parts of the world (FAO 2021). In addition, the success\
    \ of crop and animal production varies \ndepending on the short and long-term\
    \ complex environmental effects of global warming and climate change (Hatfield\
    \ et al. \n2011). In many places of the world, plants are negatively affecting\
    \ by climate conditions that are very hot or very cold, and wet \nor dry (Hatfield\
    \ et al. 2015; FAO 2019). Rising seed, fertilizer prices and wages, epidemic and\
    \ vegetative diseases, trade wars, \nflash floods, heatwaves, and other weather\
    \ changes negatively affect agriculture. To meet these challenges and meet the\
    \ demands \nof the future, countries need to develop policies and programs in\
    \ a sustainable way. \n \nIn a report published by UNECE (2021), it was emphasized\
    \ that demographic, economic, social, and climatic changes, were \nall exerting\
    \ increasing pressure on natural resources, including through a seemingly ever-growing\
    \ global demand for energy, \nfood, and water that threatens the ecosystems. As\
    \ a solution, the key to shifting towards sustainable development was highlighted\
    \ \nthat lies in the strategic decisions to be taken regarding natural resources,\
    \ which need to be better valued and more responsibly \nmanaged. \n \nAmong literature\
    \ studies reviewed, no article has been found that analyzes in view of systematic\
    \ and holistic related to digital \ntransition and transformation for a sustainable\
    \ future in agriculture. Most of the literature focuses on individual integration\
    \ of \nAgriculture 4.0 technologies and their applications in different sectors.\
    \ This review aims to close the study gap with a systematic \napproach, analyzing\
    \ digital technologies in agriculture for a sustainable future based on “Energy-Water-Food”\
    \ Nexus. \n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives\
    \ the development roadmap of industrial revolutions and \nagricultural revolutions.\
    \ Section 3 introduces sustainable food and agriculture, water-energy-food nexus,\
    \ and digital \ntransformation concepts. Section 4 discusses precision agriculture\
    \ and Agriculture 4.0 topics under the smart farming heading, \ncovering novel\
    \ technologies, digital transition and challenges. Section 5 introduces renewable\
    \ energy and environmental \ntechnologies, new combined solutions; and discussion\
    \ and conclusions are presented in the 6th and 7th sections, respectively. \n\
    \ \n2. Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions \n \nThe expression Industry 4.0\
    \ was used to point out new tsunami of technological progress that was defined\
    \ in 2015 by Schwab \nas the “fourth industrial revolution” (Schwab 2015). While\
    \ the first industrial revolution in the 18th century was characterized \nby transition\
    \ from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy, the second industrial\
    \ revolution covered from water and \nsteam power to electric power (Adebanjo\
    \ et al. 2020). \n \nThe evolution of agriculture, from the primitive level to\
    \ the advanced level of today, took place gradually over time. Figure \n1 shows\
    \ together schematic timelines of both industrial revolutions and agricultural\
    \ revolutions. Technological developments in \nagriculture are divided into 4\
    \ long-term and named the transformation from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          375 \n \n \n \nFigure 1-\
    \ Time lines of industrial revolutions and agricultural revolutions (Liu et al.\
    \ 2021) \n \nPeriod that is conventional agriculture practices from antique ages\
    \ when farmers mostly used domestic hand tools for \ncultivation mainly relying\
    \ on manpower and animal forces to the end of the 19th century is accepted as\
    \ Agriculture 1.0. \n \nAgriculture 2.0 is referred as the period that is the\
    \ increase food production and reduce hand jobs between 1784 and almost \n1870,\
    \ when agricultural machinery was used for soil tillage, sowing, weeding, irrigation,\
    \ and harvesting (Liu et al. 2021). \n \nAfter passing from the main steam power\
    \ to oil and gas power, the industry 2.0 period of the 20th century started. Due\
    \ to \ndevelopments in the energy and transportation sectors, agricultural products\
    \ were started shipping to long distances. Resulting, \nfar communities connected\
    \ together and new agriculture markets emerged that farmers can sell their produce\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nThe first assembly line that significantly increased efficiency\
    \ and productivity was set up for mass production (Zhai et al. 2020). \nThe first\
    \ agricultural mass production was applied to meat production in livestock. All\
    \ these developments provided making for \nlarge-scale intensive animal farming.\
    \ \n \n“The Green Revolution” era, namely Agriculture 2.0, is the phase of farming\
    \ that began in the late 1950s when new agronomic \nmanagement practices, new\
    \ synthetic pesticides, and fertilizers were used in agricultural fields and various\
    \ machines were \nmanually operated by farmers (Zambon et al. 2019). Thus, yields,\
    \ productivity, and returns increased at all levels (CEMA 2017a). \nAlthough increased\
    \ productivity and improved efficiency were achieved thanks to mechanization,\
    \ all of them, overconsumption \nof fossil fuels, water, and chemicals caused\
    \ the destruction of the environment. Indeed, still today, mankind continues the\
    \ \ndevastations with effects so great that it changes the climate in many parts\
    \ of the world.  Furthermore, the first programmable \nlogic controller (PLC)\
    \ was used in industry in 1969, depending on electronics and on information technology\
    \ (Yülek 2018). \n \nAgriculture 3.0, called also \"Precision Farming\" emerged\
    \ thanks to advances carried out on computing and electronics. These \ndevelopments\
    \ provided saving on energy in machinery use of and saving on the water in irrigation,\
    \ and reducing in use of \nchemicals in the field and, thanks to increasing operational\
    \ performance of agricultural systems (Ahmad & Nabi 2021). \nAccording to the\
    \ definition of the International Society of Precision Agriculture (PA), “Precision\
    \ Agriculture is a management \nstrategy that gathers, processes, and analyses\
    \ temporal, spatial, and individual data and combines it with other information\
    \ to \nguide site, plant, or animal-specific management decisions to improve resource\
    \ efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and \nsustainability of agricultural\
    \ production.” (ISPA 2021). \n \nAlthough agriculture has been affected from every\
    \ era of industrial revolutions, it should be noted the digital transformation\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector started with PA. Today, the agricultural sector\
    \ is experiencing a new revolution, called Agriculture 4.0 \nfrom with the affecting\
    \ of digital technologies also in \"Industry 4.0\" entered our life in 2011. \
    \ \n \n3. Sustainability for Future  \n \n \nUnited Nations (UNs) called for a\
    \ universal action plan related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted\
    \ on 25 \nSeptember 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives\
    \ of everyone, everywhere. The 17 goals are part of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable\
    \ Development. This agenda sets out a 15-year (2016-2030) plan to achieve the\
    \ goals. These were \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n376 \n \nplanned to help measure\
    \ progress in each of the 193 countries that agreed to work towards achieving\
    \ the goals. SDGs 17 targets \nare illustrated holistically in Figure 2 (United\
    \ Nations 2015).   \n \nAs highlighted in report prepared by The World in 2050\
    \ initiative, governments that signed the 2030 agenda of the Sustainable \nDevelopment\
    \ Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are calling for profound\
    \ transformations that will \nrequire complementary actions from civil society,\
    \ science and business (TWI2050 2018). \n \n \n \nFigure 2- Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals numbered according to icons accepted by United Nations (United Nations\
    \ 2015) \n \nSetting off to carry out the activities in The World in 2050 initiative,\
    \ Sachs et al. (2019) presented six SDG transformations \nto achieve SDG targets.\
    \ Among which, Transformation 4 has taken attention as one of the key parts covering\
    \ sustainable food, \nland, water, and oceans. Transformation 6 covers the digital\
    \ revolution for sustainable development comes forward as a foremost \nforce that\
    \ makes a difference, also it has been also pointed out as the Fourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution. \n \nIn Trends in Biotechnology published in 2021, it emphasized\
    \ that biotechnology to be coupled with digital technologies will \nplay a key\
    \ role in transforming current land-use systems in the future (Goh et al. 2021).\
    \ \n \n3.1. Sustainable food and agriculture  \n \nThe FAO has established five\
    \ basic principles that will provide to become increasingly productive and sustainable,\
    \ building a \nproduction system that works in favour of the ecosystem, satisfying\
    \ human needs to achieve 2030 SDG targets. FAO’s five basic \nprinciples are:\
    \ (1) Increasing productivity, employment, and value addition in food systems,\
    \ (2) Protecting and enhancing natural \nresources, (3) Improving livelihoods\
    \ and fostering inclusive economic growth, (4) Enhancing the resilience of people,\
    \ \ncommunities, and ecosystems, and (5) Adapting governance to new challenges\
    \ (FAO 2018). \n \nMoreover, the 20 practical and interconnected actions integrated\
    \ by FAO (2018) are prepared for decision-makers to provide \ntransformations\
    \ related to the 2030 Agenda SDGs. \n \nThe 2030 SDGs comprise the aims related\
    \ to food (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), climate change (SDG 13), and\
    \ \necosystem (SDG 15). Policies and programs managers to be developed by managers\
    \ will sign managing of resources in future \nin the way a more sustainable one.\
    \ Nevertheless, there are many operational difficulties. Holistic systematic analyses\
    \ are needed \nto obtain comprehensive solutions covering problems related to\
    \ the water-energy-food-climate. Future farming will be built on \nfour main pillars\
    \ are follows (1) Improving productivity, (2) Rational use of resources, (3) Adaptation\
    \ to climate change, and (4) \nAvoidance of food waste (FAO 2018). \n \n3.2. Water-Energy-Food\
    \ Nexus \n \nEnergy, water and food security have been identified as three of\
    \ the key resources in achieving the United Nations' sustainable \ndevelopment\
    \ goals (Babatunde et al. 2019). Therefore, the water-energy-food nexus has been\
    \ proposed as a conceptual tool for \nachieving sustainable development. Many\
    \ developing countries has faced many challenges to meet the demands increasing\
    \ for \nhealthy food, clean water and green energy due to the climate change.\
    \ An effective solution can only be achieved through \nsustainable use of vital\
    \ resources such as land, water, and energy (Rasul & Sharma 2016). \n \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n          377 \n \nWater, energy, and food are resources that\
    \ are unavoidably connected with each other. Impacts on only one resource can\
    \ also \ncause changes in the other ones. The increasing global population, energy\
    \ demands, freshwater resources, and food supply \nemphasize the significance\
    \ of this topic. The Water-Food-Energy (WEF) Nexus concept was introduced by Hoff\
    \ in the World \nEconomic Forum held in the Bonn in 2011 to take measures pointing\
    \ out the problems the world may face and to address the \nlinks between water\
    \ and economic development (Hoﬀ 2011). In recent years, the WEF nexus has become\
    \ an independent \ntechnical term due to its growing popularity. The interdependent\
    \ and complex interactions of these three basic resources are \ncalled as the\
    \ water-energy-food nexus (Zhang and Vesselinov 2016; Bieber et al. 2018). Solutions\
    \ of challenges concerning food, \nwater, and energy have to be planned to meet\
    \ current and future socio-economic demands at local, regional, national, and\
    \ global \nscales for sustainable development (Bazilian et al. 2011; FAO 2014;\
    \ Howells et al. 2013; IRENA 2015; Cevher 2019; Namany \net al. 2021). Figure\
    \ 3 shows connections water-energy-food nexus, interactions among WEF. \n \nThere\
    \ are technological solutions based on nexus models for rural and urban fields\
    \ (Lehmann 2018), sensor applications \n(Abegaz et al. 2018), renewable energy\
    \ (IRENA 2015), and greenhouse monitoring (Asolkar & Bhadade 2015). Moreover,\
    \ if \nknowing the interconnections between the three elements of the Nexus, it\
    \ can be determined which resource should be shared in \nwhat proportion for sustainable\
    \ production, how taking temporal and spatial strategical decisions. (Tian et\
    \ al. 2018; Zhang et al. \n2018; Ravar et al. 2020, Norouzi & Kalantari 2020;\
    \ Keyhanpour et al. 2021; Yue et al. 2021). \n \n \n \nFigure 3- Water-energy-food\
    \ nexus, interactions among WEF (modified from Bieber 2018). \n \n3.3. Digital\
    \ Transformation  \n \nAccording to FAO and World Bank reports, digital transformation\
    \ can be used to solve challenges that are faced in agriculture \nand in rural\
    \ areas (WB 2019; Trendov et al. 2019). Thanks to a well-planned transition towards\
    \ smart farming (Klerkx & Rose \n2020), this transformation can contribute to\
    \ agri-food systems (Klerkx and Begemann 2020). Digital transformation is a concept\
    \ \nthat defines the process of finding solutions to social and sectoral needs\
    \ with the integration of digital technologies, and \naccordingly the development\
    \ and change of workflows and culture (ElMassaha & Mohieldin 2020). Digitalization\
    \ is defined as \nthe socio-technical process providing with using digital innovations.\
    \ In the agricultural sector, numerous notions have emerged \nto define different\
    \ forms of digitalization in agri-food production systems (Klerkx et al. 2019).\
    \  \n \nThese are Precision Farming (McBratney et al. 2005; Aubert et al. 2012;\
    \ Eastwood et al. 2017), Smart Farming (Wolfert et \nal. 2017), Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Rose & Chilvers 2018; De Clercq et al. 2018; Zambon et al. 2019; Zhai et al.\
    \ 2020; Raj et al. 2021; \nRijswijk et al. 2021; Rose et al. 2021). Moreover,\
    \ synonyms of Agriculture 4.0 are “Numerical Agriculture” (Agriculture \nNumérique)\
    \ in France (Klerkx et al. 2019), “Smart Farming” in many countries of the European\
    \ Union, “Digital Agriculture” in \nAustralia and New Zealand (Keogh & Henry 2016;\
    \ Shepherd et al. 2018; Fielke et al. 2020; Fleming et al. 2021). These concepts\
    \ \nhave defined as the \"Digital Agricultural Revolution\" by Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO) (Trendov et al. 2019) \n \nAccording to CEMA (2018), Digital\
    \ Farming is the transformation from Precision Farming to end to end connectable,\
    \ \nknowledge-based farm production systems. CEMA explains that Digital Farming\
    \ has a similar structure to Industry 4.0. \nHowever, there are many aspects of\
    \ production parameters in agriculture that are different from industry. Agriculture\
    \ is mostly \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n378 \n \ndefined with environmental and biological\
    \ factors, and therefore its physical specifications should be basically considered\
    \ \n(CEMA 2017a; 2017b). \n \nLioutas et al. (2021) presented the beneficial and\
    \ negative aspects of digitalization. They also indicated the necessity to \n\
    develop new approaches based on science in terms of societal impacts in the evolution\
    \ of digital agriculture. \n \nPylianidis et al. (2021) reported a review on digital\
    \ twins in agriculture in the period 2017-2020. They defined the unique \ncharacteristics\
    \ of agricultural digital twins and pointed out that digitalization will provide\
    \ multiple gains in terms of productivity \nand sustainability to the agricultural\
    \ sector.  \n \nFielke et al. (2019) explained that more comprehensive effects\
    \ due to agricultural innovation and digitalization and pointed \nout that the\
    \ main themes covering socio-technical dimensions of digitalization in agricultural\
    \ production practices are \nconnectivity, transparency, and governance. \n \n\
    Four key technologies that will be an active role in the future of digital farming\
    \ are (1) vision and sensors, (2) automation \nand robotics (3) digitization and\
    \ big data, (4) biological actors. At the heart of all these key technologies\
    \ is the achievement of \nhigh efficiency in connectivity (Berger 2019). \n \n\
    3.3.1. Connectivity \n \nAgricultural digital transformation is one of the topics\
    \ that have political priority on a global scale (WB 2017; WB 2019; Trendov \n\
    et al. 2019). According to the European Commission Report (EC 2017), one of the\
    \ targets of the EU is to connect farmers end \nto end to the digital economy\
    \ to succeed in the sustainable evolving of food and farming.  \n \nThe digital\
    \ connectivity in agricultural knowledge networks and agro-food value exchange\
    \ will increase using novel tools \nsuch as digital hardware and software (Fielke\
    \ et al. 2019). As shown in Figure 4, all three of these technologies-sensors,\
    \ robotic \nautomation, and digital data work together and are enabled by adequate\
    \ connectivity as well as advances in edge computing and \nthe cloud. At the heart\
    \ of all these key technologies is the achievement of high efficiency in connectivity\
    \ (Berger 2019). \n \n \n \nFigure 4- Four key technology levers to drive improvements\
    \ to the farm economy and shape a new agricultural \necosystem - Agricultural\
    \ industry technology map (Berger 2019) \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          379 \n\
    \ \n3.3.2. Transparency \n \nTransparency in agricultural practices is important\
    \ for all stakeholders in the agricultural sector including consumers, and \n\
    regulators, in terms of deep connectivity and informational interaction between\
    \ them (Fielke et al. 2019). Agricultural knowledge \nand advice networks digitalized\
    \ will be crucial in terms of the transformation of agricultural innovation (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \nDigital information flows transfer with transparency to everywhere\
    \ will provide trust between farmers themselves and \ninteractions with technologies\
    \ (Kelton et al. 2008; Sligo & Massey 2007). Transparency is need due to providing\
    \ informational \ninteraction with extensive connectivity between them (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \n \n3.3.3. Governance \n \nIt is known that challenges appear\
    \ in balancing the priorities in terms of sustainable development in the agriculture\
    \ sector as \nagri-food systems digitalize. In order to solve these, planning\
    \ between public and private organizations will require (Carolan \n2018; Regan\
    \ 2019), considering socio-ethical factors to meet public and private goals in\
    \ the agricultural sector (Fielke et al. \n2019). Past experiences in agricultural\
    \ decision support systems have seen that without the contributions of all stakeholders\
    \ in \nthe agricultural sector including social systems it will not be a sufficient\
    \ solution (Fielke et al. 2018; Klerkx et al. 2017). \n \n4. Smart Farming \n\
    \ \nImprovements in both hardware and software technology open a new chapter in\
    \ agriculture, especially when it comes to sensors, \nbiologicals, robotic & automation,\
    \ and digital data. PA is a part of smart farming technologies including agricultural\
    \ \nmanagement, information systems, and automation and robotics (Balafoutis et\
    \ al. 2020; Klerkx et al. 2019; Rose & Chilvers \n2018). \n \n4.1. Precision Agriculture\
    \  \n \nPA is the management of spatial and temporal variability through using\
    \ advanced technologies to precisely match agricultural \ninputs to increase economic\
    \ gains and lessen environmental impacts. \n \nPA not only offers solutions to\
    \ address many of the problems posed, exacerbated and exposed by this global crisis,\
    \ it also \nhas the potential to be an invaluable tool for rebuilding and strengthening\
    \ the efficient and sustainable food systems of tomorrow. \nPrior to PA, farmers\
    \ homogeneously managed their inputs such as seed, fertilizer, pesticide and irrigation\
    \ despite existing within-\nfield variability in soil properties, crop stress\
    \ and crop yield. Beginning in the 1990s, after the emergence of PA, farmers were\
    \ \nable to divide their heterogeneous areas into smaller units that were relatively\
    \ homogeneous. Knowing all the historical data of \nan area can help growers adopt\
    \ a PA approach and adjust their input to benefit their land, increase profitability\
    \ and reduce their \noverall environmental impact. PA offers the use of satellite\
    \ technologies that allow real-time management of crops, fields and \nanimals\
    \ (Talepbour et al. 2015).  \n \nIn the light of the developments it has shown\
    \ from the emergence of PA to the present day, it develops agricultural \nmanagement\
    \ by making use of various perspectives. These perspectives are listed below.\
    \ \n \na) Agronomic perspective: considering the real needs of the crop in the\
    \ regulation of cultural practices (for example; better \nfertilization management).\
    \ \nb) Technical perspective: establishing better time management at farm level\
    \ (for example; planning of agricultural activities). \nc) Environmental perspective:\
    \ reducing agricultural effects (to more accurately estimate the soil's need for\
    \ nitrogen to limit \nnitrogen flow). \nd) Economic perspective: increasing productivity\
    \ or reducing the amount of input, increasing the efficiency of the yield (for\
    \ \nexample; making nitrogen fertilization application at low cost). \n \nRecently,\
    \ various technologies related to PA have developed technologies like GPS systems,\
    \ yield mapping, smart sensors, \nand automatic steering systems. As expected,\
    \ these systems were developed for the farmer to increase yields, save nutrients\
    \ and \nso as to make efficient sensing and decision support systems that can\
    \ increase profitability on the farm and reduce negative \nenvironmental impact.\
    \ PA supports reduced tillage and other cost and labor-saving novel technologies.\
    \ Along with the latest \ndevelopments in semi-autonomous systems and agricultural\
    \ robots in this process, it seems that the process has accelerated \namong farmers.\
    \ Figure 5 shows the connections between different technical systems and sensors,\
    \ especially from geolocation \nand sensing systems to decision support, variable-rate\
    \ operation, and route planning among emerging technologies in PA \n(Pedersen\
    \ 2017). \n \nFrontier technologies used in PA for long time have four main phases\
    \ that span almost all agricultural applications. These \nfour main stages and\
    \ related technologies (Balafoutis et al. 2020); \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    380 \n \n1. Guidance technologies- These include all types of automatic guidance\
    \ for tractors and self-propelled agricultural \nmachinery such as driver assistance,\
    \ controlled traffic in agriculture, developed based on hardware and software.\
    \ \n2. Information management- Measurement is essential for accurate farming and\
    \ better control results. Measurement systems \nconsist of sensors that can be\
    \ mounted on ground-based stations and attached to aerial or satellite platforms.\
    \ They collect \nspatial information including soil mapping, canopy mapping, and\
    \ yield mapping, also soil moisture mapping. Knowledge \nmanagement will enable\
    \ farmers to perform PA more efficiently and comfortably. If the connection between\
    \ the digital \nand the physical farm is not made right, there can always be a\
    \ shortage of precision farming among farmers. \n3. Application technologies-\
    \ These involve technologies such as variable rate irrigation and variable rate\
    \ application \ntechnologies for nutrients, crop protection agents, irrigation,\
    \ seeding, and precision weed control, developed based on \nhardware and software.\
    \ \n4. Data analysis technologies- These are used for the analysis of data gathered\
    \ through data collection. Related technologies \nare: \n \n- Management zone\
    \ definition \n- Decision support systems (DSS) \n- Farm management information\
    \ systems (FMS) \n \n \n \nFigure 5- Major digital systems used in precision agriculture\
    \ (Pedersen 2017) \n \nInternational experiences and survey studies show that\
    \ Aided Steering Systems (ASS) tend to be the first technologies \nadopted by\
    \ farmers, due to their relative simplicity and the tangible benefits in terms\
    \ of reduced fuel consumption and inputs as \nwell as increased labour productivity\
    \ (less driver fatigue, working during night, etc.) (Say et al. 2017). Recording\
    \ technologies \nare increasingly available through remote sensing from satellites\
    \ and drones even though their use by individual farmers is still \nlimited. Field\
    \ sensors are increasingly being deployed in higher value crops such as orchards\
    \ and vegetables but also in field \ncrops, to support irrigation management and\
    \ for early warning of diseases. Reacting technologies such as VRAs (Variable\
    \ Rate \nApplications) are being adopted more slowly, as they are most complex\
    \ requiring proper recording technologies as well as \nsufficient intra-field\
    \ heterogeneity to be profitable for farmers. Evidence in Turkey suggests a similar\
    \ pattern: As such, farmers \nare less convinced about their profitability and\
    \ require more sensitization, training and support (Say et al. 2017). \n \nSatellite\
    \ technology has also shown significant progress for imaging applications among\
    \ PA technologies. For example, \nremote sensing (RS) is used successfully to\
    \ detect variability in soil and crop conditions and to match inputs such as water,\
    \ seed, \nand fertilizer via variable rate technology. Currently, satellite imaging\
    \ technology is more suitable for large areas due to its cost \neffectiveness\
    \ in comparison to drone-based imaging. However, with a number of high-precision\
    \ satellite launches being planned, \nthat precision capabilities will improve\
    \ significantly to enable usage for medium-sized and small fields. \n \nDrone-based\
    \ imaging in PA has evolved rapidly over the last few years. Current drone imaging\
    \ favours usage of smaller \nfarms where satellite imagery is not cost effective.\
    \ With the improvements in satellite technology described above, however, \ndrone-based\
    \ imaging may be limited to certain conditions such as heavy cloud cover or difficult\
    \ terrain. With regards to precision \nspraying, however, drones may prove to\
    \ be a significant advantage as payload capacity continues to increase. \n \n\
    Lastly, farm management systems are another interesting and developing area in\
    \ the PA ecosystem. They assist farmers and \nland managers in achieving higher\

    \  \n \nThe agricultural sector sets sail towards a new era of agriculture called\
    \ “Agriculture 4.0” thanks to emerging novel digital \ntechnologies. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 finds solution to agricultural and environmental problems thanks to digitalization,\
    \ automation, and \nartificial intelligence adjusted to various agricultural technologies\
    \ from crop and livestock production, to weeding, to pest control, \nand also\
    \ to harvest.  \n \nMost studies related to new digital technologies are carried\
    \ out on topics, such as Information and Communications \nTechnologies (ICT),\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC) Big Data Analytics (BDA), robotics,\
    \ Machine Learning \n(ML), Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles \n(UGVs), and Blockchain. There\
    \ are many literatures covering various applications used in Agriculture 4.0 in\
    \ the past few years:  \nICT (Lezoche et al. 2020; Moysiadis et al. 2021); WSN\
    \ (Ojha et al. 2015; Kochhar & Kumar 2019), IoT (Sinha & Dhanalakshmi \n2022;\

    \ 2021; Liakos et al. 2018), \nBlockchain (Chen et al. 2020; Bera et al. 2022;\
    \ GHD and AgThentic 2018), Automation & Robotics (Aceto et al. 2019; Carolan \n\
    2019). Furthermore, other smart farming topics including 3D Printing, Synthetic\
    \ Biology, Gene Editing, Nano Materials have \nbeen researched by GHD & AgThentic\
    \ (2018). \n \nNonetheless, Agriculture 4.0 paradigm occurs five core technologies\
    \ covering sensors and robotics, Internet of Things, cloud \ncomputing, data analytics,\
    \ decision support system. Figure 6 shows core technologies and connections among\
    \ them. (1) Sensors \nand robotics fulfill sensing and actuating functions, according\
    \ to the needs of the system. (2) IoT provides connectivity based on \nprotocol\
    \ and network for data communication. (3) Cloud computing is responsible for data\
    \ storage and processing. (4) Data \nanalytics involves big data and AI and ML-based\
    \ algorithms for data analysis. (5) Decision support system helps to provide data\
    \ \nvisualization, guidance functions, and user interaction (Araújo et al. 2021).\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 6- Agriculture 4.0 core technologies and connections (Araújo\
    \ et al. 2021) \n \n4.2.1. Novel digital technologies \n \nIndustry 4.0 has the\
    \ potential to transform the production capabilities of whole industries, including\
    \ the agricultural fields. \nConnectivity is the cornerstone of this transformation\
    \ and IoT is a key enabling technology that is increasingly part of agricultural\
    \ \nequipment. Technologies, such as IoT, Edge Computing, AI, robotics, 5G, blockchain,\
    \ and supercomputing, all have the potential \nto make agriculture more efficient,\
    \ sustainable, and competitive. Some definitions related to the advanced digital\
    \ technologies \ngiven by European Commission are following (EC 2021a): \n \n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of smart, interconnected devices\
    \ and services that are capable of sensing \nor even listening to requests. IoT\
    \ is an aggregation of endpoints that are uniquely identifiable and that communicate\
    \ bi-\ndirectionally over a network using some form of automated connectivity.\
    \ The IoT enables based on networked sensors to \nremotely connect, track and\
    \ manage products, systems, and grids. \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n382 \n \nCloud computing\
    \ includes the use of tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases,\
    \ and software based on \na network of remote servers through the Internet. Cloud\
    \ computing services enable users to store files and applications in a \nvirtual\
    \ place or the cloud and access all the data via the Internet. Public cloud services\
    \ are available on public networks and open \nto a widely unlimited cosmos of\
    \ potential users, designed for a market, not a single enterprise. \n \nBig Data\
    \ is a term describing the continuous increase in data, and the technologies needed\
    \ to collect, store, manage and \nanalyze it. It is a complex and multidimensional\
    \ phenomenon, impacting people, processes, and technology. Big Data is usually\
    \ \ncharacterized by \"four Vs \": Volume (size of the data sets), Velocity (high\
    \ speed of data processing), Variety (different types \nand sources of data used),\
    \ and Veracity (high quality of analyzed data). \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a term used to define machines achieving human-like cognitive functions such\
    \ as learning, \nunderstanding, reasoning, or interacting. It comprises different\
    \ forms of cognition and meaning understanding (e.g. Speech \nrecognition, Natural\
    \ Language processing) and human interaction (e.g. signal sensing, smart control,\
    \ simulators). In terms of its \ntechnology base AI is a very heterogeneous field.\
    \ While some aspects like sensors, chips, robots as well as certain applications\
    \ \nlike autonomous driving, logistics, or medical instruments refer to hardware\
    \ components, a relevant part of AI is rooted in \nalgorithms and software.  \n\
    \ \nAgricultural robots can be used for crop monitoring and plant phenotyping,\
    \ yield estimation, soil sampling, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, dairy milking,\
    \ sorting tasks, disease detection, weed and pest control, planting, harvesting,\
    \ environmental \nmonitoring and pruning. UAVs and UGVs are robots that are used\
    \ both in the air and on land for agricultural applications. \n \nBlockchain is\
    \ a shared, digital, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording\
    \ transactions and tracking assets in \na business network. Shared ledgers technology\
    \ allows new transactions to be added to an existing chain of transactions using\
    \ a \nsecure, digital or cryptographic signature. Assets can be tangible (house,\
    \ car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, \npatents, copyrights,\
    \ brand). Blockchain protocols aggregate, validate, and relay transactions within\
    \ the blockchain network. \nAlmost anything of value can be tracked and transacted\
    \ on a blockchain network, reducing risk and reducing all costs involved \nin\
    \ the business. Blockchain is ideal for presenting information as it provides\
    \ instantaneous, shared, and completely transparent \ninformation stored in a\
    \ non-modifiable ledger that can only be accessed by authorized network members.\
    \ A blockchain network \ncan track orders, payments, accounts, production, and\
    \ much more. As members share a single view of the truth, all the details of \n\
    a transaction can be seen from start to finish; thus, creating new efficiencies\
    \ and opportunities as well as greater confidence.  \n \nIndustrial Biotechnology\
    \ is the application domain of biotechnology for the industry in the production\
    \ and processing of \nchemicals, materials, and fuels. This technology involves\
    \ the practices related to using microorganisms or enzymes to generate \nindustrially\
    \ useful products in a more efficient way (e.g. less energy use, or fewer by-products)\
    \ without conventional \npetrochemical processes. \n \nNanotechnology is an umbrella\
    \ term that covers from the design to structural application and production, to\
    \ devices, and \nsystems by controlling shape and size at a nanometer scale. Nanotechnology\
    \ has revolutionary the potential for the development \nof smart nano and micro-devices\
    \ and systems in fields such as agriculture, healthcare, energy, environment,\
    \ and manufacturing. \nNanotechnology use in agriculture allows smart solutions\
    \ for nutrients, pesticides, and genetic materials for improved soil \nfertility\
    \ and soil protection, thanks to better stress tolerance. Nano-based sensors can\
    \ be used for monitoring whole factors that \naffect productivity in smart farming.\
    \ Moreover, nanotechnology can be used in post-harvest food processing and packaging\
    \ to \nreduce food contamination and waste. \n \nPhotonics is a multidisciplinary\
    \ field related to light including energy generation, detection, and process management,\
    \ \ndevices such as electronic components, and photodiodes, lasers, and LEDs.\
    \ It allows the technological basis for the economic \nconversion of sunlight\
    \ to electricity for solar-powered systems. \n \n4.2.2. Agriculture 4.0 applications\
    \ \n \nAgriculture 4.0 can be applied at four main groups as showed in Figure\
    \ 7: (a) monitoring; (b) control, (c) prediction, and (d) \nlogistics (Araújo\
    \ et al. 2021). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          383 \n \n \n \nFigure 7-\
    \ Domains and applications in Agriculture 4.0 (Araújo et al. 2021) \n \nMonitoring-\
    \ Automatic monitoring is the first step to passing to Agriculture 4.0. Smart\
    \ monitoring systems have potential \nchanging the game rule thanks to real-time\
    \ data collected from the field and advanced data analytics tools providing the\
    \ success \nof agricultural management. Monitoring allows farmers to get smart\
    \ and fast decisions and perform timely interventions, to \nincrease productivity\
    \ in agriculture, save time and costs and protect the environment (Araújo et al.\
    \ 2021). \n \nMonitoring include usually applications as follows: \n \n- Weather\
    \ monitoring (air temperature and humidity, rainfall, wind direction, wind velocity,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, solar \nradiation, etc.).  \n- GHG monitoring (temperature,\
    \ GHG emissions- CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2).  \n- Crop monitoring (NDVI) and soil monitoring\
    \ (temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity, pH value, and nutrient content)\
    \ \nfor agricultural management.  \n- Water monitoring (temperature, conductivity,\
    \ pH, salinity, turbidity, specific chemical compounds, dissolved oxygen \ncontent)\
    \ for irrigation systems, aquaculture or aquaponics (aquaculture + hydroponics)\
    \ for management. \n \nControl- While information is managed in one way in the\
    \ monitoring applications, the control applications use a bidirectional \ninformation\
    \ line. Commonly, an IoT-control system works together automatic monitoring system,\
    \ which employs IoT sensors \nto collect necessary data and to transfer them for\
    \ storage and then processing. Control applications are the following (Araújo\
    \ et \nal. 2021): \n \n- Irrigation Systems (sensors, actuators such as water\
    \ pumps, and solenoid valves) for irrigation management.  \n- Fertilization and\
    \ Fertigation for optimum fertilization. \n- Weed, Pest and Disease Control for\
    \ many problems like a waste of chemicals, increased costs, and pest resistance\
    \ to \nchemicals, environmental pollution, and contamination of agricultural products.\
    \ \n \nPrediction- Predicting function in Agriculture 4.0 is used in decision-making\
    \ support for the optimization in the management \nprocess. Monitoring and documentation\
    \ are vital processes since it is used real-time and historical data to improve\
    \ exact \nanalytical methods in predicting actual events. Prediction applications\
    \ are the following (Araújo et al. 2021): \n \n- Forecasting Weather Conditions\
    \ \n- Crop Development and Yield Estimation  \n- Forecasting Market Demand \n\
    \ \nLogistics- It is known that, in recent years, consumers have been more concerned\
    \ about how the agri-food products bought \nare produced, handled, packaged, stored,\
    \ and distributed. Agriculture 4.0 provides more efficient management and transparency\
    \ \nby increasing efficiency in logistics, addressing food safety and security,\
    \ traceability and food authentication, decreasing intrinsic \nrisks, and complying\
    \ with certifications and regulations (Araújo et al. 2021). \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \nSeveral application examples related to domains such as monitoring, control,\
    \ prediction, and logistics of smart farming are given \nbelow. \n \nSmart Livestock\
    \ Farming (SLF) is one of applications of PA that supports real-time monitoring\
    \ of productions, health, and \nwelfare of livestock, and to ensure optimal yield,\
    \ to increase the management capacity of animals. A variety of sensors and \n\
    actuators and decision-making tools, and IoT technologies are used in SLF (Cadero\
    \ et al. 2018). Electronic identification systems \nsuch as ear tags, ruminal\
    \ boluses, and sub-cutaneous radio-frequency identification; on-animal sensors\
    \ like accelerometers, \nglobal positioning systems, and social activity loggers;\
    \ and stationary management systems, milking parlor, and related \ntechnologies\
    \ and flock management software are used in SLF (Vaintrub et al. 2021). Newton\
    \ et al. (2020) examined a case study \nrelated to the dairy milk recording system\
    \ under Australian conditions, using big data analytics based on individual cow\
    \ and herd \nperformance information, such as milk production, lactation, and\
    \ breeding records. They studied farm decision support using big \ndata and explored\
    \ various factors and processes along with farmer engagement. Knight (2020) reviewed\
    \ the current status of \nwearable sensor technologies in livestock farming that\
    \ could revolutionize dairy farming; explained the important difficulties, \n\
    and emphasized the advantages need for animal wellbeing, profitability. Sensors\
    \ are split into three categories: (1) \"At Cow\" \nsensors, (2) \"Near Cow\"\
    \ sensors, and (3) \"From Cow\" sensors. Wearable sensors can be placed by swallowing\
    \ or inserting into \ncows. Figure 8 shows wearable sensor technologies developed\
    \ for cows. While \"At Cow\" sensors at the red zone are used to \nmeasure acceleration,\
    \ temperature, heart rate, and pH, \"Near Cow\" sensors at the blue zone are used\
    \ to analyze video and sound \ninformation, as well as climate analysis, feed\
    \ analysis, and GPS, these are designed to be make interaction with the cloud.\
    \ \"From \nCow\" sensors at the green zone are employed to monitor products and\
    \ wastes like milk, hair, saliva, sweat, nasal secretion, \nbreath, and faeces\
    \ taken from the cow. Zhang et al. (2021) pointed out that SLF has important potential\
    \ thanks to intelligent \ntechnologies such as environmental control, disease\
    \ early warning, precise feeding, and remote diagnosis. They discussed the \n\
    framework and technical characteristics of wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT),\
    \ the advantages, difficulties, and expectations \nof the W-IoT in farm animals\
    \ (Figure 9). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8- Overview of sensor technologies associated\
    \ with dairy animals for cows (modified from Knight 2020) \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker\

    \ \n          385 \n \n \n \nFigure 9- Wearable IoT system for SLF (Zhang et al.\
    \ 2021) \n \nSmart greenhouses enable farmers to cultivate crops with minimum\
    \ human interference. Climatic conditions such as \ntemperature, humidity, luminosity,\
    \ and soil moisture are continuously monitored inside a greenhouse. Variations\
    \ in these \nconditions will trigger automated actions. These actions will then\
    \ evaluate the changes and implement corrective actions to \nmaintain optimal\
    \ conditions for plant growth. \n \nZamora-Izquierdo et al. (2019) proposed a\
    \ flexible platform for greenhouses that used soilless culture with full recirculation.\
    \ \nThe system that obtained saving of more than 30% in water consumption and\
    \ up to 80% in some nutrients has low-cost hardware \nand a three-tier open-source\
    \ software platform at local, edge, and cloud planes.   \n \nLiao et al. (2017)\
    \ developed an IoT-based system including three subsystems like environmental\
    \ monitoring system, a \nwireless imaging platform, and a host analysis platform,\
    \ shown in Figure 10. In an orchid greenhouse, environmental sensors \nthat measure\
    \ temperature, relative humidity, and illumination, and cameras capture the images\
    \ of orchids were used. The IoT-\nbased environmental monitoring system consists\
    \ of 12 WSN, and a gateway based on ZigBee. While WSNs are responsible for \n\
    measuring environmental parameters, the gateway is used to organize the sensor\
    \ readings sent by the WSNs and transmit them \nto the host via Wi-Fi. The IoT-based\
    \ wireless imaging platform is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer\
    \ with cameras. \nSensor data and camera images are saved in the host platform.\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 10- Overall conceptual diagram of IoT-based monitoring system\
    \ for greenhouses (Liao et al. 2017) \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n386 \n \nLin et al.\
    \ (2020) developed a framework using a linear programming model maximizing economic\
    \ profits and environmental \nbenefits for the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization\
    \ system in which both long-term and short-term planning are considered as \n\
    illustrated in Figure 11. \n \n \n \nFigure 11- IoT-based smart fertigation management\
    \ system (Lin et al. 2020) \n \nRoy et al. (2021) designed an IoT system according\
    \ to a dynamic irrigation scheduling called \"AgriSens\" for efficient water \n\
    management of irrigated crop fields. The AgriSens enables real-time, automatic\
    \ irrigation, as well as remote manual irrigation \nfor different growth phases.\
    \ IoT helps not only enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes but also minimize\
    \ water losses. In \norder to calculate the precise needs for water, sensors that\
    \ measure various parameters, such as relative humidity, soil moisture, \ntemperature,\
    \ and light intensity, need. IoT-based smart irrigation systems with such a mechanism\
    \ can contribute to higher \nirrigation efficiency. Benyezza et al. (2021) proposed\
    \ a block diagram of the example irrigation system, which is composed of \nthree\
    \ main parts, as shown in Figure 12: data processing, cloud, and communication\
    \ part. \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          387 \n \n \n \nFigure 12- Block diagram\
    \ of the example irrigation system (Benyezza et al. 2021) \n \nChen et al. (2020)\
    \ proposed a framework called “blockchain-based electronic agriculture” on its\
    \ development and challenges \nof Ecological Farm in the Beijing Liuminying. According\
    \ to this framework, the whole circular agricultural model of the \necological\
    \ farm into the blockchain network automatically handles and uploads data through\
    \ several types of smart devices, \nwhich expands the information set that can\
    \ be used for sharing. This innovation provides a powerful agriculture model,\
    \ and \npresents a reliable path for reaching \"digital agricultural”. As shown\
    \ in Figure 13, Blockchain-based applications can be used \nalong with IoT smart\
    \ devices and drones to monitor agricultural environments (Bera et al. 2022).\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 13- Blockchain-IoT enabled agriculture using drones (Bera\
    \ et al. 2022) \n \nThe European Commission has set up large-scale projects to\
    \ initiate the digitization of agriculture in Europe with \napproximately €1 billion\
    \ of EU funding under the Horizon 2020 program (EC 2021b). Several examples of\
    \ these projects are \ngiven below: \n \nATLAS project is agricultural interoperability\

    \ \napplications. The goal of ATLAS is the development of an open interoperability\
    \ network for agricultural applications and to \nbuild up a sustainable ecosystem\
    \ for innovative data-driven agriculture. The platform enables the flexible combination\
    \ of \nagricultural machinery, sensor systems, and data analysis tools to overcome\
    \ the lack of interoperability. This allows farmers to \nincrease their productivity\
    \ in a sustainable way. The ATLAS platform is built around a data exchange network\
    \ using a uniform \napplication program interface (ATLAS 2019). \n \nDayıoğlu\

    \ in the European food and farming industry both precision farming \nand smart\
    \ farming (IoF2020 2017). IoT-driven smart farming enables farmers to optimize\
    \ their operating tasks to boost crop \nyields and to reduce the costs of inputs\
    \ such as water, fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.  \n \nDEMETER project\
    \ is a large-scale deployment of farmer-driven, interoperable smart farming-IoT\
    \ based platforms, delivered \nthrough a series of 20 pilots across 18 countries\
    \ (15 EU countries). Involving 60 partners, DEMETER adopts a multi-actor \napproach\
    \ across the value chain (demand and supply), with 25 deployment sites, 6000 farmers\
    \ and over 38000 devices and \nsensors being deployed (DEMETER 2019). \n \nSome\
    \ of EU’s robotics projects are Vinbot, MARS, GRAPE, VINEROBOT, ROMI and Flourish\
    \ projects (Moysiadis et al. \n2021). Vinbot aimed operations crop monitoring\
    \ using devices like laser sensors, cameras and the navigation system that is\
    \ based \non a hybrid reactive/GPS (VINBOT 2017). MARS subproject was designed\
    \ for the development of a mobile agricultural robot, \nwhich had the ability\
    \ to cooperate and work in swarms (Figure 14a). GRAPE subproject targeted to develop\
    \ a UGV able to \nperform semi-autonomous vineyard monitoring and farming tasks\
    \ (Figure 14b). VINEROBOT aimed to develop a novel UGV \ncapable of monitoring\
    \ grape growth and factors like grape yield, vegetative growth, water stress,\
    \ and grape composition in \ncovering vineyard management (Figure 14c). ROMI project\
    \ is developed for a UGV performing tasks such as weeding, crop \nmonitoring,\
    \ and collecting specific information on any individual plant (ROMI 2020). Flourish\

    \ 2021) \n \n4.2.4. Digital transition and challenges \n \nAlthough the many gains\
    \ that the success of Agriculture 4.0 could lead, there are still various challenges\
    \ that need to be handled \nfor providing a successful digital transformation.\
    \ The main challenges to be considered in Agriculture 4.0 are split into five\
    \ main \nlevels. Those challenges are related to device, data, network, application,\
    \ and the system according to levels. Challenges at device \nlevels are usually\
    \ related to a harsh field environment, power consumption, and cost issues. Data\
    \ levels are mostly linked to \nquality, availability, privacy, integrity, and\
    \ interpretability issues. Facing at network levels are mostly network size, latency\
    \ and \nthroughput, transmission range, propagation losses, and interoperability\
    \ issues. Emerging of during applications are usually real-\ntime use, context-awareness,\
    \ cyber-security, modularity, and reliability problems. Problems that emerged\
    \ in the system are \nscalability, flexibility, robustness, complexity, affordability,\
    \ and continuous improvement issues (Araújo et al. 2021).  \n \nAs noted earlier\
    \ (besides the small scale of land and low level of mechanization), farmers face\
    \ significant challenges in the \ntransition to smart farming as they try to adopt\
    \ sensors, biologicals, robotic automation, and digital data from third-party\
    \ \nproviders. Farmers are traditionally conservative and adopt new technology\
    \ solely for its usefulness rather than its technological \nappeal. As a result,\
    \ compelling applications must be significantly deep to deal with the farmer's\
    \ specific situation, while also \nrelying on integrated solutions that make data\
    \ and insights easy and seamless. \n \nThere are two basic stages in smart farming\
    \ that should be taken into account for the transition: (1) The pre-processing\
    \ stage \nand (2) the post-processing stage. The pre-processing phase covers market\
    \ trends geographical conditions and soil properties of \nthe land, seeds choosing,\
    \ and the land preparation for the smart farming system. The post-processing stage\
    \ is employed machine \nvision techniques for disease and weed identification\
    \ while using smart technologies in irrigation and harvesting. For traditional\
    \ \nagricultural players, this transition is not easy. As the industry moves from\
    \ products to outcome-based solutions and worksite \noptimization, many organizations\
    \ face the conflict of traditional platform or product-based organizations versus\
    \ the needs of the \nfarmer and marketplace. As a result, smart farming is undergoing\
    \ a rapid transformation from both a product and a service \nperspective. Technological\
    \ disruptions, business model transformations, and organizational changes are\
    \ all creating an exciting \nbut challenging opportunity. \n \n5. Renewable Energy\
    \ and Environmental Technologies \n \nRenewable energy technologies have the potential\
    \ to provide synergy between water, energy, and food; and also, the optimum \n\
    mix is available for three sectors. Solar-based pumping solutions offer a cost-effective\
    \ alternative to the grid- or diesel-based \nirrigation pumps. Renewable energy\
    \ and rainwater harvesting technologies can be combined with a nexus system. Renewable\

    \ Agrivoltaics  \n \nAgrivoltaic systems are PV technologies installed at a certain\

    \ energy. Agrivoltaic systems can provide both preserve agricultural land and\
    \ advantage crop production by increasing \nwater use efficiency and decreasing\
    \ water stress (Agostini et al. 2021; Allardyce et al. 2017). Sun'Agri agrivoltaic\

    \ by the pivoting solar panels continue to grow and show a reduced \nneed for\
    \ water thanks to the reduction in evapotranspiration (pv magazine 2020). However,\

    \ and any form of life on earth are inevitably dependent on sunlight, and today,\
    \ thanks to modern technologies \nemerging, Sun offers a bigger source with the\
    \ possibility to harness the energy from it all around the year. Not only does\
    \ the \ndevelopment of the crop with energy coming from the sun but supports the\
    \ gathering of precious information about the soil, air, \nwater, and weather\
    \ conditions themselves. \n \nSolar-powered plug-and-play wireless field sensors\
    \ provide farmers with instant access to data on their soil properties and \n\
    crop health. This hardware is a device IoT-based, low-power, long-range, and adaptable\
    \ based on farm size. A farm monitoring \nsystem shown in Figure 17 is a network\
    \ of smart sensors driven by powerful AI-based crop intelligence and farm management\
    \ \nsoftware to aid farmers across the globe with instant access to soil and crop\
    \ health. It is designed to help farmers accomplish \nhigh crop productivity and\
    \ high-profit margins (Solarvibes 2021). \n \n \n \nFigure 17- Solar-powered Plug\
    \ & Play Farm Monitoring System (Solarvibes 2021) \n \n5.3.2. Environmental monitoring\
    \ \n \nClimate change is due to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that have\
    \ been greatly affecting agricultural production. The \nside eﬀects of climate\
    \ change result in frequent experiences of droughts, ﬂoods, and extreme weather\
    \ conditions. Data-driven \nIoT systems are have monitoring and control functions\
    \ including reducing energy and fuel consumption, generating renewable \nenergy\
    \ on-site, and performing closed-loop measurements of carbon consumption and waste.\
    \ It is seen that IoT-powered smart \nservices and industry could account for\
    \ up to 10 percent carbon reduction by increasing efficiency and eliminating reliance\
    \ on \ndisposable materials in both the public and private sectors. \n \nMonitoring\
    \ systems can assist farmers in monitoring and improving the quality to avoid\
    \ degradation of soil. They allow for \nthe monitoring of a number of physical,\
    \ chemical, and biological properties such as texture, water-holding capacity,\
    \ and \nabsorption rate. Soil monitoring can help to minimize problems, such as\
    \ erosion, densification, salinization, acidification, and \npollution due to\
    \ toxic elements (Yurtseven et al. 2018). \n \nPesticides and several other agrochemicals\
    \ are used widely in agriculture. These chemicals that affect in way serious and\
    \ \npermanent ecological balance are harmful to human and animal welfare, causing\
    \ substantial damage to complete ecosystems. \nIoT-based smart devices, such as\
    \ WSNs, drones, robots, enable farmers to substantially decrease the use of pesticides.\
    \ Advanced \nIoT-based pests and insect control allow precise tracking, simulation,\
    \ disease prediction, and therefore is more efficient than \ntraditional pest\
    \ control calendars or prescripts (Raj et al. 2021). The IoT-based systems with\
    \ ML, DL, and image processing can \nbe used in preventing fruit diseases, diagnosing\
    \ and preventing infection in agricultural products. Studies have seen that chemical\
    \ \npollution can prevent using big data, AI, ML technologies. Wastewater from\
    \ industry can be used in agricultural production; \nWater polluted with heavy\
    \ metals threatens our food (paddy, greenhouse cultivation, fish production, etc.)\
    \ and our health. In \nrecent years, it is known that cancer and many diseases\
    \ that adversely affect the immune system are caused by excessive \nagricultural\
    \ spraying and industrial wastewater. Excessive use of pesticides in fields, vineyards,\
    \ gardens, and greenhouses \npollutes air, soil, and water resources. In other\
    \ words, excessive spraying, irrigation, fertilization harm the entire ecosystem\
    \ in \nan unsustainable way. All of this should be traced back to the source where\
    \ the problem started; all data should be forwarded to \nthe center and evaluated;\
    \ monitoring and control mechanisms should be developed. \n \nPA has not only\
    \ the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also having a positive\
    \ effect on-farm productivity and \nthe economy. These technologies cover whole\
    \ farming applications such as variable-rate spraying, irrigation planting, \n\
    fertilization, and weeding (Balofoutis et al. 2017). Both driver assistance (Machine\
    \ Guidance) and Variable Rate Technologies \n(VRT) contribute to climate change\
    \ mitigation by reducing fuel and input use at given yields. Based on a literature\
    \ review, the \nEU classifies GHG reduction potential of different Precision Agricultural\
    \ Technologies (PATs) as it follows (Table 1): \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    \          391 \n \nTable 1- Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction potential of different\

    \ (VRT) \n1 \nWeeding (Precision physical) \n1 \n \nVariable-rate nutrient application\
    \ has the highest GHG emission reduction potential amongst PA technologies, as\
    \ nitrogen \nfertilizer is the main source of N2O that is the most influential\
    \ GHG emitted from farming activities. Its impact on global warming \nis 298 times\
    \ higher than that of CO2 (Soto et al. 2019). Variable-rate irrigation has a dual\
    \ impact. (1) decreasing the energy need \nfor water pumping from the water source,\
    \ (2) reducing of the GHG emissions by applying the optimum irrigation scheduling.\
    \ \nOn the other hand, applications such as controlled traffic in agriculture,\
    \ machine guidance, VRT-pesticide use have GHG \nreduction potential. Moreover,\
    \ all-natural resources (water, air, soil) have threatened due to chemical contaminants,\
    \ \noverwatering, over-spraying, over-fertilizing. \n \n5.3.3. Water monitoring\
    \ \n \nWater Quality Index (WQI) that developed to measure water quality is determined\
    \ through different water quality parameters, \nsuch as pH, turbidity, temperature,\
    \ chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen\
    \ demand \n(BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), etc. (Ahmed et al. 2020).\
    \ Smart water management requires the integration of \nsystems and a complex of\
    \ measures to monitor, control and regulate the usage and quality of water resources\
    \ as well as maintain \nthe associated equipment (sensors, actuators, pipes, pumps,\
    \ etc.). Smart water systems based on the combination of the IoT, big \ndata,\
    \ and AI technologies can help stop water scarcity from happening and remove the\
    \ damage the incautious usage of water \nresources has already caused. \n \nIn\
    \ rural areas shown in Figure 18, solar-powered wireless air - water - soil monitoring\
    \ stations can be used to monitor \nenvironmental variables at vineyards, orchards,\
    \ fields, fish farms, greenhouses, basis on the energy - food - water nexus at\
    \ real-\ntime. \n \n \n \nFigure 18- Solar-powered wireless-weather-soil-water\

    \ in Africa, a large pivot system with a radius of 479 meters has used to irrigate\
    \ 50 hectares of desert. The fuel costs of \noperating this system are very high.\
    \ Water is being supplied through an artificial canal from the Nile. At this point,\
    \ Alfalfa is \ngrown as feeding hay and harvested 11 times each year with the\
    \ harvest season exceeding 300 days. Until 2013, a 135-kW diesel \ngenerator ran\
    \ 22 hours per day to power the system. An alternative power source had to be\
    \ found in this off-grid. Following \nfeasibility analysis, a solar-powered system,\
    \ using suitable pumps to replace the diesel-powered generator and AC pumps were\
    \ \ninstalled. While all motors required to move the pivot now are powered with\
    \ solar energy, the pivot speed is automatically \ncontrolled proportional to\
    \ water flow. Figure 19 shows solar-powered center pivot irrigation system that\
    \ is installed by Lorentz. \nIn 11 hours, the pivot completes one 360 degrees\
    \ turn, providing the required 3300 m³ of water per day for partial irrigation\
    \ \n(Lorentz 2014). This energy transformation not only no longer decreasing energy\
    \ costs, but also greatly reducing carbon \nemissions. \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\

    \ \n \nFood security and sustainable agriculture are the two main objectives of\
    \ agriculture production process and these objectives can \nonly be achieved by\
    \ changing the farming practices from fossil-based energy generation to renewable\
    \ energy based farming. \nRenewable energy technologies to be able to use in farming\
    \ are solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and biomass \nenergy. IFES\
    \ is a farming system model designed to combine, intensify, and hence improve\
    \ the simultaneous production of food \nand energy through the sustainable use\
    \ of biomass; achieved in two ways: 1. Combining the production of food and fuel\
    \ feedstock \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          393 \n \non the same land, e.g. inter-cropping,\
    \ agroforestry, or agro-pastoral systems, 2. Using the by-products/residues of\
    \ one production \nsystem i.e. ‘closed loop’ or ‘zero waste’ systems. Hence, energy-smart\
    \ solutions can include simultaneously producing food and \nenergy as a means\
    \ of achieving sustainable production systems in rural communities as shown in\
    \ Figure 21 (Sims & Flammini \n2014). \n \n \n \nFigure 21- Integrated food energy\
    \ system (IFES) (Sims & Flammini 2014) \n \n6. Discussion \n \nIn this review,\
    \ innovative digital technologies to be able to use in agri-food systems are discussed\
    \ based on the water-energy-\nfood nexus for sustainable development. The agriculture\
    \ sector has a social-economic structure that is always a risky sector, \nwhere\
    \ variable inputs are used to grow very different products such as food and feed,\
    \ directly affected by weather conditions. \nAgricultural activities, unlike industry,\
    \ are carried out in large, open areas like fields, vineyards, and orchards, or\
    \ closed areas \nlike greenhouses, barns, poultry houses, and mushroom houses.\
    \ Today, it is necessary to switch from labor-intensive production \nto technology-intensive\
    \ production for successful and sustainable agricultural production in all its\
    \ processes.  \n \nSince the areas used in agricultural production are limited,\
    \ a productivity increase in agricultural production should be \nensured. While\
    \ input costs can be reduced, production yield and quality can be increased using\
    \ precision farming (Berger 2019; \nWolfert et al. 2017) and smart farming (Balafoutis\
    \ et al. 2019; Boursianis et al. 2019) technologies with variable rate applications,\
    \ \ndeveloped applications saving the environment. \n \nThe driving factor of\
    \ smart agriculture is to meet the demand for more food to increase yields, optimize\
    \ interdependent \nresources of energy, water, and land, and provide sustainable\
    \ urbanization. Water and energy are two finite resources that must \nreach access\
    \ to more people and so ensuring everyone has access to a reliable supply are\
    \ crucial to human survival and sustainable \ndevelopment (EC 2017; FAO 2017a;\
    \ WB 2019). \n \nThe agri-food value chain consumes 30 percent of the world’s\
    \ available energy (FAO 2020). Energy is needed in the \nproduction of crops,\
    \ fish, livestock, and forestry products, food storage and processing, food transport\
    \ and distribution and, as \nwell as, in food preparation (FAO 2012). Although\
    \ the availability of fossil fuels has made a significant contribution to feeding\
    \ \nthe world, these energy sources are finite and, in general, environmentally\
    \ problematic. As discussed also in this study, renewable \nenergy technologies\
    \ are key to food security and a climate-friendly, sustainable transformation\
    \ of agri-food systems to produce \nmore and better-quality food. Data-driven\
    \ systems, IoT-backed sensors keep an eye on consumption patterns and provide\
    \ insights \ninto inefficient areas which in turn help to analyze energy consumption,\
    \ usage, and pattern. These solutions can be utilized to \nmanage and optimize\
    \ energy consumption patterns by taking complete control of energy data at the\
    \ most fundamental and \ngranular level.  \n \nFAO supports digital technologies,\
    \ innovative ideas with high potential for impact in food and agriculture, for\
    \ transforming \ndigital solutions and services into global public goods. FAO\
    \ aims to explore the responsible application and adoption of existing \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n394 \n \nand frontier technologies, design and new services,\
    \ tools and approaches to empower rural households and inspire youth \nentrepreneurship\
    \ in food and agriculture (Santos Valle & Kienzle 2020). \n \nThe farming sector\
    \ is moving towards a new paradigm that is recalled Agriculture 4.0 that integrates\
    \ a number of innovations \nin order to produce agricultural products. Agriculture\
    \ has become a strategic sector that needs to be given more importance due \n\
    to reasons such as climate imbalances caused by global warming, an increase in\
    \ the world population, and the gradual decrease \nof usable agricultural resources.\
    \ Today, when traditional farming methods are no longer sufficient, countries\
    \ have to focus on \npractices that increase productivity and reduce costs with\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 practices. Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is used \nto\
    \ point out the digitalization of production as in Industry 4.0. Indeed, modern\
    \ technology is available that will make agriculture \nmore environmentally friendly\
    \ and efficient. Technical improvements in the agriculture sector can be carried\
    \ out to optimize \nproduction efficiency, and improve quality, minimize carbon\
    \ footprint; and can be reduced production-associated risks. \n \nAgricultural\
    \ applications that are from crop production to harvesting, from weather monitoring\
    \ to prediction, irrigation, \nweeding, fertigation, pest control, and logistics\
    \ are rapidly evolving towards a new digital cosmos covering technologies such\
    \ as \nIoT, cloud computing, big data, automation, and artificial intelligence.\
    \ \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nThis study targets to obtain holistic solutions in\
    \ a systematic view, basis on Water-Energy-Food nexus to agricultural digital\
    \ \ntransformation that will support achieving a sustainable future. Digitalization\
    \ is a technology accessing unexploited data pools \nto valuable information,\
    \ providing transformation to potential benefits for society and the environment\
    \ if programming smartly \nand efficiently among data sets.  \n \nThe water-food-energy\
    \ resources are at the center of sustainable development. The development of smart\
    \ systems \ninterconnected can generate unique opportunities to effectively solve\
    \ the challenges targeted in United Nations’ Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.\
    \ It can be emphasized that smart technologies can be able to use as tools for\
    \ game-rule changing, if setting \ntheir systematic integrations, the food-water-energy\
    \ nexus will benefit sustainable development. The strategical use of three \n\
    essential sources for future generations will provide invaluable solutions listed\
    \ here: (1) sustainable food production; (2) access \nto fresh and safe water;\
    \ and (3) renewable energy generation and usage. Human beings have two inevitable\
    \ missions to fulfill \nsustainable development. The first one is to solve the\
    \ interconnections between food - water - energy - climate nexus. The second \n\
    one is to develop smarter machines and systems achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional to digital to improve \nefficiency, decrease input costs and\
    \ resource use, and protect the environment. \n \nIn the new digital era starting\
    \ with the Industry 4.0 revolution, the production capabilities of all industries\
    \ thanks to \ninnovations emerged, including agriculture will have to transform\
    \ in order to feed the rapidly growing population of the world.  \n \nSmart agriculture\
    \ is real-time farm management providing a high degree of automation, and data-driven\
    \ intelligent decision-\nmaking to improve productivity, save natural resources.\
    \ Digital technologies can support farmers' production of safe, sustainable, \n\
    and quality food.  Technological innovations can help us overwhelm many of the\
    \ economic, social, and environmental challenges \nthat agriculture is facing\
    \ today. Novel technologies like the internet of things, cloud computing, big\
    \ data, artificial intelligence, \ndrones, and robotics provide making processes\
    \ more efficient and drive the creation of new products and services and streamline\
    \ \nagricultural operations. \n \nThe driven technology of Agriculture 4.0 is\
    \ the IoT that provides the ability to securely connect end-to-end to anything,\
    \ to \nanywhere. In IoT, numerous wireless sensor network deployed to the field\
    \ can be used along with cloud technologies. Big data \ngathered site-specific\
    \ are transformed into meaningful data set to be used in decision support systems\
    \ for smart applications. The \ncaptured information in the field can be examined\
    \ by computational techniques to reveal trends and patterns, and interactive \n\
    information on human behaviors, environment, and experiences can be transformed\
    \ into efficient actions.  \n \nBy using smart agriculture technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques, it will be possible to monitor in real-time how water, \nchemicals,\
    \ and energy are used for the production of healthy food and animal feed, and\
    \ what environmental effects the applied \nagricultural activity may cause. However,\
    \ this requires the development of national and international policies, the implementation\
    \ \nof strategies, and the control and supervision of processes.  \n \nDeveloped,\
    \ there are many smart farming technologies including decision support system,\
    \ yield monitoring, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, management of crop disease,\
    \ crop monitoring, soil monitoring, treatment of pests with robots, intelligent\
    \ \nharvesting according to maturity, traceability from farm to fork, logistics,\
    \ as well as e-marketing. Although innovation is often \nconceived as techno-centric,\
    \ the rise of Agriculture 4.0 thinking needs to consider also environmental and\
    \ social sustainability \nperspectives. However, challenges related to power,\
    \ performance, and security are obstacles to seamless connectivity.  \n \nThanks\
    \ to developments in recent years, it is seen that digital technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques have the potential to \ntransform agriculture more precisely, efficiently,\
    \ and sustainably. Furthermore, while providing greater transparency for \nDayıoğlu\

    \ support has helped farmers in many practices, in terms of environmental \nand\
    \ agricultural performance. Beyond farming, while digital technologies make the\
    \ job more attractive to new generations, they \noffer many opportunities to reduce\
    \ problems related to remoteness and improve access to services. \n \nAlthough\
    \ data-driven technologies play a key role at all stages of the production of\
    \ food and feed in agri-food systems of the \nfuture, none of this can happen\
    \ without enough energy and water from farm to fork. Being clean and sustainable\
    \ the energy used \nin agriculture, not chemically polluted of the water is vital\
    \ to access to fresh water and clean energy everyone, and for a better \nreconstructing\

    \ paper is to review the \nimplementation of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ system in \nthe precision agriculture sector. Each year, farmers suffer \nenormous\
    \ losses as a result of insect infestations and a lack of \nequipment to manage\
    \ the farm effectively. The selected article \nsummarises the recommended systematic\
    \ equipment and \napproach for implementing an IoT in smart farming. This \nreview's\
    \ purpose is to identify and discuss the significant \ndevices, cloud platforms,\
    \ communication protocols, and data \nprocessing methodologies. This review highlights\
    \ an updated \ntechnology for agricultural smart management by revising \nevery\
    \ area, such as crop field data and application utilization. \nBy customizing\
    \ their technology spending decisions, agriculture \nstakeholders can better protect\
    \ the environment and increase \nfood production in a way that meets future global\
    \ demand. Last \nbut not least, the contribution of this research is that the\
    \ use of \nIoT in the agricultural sector helps to improve sensing and \nmonitoring\
    \ of production, including farm resource usage, \nanimal behavior, crop growth,\
    \ and food processing. Also, it \nprovides a better understanding of the individual\
    \ agricultural \ncircumstances, such as environmental and weather conditions,\
    \ \nthe growth of weeds, pests, and diseases. \nKeywords—component; \nInternet\
    \ \nof \nThings; \nPrecision \nagriculture; Data management; Crop monitoring;\
    \ Smart farming \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe agriculture sector contributes to a\
    \ large share of \nemerging countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [1]. The \n\
    ability of this industry to keep up with the ever-increasing \npopulation and\
    \ the demands of emerging technologies is in \njeopardy due to the ever-increasing\
    \ population. By 2030, the \npopulation of the planet will have topped 8 billion,\
    \ and nearly \n10 billion by 2050. In terms of population size, China and \nIndia\
    \ are the most populous countries in the world, with more \nthan 1 billion inhabitants\
    \ each, accounting for 19 percent and \n18 percent of the world's total population,\
    \ respectively. By \n2022, China is expected to overtake India in population by\
    \ \n2022. Agricultural production is critical to the economies of \nboth countries\
    \ in order to ensure a steady supply of \nlivelihoods for their growing populations.\
    \ \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a modern developing \nmechanism that has taken\
    \ over networked cloud applications, \nranging from electrical to digital systems,\
    \ mechanical, as well \nas individuals with unique IDs. By far the most important\
    \ \nconsideration of the IoT is the potential to transmit data \nwithout the need\
    \ for a human transmission interface. \nAttributed to the reason that the field\
    \ is stretched across a \nlarge region of farmland for agricultural or animal\
    \ gazing, the \napplication of Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) is the best way \n\
    to solve the problem. The actuator modules are \ninterconnected to the Personal\
    \ Area Network (PAN) as they \nconsume a huge amount of power which is not as\
    \ numerous \nas the sensor nodes. This comprehensive framework can be \nintegrated\
    \ into an IoT-based system by utilizing existing \nLocal Area Network (LAN) and\
    \ Internet infrastructure. \nAgricultural digitization is advancing in the majority\
    \ of \nemerging countries. In Japan, computerised crop breeding, \ninsect utilisation,\
    \ agricultural management, and the \npreparation of meteorological reports are\
    \ all common. \nFarmers in the United States (US) have access to large data \n\
    cloud systems, as well as government databases for \nagriculture, research institutes,\
    \ and libraries. Farmers can use \nthe database to acquire up-to-date market prices,\
    \ crop \nimprovement, and growing skills and technology in the \nagriculture sector.\
    \ Computers can assist farmers in \ndetermining the best crops to plant, the best\
    \ seasons to grow \nthem, and the best farming mode to use, resulting in farms\
    \ \nwith the maximum yields and benefits. Well-known financial \nmanagement information\
    \ system (FMIS) providers, such as \nWisu 10 and Agrineuvos, offer plug-in or\
    \ comparable \nsolutions for a variety of agricultural management specialties.\
    \ \n \nAcknowledging appropriate and available information is \nessential \nfor\
    \ \nagricultural \nproduction \neducation. \nAn \nagriculture management information\
    \ system (AMIS) is built \non the foundation of agricultural information. The\
    \ \nmanagement of agricultural data is greatly influenced by the \nquality of\
    \ agricultural data collection and processing. \nBecause the farming ecosystem\

    \ A Review \nII. DATA MANAGEMENT IN AGRICULTURE \nSmart agriculture, also known\
    \ as automated farming, is \nthe most recent paradigm based on agricultural data\
    \ to \nemerge. It was made possible by advancements in \ntelecommunications and\
    \ data processing, which were \ncombined with the previously existing concept\
    \ of precision \nagriculture to improve operational accuracy. In this sense, \n\
    smart agriculture is founded on the same principles, with \nfarmers implementing\
    \ this technology that collects data from \nagricultural fields, which would then\
    \ be analyzed in order to \ndraw suitable managerial and operational conclusions.\
    \ \nTraditionally, farmers had to personally visit the ground farm \nto inspect\
    \ the state of the plots and to review decisions that \nwere made without their\
    \ prior knowledge. A multitude of \nfactors have rendered this method ineffective,\
    \ including the \nfact that many sectors are too broad to be adequately \naddressed\
    \ within the framework of legal standards. In the \ncontext of smart agriculture,\
    \ cutting-edge management tools \nare providing practical applications. Aside\
    \ from that, \nalthough some farmers have long-term expertise gathered via \n\
    a variety of experiences, technology can provide an \nautomated way to find unpredictable\
    \ defects that are difficult \nto notice through eyesight assessment on a periodic\
    \ basis. \nYounger farmers are more likely to use new agricultural \ntechnologies\
    \ than older farmers, as they will employ smart \ndevices or instruments to enhance\
    \ their limited knowledge. \nEven so, the average age of farmers has risen rapidly\
    \ in recent \ndecades: 63 in Japan, 60 in Africa, and 58 in the US and \nEurope\
    \ [2]. Fortunately, various policies are being revised \nand expanded in Europe\
    \ to help generational transformation \nby increasing access to initial capital,\
    \ loans, market counsel, \nand coaching. Generational regeneration goes beyond\
    \ merely \ndecreasing rural farmer's retirement age. In addition, it \ninvolves\
    \ encouraging the most educated and active young \nfarmers to use technology to\
    \ promote viable agri-business \npractices. In order to attain sustainable food\
    \ security and food \nchain competitiveness, young farmers must convert their\
    \ \ncurrent land into more sustainable and efficient farms. \nA. Data Acquisition\
    \ Using an IoT \nThe correlation of IoT with agriculture has always been \ndefined\
    \ as the use of sensing devices and other instruments to \nconvert any part of\
    \ farming activities into data. Over 10% of \nUS farmers are anticipated to use\
    \ IoT devices on their \nplantations, which cover more than 2400 million acres.\
    \ The \nInternet of Things is at the heart of so-called \"agricultural \n4.0\"\
    . Indeed, IoT technology has become a catalyst in \nagriculture businesses because\
    \ it enables the generation of \nsuch a vast volume of relevant knowledge, and\
    \ improvements \nin these technological advancements are expected to have a \n\
    significant impact on the farming sector. By 2050, it is \npredicted that the\
    \ IoT will be able to boost agricultural output \nby over 70% using existing techniques.\
    \ This is a positive \ndevelopment, as Myklevy et al. claimed that the planet's\
    \ food \nsupply must expand by 60% by 2050 to accommodate the \nworld's growing\
    \ population of nearly 900 million people. The \nmain benefits of the Iot systems\
    \ are better harvests and lower \nprices. A typical farming business that uses\
    \ IoT can improve \nyield by up to 2% and minimize energy use by up to 8%. \n\
    \ \nB. Analytics of Big Data \nIn order to generate organisational big data, a\
    \ new form \nof automation technique is required due to the enormous \namounts\
    \ of data streams accessible for farm management. \nEven so, the volumes of information\
    \ retrieved from either the \nmajority of industrial or agricultural subject areas\
    \ are unlikely \nto meet the criteria for classification as big data. It can be\
    \ \nclassified into three perspectives when it comes to big data: \nthe volume,\
    \ velocity, and variety of organisms. Veracity and \nvalorization, resulting in\
    \ the following: \na) Volume: Volume linked with databases that are too \nlarge\
    \ to be captured, archived, handled, and analyzed using \nconventional methods.\
    \ It provides an estimate of the size of a \ndatabase required to be considered\
    \ huge, which varies by \nrespected field, based on commonly available computing\
    \ \nresources and standard dataset sizes, which often begin in the \nterabyte\
    \ range. \nb) Velocity: The term \"velocity\" describes the \ncapability of learning,\
    \ comprehending, and experiencing \nevents as they occur. When it comes to agriculture,\
    \ these \nsystems operate in real-time, such as information extraction \nin the\
    \ area to implement different amounts of chemicals in \nequipment fitted with\
    \ variable-rate delivery mechanisms, \namong other applications. \nc) Variety:\
    \ The phrase \"variety\" alludes to the various \ninformation formats (text, videos,\
    \ and audio) and levels of \nsophistication. Soil or temperature sensors and images\
    \ are \njust two examples of the kinds of data that are employed in \nagriculture\
    \ when dealing with ever-changing circumstances. \nd) Veracity: The word \"veracity\"\
    \ relates to the \nconsistency, reliability, and authenticity of the information.\
    \ \ne) Valorization: It is called valorization when one \nwants to share awareness,\
    \ respect, and creativity with other \npeople. \nIn terms of agricultural management,\
    \ big data is significant \nin agriculture only in particular circumstances, relying\
    \ on the \nplantation and the pace of technological acceptance. There \nwere 34\
    \ surveys that talked about how information systems \ncould be utilised in farming\
    \ [3], and research on how big data \ncould be used in modern agriculture was\
    \ conducted by \nWolfert et al. [4]. To keep up, the Organization of Global \n\
    Agricultural Research Centers launched the Agriculture Big \nData Platform, which\
    \ promises to address agricultural growth \nconcerns more rapidly, more affordably,\
    \ and more effectively \nthan the existing approaches. \nC. Using Artificial Intelligence\
    \ (AI) and Robotics to Aid \nHumanity in Agriculture 5.0 \nThrough transformative\
    \ technology, large engineering \nproblems frequently lead to significant solutions,\
    \ and \nAgriculture 5.0 is most certainly one for the early half of the \ntwenty-first\
    \ millennium. Agriculture 5.0 is a concept that \ndescribes farmlands that employ\
    \ Precision Agriculture \nstandards and technology, such as autonomous operational\
    \ \nprocesses and automated decision support tools. As a matter \nof fact, Agriculture\
    \ 5.0 incorporates various forms of AI and \nrobotics. Historically, farms have\
    \ relied heavily on seasonal \nlabour to work the fields and increase profitability.\
    \ However, \nJournal of Robotics and Control (JRC) \nISSN: 2715-5072 \n340 \n\
    \ \nN. S. Abu, Internet of Things Applications in Precision Agriculture: A Review\
    \ \nthe culture has changed from an agrarian community with \nmany people residing\
    \ in fields to one that has more people \nliving in towns, which has led to a\
    \ shortage of workers on \nfarms. According to a Forbes report, agricultural robots\
    \ help \nhumans by harvesting crops faster and more efficiently. \nWhilst robots\
    \ are still extremely slow than individuals in so \nmany \nelements, \nagriculture\
    \ \nis \ncurrently \nimproving \ntechnology tools to assist farmers with repetitive\
    \ tasks, \ndriving agricultural systems into the modern paradigm of \nAgriculture\
    \ 5.0. Based on Reddy et al. [5], agricultural \nrobotics has increased efficiency\
    \ and decreased farm \noperating expenses in a number of nations. Robotic \ntechnologies\
    \ for agriculture are developing at a quick speed \n[6], offering exciting potential\
    \ for smart farming in the face \nof staff shortages and long-term diminishing\
    \ profit growth; \nbut, just like other breakthroughs, major restrictions must\
    \ be \naddressed in the current early phases. Since small individual \nfarms are\
    \ less profitable due to scale economics, these \ntechnologies remain outrageously\
    \ expensive for the majority \nof farmers, including those with small farms. Furthermore,\
    \ as \ntechnology becomes more affordable, agricultural robotics \nwill undoubtedly\
    \ be used in the future as a means of \nincreasing production. Farming and crop\
    \ production around \nthe world slowed down in 2015. Agricultural robots were\
    \ \ndesigned to address these concerns and fulfill an increasing \nnecessity for\
    \ better returns. According to a Verified Market \nIntelligence analysis, agricultural\
    \ robotics would be able to \naccomplish field chores more efficiently than farmers,\
    \ \nimproving the worldwide agriculture and crop production \nmarket. \nOver $800\
    \ million has been raised by agricultural \ntechnology startups within the last\
    \ five years. In 2014, start-\nups that use automatons and the use of machine\
    \ learning to \ntackle agricultural challenges have expanded. This coincided \n\
    with a big rise in the popularity of AI. For the last five years, \nthere has\
    \ been a significant increase in venture funding for AI \n[7]. The United Nations\
    \ Food and Agriculture Organization \n(FAO) says there will be more than 9 billion\
    \ people \nworldwide on Earth by 2050. This new form of agriculture \ngives the\
    \ pretence of accomplishing something for less. In \nagriculture, the use of high-tech\
    \ sensing technologies will \nhelp solve the problem. These technologies will\
    \ provide \naccurate information regarding soil and crops as well as the \nenvironment,\
    \ which will enable the practical implementation \nof phytosanitary goods that\
    \ will drastically reduce herbicides \nand pesticides, enhance water utilization\
    \ reliability, and raise \nagricultural production. \nIII. \nREVIEW ON IMPLEMENTING\
    \ IOT BASED \nAGRICULTURE IN THE CURRENT MARKET \nPesticide or fertilizer management,\
    \ plant health, disease \nprevention, \nirrigated \nagricultural \nmonitoring,\
    \ \nsoil \nconservation, distribution network traceability, automotive \nand machine\
    \ and equipment control, are some of the most \noften used applications for IoT\
    \ solutions in modern \nagriculture. Table 1 lists the articles that were reviewed,\
    \ \nwhich are organized by climate of farmlands and the \nutilisation of the IoT\
    \ approach. In particular, it is vital to keep \nin mind that some of the IoT\
    \ systems strategies presented in \nthe examined papers could be applied in a\
    \ range of settings. \nAgricultural crop monitoring, as illustrated in Table 1,\
    \ is the \nmost widely utilised IoT system for smart farming. \nFurthermore, these\
    \ solutions have been created for usage in a \nnumber of agricultural contexts,\
    \ including arable fields, \norchards, and greenhouses, among others. Crop surveillance\
    \ \nis critical for farmers, which explains why this sort of \ntechnology is so\
    \ popular in agriculture. IoT solutions for crop \nmonitoring were made with the\
    \ goal of getting environmental \ndata from plantations, like temperature, humidity,\
    \ luminosity, \nand so on, from the field. Farmers can utilise this data to gain\
    \ \na more comprehensive view of their plantations. Similar data, \nfor example,\
    \ has been used to evaluate the vigour of price [8, \n9], alfalfa [10], and maize\
    \ [11] crops, as well as to regulate \ngreenhouse environmental conditions [12,\
    \ 13, 14]. \nTABLE I. THE APPLICATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF \nSMART AGRICULTURE\

    \ \n[48] \n[49] \n \n[50] \n \nSimilarly, as demonstrated in Table 1, IoT automated\
    \ \nirrigation systems have been created for a variety of \nagricultural situations.\
    \ To enhance agricultural water use, \nnumerous IoT systems are intended to use\
    \ sensors to detect \nsoil moisture and monitor irrigation sources. Alternatively,\
    \ in \na more simplified manner, by integrating weather and \nhumidity data to\
    \ ascertain the amount of accessible water \nwhen watering the crops [36]. IoT\
    \ disease control approaches \nare designed to detect and avoid diseases on plantations.\
    \ \nThese IoT solutions obtained a range of environmental and \nplantation data\
    \ for this purpose, including plant photos [33], \nsounds, temperature, humidity,\
    \ and so on. This data is \nanalyzed using various methods. For example, image\
    \ \nprocessing and AI. For instance, the Internet of Things \ndriving innovation\
    \ in [51], analyses shots of a sugarcane \nplant and discovers infections of pesticides\
    \ on the plant's \ngreen leaves. In comparison, [52] established an Internet-of-\n\
    Things-enabled device for recording the sounds emitted by \nlarvae within trees.\
    \ Table 1 summarizes IoT technologies for \nchemical control that aid in optimizing\
    \ fertilizer and pesticide \napplication on plantations. As a result, these technological\
    \ \nsolutions gather information from crops (such as nitrogen, \nsalinity, or\
    \ PH). These IoT technologies can distinguish crop \nzones that may require fertilizer\
    \ or pesticide application \nresults derived. The nitrogen content in a large\
    \ plantation, for \nexample, can be evaluated using aerial pictures of crops [53].\
    \ \nThese pictures may be used to locate the precise field that \nneeds fertilizer.\
    \ Furthermore, [30] created an autonomous \nrobot that optimizes pesticide distribution\
    \ in greenhouse \nJournal of Robotics and Control (JRC) \nISSN: 2715-5072 \n341\
    \ \n \nN. S. Abu, Internet of Things Applications in Precision Agriculture: A\
    \ Review \ngrowing areas. The industrial IoT soil science platforms seek \nto\
    \ describe a variety of soil characteristics that may be \nimplemented for planting.\
    \ As an example, such systems are \nused to determine soil water content [54],\
    \ analyze water \nconsumption patterns [55], identify soil nutrients [56], and\
    \ as \nweather station with air quality measurement [57]. \n \nThe IoT technologies\
    \ for automobile and machinery \nmanagement are primarily focused on collecting\
    \ and \nanalysing data from agricultural plants and facilities such as \ntrucks,\
    \ harvesters, and tractors. As a result, IoT solutions have \nto handle unique\
    \ features of agricultural gear, such as \nmobility. Sensors receive inputs from\
    \ the equipment itself, \nsuch as the state of the implement, engine performance,\
    \ or \nrpm, in order to optimise their maintenance period. Further, as \nagricultural\
    \ \nequipment \nhas \nbecome \nmore \nmobile, \nopportunistic computing has been\
    \ used to collect data from \nremote crop fields via tractors equipped with sensors\
    \ [62, 63]. \nEach agricultural condition in Table 1 poses unique challenges \n\
    for production, along with the environment's influence on \nsensor information\
    \ exchange, which can be caused by sensor \nnode distance [59], a breakdown in\
    \ communication in \nfarmlands [63], or even the effect of vegetation on signal\
    \ \ntransmission. Additionally, meteorological variables such as \nsnow, fog,\
    \ or solar irradiance have an impact on both the \nsensor network and the planting.\
    \ Approximately 96% of the \npapers surveyed used electronic sensors to cover\
    \ these \nsituations. This descriptive approach is validated by the fact \nthat\
    \ such sensor nodes are certified, affordable, and available, \nas well as meeting\
    \ the essential monitoring criterion for IoT \ntechnology for smart agriculture.\
    \ As indicated by Table 2, \nsuch sensors are utilised to gather real-time data\
    \ on various \nagricultural parameters, including meteorological variables, \n\
    substrate characteristics, luminance, CO2 concentration, and \npictures. Additionally,\
    \ certain publications (4%) focused on \nthe development of customised sensors\
    \ for the purpose of \nkeeping track of specific agricultural parameters, using\
    \ \napproaches like soil mineral elements (e.g., nitrate 56]) and \nplant leaf\
    \ evaporation to calculate hydric pressure in tobacco \ncrops [65]. \n \nAs shown\
    \ in Table 2, a wide range of sensors were \nimplemented in IoT approaches for\
    \ modern farming to glean \nknowledge about farming from a variety of sources,\
    \ including \nthe environment, agricultural productivity, and substrates. As \n\
    shown in Table 2, electronic detectors are being applied in IoT \nsolutions to\
    \ acquire parameters. For example, humidity, \ntemperature, and luminosity [14,\
    \ 23, 58]. Besides that, \nelectronic sensor nodes were implemented to acquire\
    \ \ninformation from the soil surface (e.g., water and soil) for \nsubstrate supervision,\
    \ including moisture, temperature, and \nnitrogen. Similarly, pH sensors are often\
    \ applied in \nhydroponics cultivation practices to test the alkalinity or \n\
    acidity of the water. Multispectral sensor systems and cameras \nwere used to\
    \ take pictures of crops so that they could be \ntracked. UAVs may be employed\
    \ in multiple ways to take \naerial photos of huge plantations [8, 9, 11] or robots\
    \ are being \nimplemented to get a very detailed picture of a plant leaf [73].\
    \ \nThe choice of equipment is an important part of the \ndevelopment of an IoT\
    \ application because it affects the \nexpenses as well as the technological advances\
    \ for use. \nAmong the publications, 60% reviewed the components \napplied to\
    \ facilitate the IoT application. \nMoreover, SBCs were described in 40% of the\
    \ studies \nsurveyed. The usage of SBCs is justified by their low cost and \n\
    scalability [21], which enables the production of customised \nIoT systems. Certain\
    \ SBCs, such as Arduino, includes a built-\nin development environment (IDE).\
    \ It allows for the \nadvancement of customised applications that may be \nemployed\
    \ in order to run as software on the microcontroller. \nMoreover, the Raspberry\
    \ Pi runs on a multitude of platforms, \nsuch as Ubuntu Core, Raspbian, and Mozilla\
    \ Web Things. It \nis possible to modify the source code of several of these \n\
    operating systems. Additionally, these operating capabilities \nenable the execution\
    \ of programmes developed in \nprogramming languages like Python [74]. Moreover,\
    \ the \nfunctions of SBCs can be enhanced by incorporating other \nelements such\
    \ as sensing devices or transceivers. Due to this \nfeature, SBCs can operate\
    \ as gateways or core networks in \nIoT approaches. The application of ESP boards\
    \ (including \nESP12, ESP32, and ESP8266), Arduino, and Raspberry Pi \nwas mentioned\
    \ in 82% of the publications that covered SBCs. \nThe following table depicts\
    \ how integrated machine \nplatforms and UAVs are used in modern agriculture.\

    The utilisation of UAVs in IoT systems for crop \nmanagement, disease prevention,\
    \ and biological control is \nshown in Table 3. Attributed to their ability to\
    \ monitor big \ncrops quickly and cheaply, UAVs are increasingly being \nimplemented\
    \ for crop surveillance. For this specific purpose, \nUAV systems equipped with\
    \ multispectral sensing devices \nand cameras are implemented to take airborne\
    \ photos of \nenormous fields of crops. In order to measure agricultural \nfactors\
    \ like the leaf area index, the IoT solution employs these \nphotographs (LAI).\
    \ The LAI is a metric that is deployed to \nascertain how much vegetation is present\
    \ in a given region. To \nmeasure and discover the level of nitrogen in rice production\
    \ \n[9], compute the vigour of rice as well as maize crops [8, 11], \nand determine\
    \ the presence of pests in sugarcane crops [51], \nLAI can be implemented in conjunction\
    \ with other indicators. \nIn addition, [67] uses UAV systems to optimise pesticide\
    \ and \nfertiliser applications in agricultural production. Acquired \ndata is\
    \ often transferred beyond a wired or wireless network \nto an endpoint such as\
    \ an IoT-based, database, or webserver.  \nThe set of rules for networks utilized\
    \ in the IoT strategy \nwere addressed in 60% of the articles reviewed. Among\
    \ the \ncommunication protocols mentioned, Ethernet and CAN \nwere the most frequently\
    \ employed for wired networks. \nSimilarly, \nfor \nlong-distance \nwireless \n\
    connections, \nLoRaWAN and wireless network configurations are by far \nthe most\
    \ widely used. For example, 3G, GPRS, and etc. \nSimilarly, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\
    \ and Wi-Fi are the most often \nused mechanisms for short-to medium-range wireless\
    \ \nchannels. The network protocols implemented in the \nexamined articles for\
    \ IoT solutions are presented in Table 4. \nNumerous network protocols, as indicated\
    \ in Table 4, are \nemployed to enable connectivity between smart devices such\
    \ \nas routers and motes in selected agricultural contexts (e.g., \ngreenhouse,\
    \ orchard, arable land). This collection of data \nstructures allows the construction\
    \ of both short-range and \nlong-range networks. \nTABLE IV. MODERN FARMING EMPLOYS\

    \ \n \n[36] \n \n \nAs shown in Table 4, different devices were utilised for \n\
    middle-range and short-range networking in the IoT \nimplementations that were\
    \ assessed, including Wi-Fi, ZigBee, \nand Bluetooth. Table 4 further shows that\
    \ Wi-Fi has been a \nfrequently selected mechanism for connectivity in the papers\
    \ \nthat were reviewed. This widespread need for Wi-Fi may be \nhighlighted regardless\
    \ of the fact that Wi-Fi is a pervasive \nfacility that is relatively simple to\
    \ build. In spite of this, \nenergy-efficient \ntechnological advances, \nfor\
    \ \ninstance, \nBluetooth and ZigBee continue to be frequently employed as \n\
    a result of the high energy demand of Wi-Fi. The ZigBee \nprotocol, for example,\
    \ was used to transfer information from \na farm to an unreachable server, and\
    \ established a Bluetooth-\nenabled node to monitor data straight from a field\
    \ to a smart \ndevice. As indicated in Table 4, long-distance networks such \n\
    as cellular networks, Sigfox, and LoRaWAN were used in the \nstudied articles\
    \ on IoT implementations. Smart farming \nsolutions that rely on cellular networks\
    \ are becoming widely \nattractive. Cellular networks, which enable IoT devices\
    \ to be \nconnected over vast distances and at faster speeds, might be \nused\
    \ to support this argument. Communication data using \ncellular network obtained\
    \ from humidity sensing devices to an \nIoT platform, and operate a watering system.\
    \ LoRaWAN and \nSigfox, on the other hand, enable the transmission of data over\
    \ \nextremely long distances while consuming minimal energy. \nLoRaWAN and Sigfox,\
    \ which are based on these \ncharacteristics, \nhave \nbeen \napplied \nfor \n\
    long-distance \nconnections, giving another option to wireless networks or in\
    \ \nplaces where cell service coverage is poor or absent. A \nplantation irrigation\
    \ management solution based on Sigfox is \ndescribed in [36] as a network protocol\
    \ for the IoT. \nAdditionally, in [34], data from many sensors placed \nthroughout\
    \ the greenhouse is transmitted via LoRaWAN to a \ncloud-based service. Apart\
    \ from the range between sensor \nJournal of Robotics and Control (JRC) \nISSN:\

    \ Agriculture: A Review \ndevices, gateways, as well as other network equipment,\
    \ \nvegetation itself may operate as an obstruction to sensor \ncontact, as demonstrated\
    \ by [62], who evaluated the impact of \n2.4 GHz and 433 MHz signal transmission\
    \ in large estates as \nwell as an orchard. Another drawback with greenhouses\
    \ is the \namount of detectors, which might result in wireless signal \ninterruption\
    \ due to their close proximity [59]. To address this \nissue, Ethernet [78] and\
    \ CAN [76] are two examples of wired \nconnections that can be utilized. As illustrated\
    \ in Table 4, \nthese systems are being employed more extensively in plants, \n\
    since this pattern of farming setting lends itself well to \ndemonstrating access\
    \ points. \n \nThe topology of a network is another important \nconsideration\
    \ when implementing an IoT strategy. According \nto [90], sensor networks can\
    \ be either star, mesh-based, or \ntree-based (also known as a cluster). The topology\
    \ of the \nnetwork has an effect on both the amount of nodes in the WSN \nand\
    \ the length between sensor devices and the destination \n[91]. For instance,\
    \ networks of stars are made up of a central \nunit and a large number of end\
    \ nodes. In this design, data is \nsent from peripheral nodes to the center node\
    \ [59]. In this case, \nthe physical layer communication standard limits how far\
    \ the \nperipheral nodes can be from the main node. In comparison, \nmesh networks\
    \ include routing capabilities built into each \nnode, allowing for multi-hop\
    \ communication to extend \nnetwork coverage. Depending on the specifications\
    \ of the IoT \nstrategy and the task overview, 61 percent of the reviewed \npublications\
    \ employed the same topology. Using the LoRa \nprotocol, [36] interconnect sensors\
    \ to a central point using star \ntopology. Irrigation systems can be monitored\
    \ via Sigfox \nthrough this central point, which serves as a channel for cloud-\n\
    based software. The star topology is also utilised to integrate \nvarious sensors\
    \ inside a conservatory via wireless \ncommunication. To stay updated on a greenhouse,\
    \ [59] used \nthis topology. Cluster networks, which are also called tree \nnetworks,\
    \ are made up of a lot of star networks that connect to \neach other. Cluster\
    \ networks were used by both [90] and [50] \nto manage crops. Sensor nodes in\
    \ [90] gather and transmit data \nfrom a harvesting station to a router point.\
    \ \n \nThis router acts as a network interface, retransmitting \nmessages to the\
    \ network's central router node. Multiple router \nnodes are installed around\
    \ the crop to maximize the energy \nconsumption of sensor nodes. Table 5 tabulated\
    \ the cloud-\nbased IoT platform for processing data and each technique \nsuch\
    \ as computer vision and big data. In the other/not \nidentified column, stated\
    \ the categories that have either used a \ncloud platform to do data processing\
    \ or have not clearly stated \nthe method of data processing. According to Table\
    \ 5, the most \noften encountered cloud computing in the checked articles are\
    \ \nMobius, ThingSpeak, Google, Azure IoT, Thinger.io, and \nAWS IoT. ThingSpeak\
    \ has become the most widely used \ncloud-based framework in all surveyed articles,\
    \ referring to its \nopen-source nature and low technology requirements [36].\
    \ \nFurthermore, Table 5 tabulated the use of AWS IoT for a \ngreater variety\
    \ of information processing methods. Only some \nof the cloud-based platform providers\
    \ have an identical range \nof features and capabilities, but they all facilitate\
    \ information \nmanagement in general [10, 13, 33, 79], modelling [68], \nprocessing\
    \ and farm-level action management. Moreover, \ndespite the fact that various\
    \ cloud-based frameworks exist, \nseveral of the examined articles establish personal\
    \ cloud-\nbased systems for the IoT solution, as demonstrated in Table \n5. By\
    \ using cloud computing for both data processing and \nstorage, cloud-based platforms\
    \ offer connectivity for IoT \nprojects. Some of the IoT platforms, like Thinger.io\
    \ [25], are \ncompletely based on infrastructural suppliers such as Amazon \n\
    AWS and Microsoft Azure. Such services often feature data \nprocessing elements\
    \ with visuals and panels that acquired data \nor the design of personalised components\
    \ from the \naggregation of different data sets as time progresses. \nTABLE V.\

    \ the scalability offered with these channels, the \nvast volumes of information\
    \ produced by the detectors are \nprocessed in database systems to create big\
    \ data, where an \nunorganised source of data is utilised to obtain crop details.\
    \ \nTechnology is needed to minimise reaction time owing to the \nlarge amount\
    \ of data. A parallel computer system known as \nHadoop provides big data applications;\
    \ it has been shown to \nbe more successful at analysing the rainfall benchmark\
    \ data \nfrom numerous weather stations. IoT solutions analyse data in \na number\
    \ of ways and use a range of technologies [92]. Table \n6 shows the most widely\
    \ used technology for each application \nas described in the reviewed articles.\
    \ It also shows that the \nmost common applications to process data are big data,\
    \ deep \nlearning, and artificial intelligence. These technologies are \ncapable\
    \ of handling high volumes of data in a very short \nperiod of time. Furthermore,\
    \ IoT technology is the most \ncommon technology in crop monitoring using data\
    \ processing \ntechnology. In addition, crop control is the mode of \napplication\
    \ that requires the widest range of data processing \ntools. This is understandable\
    \ given that most IoT solutions for \ncrop monitoring gather a large amount of\
    \ information through \ndeep learning and big data analytics to process it. Table\
    \ 6 \nshows that big data was applied to many IoT solutions like \nfertiliser\
    \ control and soil management systems. For example, \nthe data on soil moisture\
    \ was collected by using sensors were \nconnected to cloud datasets [55, 87] such\
    \ as the Prediction of \nWorldwide Energy Resources (POWER) of NASA, which \n\
    includes datasets such as the market trading price of crops, \nfeedback from users\
    \ to optimise the irrigation performance, \nand assists farmers at the stage of\
    \ acquisition of material such \nas seed and fertiliser. Big data is also applied\
    \ in [27] to \nmonitor irrigation systems and provide irrigation advice to \n\
    farmers based on the intelligent basis developed and data \ncollected from sensing\
    \ devices such as temperature and \nmoisture detectors in soil. \n \nJournal of\

    Furthermore, the modification of numerous parameters \nis required for IoT-based\
    \ automated management. Initially, \nbasic monitoring of soil moisture, as described\
    \ by [72], can \nbe utilised to drive irrigation or cooling systems. However,\
    \ \ngreenhouse upkeep might be more demanding. As \ndemonstrated in [14], greenhouse\
    \ characteristics, including \nhumidity and temperature, are strongly connected,\
    \ and \nmodifying one would have a domino impact on the others. \nTable 6 summarises\
    \ how computer vision is applied in IoT \nsolutions to achieve image processing\
    \ like pest and disease \ndetection. Based on the reviewed paper, computer vision\
    \ is \nalso possible to clarify and manage the objects in the image \nacquired\
    \ from the camera, such as applying computer vision \nto clarify types of fruit\
    \ in an orchard and [31, 51, 80] applying \ncomputer vision to achieve pest and\
    \ disease detection. \nSimilarly, computer vision was applied in [98] as a \n\
    monitoring equipment to achieve diseases detection on olive \ngroves and [31]\
    \ applied same technology to analyse the \ndiseases that may cause morphological\
    \ deformation on crops. \nAdditionally, computer vision is also applied in crop\
    \ \nmanagement systems, such as attaching a camera and other \nphysical sensors\
    \ on the robot to make it capable to acquire \nvisuals of vegetation and, through\
    \ image processing, detect \nand eliminate weeds in farmland, while [73] applying\
    \ \ncomputer vision to a robot in order to clarify the crops and \ninteract with\
    \ the farm when necessary. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nPrecision agriculture is a kind\
    \ of farming that makes use \nof data sensors, linked devices, remote control\
    \ tools, and \nother modern technology to provide farmers with more \ncontrol\
    \ over their fields and teams [97]. Precision agriculture \nis becoming increasingly\
    \ popular [98]. This article conducts \nan in-depth survey of current Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) \napplications in farming. This research demonstrated that \n\
    while the majority of agriculture work was focused on simple \ndata processing\
    \ and decision making a few years ago, the \ntrend toward systematic management\
    \ systems, for instance, \ncloud technology and big data is used to analyze enormous\
    \ \namounts of information has lately gained traction. \nAdditionally, artificial\
    \ intelligence and computer vision have \nbecome new trends in agriculture, with\
    \ the goal of improving \nfarm management. According to the numerous initiatives\
    \ \ncovered in this paper, the major portion of IoT smart farming \ntechnologies\
    \ were utilized to monitor crop data. Numerous \napplications discussed in this\
    \ article utilized multiple types of \nnetwork protocols concurrently to improve\
    \ the performance \nof their IoT solutions. Furthermore, this article compared\
    \ \nseveral forms of communication networks, with wired \nnetwork systems being\
    \ applied to indoor farming, such as \ngreenhouses, and wireless network systems\
    \ being applied to \noutdoor farming, such as arable lands and plantations. The\
    \ \nassessment in this paper demonstrated that IoT applications \nin smart farming\
    \ are growing in insignificance. A farmer will \nget a comprehensive evaluation\
    \ of all aspects of his or her \noperation, including crop and livestock management,\
    \ weather \nconditions, soil quality, and the performance of his or her \nemployees\
    \ [93, 99, 100]. The site's history and evolution will \nbe shown in a unified\
    \ manner by storing all of this data \ntogether and making it readily accessible\
    \ [94]. This article \nwould serve as a reference for future work on project cost\
    \ \nestimation and equipment selection for IoT systems. Building \nbetter distribution\
    \ plans and outlining prospective income \nstreams are both made possible by precisely\
    \ forecasting the \nyield levels that will be gathered in each field [95, 96].\

    \ and Communication Technologies have a signifi-\ncant impact on all sectors of\
    \ the economy worldwide. Digital Agriculture appeared \nas a consequence of the\
    \ democratisation of digital devices and advances in artificial \nintelligence\
    \ and data science. Digital agriculture created new processes for making \nfarming\
    \ more productive and efficient while respecting the environment. Recent and \n\
    sophisticated digital devices and data science allowed the collection and analysis\
    \ of \nvast amounts of agricultural datasets to help farmers, agronomists, and\
    \ professionals \nunderstand better farming tasks and make better decisions. In\
    \ this paper, we present \na systematic review of the application of data mining\
    \ techniques to digital agriculture. \nWe introduce the crop yield management\
    \ process and its components while limiting \nthis study to crop yield and monitoring.\
    \ After identifying the main categories of data \nmining techniques for crop yield\
    \ monitoring, we discuss a panoply of existing works \non the use of data analytics.\
    \ This is followed by a general analysis and discussion on the \nimpact of big\
    \ data on agriculture.\nKeywords: Digital agriculture, Data analytics, Crop management,\
    \ Big data, Data \nmining, Machine learning\nIntroduction\nDA, (also called digital\
    \ farming or smart farming)1 [78, 105, 130], is a modern approach \nthat uses\
    \ digital and smart devices [sensors, cameras, satellite, drones, the Global Posi-\n\
    tioning System (GPS)] in conjunction with Data Mining (or data analytics) to improve\
    \ \nproductivity and to optimise the use of resources. Digital Agriculture (DA)\
    \ comes as a \nresponse to the increasing demand for improving productivity while\
    \ reducing farming \noperational costs. Moreover, the improvement of productivity\
    \ should not be done at \nany cost, e.g., overuse of natural resources and chemical\
    \ products. DA can, for example, \nmanage crop growth by finding appropriate fertilisation\
    \ program for each farming field \nand can help farmers to reduce their operational\
    \ costs and respect the environment by \nrefining their farming operations based\
    \ on the needs of each part of the farming field.\nSince agriculture has a direct\
    \ and significant impact on the population and therefore \nits economic environment,\
    \ DA in its turn should be viewed as the next natural step to \n*Correspondence:\

    \ the environment, by taking \nadvantage of the recent technological advances\
    \ in digital devices, communications sys-\ntems, and artificial intelligence.\
    \ These allow us to construct multidimensional domains, \nwhere the farms and\
    \ farmers are their central subjects. Figure 1 shows the agriculture \necosystem\
    \ and its direct impact on other sectors of the economy.\nBesides, since DA involves\
    \ the development, adoption and iteration with digital tech-\nnologies [39], and\
    \ Artificial Intelligence (data analytics, ...), these developments and \ninteractions\
    \ should be well-defined (laws, regulations and policies) to guarantee rights\
    \ \nand benefits of all the involved actors (farmers, farm holders’, data owners’,\
    \ developers \nand analysts, technology vendors’,...) [70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146].\n\
    DA can be regarded as a data driven form of farming, in which decision-making\
    \ pro-\ncesses are based on explicit information derived from data collected through\
    \ various \nsources [148]. DA and Precision Agriculture (PA) seem to refer to\
    \ the same thing, how-\never, as stated in [148], DA involves the development\
    \ and adoption of modern technolo-\ngies in both collecting the data and its analysis\
    \ in various farming contexts, while PA \ntakes into account only the in-field\
    \ variability [147]. DA aims to exploit advanced digital \ndevices, ranging from\
    \ a simple sensor to complex robots, to offer the required farmland \ntreatment\
    \ with high accuracy. DA can be applied in almost all agricultural fields. For\
    \ \ninstance, in crop production: DA allows accurate management of crops, which\
    \ includes \nfields, wasteland, crop, pest, and irrigation management, soil classification,\
    \ etc. In Ani-\nmal production: DA allows monitoring the animal over its whole\
    \ life cycle, its food \nquantity, health control and protection from diseases,\
    \ and so on. Fishery, animal Hus-\nbandry, livestock and dairy farming are some\
    \ examples [14]. In Forestry: We can effi-\nciently manage forests by supporting\
    \ the environmental and sustainable decision [36]. \nDA can help in detecting\
    \ unhealthy trees, air pollution, discriminate different tree spe-\ncies, protect\
    \ the wildlife, etc. From the economy point of view, the application of DA for\
    \ \nforest management enhances the wood quality and its production, which can\
    \ augment \nprofits; reduce waste and maintain the environment [138].\nAddressing\
    \ DA from all the above mentioned views is a challenging task and cannot \nbe\
    \ achieved without the participation of specialists from all these sectors. In\
    \ this study, \nFig. 1 The interlocked sectors involved in DA\nPage 3 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nwe focus\
    \ on the use of Big Data in crop management, it is, not only one of the pillars\
    \ in \nagriculture but also it can profoundly affect biodiversity. Moreover, crop\
    \ growth is a very \ncomplex process involving various endogenous and exogenous\
    \ factors. Recent advances \nin digital technologies allow us to collect data\
    \ about all these factors. DA has the ability \nto elucidate the correlations\
    \ and interactions of these factor to help farmers and agrono-\nmists optimise\
    \ the productivity while reducing the side effects on the environment. DA \nexhibits\
    \ several benefits to agriculture as shown in Figure  2. These benefits were dis-\n\
    cussed in [10, 13, 70, 98, 104, 112, 113, 130, 135, 148] and summarised in the\
    \ following:\n• DA provides a farmer with useful information to support their\
    \ decision-making pro-\ncesses, such as soil and weather monitoring and prediction,\
    \ weed and pest monitor-\ning, crop yield dynamic predictions, etc.\n• DA can\
    \ sustain the environment and improve the products’ quality, since it provides\
    \ \nhigh quality information and measurements for optimal farming operations on\
    \ each \nfield.\n• DA can provide farmers advanced management methods against\
    \ climate change and \nother environmental challenges. The farmer can continuously\
    \ monitor crop growth \nand protect them against diseases.\n• DA offers valuable\
    \ feedback to farmers and good assessment of risks, to minimise \nmicrobiological\
    \ or disaster-related risks.\n• DA can provide prediction and assistance to farmers\
    \ against adverse weather inci-\ndence, disasters and market instability by assessing\
    \ the loss at the farm level.\n• Farmers/agronomists can benefit from advanced\
    \ models to understand the market \nand forecast which products could be more\
    \ profitable.\nThe contributions of this study are in the investigation of big\
    \ data analytics applications \nto crop production. Crop farming is a complex\
    \ task, and it depends on many factors that \nshould be taken into account. To\
    \ optimise the operational cost and reduce the impact \non the environment, the\
    \ big data analytics emerges as one of the most cost effective \napproaches nowadays.\
    \ The contributions, therefore, include the following:\nFig. 2 Role of DA in crop\

    \ quality.\n• A highlight of the different types of data used in the existing\

    \ of data analytics and big data on DA based on previous works, we \nconducted\
    \ a systematic review approach that consists of three steps: (1) collection of\
    \ \nrelated work, (2) selection of relevant work, and (3) examination and analysis\
    \ of the fil-\ntered related work.\nIn the first step, we performed keyword-based\
    \ research and We gathered a large \nnumber of studies from well-known and popular\
    \ online sources (Web of Science, Sco-\npus, IEEEXplore, ACM, etc.). We used a\
    \ combination of keywords from the two sets \n(Big data, data mining, data analytics,\
    \ machine learning, Internet Of Things, sensors) \nand (Digital agriculture, smart\
    \ farming, precision agriculture, agriculture, farming). We \ngathered more than\
    \ 327 articles. In the next steps, We selected a small number of arti-\ncles,\
    \ which are considered relevant for further analysis, based on their ideas, methods,\
    \ \ndata types and sources, addressed problems, proposed solutions, tools used\
    \ and quality \nof the results.\nThrough the literature analysis, the study aims\
    \ to find responses to the following \nresearch questions and discuss findings\
    \ in the following sections.\n• What is the process of DA for crop management?\n\
    • What are the various data types generated by farms and used in DA applications\
    \ for \ncrop management?\n• What role does big data analytics play in DA?\n• How\
    \ are big data analytics used for crop management?\n• What are the influences\
    \ of the farm’s scale on the application of DA?\n• How big is the data used in\
    \ the proposed DA solutions’?\n• What are the challenges facing the DA?\nPage\

    Related work\nDespite that DA and Big Data being relatively recent research fields,\
    \ their scientific lit-\nerature is rich and covers several concepts. As DA is\
    \ at the cross boundaries between \nagriculture and ICT, three major dimensions\
    \ have emerged as of a very high importance; \ntechnology, social economics and\
    \ ethics, and decision-making based on Machine Learn-\ning. The first dimension\
    \ focuses on the use of advanced technologies to improve prac-\ntices and productivity\
    \ [56, 124]. In Ref. [124], the authors studied the impact of sensor \nnetworks\
    \ in agriculture, including remote sensing technologies, wireless devices, and\
    \ \nother IoT devices. Ref. [56] reviewed some developments in remote sensing\
    \ within Big \nData processing and management in agriculture. The second dimension\
    \ concerns legal, \nethics, social and economic factors of DA, to provide insights\
    \ into the impact of digit-\nised information and its analysis on the farm management;\
    \ farmer identity, skills, pri-\nvacy, production, and value chains in food systems\
    \ [39, 70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146, 148]. The \nthird dimension focuses on the application\
    \ of big data analysis and machine learning \n(ML), to optimise and forecast the\
    \ production and the use of resources. In this paper, we \nonly consider this\
    \ dimension.\nVarious studies have been conducted on the application of data analytics\
    \ to crop yield \nmanagement. For instance, [71] presented a systematic review\
    \ on crop yield prediction \nusing ML techniques, and extracted major ML algorithms,\
    \ features and evaluation met-\nrics used in those studies. Ref.[35] discussed\
    \ the yield estimation by integrating agrarian \nfactors in ML techniques. This\
    \ allowed them to show a strong relationship between crop \nyield and climatic\
    \ factors. Ref. [103] Provided a systematic review on the use of com-\nputer vision\
    \ and AI to enhance the grain quality of five crops (maize, rice, wheat, soy-\n\
    bean and barley), disease detection and phenotyping. Ref. [64] reviewed the application\

    \ 9:123 \nof big data analysis in some fields of agriculture. It highlighted solutions\
    \ to some key \nwell-known problems, used tools and algorithms, along with input\
    \ datasets. The authors \nconcluded that big data analytics in agriculture is\
    \ still at its early stage, and many bar-\nriers need to be overcome, despite\
    \ the availability of the data and tools to analyse it. To \nmeasure the level\
    \ of usage of big data in DA, the authors defined big data metrics (low, \nmedium,\
    \ high) for each of its dimensions (volume, velocity, and variety). However, while\
    \ \nit is a very simple model, it is not easy to specify thresholds, as some dimensions,\
    \ such \nas volume and velocity depend on technological advances. Ref. [12] presented\
    \ a review \non the use of ML methods to detect biotic stress in crop protection.\
    \ The authors ana-\nlysed the potential of these techniques and their suitability\
    \ to deal with crop protection \nfrom weeds, diseases and insects. In addition,\
    \ they provided very good instructive exam-\nples from different fields of DA.\
    \ An earlier similar study was presented in [89], where \nthe authors studied\
    \ four very popular learning approaches; Artificial Neural Network \n(ANN), Support\
    \ Vector Machine (SVM), K-means, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). \nRef. [25] presented\
    \ a survey on data mining clustering methods applied to food and agri-\ncultural\
    \ domains. It first described major techniques of unsupervised classification,\
    \ then \nit examined some existing techniques applied to agriculture products;\
    \ like fruit clas-\nsification, wine classification, analysis of remote sensing\
    \ in forest images and machine \nvision.\nThis study is not just an update of\
    \ previous surveys. The main objective is to examine \nthe effectiveness of big\
    \ data analytics in crop yield monitoring and discuss the challenges \nof such\
    \ paradigm shift in the agriculture domain. Moreover, It is important to under-\n\
    stand the sources of datasets, their types, and which ML techniques are more suitable\
    \ to \nanalyse them.\nDA: it’s all about data\nDigital Agriculture (DA) relies\
    \ heavily on the data sources and techniques used to col-\nlect it. This data\
    \ is then organised in agricultural data warehouses and analysed [93]. The \n\
    results of this data analysis provide significant insights to farmers and agronomists\
    \ about \nhow to improve the production, minimise the farming operational costs,\
    \ manage risks, \nand protect the environment. The process of deploying DA is\
    \ derived from data science.\nDigital agriculture process\nFigure  4, adopted\
    \ from the knowledge pyramid DIKW, shows a data-driven process, \nwhich is at\
    \ the heart of DA. This usually shows how data from past experiences and \nmodels\
    \ serve as input to techniques of mining and analysis to help in future decisions\
    \ \nand acting accordingly. The newly collected data will be used to further refine\
    \ the pro-\ncess and adapt it to an ever-evolving agricultural world.\nThis is\
    \ a data-driven methodology derived from the overall knowledge discovery pro-\n\
    cess. The first phase, data collection, is crucial to the validity of the whole\
    \ analysis. One \nneeds to carefully identify the type of data that should be\
    \ collected and the approach \nof gathering it and maintain it through its whole\
    \ life cycle. This is even more complex \nin DA, as the data is issued from various\
    \ and heterogeneous sources, and contains a \nnumber of factors of uncertainties.\
    \ The second phase, data representation and analysis, \nis very sophisticated,\
    \ as there is no common standards in the way the data should be \nPage 7 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nintegrated,\
    \ consolidated, to derive a unified representation that is suitable for its analy-\n\
    sis, and in the choice of the analysis techniques. Finally, the decision-making\
    \ is a labori-\nous task, where the extracted knowledge will be associated to\
    \ the expertise of farmers \nand agronomists, farming constraints and regulations\
    \ to derive new management pro-\ncesses with the view to improve productivity\
    \ and quality of products, reduce and their \nimpact on the environment. Figure\
    \  5 depicts a diagram presenting the DA process for \ncrop yield monitoring,\
    \ as explained below.\n• Data collection and preparation It is important to identify\
    \ the data types and attrib-\nutes based on the problem at hand (e.g., crop management),\
    \ and the level of granu-\nlarity of the data. The required data sources should\
    \ also be identified and assessed for \ntheir data quality. As mentioned above,\
    \ the data is then prepared for analysis. This \nincludes data integration, representation,\
    \ selection, transformation, etc.\nFig. 4 DA– a data-driven process\nFig. 5 Big\
    \ Data Analytics system architecture for crop yield monitoring\nPage 8 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n• Data analysis\
    \ the complex nature of the agricultural data requires an elaborative \nanalysis\
    \ approach, ranging from methods of feature selection or extraction to various\
    \ \nlearning algorithms to discover models, patterns (or knowledge in general\
    \ term) for \ndata analysis. These will be evaluated against the expected quality\
    \ of results and their \nsuitability to a decision-making process.\n• Decision-making\
    \ The main goal of the DA process is the decision-making. Any deci-\nsion should\
    \ follow the state-of-the-art practice, be justifiable and scientifically sound.\n\
    Digital agriculture data\nIn agriculture, Very large amounts of data can be collected\
    \ from various sources. These \ninclude sensors, weather stations, satellite imagery,\
    \ drone imagery, and many other \ninstruments. The datasets include weather data,\
    \ farm records, environmental condi-\ntions, soil parameters (nutrients, texture,\
    \ moisture, and so on. The data is usually rich, \nlarge, very complex, and heterogeneous.\
    \ Therefore, its analysis is not straightforward.\nThe heterogeneity is not only\
    \ expressed by the data types and formats, but it can be \ncollected using different\
    \ equipment of different quality. In addition, historical data may \nbe described\
    \ with different sets of attributes compared to very recent data. This can pre-\n\
    sent inconsistencies in naming conventions and measures when the data is collected\
    \ \nfrom different locations and times. Moreover, the data can be static and historical,\
    \ which \nis considered as offline data, and can be online weather data collected\
    \ at regular intervals \n(streams of data values), such as weather data (e.g.,\
    \ every 15 minutes), satellite imagery, \nwhich is characterised of being spatio-temporal,\
    \ such as Geo-spatial data, Moderate-\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ images, etc.\nAs mentioned earlier, the data collection is not well tackled\
    \ in the literature. Most \nof the studies assume that the data is known already,\
    \ and the experimental setup was \nalready in place. Therefore, more effort is\
    \ allocated to the data analysis and interpreta-\ntion rather than on the complete\
    \ environmental parameters and conditions. In the fol-\nlowing sections, we discuss\
    \ the data analysis process. This discussion is structured based \non the main\
    \ categories of the data analysis; classification, and clustering [24]. Note that,\
    \ \nfor high quality results, the data needs to be pre-processed, as discussed\
    \ in the previous \nsection. The pre-processing includes cleaning (dealing with\
    \ missing values, redundant \ndata, noise and outliers), data transformation,\
    \ dimensionality or data reduction, and so \non.\nClassification for crop monitoring\n\
    Big Data analytics system architecture is depicted in Fig.  5. While this system\
    \ is tar-\ngeted specifically to crop yield management, it can be adapted to any\
    \ data-driven appli-\ncation. This architecture implements faithfully what we\
    \ have highlighted in the previous \nsections. In this section, we will focus\
    \ on the data analysis layer of the architecture, \nmoreover, we will pay attention\
    \ to the data types and their sources, techniques of data \nacquisition, the learning\
    \ algorithms. The main objective of the crop management data \nanalysis is to\
    \ get some insights about the crop monitoring problems and show the poten-\ntial\
    \ of DA through big data analytics, also called data mining. Data mining and its\
    \ tech-\nniques are involved in several roles in crop production. Farmers may\
    \ want to know the \nPage 9 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \
    \         (2022) 9:123 \n \nfuture yield of their crop, specific areas of their\
    \ farms suffer from the spread of weeds \nor under-nutrition. Researchers can\
    \ look for information such as plant growth patterns, \noptimum growing conditions,\
    \ best pest and disease control environment and so on. Data \nmining offers panoply\
    \ of sophisticated techniques required to meet all of these needs.\nThere are\
    \ two major categories of data analysis: Classification and Clustering. In the\
    \ \nwork of [24], authors studied applications of data mining techniques in crop\
    \ manage-\nment and proposed a classification of these applications. They found\
    \ that the classifi-\ncation and clustering are the main used categories, where\
    \ the classification includes \nprediction, detection, protection, and categorisation).\
    \ The choice between classification \nor clustering analysis is very simple. If\
    \ the models or classes we are looking for were \nknown in advance and we have\
    \ an annotated data to support the training of the learn-\ning algorithms, then\
    \ classification is the right choice. However, the annotated data is not \nalways\
    \ available and easy to generate, and in many cases we do not know even which\
    \ \nmodels or patterns we are looking for. In these situations, clustering analysis\
    \ is the right \nalternative.\nIn this section, we focus on the studies that use\
    \ classification methods for their data \nanalysis. Clustering analysis will be\
    \ covered in the next section. We structure these clas-\nsification studies based\
    \ on the application objectives or targets which arecategorisation, \nprediction,\
    \ detection, and protection.\nCategorisation\nWhile the classification main objective\
    \ is to assign a given object into one of the pre-\ndetermined classes, in the\
    \ agricultural world, the use of classification process may vary \ndepending on\
    \ the stakeholders interests. In this study, we report four different applica-\n\
    tions (or targets) which are widely used in agriculture categorisation, prediction,\
    \ detec-\ntion, and protection.\nCategorisation aims at defining the classes (or\
    \ class labels) based on the simple recog-\nnition of similarities that exist\
    \ across a set of entities. For example, categorisation can \nbe used to classify\
    \ small fruit from fruit with normal to big size, to make an estima-\ntion of\
    \ yields; which may have an economic impact if the farmer wants to make different\
    \ \npackages or prices for each type of fruit separately. It can also be used\
    \ to classify dam-\naged crops from good ones in order to estimate losses, or\
    \ to prepare for the harvest and \nmarketing. Categorisation can also be applied\
    \ for crop mapping (e.g., poor, average, high \nyield), which aims to provide\
    \ information on farmed fields given a specific type of crops, \nor to identify\
    \ a type of crops that are more suitable for a particular field. Based on the\
    \ \ninput data, categorisation can help improve the farming operations based on\
    \ the mean-\ningful categories (classes) predefined in advance.\nProducing accurate\
    \ crop maps is essential for effective agricultural monitoring [131]. \nCategorisation\
    \ approaches can be applied to study regional crop distribution within or \npost\
    \ growing season. For this purpose, it can offer:\n• A good understanding of how\
    \ crops are distributed at early stage of their develop-\nment; allowing for an\
    \ opportune decision making and management, as well as \nadjusting crop planting\
    \ structure, is crucial. Besides, the timely available of (spatial \nPage 10 of\
    \ 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nor maps)\
    \ distribution of crop types is required for statistical and economic purposes\
    \ \n[131].\n• The availability of crops maps is critical for the diverse agricultural\
    \ monitoring activi-\nties, such as crop acreage estimation, yield modelling,\
    \ harvest operation schedules \n[131, 144], etc.\nMoreover, categorisation has\
    \ been applied for agricultural field mapping [31], to quan-\ntify the cropping\
    \ intensity for small-scale farms [58], to identify and map crops and to \nretrieve\
    \ the area of major cultivation [100] and to classify land-cover and crop [76].\
    \ \nTable  1 highlights the major fields, ideas and tools used for crops categorisation.\
    \ We can \nsee that data issued from satellites and remote sensing, and the features\
    \ with vegetation \nindices especially NDVI and EVI, the RGB colours, are the\
    \ most used.\nCrop yield prediction\nThe estimation of crop yield is crucial in\
    \ DA, as it enables efficient planning of resources. \nEconomically, an early\
    \ and accurate prediction of yields can help decision-makers to \nreact to the\
    \ crops market. Moreover, crop yield prediction permits the study of factors \n\
    that influence and affect the production, such as climate and weather, natural\
    \ soil fer-\ntility and its physical structure and topography, crop stress, the\
    \ incidence of pests and \ndiseases, etc.\nThe prediction of crop yields has been\
    \ the subject of many studies. Ref. [71] presented \na literature review on crop\
    \ forecasting, where the authors highlighted the most used \nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms along with the applied metrics and measures. In this sec-\ntion,\
    \ we examine the learning algorithms that have been used in crop yield prediction\
    \ \nfrom different views: data types, the pre-processing methods, and features\
    \ or the predic-\ntor variables used in each study. Tables  2 and  3 summarise\
    \ some relevant studies.\nThe crop yield forecasting approaches follow two major\
    \ types of sources of data. The \nfirst type is related to the sources that have\
    \ direct impact on the crops. These sources are \nsoil data, weather data, environmental\
    \ parameter data. These are usually used to predict \ncrop yield [27, 34, 42,\
    \ 46, 51, 73]. The second type of sources are the use of advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and tools like satellite multi/hyper spectral images, remote sensing and \n\
    sensors to collect the data [62, 83, 102, 114, 152]. Some advanced studies use\
    \ both types \nof data sources [1, 40, 54, 59, 65, 67, 68, 97, 120, 121].\nThe\
    \ forecasting models based on the first type of data sources provides a pre-season\
    \ \nestimation of the yield, even before the beginning of the crop season. This\
    \ allows farmers \nto decide which strategy to both optimise the farming operations\
    \ and crop production. \nThese decisions include choosing seeds and crop type,\
    \ type of fertiliser and its applica-\ntions. Moreover, This data can also be\
    \ used for some crop monitoring during the grow-\ning season.\nThe monitoring\
    \ systems based on the second type of data analysis - data imagery \nobtained\
    \ from satellite, cameras, scanner, sensors - allow for on-season estimation \n\
    (emergence, detect stress conditions of crop, harvest dates, ...). These models\
    \ are com-\nplex since they have to analyse the data that consists of both spatio-temporal\
    \ and non-\nspacial. While the spatial data is of high resolution, some images\
    \ can be of very poor \nPage 11 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data\

    \ as a major menace for food security in many regions of the \nworld since it\
    \ causes serious crops losses. While the detection of crop diseases correctly\
    \ \nand timely when they first appear is crucial in crop monitoring, this remains\
    \ a difficult \ntask. One of the solutions to deal with this issue is to use data\
    \ analytics approach. This \nwill reduce yield losses and prevent farmers to take\
    \ effective reactive actions. Forewarn-\ning can be seen as the outputs of data\
    \ mining process. Usually, this consists of examining \nthe features of a newly\
    \ presented case and assigning it to a predefined class.\nSeveral interesting\
    \ efforts have been developed to prevent crops losses due to dis-\neases, Tables\
    \  4 and 5 summarise some major studies. Ref. [7] presented an overview of \n\
    ML techniques for crop disease classification. In addition, it presented to a\
    \ case study \nwhere a deep learning algorithm was successfully used. Ref. [45]\
    \ provided a review on \nadvanced ANN techniques to process hyper-spectral data\
    \ for plant disease detection. \nRecently, deep learning approaches have been\
    \ emerged and widely used for plant dis-\nease detection and classification, with\
    \ a variety of network architectures (CNN, AlexNet, \ngoogLeNet, CaffeNet, DenseNet,\
    \ Inception, LeNet, VGGNet,...) and training methods \n(shallow, deep, from scratch)\
    \ [9, 16, 21, 28, 38, 63, 79, 82, 125, 139, 143, 150, 155]. More-\nover, [127]\
    \ presented an interesting study on the potential of the use of deep learning\
    \ for \nplant stress phenotyping.\nCrop protection, that consists of disease,\
    \ stress, and weed detection, aims to offer tools \nthat detect plants disease\
    \ caused by various biotic (pathogen, insect, pest, and weed) \nor abiotic (temperature\
    \ stress, nutrient deficiency, toxicity, herbicide) variables [126]. \nThe earlier\
    \ the stress, disease or their symptoms are detected, the greater the chance of\
    \ \nreducing the disease spread within a field. This has gained significant advantage\
    \ from the \nadvances in image collection and processing and their analysis using\
    \ ML algorithm. The \nstate-of-the-art is very rich. The large majority of studies\
    \ carried out so far were using \nimage processing, consequently image-based data\
    \ and classification techniques. These \nare capable of detecting disease at the\
    \ scale of leaf, canopy or field [126].\nDisease detection at a leaf level uses\
    \ images collected using digital cameras, which are \nstored in data warehouses.\
    \ For instance, PlantVillage database [6, 9, 21, 28, 63, 79, 88, \n106, 125, 129,\
    \ 150] is created for this purpose. The objective of this repository is to build\
    \ \nclassifiers with high accuracy. The basic classifiers can simply assign to\
    \ an unseen image \na label healthy or infected, while more elaborated classifiers\
    \ can identify the disease - in \nother words, classify unseen images to disease\
    \ classes. However, this approach has some \nlimitations. First, it depends on\
    \ the quality of the images, as when taken in natural envi-\nronment, these images\
    \ are subject to different degrees of light, shadow, dust and leaves \noverlapping\
    \ and requires sophisticated image processing, which is not an easy task. Sec-\n\
    ond, usually the datasets sizes are small, which affect the learning phase of\
    \ the classifiers \nPage 16 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \

    \ potential of some advanced learning algorithms such as deep \nlearning. Data\
    \ augmentation (rotation, light shade’s variation, colour inversion, transla-\n\
    tion and changes in intensity and so on) is one of the methods used to overcome\
    \ this \nproblem to artificially increase the number of images [6, 9, 21, 63,\
    \ 79, 129, 150], but it \ndoes not always work. Transfer learning is another solution\
    \ to scarce/small data-set, \nwhere the knowledge obtained from solving a task\
    \ in a given domain is transferred to \nthe target domain in which the dataset\
    \ is small [6, 11, 28]. The transfer learning can only \nbe efficient if the source\
    \ and target domains share some similarities in terms of diseases \nand their\
    \ symptoms, for example. Moreover, it is very challenging to transfer knowledge\
    \ \nfrom representations learned using RGB images to a target task using multi-spectral\
    \ \nimages from UAV or satellite [126].\nThird, this approach cannot detect more\
    \ than a single disease at a time, and the detec-\ntion of diseases if the symptoms\
    \ are manifested in another area than leaves. Plant can-\nopy based-image was\
    \ proposed as a solution to this problem. The idea is to collect data \nrelative\
    \ to disease in situations where single-leaf phenotypes alone would not provide\
    \ \nsufficient information. Such features include the size, the height, the structure,\
    \ and \nbranching of canopy [126]. The canopy-based detection uses UAV equipped\
    \ with (multi/ \nhyper) spectral cameras and sensors to collect the data [32,\
    \ 49, 80, 82, 136, 143, 153, \n155]. Then data needs to be processed to extract\
    \ features which are usually related to \nvegetation indices like NDVI and EVI\
    \ or colours like RGB and NIR. The benefit from \nUAV images comes with cost on\
    \ complexity of analysis since images taken by UAV are \nsusceptible to occlusion,\
    \ overlapping, and atmospheric effects. Also, UAV is not able \nto fly at higher\
    \ altitudes, which decreases the quality of the collected images. To cover \n\
    larger zones and fields, satellite-based remote sensing and images has been proposed\
    \ as \na very good alternative [15, 81, 109, 156]. However, the problem with satellite\
    \ remote \nsensing is the revisit time, which is 16 days on average, which makes\
    \ protection applica-\ntions difficult, and some diseases can spread rapidly in\
    \ fields before they are detected. \nMoreover, passive sensors cannot penetrate\
    \ clouds [149]. The integration of these data \nwith additional data sources like\
    \ field surveys, contextual information of field and crop \nrotation can improve\
    \ the accuracy [15, 81, 109].\nDetecting diseases only from one data source based\
    \ on digital images or sensor data is \nnot sufficient. Besides, variations in\
    \ symptoms may lead to false positives due to dynamic \nnature of plant changes\
    \ [126]. Consequently, the appearance-based identification of dis-\neases is not\
    \ reliable enough to accurately detect unhealthy plants, especially in the early\
    \ \ngrowth stages. The use of multi-data sources can improve the accuracy of the\
    \ detection. \nFor instance, the use of physiological features and morphological\
    \ characteristics (growth \nattributes, yield-related features, soil) [66], or\
    \ the employment of satellite-based images \nand canopy-based images [156], where\
    \ the disease can be identified at the plant canopy \nlevel and at the field level.\n\
    Crop maturity monitoring\nCrop maturity is a kind of crop yield prediction, but\
    \ it is based on image data. This tech-\nnique has been used in fruit detection,\
    \ like apples, tomatoes, oranges, etc, and provides \nan early estimation of yield.\
    \ It is also used for crop monitoring to provide information \nto farmers with\
    \ the view to plan their farming operations, adjust management practices \nPage\

    \ \nbefore harvesting, etc. Such intelligent systems for monitoring crop implement\
    \ the data \nmining process incorporating machine vision and image processing\
    \ methods among \nwith advanced learning algorithms, such as CNN, SVM and ANN.\
    \ Unlike crop yield \nprediction process described above, this process is based\
    \ on a single-data source; digital \nimages [5, 23, 52, 75, 108, 122] or sensor\
    \ based-images [117, 123, 153]. Table  6 summa-\nrises such techniques. The challenges\
    \ of these systems are more or less the same as those \nof systems for crop disease\
    \ detection and protection. For instance, images with differ-\nent illumination\
    \ and lighting angles, complex surroundings and backgrounds, noise, the \npresence\
    \ of clouds, etc.\nClustering for crop monitoring\nClustering techniques are not\
    \ widely employed in DA, few efforts have been deployed to \ninvestigate the potential\
    \ of these techniques for zones’ delineation within a field. There \nare several\
    \ reasons for splitting an agricultural field into zones. Some traditional reasons\
    \ \ninclude crop diversification within a field, crop-rotation, facilitating the\
    \ management \ntasks, and more recently we defined the zones based on yield maps.\
    \ This usually helps \nto improve the overall crop yield of the field, by managing\
    \ the zones more effectively. \nTherefore, delineation of Management zones (DMZ)\
    \ is a very important task for farming \noperations since determining zones of\
    \ low-or-high yields, and understanding the rea-\nsons behind low yields, can\
    \ help come up with specific solution for each zone with the \nview to increase\
    \ the yields. In addition, it has other economic benefits, because we can \ntarget\
    \ each zone with the right amount of fertilisers, water, and other nutrients.\n\
    According to [69], delineation of management zones is an effective way to manage\
    \ the \nvariability of soil within a field, such that each zone will receive specific\
    \ management. In \n[145], a management zone is defined as a subregion of a field\
    \ that has a relatively homo-\ngeneous combination of yield-limiting factors,\
    \ for which a single rate of a specific crop \ninput is appropriate to reach maximum\
    \ efficiency of farm inputs. In [53], it is defined as \na subregion of a field\
    \ that is relatively homogeneous with regard to soil attributes.\nDMZ is a complex\
    \ spatial problem, which is addressed in the literature from several \nperspectives.\
    \ This has attracted interest from many researchers [61, 85, 87, 110, 140]. A\
    \ \nliterature review has been presented in [90], where the authors discussed\
    \ the delineation \nof soil management zones from the variable-rate fertilisation\
    \ point of view. many other \nstudies presented the delineation based on various\
    \ criteria. Some techniques that have \nbeen used include topographic maps, direct\
    \ soil sampling, non-invasive soil sampling by \nelectrical conductivity equipment,\
    \ soil organic matter or organic estimated by remote \nsensing, and yield maps\
    \ built using data collected over several seasons/years [99].\nFigure  6 depicts\
    \ the general process of delineation of management zones designed \naccording\
    \ to methodologies followed by the majority of the literature.\nThe majority of\
    \ problems that are related to crop management imply the management \nof fields\
    \ and zones. Therefore, the collected data is usually characterised by geographic\
    \ \ncoordinates and time associated with each sample, which leads to the use of\
    \ data min-\ning techniques that are more suitable for spatial and temporal datasets.\
    \ It is well rec-\nognised that agricultural datasets are typically spatio-temporal,\
    \ as the data is always \nassociated with location and time. However, these datasets\
    \ contain a significant amount \nof noise, outliers, and even missing values.\

    \ noise, imprecisions, and even outliers in the data. Satellite imagery also faces\
    \ huge \nimprecision and noise (such as clouds, ...).\nBecause of the type of\
    \ the datasets, which is spatio-temporal, it is not surprising \nto notice that\
    \ the majority of the clustering algorithms used are of type partitional. \nK-means\
    \ and Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) are considered among the most popular clustering \ntechniques\
    \ and heavily used to cluster agricultural data [17, 18, 84, 134, 137, 142, 151,\
    \ \n154]. The FCM approach has an advantage over K-means, as it deals better with\
    \ impre-\ncision and noisy data. Moreover, other types of clustering algorithms\
    \ have also been \nproven to be efficient in DA, such as density-based and hierarchical-based\
    \ clustering \ntechniques applied to DMZ [48, 116].\nAs mentioned above, besides\
    \ its huge importance in crop management, delineation \nof management zone (DMZ)\
    \ has received much attention, as the data is now available \nnot only from traditional\
    \ sources but also from refined sources, including advanced data \npre-processing\
    \ techniques. In addition, the recently collected data integrates knowledge \n\
    of experts and farmers experiences on their fields, which improves significantly\
    \ the qual-\nity of the data [84, 141]. Advanced imaging enhancement techniques\
    \ improve further \nthe data quality, and they offer the ability to track the\
    \ development of crops and provide \na Geo-referenced data that can describe the\
    \ spatial and the temporal variability of soil \nand crops variables at high resolution,\
    \ covering large areas [17, 84, 101, 132, 133, 141, \n151].\nSystematic analysis\n\
    In the following we will explore the application of data analytics in DA and its\
    \ extension \nto big data, and illustrate the practical challenges that hinder\
    \ the full adoption of DA by \nfarmers.\nDA in (small /large) scale farming\n\
    Farming can be carried out on a small or large-scale fields depending on several\
    \ fac-\ntors like land size, capital, farmer skills, level of use of machinery\
    \ and technology, etc. \nAccording to FAO3 and Grain4, over 90% of all farms worldwide\
    \ are of small-scale hold-\ning on average 2.2 hectares (from 0.6 to 10 hectares),\
    \ except for Northern America \nwhere small farms have an average size of 67.7\
    \ hectares5. Small-scale farms represent \n25% of the world’s farmland today,\
    \ where 73.12% are located in developing countries.\nFig. 6 The delineation management\
    \ zones process\n3 http:// faost at3. fao. org/ faost at- gatew ay/ go/ to/ home/.\n\
    4 https:// grain. org.\n5 According to the criterion put forward by Lincoln University\
    \ in Nebraska, which defines a small farm in the US as one \nwith an annual turnover\
    \ of less than US$50,000)\nPage 24 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big\
    \ Data           (2022) 9:123 \nIn [10] the authors described three categories\
    \ of smart farming technology, which are \ncomplementary:\n• Data acquisition\
    \ technologies: they are used to acquire the data that is related to the \nfarm.\
    \ These include remote sensing, weather data, etc.;\n• Data analysis and evaluation\
    \ technologies: these technologies usually take as input \nthe data that has been\
    \ collected so far and deliver insight to the farmer. These include \ncomputer-based\
    \ visualisation and decision models, farm management and informa-\ntion systems;\n\
    • Precision application technologies: these are focusing on variable-rate application\
    \ \nand guidance technologies.\nThe application of smart technologies and data\
    \ analytics for crop management are not \nrestricted to one kind of farm. Nowadays,\
    \ every farm should adopt smart technologies, \nas they are needed for variable\
    \ rates applications (irrigation, pesticides, fertilisers) [72, \n102, 154] while\
    \ protecting the environment.\nThe size of the farm determines how these technologies\
    \ will be used. Large farms tend \nto develop their smart technology to monitor\
    \ their farming land, or to afford some of the \nexisting sophisticated systems\
    \ like CropX as they hold the scale and margins. While small \nfarms tend to rent\
    \ sophisticated machinery and smart applications on demand, especially \nwith\
    \ the proliferation of cloud technologies that makes these smart applications\
    \ reason-\nable, the work of [30] is an example among others, of a smart irrigation\
    \ system designed \nfor smallholders. Besides, some technologies are more suitable\
    \ for large-scale farms like \ndrones and aerial vehicles used to monitor crops\
    \ which are not as profitable or efficient \nfor small scales because they have\
    \ less difficulty visualising their crops. On the other side, \nlarge-scale farms\
    \ are responsible for 70% of current deforestation6, the largest share of \nagriculture-related\
    \ greenhouse-gazes emissions, agricultural water use and habitat disrup-\ntion\
    \ resulting in biodiversity loss. Generally, small-scale farms require considerably\
    \ fewer \nexternal inputs and cause minor damage to the environment.\nTable  7\
    \ summarises the main differences between small and large-scale farming from \n\
    several perspectives. However, DA can be applied to any kind of farm without restric-\n\
    tion. Yet, we have found that the number of papers that addressed large-scale\
    \ farms is \nalmost the same as works on large-scale farms.\nTechnologies for\
    \ data acquisition Table  7 can be used to all types of farms, such as \nremote\
    \ sensing, imagery data systems, and so on. The acquired data, over the years,\
    \ can \nlead to the phenomenon of Big Data. If pre-processed and stored properly,\
    \ this will give \na significant competitive advantage to farms that collected\
    \ them, whether they are small \nor large. Some of the applications and data analyses\
    \ that can be performed of the col-\nlected are summarised in the Tables  1,  2,\
    \  3, 4 and  5,  6.\nDA and big data\nBig data is not just characterised by the\

    \ techniques to deal with large volumes of data (volume), various types of data\
    \ \nattributes (variety or heterogeneity), and be able to analyse the new data\
    \ as soon as it \nis collected (velocity) are extremely challenging tasks. Moreover,\
    \ many other character-\nistics can be found in some big data-driven applications,\
    \ these include veracity, value, \nviscosity, veracity, visualisation, etc. In\
    \ this study, we added veracity, as the data, col-\nlected by various instruments\
    \ and sensors, is of different quality, which creates a huge \nchallenge to the\
    \ data pre-processing task, and therefore its analysis. In the following, we \n\
    discuss the impact of Big Data challenges on DA.\n• Velocity: many studies that\
    \ have been examined do not consider the data velocity \nduring their data collection.\
    \ In DA, the frequency of collecting data depends on its \nsource and the problem\
    \ for which the data was collected. Some applications need \nreal-time data and\
    \ others do not. For instance, crop yield prediction does not need \nreal-time\
    \ data or data streams. It is performed at ad-hoc, while crop protection and \n\
    disease detection require high quality sensors and imagery data connected to effi-\n\
    cient methods of data analysis, which need continuous control.\n• Variety: this\
    \ is very common in agricultural datasets, as multiple sources were used \nto\
    \ collect all the necessary information about the farm and farming operations.\
    \ The \ndata values can be a simple number such as temperatures to more elaborated\
    \ such as \nimagery data, NDVI, soil texture, etc. This makes the definition of\
    \ distance measures \nand other parameters of the learning algorithms very difficult.\n\
    • Veracity: Agricultural data contains many missing values and collected from\
    \ various \nsources of varying quality. The data is very noisy, and more importantly\
    \ it contains \nmany missing values. Therefore, it is very challenging to clean\
    \ and prepare it for the \nanalysis. This was the case in the work conducted by\
    \ [37], and also in [93–96, 107] \nwhere data was collected from very large farming\
    \ areas.\nTable  8, summarises a set of representative papers reported in the\
    \ paper according to \ntheir usage of big data. For each paper, we identify the\
    \ type, the size, the heterogeneity \nof data used, and the frequency of its collection.\
    \ Also, we consider the number and type \nof ML algorithms used, the complexity\
    \ of the proposed analysis algorithms and devices \nused to collect data, data\
    \ analysis applied to a given crop and problem to solve. One \ncan notice while\
    \ the data analysis algorithms and techniques were heavily used and var-\nied,\
    \ the rigorous process of knowledge discovery was not followed, usually the data\
    \ is \nrelatively small either in size (small observations) or the data has few\
    \ dimensions (for \ninstance, considering only weather data, or fertiliser, without\
    \ taking into account other \nfactors).\nFrom Table  8, we can extract three classes\
    \ of applications according to their usage of \nbig data: Full usage (the data\
    \ contains all the characteristics of big data), light usage (the \ndata contains\
    \ some characteristics), non-usage (the data does not contain any character-\n\
    istic of big data).\nTo examine the degree of use of the big data concept and\
    \ to figure out which of its \ndimension is more present, we conducted a statistical\
    \ study where we classify works \naccording to their employment of the 4Vs of\
    \ big data.\nPage 27 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data         \

    \  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nFigures  7 and  8 show that\
    \ no work has a full employment of big data (4Vs). One can \nnotice that the agricultural\
    \ data is multidimensional and heterogeneous (variety). More-\nover, we have found\
    \ that the prediction applications display more use of big data, there \nexist\
    \ studies that have used three dimensions such as DMZ applications. It is worth\
    \ not-\ning that these applications, either prediction or delineation of zones,\
    \ have the potential \nto use big data to provide stable and accurate results.\n\
    If we put aside the volume dimension (V1) (see Figure  7, only 7% of the reviewed\
    \ \nstudies used (V2, V3 and V4), and 32% of studies just employed data mining\
    \ techniques \nfor agriculture problems. The most employed data mining techniques\
    \ are for prediction, \nincluding yield prediction, forecasting, prediction of\
    \ fertiliser applications, etc.\nDA practical challenges\nThere exist a number\
    \ of challenges and obstacles impeding the potential benefit of DA. \nIn [104],\
    \ the authors studied the barriers that prevent the adoption of smart farming\
    \ \nin their country, Brazil. Some of these barriers include lack of integration\
    \ and compat-\nibility between different agriculture systems, lack of advanced\
    \ data manipulation of data \nobtained from different equipment, poor telecommunications\
    \ infrastructure on rural \nareas, and finally, the lack of training in deploying\
    \ and using new technologies. These \nbarriers are common to the majority of countries\
    \ in the world.\nFig. 7 Distribution of works according to the used Big Data dimensions’\n\
    Fig. 8 Percent of employment of big data dimensions\nPage 30 of 37\nChergui and\
    \ Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nFrom the Table  7, we\
    \ can see that over 73% of crop farms are located in developing \ncountries. So\
    \ that, the investment in high and sophisticated DA technologies is not \nthere.\
    \ Most of the main technologies used in DA systems (GPS, UAV, auto-steering and\
    \ \nvariable rate technology) are designed for relatively large-scale farms located\
    \ in devel-\noped countries [10] or designed by developed countries. Some of these\
    \ technologies are \nbecoming available recently. For instance, since 2018 African\
    \ scientists can have access \nto free and open-source satellite data as a result\
    \ of a deal signed by the African Union \nwith the European Commission’s Copernicus\
    \ programme.\nAs DA is relatively new technology, there is a lack of standards\
    \ and common solutions \nfor data collection, preparation and storage. In addition,\
    \ there is a lack of data for many \nreasons, farmers did not record their data\
    \ and it takes time to build significant historical \ndatasets [20, 39, 77, 78,\
    \ 92, 146]. Another major barrier is that many farmers are relying \nmore on their\
    \ expertise and refusing to adopt these new and complex technologies [10]. \n\
    Moreover, the transition from their traditional practices and farming habits to\
    \ these \ntechnologies comes with a cost and energy (training and learning new\
    \ skills).\n[20] States that the legal and regulatory frameworks around the collection,\
    \ sharing and \nuse of agricultural data contributes to a range of challenges.\
    \ Many laws potentially influ-\nence the ownership, control of and data access.\
    \ Ref. [74] presented a set of socio-ethical \nimperatives associated with the\
    \ use of data in agriculture, including dependency risks, \ndata concentration,\
    \ potential lock-in effects, and the peril of transformation of farmers \ninto\
    \ information tools, in addition to the sustainability challenges.\nFinally, according\
    \ to [47], the real economic value of the use of big data in farming is \nstill\
    \ unknown, especially for small-scale farming. Consequently, it will be hard to\
    \ con-\nvince them to switch from process-driven towards data and machine learning\
    \ driven. \nThis is reaffirmed in [20], where the authors stated that on one side,\
    \ farmers are enticed \nwith promises of increased profits and farming efficiency,\
    \ on the other hand the proofs \nare not there yet.\nConclusion\nDigital agriculture\
    \ (DA) is a data-driven approach that exploits the hidden information \nwithin\
    \ the collected data to gain new insights; transforming the farming practices\
    \ from \nintuitive-based decision-making to informed-based decision-making. DA\
    \ relies on effi-\ncient data collection practices, efficient data preparation\
    \ and storage techniques, effi-\ncient data analytics, and efficient deployment\
    \ and exploitation of the gained insights to \nmake optimal farming decisions.\n\
    In this study, we presented a systematic review of the potential use of the data\
    \ mining \nprocess in crop production and management and highlighted serious gaps\
    \ which can be \nconsidered in future studies. The majority of the current practices\
    \ were dominated by \nstatistical analyses and small machine learning systems.\
    \ However, these can only give \nsome ideas within a very limited view of the\
    \ overall system. Agricultural data-driven \napplications collect a significant\
    \ amount of data from various sources. This constitutes \nan excellent opportunity\
    \ to the field to answer numerous research and practical ques-\ntions that were\
    \ not possible before. Nevertheless, despite all the advantages that can \nbe\
    \ gained from DA, there are several other challenges and obstacles that need to\
    \ be \nPage 31 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022)\
    \ 9:123 \n \naddressed, among them lack of data, lack of skills, and lack of maturity\
    \ and standards so \nthat it can be adopted and deployed quickly and easily.\n\
    In this study, we cover approaches that deal the entire process of data mining;\
    \ from \ndata collection to knowledge deployment. We cover this process from big\
    \ data view, \nwith more focus on crop monitoring and management in an attempt\
    \ to understand the \nchallenges that DA is currently facing. We defined the research\
    \ questions addressed by \nthe study and provided a classification of data mining\
    \ techniques used in the field. For \neach class, a set of representative existing\
    \ works have been reviewed, and an analytical \nstudy has been provided to highlight\
    \ the category of machine learning method applied \nand for which purpose. We\
    \ discussed the big data concepts and its current impact on \nDA, and showed that\
    \ from the data analyst’s view, the transition towards DA is ready \nto embrace\
    \ big data analytics concepts. This provides new opportunities of investment \n\
    into these challenges and allows for a efficient ways of managing crops. Besides,\
    \ it will \nprovide farmers with new insights into how they can grow crops more\
    \ efficiently, while \nminimising the impact on the environment. It also promises\
    \ new levels of scientific dis-\ncovery and innovative solutions to more complex\
    \ problems.\nAbbreviations\nANN \n Artificial Neural Network\nBC \n Bayesian classifier\n\

    Abstract—On one hand, the emergence of cutting-edge tech-

    nologies like AI, Cloud Computing, and IoT holds immense

    potential in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. These

    technologies enable real-time data collection, including high-

    resolution crop imagery, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

    Leveraging these advancements can revolutionize agriculture by

    facilitating faster decision-making, cost reduction, and increased

    yields. Such progress aligns with precision agriculture principles,

    optimizing practices for the right locations, times, and quantities.

    On the other hand, integrating UAVs in Smart Farming faces

    obstacles related to technology selection and deployment, par-

    ticularly in data acquisition and image processing. The relative

    novelty of UAV utilization in Precision Agriculture contributes to

    the lack of standardized workflows. Consequently, the widespread

    adoption and implementation of UAV technologies in farming

    practices are hindered. This paper addresses these challenges by

    conducting a comprehensive review of recent UAV applications

    in Precision Agriculture. It explores common applications, UAV

    types, data acquisition techniques, and image processing methods

    to provide a clear understanding of each technology’s advantages

    and limitations. By gaining insights into the advantages and

    challenges associated with UAV-based applications in Precision

    Agriculture, this study aims to contribute to the development

    of standardized workflows and improve the adoption of UAV

    technologies.

    INTRODUCTION

    The agriculture industry is currently undergoing a sig-

    nificant transformation fueled by cutting-edge technologies,

    offering promising prospects for enhanced farm productivity

    and profitability. Precision Agriculture, which focuses on the

    precise application of inputs where and when they are needed,

    represents the third stage of the modern agricultural revolution.

    Advanced farm knowledge systems, empowered by the abun-

    dance of data, have further propelled the evolution of Preci-

    sion Agriculture [1]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the

    positive impacts of adopting Precision Agriculture technolo-

    gies, such as increased net returns and operating profits, as

    reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2].

    Moreover, there is a growing emphasis on implementing these

    technologies in environmentally conscious ways to ensure

    sustainable farm production. However, effectively harnessing

    the vast amount of data generated by crops remains a persistent

    challenge [3].

    To address these challenges, it is crucial to explore and

    integrate cutting-edge technologies in the realm of Smart

    Farming and Precision Agriculture. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

    (UAVs), Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data

    analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as key

    enablers of innovation in this domain [4]. UAVs equipped with

    advanced sensors and imaging capabilities allow for real-time

    data collection, including high-resolution imagery of crops.

    Cloud Computing provides the infrastructure for data storage,

    processing, and analysis, while IoT facilitates the seamless

    integration of various agricultural devices and sensors. Big

    Data analytics and AI techniques enable intelligent insights

    and decision-making based on the collected data [5], [6].

    This paper aims to delve into the theoretical background

    and related work of UAV, Cloud, IoT, Big Data, and AI

    approaches in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. Ad-

    ditionally, authors propose a comprehensive systematic review

    study that investigates the current state of research and de-

    velopment in this area. By analyzing existing literature, in

    order to identify the gaps, challenges, and opportunities for

    utilizing these technologies in the context of Smart Farming

    and Precision Agriculture, Fig. 1, depicted below, offers valu-

    able insights into the evolution characteristics and challenges

    of agricultural development, spanning from Farming 1.0 to

    Farming 5.0. This figure serves as a valuable tool to showcase

    the effective utilization and evolution of technologies within

    the realms of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. The

    problem statement of this study revolves around the lack

    of a standardized framework for leveraging UAVs, Cloud

    Computing, IoT, Big Data, and AI in Smart Farming and

    Precision Agriculture. This lack of standardization hinders the

    widespread adoption and implementation of these technolo-

    gies, limiting their potential benefits for farmers, agricultural

    productivity, and sustainable practices. To address this prob-

    lem, our proposed solution is to conduct a systematic review

    that synthesizes existing research, identifies key insights, and

    provides recommendations for the development of standard-

    ized frameworks and practices in this field.

    The motivation behind this work stems from the immense

    potential of integrating UAVs, Cloud Computing, IoT, Big Data

    analytics, and AI in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    By leveraging these technologies effectively, farmers can make

    faster and more informed decisions, reduce costs, optimize

    resource utilization, and increase yields. Moreover, this inte-

    gration aligns with the growing demand for sustainable farming

    practices and the need to meet the rising global food demands.

    The contribution of this paper lies in the comprehensive review

    of existing literature, which consolidates knowledge, identifies

    research gaps, and proposes recommendations for the future

    development of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    BACKGROUND

    A. Unnamed Aerial Vehicles for Agriculture

    Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), also known as drones,

    have become increasingly popular in agriculture due to their

    ability to provide a quick, cost-effective and efficient way to

    gather data and perform tasks on large fields and crops [7].

    UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) indeed come in different

    types and can be equipped with a variety of sensors and

    cameras presented in Fig. 2 that can capture high-resolution

    images, aerial maps and thermal imagery, which can be used

    for a range of agriculture applications, including:

    •

    Crop monitoring: UAS can be used to gather real-time

    data on crop health, growth, and yield potential.

    •

    Irrigation management: Drones can be equipped with

    infrared cameras to identify areas that are in need of

    irrigation and to help optimize water use.

    •

    Pest and disease management: Drones can be used

    to detect and map the spread of pests and diseases in

    crops, helping farmers to take timely action to prevent

    or treat these issues.

    •

    Field mapping: UAS can produce high-resolution

    maps of fields, providing data on soil structure, to-

    pography, and plant populations, which can be used to

    make informed decisions about planting, fertilization

    and other aspects of crop management.

    •

    Livestock management: Drones can be used to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock, as well as to keep

    track of the location of animals.

    Overall, the use of UAS in agriculture provides a new tool for

    farmers to gather data, monitor their crops and make more

    informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved yields,

    increased efficiency and reduced costs.

    B. Cloud, Internet of Things, Big data and IA

    1) Cloud: computing plays a crucial role in smart farming,

    which is an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in

    agriculture. The cloud enables farmers to store, process, and

    analyze large amounts of data generated from various IoT

    devices and sensors on their farms [9]. This data can include

    information on weather patterns, soil moisture levels, crop

    growth, and even the health of livestock. By analyzing this data

    in real-time, farmers can make more informed decisions about

    crop management and animal husbandry, leading to increased

    productivity and efficiency.

    Additionally, cloud-based solutions can provide farmers

    with access to advanced algorithms and predictive analytics

    tools that can help them optimize their farming operations.

    For example, cloud-based machine learning models can predict

    UAV, Sensing UAV) [8].

    crop yields, identify pest infestations, and suggest the most

    appropriate treatments. Furthermore, the cloud allows farmers

    to monitor their farms remotely and receive real-time updates

    on conditions and activities.

    2) Internet of Things: The concept of the Internet of Things

    (IoT) pertains to a network comprising physical devices,

    vehicles, appliances, and various objects. These entities are

    equipped with sensors, software, and connectivity features that

    empower them to gather and exchange data via the internet.

    These connected devices can communicate and interact with

    each other, as well as with humans, creating a vast ecosystem

    of interconnected systems [10]. The IoT has the potential to

    revolutionize various sectors, including agriculture, healthcare,

    transportation, smart homes, and many others, by enabling

    increased automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-

    making. In smart farming, IoT is used to gather real-time data

    from various sources such as weather stations, soil moisture

    sensors, and crop and animal monitoring systems.

    IoT devices and sensors in smart farming can range from

    simple weather sensors to more complex systems such as pre-

    cision agriculture systems that use Global Positioning System

    (GPS) to monitor the growth and health of crops. These devices

    can also be connected to irrigation systems, allowing farmers

    to control the amount of water they use based on real-time

    soil moisture levels. One of the key benefits of IoT in smart

    farming is that it enables farmers to make data-driven decisions

    in real-time. This leads to more efficient use of resources and

    improved crop yields. IoT also enables farmers to monitor their

    farms remotely, reducing the need for on-site visits and freeing

    up more time for other tasks.

    In addition to its direct benefits, IoT in smart farming

    can also help address important global challenges such as

    food security and sustainability [11]. By using technology to

    optimize their operations, farmers can produce more food using

    fewer resources, reducing their carbon footprint and helping to

    ensure that future generations have access to safe and healthy

    food. Overall, the Internet of Things is revolutionizing the way

    farming is done and is poised to play a crucial role in the future

    of agriculture.

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are networks of small,

    low-cost, and low-power devices that can be used to monitor

    and collect data from the environment [12]. These devices,

    called “nodes”, are equipped with sensors, microcontrollers,

    and wireless communication capabilities, allowing them to

    transmit data wirelessly to a central location for analysis.

    WSNs are widely used in a variety of applications, in-

    cluding smart farming, where they are used to monitor soil

    moisture, temperature, light, and other environmental param-

    eters that affect crop growth [13]. The data collected by the

    sensor nodes can be used to make informed decisions about

    irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices, leading

    to increased efficiency and higher crop yields.

    One of the key benefits of WSNs is that they are low-cost

    and easy to deploy, making them accessible to farmers of all

    sizes and resources. They are also scalable, allowing farmers

    to add more nodes as their needs grow [14]. Finally, a review

    of 77 research papers published between 2012 and 2022 on

    the implementation of IoT in various agricultural applications

    showed that roughly 16% focused on precision agriculture

    and the same percentage on irrigation monitoring. 13% of

    the papers delved into soil monitoring, while temperature and

    animal monitoring were each covered in 11% of the research.

    Air and disease monitoring each received 5% of attention, with

    water monitoring accounting for 7%. Fertilization monitoring

    was the least studied, with only 4% of the research papers

    devoted to it in [15].

    C. Big Data

    Big Data plays a significant role in the context of smart

    farming. Smart farming involves the application of advanced

    technologies, such as sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) de-

    vices, and data analytics, to enhance agricultural practices and

    decision-making processes [16]. These technologies generate

    vast amounts of data from various sources, including weather

    conditions, soil moisture levels, crop health indicators, and

    machinery performance.

    IJACSA-International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,

    Vol. 14, No. 6, 2023

    Big Data analytics allows for the collection, storage, pro-

    cessing, and analysis of large volumes of agricultural data in

    real-time or near-real-time. By applying advanced analytics

    techniques, such as machine learning and predictive model-

    ing, valuable insights can be extracted from this data. These

    insights can help optimize farming practices, improve resource

    allocation, enhance crop yield, and enable more informed

    decision-making for farmers and agricultural stakeholders [17].

    Furthermore, Big Data analytics can enable predictive capa-

    bilities in smart farming. By leveraging historical data and

    machine learning algorithms, models can be developed to

    forecast disease outbreaks, pests infestation, crop yield, and

    market demand. These predictive insights empower farmers to

    make proactive decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize resource

    allocation. In summary, the integration of Big Data analyt-

    ics in smart farming allows for data-driven decision-making,

    optimization of agricultural practices, and the potential for

    increased productivity, sustainability, and profitability in the

    agriculture industry [18], [19].

    D. Artificial Intelligence

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses the creation of

    computer systems capable of executing tasks typically requir-

    ing human intelligence, including pattern recognition, predic-

    tion, and learning from experience. In smart farming, AI is

    used to automate various processes and make more informed

    decisions [16]. One of the key applications of AI in smart

    farming is precision agriculture, where AI algorithms are used

    to analyze data from various sources, such as weather stations

    and sensors, to determine the best practices for growing crops.

    For example, AI can be used to optimize irrigation and fer-

    tilization practices, leading to increased efficiency and higher

    yields. AI can also be used in animal husbandry to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock. Also, AI algorithms can

    be used to detect signs of illness in animals, such as changes

    in their heart rate or behavior, and alert farmers to take action.

    Another application of AI in smart farming is in the detection

    and control of pests and diseases. AI algorithms can be used to

    analyze images of crops and detect signs of pests or diseases,

    allowing farmers to take proactive measures to address them. In

    conclusion, AI is a valuable tool in the development of smart

    farming, enabling farmers to make more informed decisions

    and automate various processes [20]. By using AI, farmers can

    improve efficiency, increase yields, and reduce waste, making

    a valuable contribution to the future of agriculture. However,

    it’s important to note that while AI has the potential to greatly

    benefit the agriculture industry; it also presents challenges,

    such as the need for large amounts of data and the potential

    for bias in algorithms. Thus, it’s important to approach the

    integration of AI in smart farming with caution and a focus

    on ethical and sustainable practices.

    METHODOLOGY

    In recent years, the academic community has extensively

    analyzed numerous works related to smart farming develop-

    ment from various perspectives. For instance, [21] introduced a

    systematic review focusing on precision farming. Then, authors

    in [22] provided a review on technologies in precision agricul-

    ture, highlighting innovations, technologies, and applications.

    Also, authors in [23] explored the use of big data on smart

    farming, emphasizing the primary opportunities and challenges

    associated with this technology. Additionally, [24] conducted a

    quantitative literature review, offering an overview of academic

    production in smart farming.

    In order to enhance the existing analyses, the present

    study seeks to conduct a comprehensive review of UAV based

    applications in the field of smart farming. To accomplish this

    objective, we employed the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) methodology [25], a frame-

    work specifically designed to facilitate literature reports and

    systematic reviews. In October 2022, authors conducted a

    search using the available search tool on the Scopus database

    website. Additionally, another search was performed in april

    2023 within the same database to include papers published

    in the year 2023. Scopus was selected due to its exten-

    sive coverage and relevance in similar bibliographic reviews

    mentioned in [24] and [26]. Our search strategy focused

    on terms related to technological applications in agriculture,

    such as “Precision Agriculture,” “Precision Farming,” “Smart

    Farming,” and “Smart Agriculture,” in conjunction with “UAV”

    and related terms. The publication date of articles was not a

    basis for exclusion. However, we restricted our research scope

    to journal and conference articles published in English. To

    ensure methodological rigor, this systematic review adhered to

    the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), with the

    most recent version being 2020. In Table I, you will find a

    compilation of the research questions (RQ) that the Systematic

    Literature Review (SLR) aims to address.

    In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) was

    conducted to assess recent research papers on the use of IoT,

    Big data, Cloud & AI techniques in the field of Smart farm-

    ing. However, advancements in technology and the increasing

    availability of digital resources have led to the development of

    new systematic review process, but the traditional systematic

    literature review methodology remains the standard approach

    for conducting systematic reviews, new tools and techniques

    are emerging that can enhance the process and provide addi-

    tional benefits to researchers and decision-makers. However,

    it is important to consider the limitations of these new ap-

    proaches and to ensure that the results of the systematic review

    remain reliable and trustworthy. The following are the steps

    involved in the systematic literature review methodology: In

    this context, lookup has produced a plethora of SLR standards

    that should be observed to reap tremendous empirical research.

    In this paper, we concentrate on the SLR guidelines proposed

    by authors in [19], which can be classified into the following

    categories. There are four steps:

    •

    Step 1: Identifying the research goal(s).

    •

    Step 2: Research subject framing (conceptual bound-

    aries).

    •

    Step 3: Using inclusion/exclusion criteria to collect

    data.

    •

    Step 4: Validation of the research findings is the fourth

    step.

    A. Research Objectives

    This study attempts to systematically analyze possible

    future possibilities for IoT, Cloud, Big Data and AI in Smart

    Farming by analyzing current knowledge and the state of the

    research, with a focus on recent research advancements. This

    paper is interested in learning how this study topic has changed

    throughout time. Furthermore, the outcomes of the evaluation

    will be utilized to identify critical activities for future study as

    well as practical applications.

    B. Framing of the Research Subject

    The goal of this study is to evaluate Big Data, Cloud,

    internet of things, artificial intelligence technologies for Smart

    Farming in a systematic way. As a result, the research subject,

    i.e. the conceptual boundaries, were defined in the agriculture

    environment using the terms “Unnamed Aerial Vehicle”, “Big

    Data”, “Cloud”, “internet of things”, “artificial intelligence”

    and related concepts “machine learning” and “deep learning.”

    The following Table II displays the Inclusion and exclusion

    criteria identified to refine the search request.

    C. Data Collection by Using Criteria

    A definition of search parameters, databases, search key-

    words, and publication time is also required by the SLR.

    The selection of search resources and the choice of search

    phrases are both part of the search strategy. To find the papers,

    automated search engine from the most relevant sources were

    chosen: Scopus. A further examination of similar databases

    (ACM Digital Library and Emerald) revealed significant vari-

    ations in the research studies that resulted. As a result, Scopus

    was used as the primary database for secondary data evaluation

    in this research study. The systematic research approach [24]

    and the inclusion and exclusion criterias, which are based on

    the process query depicted in Fig. 3.

    Screening the article title, abstract, and keywords for rele-

    vant literature for Blockchain, IoT and AI in the subject areas

    of management was the first step. We included a variety of

    document formats in this stage and limited them to the English

    language. This first method was mostly utilized to obtain a

    sense of where research was at the time. As a result, the study

    was not limited intialy to a specific period. In total, 536 studies

    were found as a result of this method. We concentrated on

    studies in the areas of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture

    in the second step. As a consequence, we narrowed down

    the previously identified 536 publications to 186 papers that

    contained the terms Smart Farming or Precision Agriculture.

    Furthermore, we created a ranking of all detected keywords,

    which was utilized to verify the meta-search query for the

    current database investigation. In our research strategy, no

    important terms were left out. To evaluate only high-quality

    studies, the study was limited to conference papers, conference

    reviews, articles, or reviews in the third step. In conclusion,

    the final meta-search query was as follows:

    Research Query : (“UAV” OR “Unnamed Aerial Vehicle”)

    AND (“Machine Learning” OR “Deep Learning”) AND (“IoT

    technology” OR “IoT” OR “Internet of Things” OR “internet-

    of-things”) AND (“Smart Farming” OR “Smart Agriculture”

    OR “Precision Farming” OR “Precision Agriculture”) AND

    (“Cloud Computing”).

    The chosen papers were evaluated using eight quality

    assessment questions listed in Table III [27]. Scores of 1 (high

    quality), 0.5 (moderate quality), or 0 (poor quality) were given

    to each paper. Papers that received a total score below four

    were removed from the study.

    IV.

    RESULTS

    This section present the results obtained and content

    analysis on the complete texts of the identified papers. The

    initial stage of the selection process involved screening the

    title, abstract, and introduction of each paper to ascertain

    its relevance. The subsequent step was to eliminate papers

    that did not meet the exclusion criteria outlined in Table II.

    As a result, 80 papers were identified as the basis for the

    further research process. It is important to note that quotation

    marks are used to ensure that multi-word terms are searched

    together, preventing individual words from being considered

    separately. After conducting the search, the resulting articles

    were manually reviewed by analyzing their titles, keywords,

    abstracts, and texts. Duplicate articles were eliminated, and

    the remaining articles were assessed to determine whether

    they were relevant to the study’s objectives. Valid articles

    were those that focused on IoT-based solutions for agricultural

    problems, were not literature reviews, were written in English,

    Portuguese, or Spanish, and pertained to agriculture rather than

    livestock activities. The study’s search and selection process is

    summarized in Fig. 4. The initial search yielded 536 articles,

    which were then analyzed and narrowed down to 186 articles

    that met the study’s eligibility criteria. During the screening

    phase, 350 articles were deemed invalid and discarded based on

    their lack of relevance to the study’s objectives. Of these, 65%

    did not focus on smart farming. Additionally, almost 35% of

    the discarded papers were literature reviews or studies related

    to smart farming that did not involve IoT. A small number

    of papers pertained to smart farming but did not address IoT

    (about 5% were related to sensors), and some papers had

    abstracts or texts that were not available (about 2%).

    In the eligibility phase, the content of the 80 remaining

    articles was reviewed using the same criteria as in the screening

    phase. Of these, 23 articles were discarded, with 27% not

    related to IoT and 32% not to smart farming. The remain-

    ing 41% were literature reviews or papers without available

    content. This research analysis conducted in 57 articles that

    were eligible for inclusion in the study’s sample.

    A. Description Analysis

    57 papers were ultimately assigned to the topic and rated as

    relevant for deep analysis, out of a total of 536 papers that had

    been previously identified regarding the application of Cloud,

    Big Data, IoT, AI, within UAV Application in Smart Farming.

    The distribution of the selected studies’ suitability, which was

    assessed by reading their titles and abstracts, the distribution

    of articles published per year is shown in Fig. 5, then the

    distribution of documents per year per source is provided

    in Fig. 6 and finally the Fig. 7 describe the distribution of

    documents by appropriateness.

    The decrease in research on the application of drones in

    precision agriculture may be multiple and dependent on vari-

    ous factors such as funding, research priorities, technological

    advancements, etc. However, some possible hypotheses can

    be suggested: Recent technological advancements may have

    solved a significant portion of the issues related to drone

    application in precision agriculture, thereby reducing the need

    for further research in this field. Funding for research in this

    field may have been reduced or directed towards other research

    areas. The scientific community may be transitioning to other

    agricultural monitoring technologies or methods, such as the

    use of remote sensors or satellites. It is also possible that the

    number of scientific publications on the subject has decreased,

    but research is still ongoing in other contexts as provided in

    the distribution of document by subject area provided in Fig.

    8, such as in the private industry. Ultimately, it is important to

    realize that the decrease in research in a given field does not

    necessarily imply that research should be abandoned or that

    previous results are no longer relevant. Existing research can

    still be used to improve existing applications and guide future

    research.

    Out of the 166 full texts in the field of smart farming

    that were found, 96 papers (58%) were rated as having high

    appropriateness, 53 papers (32%) as having medium appropri-

    ateness, and 17 papers (10%) as having low appropriateness in

    relation to the goal of this research project. Book chapters are

    of total of 21%, while research articles are 44%, and reviews

    are 23%.

    Based on the 166 complete articles that were found, Fig.

    8 displays the distribution of document types in the field of

    smart farming by subject area.

    B. Content Analysis

    The complete texts of the papers were reviewed and iden-

    tified in this section. Table IV summarizes the most important

    clusters, primary references, to group the chosen literature into

    related clusters, we engaged in a thorough content analysis.

    In addition Table V complete this set of research documents

    by UAV articles analyzed by characteristics and limitations

    identified in the survey.

    IoT (Internet of Things) technology is transforming the

    agricultural industry by enabling farmers to collect and an-

    alyze data from various sources to make informed decisions.

    However, like any technology, IoT also presents challenges and

    issues, particularly in the context of smart farming. Table VI

    provides a comparison of IoT issues and challenges in smart

    farming:

    RQ1. WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF UAVS

    IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE?

    The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud technol-

    ogy in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has brought about

    significant improvements in smart farming. Here are some of

    the impacts:

    •

    Soil Analysis: UAVs can be used to collect soil

    samples, analyze soil moisture levels, and assess soil

    quality, which can help farmers optimize fertilization

    and irrigation practices.

    •

    Planting: UAVs can be used to plant seeds precisely

    and efficiently, reducing labor costs and increasing

    planting accuracy. Crop spraying: UAVs equipped

    with spraying systems can be used to apply pesticides,

    herbicides, and fertilizers accurately, reducing the en-

    RQ2. WHICH CROPS ARE MONITORED BY UAV

    SYSTEMS?

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly

    being used for crop monitoring and management in agriculture.

    Various types of crops can be monitored using UAV systems,

    including different Cereals. These crops are often monitored

    for growth stages, yield prediction, and disease detection [63].

    Fruits and vegetables: Such as grapes, citrus, apples, tomatoes,

    and potatoes. UAV systems can monitor the growth and health

    of these crops, detect pests and diseases, and assess yield.

    Oilseeds: Such as soybeans, sunflowers, and canola. UAV

    systems can be used to monitor crop growth, assess the health

    of plants, and predict yields. Specialty crops: Such as coffee,

    tea, cocoa, and tobacco. UAV systems can help monitor the

    health of these crops, detect early signs of disease or pest

    volutional neural network

    using unmanned aerial ve-

    hicle (UAV) imagery

    This paper proposes a framework

    that integrates UAVs with IoT and

    cloud computing for smart agricul-

    ture. The authors demonstrate the

    feasibility of the proposed frame-

    work through a case study. They

    conclude that the proposed frame-

    work can improve crop yield and

    reduce costs for farmers.

    The authors primarily focus on the

    challenges associated with imple-

    menting UAV-based systems, rather

    than discussing potential solutions

    or strategies for overcoming these

    challenges. While this is an im-

    portant aspect to consider, a more

    detailed analysis of potential solu-

    tions or strategies could be useful

    for practitioners and researchers in

    the field.

    infestations, and optimize harvest. While the use of UAV

    systems for crop monitoring has several advantages, there

    are also some limitations to the types of crops that can

    be effectively monitored. Here are some of the limitations

    collected by analyzing the following articles [64], [65], [66].

    So, there are several limitations to using UAVs for crop

    monitoring. Firstly, UAVs can only cover a limited area in

    a single flight, which makes it difficult to monitor large farms

    efficiently. Secondly, UAVs are affected by weather conditions

    and may not be able to fly in adverse weather, which can

    impact data collection. Thirdly, UAVs require skilled operators

    and specialized equipment, which can be costly and time-

    consuming to maintain. Then, regulations around the use of

    UAVs can be complex and vary between countries, which can

    add another layer of complexity to their use in crop monitoring.

    These limitations must be carefully considered when deciding

    whether to use UAVs for crop monitoring and when planning

    a UAV-based monitoring program.

    In conclusion, while UAV systems can be an effective tool

    for crop monitoring, there are limitations to the types of crops

    that can be effectively monitored. Crop height, density, size,

    weather conditions, and sensor limitations are all factors that

    can affect the effectiveness of UAV monitoring. Generally,

    UAV systems can provide farmers with valuable insights and

    data to optimize crop management, increase productivity, and

    reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers.

    RQ3. HOW CAN UAV-BASED TECHNOLOGIES BE

    ADAPTED FOR USE IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF CROPS OR

    FARMING ENVIRONMENTS?

    Precision agriculture involves the use of various tech-

    nologies to optimize crop management and increase yields.

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are becoming in-

    creasingly popular in precision agriculture due to their ability

    to collect high-resolution data quickly and efficiently. Here are

    some UAV system technologies in Fig. 10 that are commonly

    adopted in precision agriculture:

    •

    Multispectral imaging: UAVs equipped with multi-

    spectral cameras can capture images of crops at dif-

    ferent wavelengths, providing valuable information on

    plant health, stress levels, and nutrient deficiencies.

    •

    Thermal imaging: Thermal cameras mounted on UAVs

    can detect differences in temperature across a field,

    helping to identify areas of stress or water deficiency

    in crops.

    •

    with Lidar technology can create high-resolution 3D

    maps of crops and terrain, which can be used for crop

    modeling and yield prediction.

    •

    Global Positioning System (GPS): UAVs equipped

    with GPS can precisely navigate and collect data on

    a field, helping farmers to monitor crop growth and

    identify problem areas.

    •

    Machine learning and artificial intelligence: UAV sys-

    tems can collect vast amounts of data that can be

    analyzed and processed using machine learning and

    artificial intelligence algorithms.

    •

    Variable rate application (VRA): UAV systems can be

    used for VRA, where the data collected can be used to

    tailor crop management practices to specific areas of a

    field, optimizing inputs like fertilizers and pesticides,

    reducing costs and environmental impact.

    Overall, these UAV system technologies can provide farm-

    ers with detailed information on crop health, growth, and yield

    potential, helping them to make more informed decisions on

    crop management and increase productivity.

    RQ4. WHAT TYPES OF DATA CAN BE OBTAINED

    THROUGH THE USE OF UAVS?

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are deployed in various appli-

    cations, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and

    infrastructure inspection. UAVs are equipped with sensors that

    can capture different types of data. Here are some examples

    of data that can be acquired by UAVs:

    •

    Visual imagery: UAVs can capture high-resolution

    visual imagery using cameras that range from standard

    RGB cameras to more specialized cameras like mul-

    tispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal cameras. These

    images can be used to monitor vegetation health,

    detect anomalies, and map land cover.

    •

    LiDAR: LiDAR sensors can be mounted on UAVs

    to generate high-resolution 3D maps of the terrain,

    vegetation, and structures. This data can be used

    for precise measurements of features such as height,

    volume, and biomass.

    •

    GPS data: UAVs can collect GPS data, which can

    be used to generate maps, track the drone’s position,

    and measure distances. Environmental data: UAVs

    can be equipped with sensors that measure environ-

    mental variables such as temperature, humidity, and

    air quality. This data can be used for environmental

    monitoring and disaster response.

    •

    Magnetic and acoustic data: UAVs can be equipped

    with magnetometers to measure the magnetic field

    of the Earth’s surface. This data can be used for

    geological surveys and mineral exploration. UAVs can

    also be equipped with microphones to capture acoustic

    data.

    Overall, UAVs can capture a wide range of data types,

    which can be used for various applications in fields such as

    agriculture, environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspec-

    tion, and disaster response.

    RQ5. WHICH METHODS OF DATA PROCESSING CAN BE

    EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE AGRICULTURAL DATA

    COLLECTED BY UAVS?

    The data acquired by UAVs in precision agriculture can

    be processed and analyzed using various techniques to extract

    useful information. Here are some examples of data processing

    methods that can be used to exploit agricultural data acquired

    by UAVs described in Fig. 11.

    •

    Image processing: UAVs capture high-resolution im-

    ages of crops, which can be processed using image

    processing techniques to extract information such as

    crop health, leaf area index, and crop growth stage.

    Fig. 11. Data processing methods used to exploit data collected by UAV.

    •

    Geographic Information System (GIS): UAV data can

    be integrated with GIS to create maps that provide

    valuable information about crop health, yield, and soil

    properties.

    •

    3D modeling: UAVs can capture data in the form of

    point clouds using LIDAR sensors, which can be used

    to create 3D models of the field. These models can

    be used to estimate crop height, biomass, and plant

    spacing.

    In summary, the data acquired by UAVs in precision agri-

    culture can be processed and analyzed using various techniques

    to extract valuable information about crop health, yield, and

    soil properties. These techniques include image processing,

    GIS, multispectral data analysis, machine learning, and 3D

    modeling.

    RQ6. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

    USING DRONES FOR DISEASE DETECTION IN

    AGRICULTURE?

    The challenges can be categorized into two primary

    groups: dataset-related challenges and model-building chal-

    lenges. Dataset-related challenges encompass deformations in

    the image dataset, insufficient availability of expert-labeled

    data, significant randomness in the data, and inadequate repre-

    sentation of classes in the dataset. Challenges associated with

    model building are the scarcity of training samples, extended

    training and processing times. Out of the papers analyzed, only

    two proposed potential solutions for these difficulties. The use

    of UAV in smart farming has become increasingly popular

    due to their ability to collect vast amounts of data quickly

    and accurately. However, the integration of Internet of Things

    (IoT) technologies into UAV applications also brings unique

    challenges and issues. The Table VI provides a comparison

    of the key challenges and issues related to IoT in UAV

    applications for smart farming.

    RQ7. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL

    IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF DRONES

    IN AGRICULTURE, AND HOW CAN THESE ISSUES BE

    ADDRESSED?

    The use of drones in agriculture presents various ethical

    and legal implications that need to be considered and ad-

    dressed. From an ethical standpoint, privacy concerns arise

    as drones can capture sensitive information about individuals

    or their properties. There is also the potential for drones to

    infringe on airspace regulations, endangering other aircraft

    or public safety. Furthermore, the automation and autonomy

    of drones raise questions about accountability and liability

    in case of accidents or damage caused by these devices. To

    address these issues, several measures can be implemented.

    Firstly, clear regulations and guidelines should be established

    regarding the operation of drones in agricultural settings. These

    regulations should address aspects such as flight restrictions,

    licensing requirements, and privacy protection. Adequate en-

    forcement mechanisms should be in place to ensure compli-

    ance.

    Secondly, public awareness campaigns and education ini-

    tiatives can inform both farmers and the general public about

    the responsible and legal use of drones in agriculture. This can

    help foster understanding and mitigate privacy concerns. Addi-

    tionally, technological solutions can be developed to enhance

    privacy protection, such as implementing geofencing mecha-

    nisms that restrict drone access to certain areas or utilizing

    data anonymization techniques. Collaboration between stake-

    holders, including farmers, drone operators, regulatory bodies,

    and legal experts, is crucial for developing comprehensive

    guidelines and frameworks that address the ethical and legal

    implications of drone use in agriculture. Regular review and

    updates of regulations can also ensure they remain relevant

    as technology evolves. Ultimately, a balanced approach is

    needed that considers the benefits of drone technology in

    agriculture while safeguarding privacy, public safety, and legal

    compliance.

    DISCUSSIONS

    The reason to conduct this systematic review on UAV-

    based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and cloud

    technologies is to provide a comprehensive overview of the

    current state-of-the-art in this field. This review aims to gather

    and analyze existing research studies, to identify gaps in the

    literature, and to provide insights into the potential of these

    technologies for smart farming.

    The systematic review will contribute to the research field

    in several ways. Firstly, it will provide a clear understanding

    of the current state-of-the-art in UAV-based applications in

    smart farming, including the various applications, benefits,

    and challenges associated with the use of these technologies.

    Secondly, it will identify gaps in the literature and areas where

    further research is needed. This will help researchers to focus

    their efforts on areas that are most promising and where further

    advancements are needed. Thirdly, it will provide insights into

    the potential of these technologies to transform the agriculture

    industry, promote sustainable farming practices, and address

    global food security challenges.

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies face several data challenges that must

    be addressed for successful implementation. These challenges

    include acquiring and efficiently storing the large amounts of

    data generated by UAVs, ensuring the quality and reliability

    of the data, processing and analyzing the data in real-time

    using AI and cloud technologies, seamlessly integrating the

    UAV-based applications with other systems, and ensuring

    data privacy and security. Overcoming these challenges will

    require the development of robust data management strategies,

    advanced algorithms for data analysis, secure and interoperable

    systems, and effective policies and regulations for data privacy

    and security. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for

    the successful implementation of UAV-based applications in

    smart farming and the realization of their potential benefits for

    the agricultural industry. Meteorological conditions can have a

    significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart farming

    that use AI, IoT, and cloud technologies. For example, wind

    speed and direction can affect the stability and maneuverability

    of the UAV, which can impact the quality of the data collected.

    Similarly, rain, fog, and low-light conditions can affect the

    quality of the images and sensor readings collected by the

    UAV, which can impact the accuracy of the data analysis.

    Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, thunder-

    storms, and blizzards can also pose safety risks for the UAV

    and the personnel operating it. High winds, lightning, and

    heavy precipitation can damage the UAV or cause it to crash,

    while snow and ice can affect its mobility and stability. To mit-

    igate the impact of meteorological conditions on UAV-based

    applications in smart farming, it is important to have reliable

    weather forecasting systems in place. This can help farmers

    and operators plan UAV flights around weather patterns, avoid-

    ing unsafe conditions and optimizing data collection.

    Additionally, it is important to use UAVs equipped with

    weather-resistant sensors and cameras that can operate in a

    range of environmental conditions. This can help ensure the

    accuracy and reliability of the data collected, even in adverse

    weather conditions. In summary, meteorological conditions can

    have a significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart

    farming, and it is important to have reliable weather forecasting

    systems and weather-resistant equipment to mitigate these

    effects.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today.

    By validating and comparing the PRISMA (Preferred Re-

    porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

    results with the presented objectives, scenarios, and analysis

    criteria in Table VII, this systematic review aims to enhance the

    existing survey methodology. It strives to provide an updated

    research review based on established guidelines, which can

    have several advantages. So, by employing a validated method-

    ology and adhering to established guidelines like PRISMA, this

    work aims to provide a reliable, transparent, and up-to-date

    resource that can contribute to the existing body of knowledge

    in UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. Despite the numerous benefits associated

    with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT, and cloud technologies in smart

    farming, there are still some limitations and challenges that

    need to be addressed in the future. One of the main limitations

    is the high cost of acquiring and maintaining these technolo-

    gies, which may limit their adoption by smallholder farmers.

    Another limitation is the lack of regulatory frameworks and

    policies to guide their use, particularly in developing countries.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today. Despite the

    numerous benefits associated with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies in smart farming, there are still some

    limitations and challenges that need to be addressed in the

    future.

    CONCLUSION

    In

    conclusion,

    this

    paper

    provides

    a

    comprehensive

    overview of the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicules

    (UAS), or drones, in agriculture and the integration of AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies for precision farming. The systematic

    review conducted following the PRISMA method highlights

    the potential of UAV-based applications in smart farming using

    these advanced technologies. The major takeaways from this

    work include the significant potential of UAVs in enhanc-

    ing agricultural productivity and sustainability. The findings

    demonstrate that UAVs offer valuable capabilities for data

    collection, precision monitoring, and decision-making in large-

    scale farming operations. The integration of AI, IoT, and cloud

    technologies further enhances these capabilities by enabling

    real-time data analysis, remote accessibility, and efficient re-

    source management. The justification for this research lies

    in the growing importance of technology-driven solutions

    in modern agriculture. By leveraging UAVs and advanced

    technologies, farmers can make informed decisions, optimize

    resource usage, and improve crop yields. The presented work

    serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers,

    and practitioners interested in understanding the potential and

    challenges of UAV-based applications in smart farming.

    Moving forward, future research should focus on devel-

    oping more advanced machine learning models to enhance

    accuracy in crop yield predictions and pest infestation iden-

    tification. Additionally, exploring the feasibility of drones for

    other agricultural tasks such as irrigation management and soil

    analysis can provide valuable insights. Conducting empirical

    studies will further validate the benefits and limitations of these

    technologies in agriculture.

    Providing food has become more complex because of climate change and other

    environmental and societal stressors, such as political instability, the growth
    in

    the world population, and outbreaks of new diseases, especially the COVID-19

    pandemic. In response to these challenges, the agri-food industry has increased

    its eforts to shift to using more digital tools and other advanced technologies.

    The transition toward digital has been part of the fourth industrial revolution

    (called Industry 4.0) innovations that have and are reshaping most industries.
    This

    literature review discusses the potential of implementing digital technologies
    in

    the agri-food industry, focusing heavily on the role of the COVID-19 pandemic
    in

    fostering the adoption of greater digitalization of food supply chains. Examples

    of the use of these digital innovations for various food applications, and the

    barriers and challenges will be highlighted. The trend toward digital solutions
    has

    gained momentum since the advent of Industry 4.0 and implementations of these

    solutions have been accelerated by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Important digital technology enablers that have high potential for mitigating
    the

    negative efects of both the current global health pandemic and the environmental

    crisis on food systems include artiﬁcial intelligence, big data, the Internet
    of Things,

    blockchain, smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and virtual and augmented

    reality. However, much remains to be done to fully harness the power of Industry

    4.0 technologies and achieve widespread implementation of digitalization in the

    agriculture and food industries.

    1. Introduction

    The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World

    Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 has led to

    unprecedented challenges to public health and the global economy,

    including food supply chains and food systems. Due to the severe

    restrictions (e.g., lockdowns and social distancing) and the resulting

    labor shortages throughout the food value chain, this global

    health crisis has disrupted the current food systems and consumer

    eating behaviors, highlighting the importance of adaptability and

    resilience for a healthier and more sustainable food supply. The

    safety, quality, and traceability of food have become major concerns

    for consumers and food producers worldwide (Barone et al., 2021;

    Bisoﬃ et al., 2021; Han et al., 2021; Hassoun et al., 2022a,f).

    New ways, alternative solutions, and technological innovations

    have been explored to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and mitigate

    the impact of this pandemic (Barrett et al., 2021; Galanakis et al.,

    2021). One of the solutions that has received enormous attention is

    digitalization, and research on digital transformation has, therefore,

    increased rapidly in the last few years. Indeed, data obtained

    from the Scopus database shows that there has been a growing

    literature on digitalization in agri-food systems over the last

    decade (Figure 1). The agriculture and food industry, as did other

    sectors, experienced increased digitalization before the COVID-19

    pandemic, but the need for digital transformations became clearer

    during and after this crisis. Digitalization and automation have

    become increasingly ubiquitous as a way to increase productivity

    and improve eﬃcient resource use, consistent with the need for a

    more sustainable food system (Ghobakhloo, 2020; Marvin et al.,

    2022; Abbate et al., 2023; Hassoun et al., 2023c).

    The concept of digitalization is strongly linked with Industry

    4.0 (or the fourth industrial revolution). Many digital, physical,

    and biological domains are being combined, such as artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, robotics,

    3D printing, and smart sensors to create smart digital factories

    and farms (Lezoche et al., 2020; Hassoun et al., 2022c,e, 2023b).

    There is no speciﬁc classiﬁcation or general agreement as to what

    are the Industry 4.0 technologies, but most reports within the

    agriculture and food industry include those mentioned above, plus

    blockchain, cloud computing, digital twins, and cyber-physical

    systems (Echegaray et al., 2022; Hassoun et al., 2022b,h). The

    Scopus data were analyzed using the graph network bibliometric

    visualization tool VOSviewer (VOSviewer.com, Leiden University,

    The Netherlands). According to the output, co-occurrence analysis

    identiﬁed >5,600 keywords, of which 111 occurred at least 10 times

    (Figure 2). Agriculture, digitalization, digital technologies, and

    digital transformation were the most frequent keywords identiﬁed

    (the size of the node indicates the frequency of the keyword),

    followed by Industry 4.0, and its elements, such as AI and IoT.

    Several recent publications have reviewed the use of digital

    technologies and other Industry 4.0 elements to ﬁght the COVID-

    19 pandemic in diﬀerent ﬁelds, such as healthcare services

    (Chandra et al., 2022), international business (Pereira et al.,

    2022), and learning and teaching (Jakoet-Salie and Ramalobe,

    2022). In the agri-food sector, the role of certain Industry 4.0

    technologies, namely blockchain, IoT, big data analytics, and AI, in

    the digitalization of the food system has been highlighted (Amentae

    and Gebresenbet, 2021). The role of digital transition and Industry

    4.0 technologies in enhancing food sustainability and achieving

    sustainable food systems has been also highlighted (Masi et al.,

    2021; Marvin et al., 2022; Abbate et al., 2023). Another recent

    publication has discussed the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies

    for a successful implementation of smart farming (Javaid et al.,

    2022). The signiﬁcant role of digital technologies in addressing food

    loss and waste issues in agriculture was also recently demonstrated

    (Benyam et al., 2021; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2021; Hassoun

    et al., 2023a). The implication of digitalization in the shift to

    plant-based diets (Hassoun et al., 2022d) and the dairy sector

    (Hassoun et al., 2023b) has also been explained. Di Vaio et al. (2020)

    demonstrated the signiﬁcant role of AI in supporting the businesses

    struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic, and achieving the

    sustainable development goals in the water, energy, and food

    sectors (D’amore et al., 2022).

    However, there is a gap in the literature since no comprehensive

    review has explored the role of all Industry 4.0 components in

    accelerating the shift to digital in the agri-food sector during

    the COVID-19 era. Indeed, little attention has been given to the

    COVID-19 pandemic and its critical role in driving the adoption

    of digital technologies in diﬀerent food-related sectors. Thus, based

    on the recent literature (within the past 5 years), this review will

    identify the important enablers of digital transformation and brieﬂy

    describe their implication in mitigating the negative consequences

    of the COVID-19 pandemic in agriculture and the food industry. In

    this literature review will try to bridge the aforementioned literature

    gap by answering the following two research questions: what are the

    main enablers of the digital transformation in the agri-food sector:

    how could digital technologies help mitigating the negative eﬀects

    of the COVID-19 pandemic.

    The methodology used in this literature review process can

    be summarized as follows: publications search, selection, and

    collection using leading data sources (especially Scopus and Google

    Scholar). The following keywords were included in the search

    string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (Digital transformation) OR (Digital shift)

    OR (Shift to digital) OR (Digitalization) AND (Agri-food) OR

    (Agriculture) OR (Food industry).

    2. Overview of the main enablers of

    the digital transformation

    Several emerging technologies can be considered enablers of

    the digital transformation in agri-food sectors (Figure 3). A short

    introduction to these technologies follows.

    2.1. AI and big data analytics

    AI and big data analytics are at the core of digital

    transformation. AI is a branch of computer science that simulates

    human thinking processes, learning ability, and knowledge storage

    to enable the performance of tasks that typically require human

    intelligence (Addanki et al., 2022; Fuentes et al., 2022). AI and data-

    driven innovations can address many challenges to the food supply

    chain related to public health and mitigation of risks, improvement

    of eﬃciency and accuracy, and implementation of sustainability

    initiatives. AI-based techniques, combining data from multiple

    sources, can have a role in providing predictive risk analysis as

    well as prescriptive decision-support (Lezoche et al., 2020; Marvin

    et al., 2022; Misra et al., 2022). The possibilities of such an approach

    improving food safety, food fraud detection, sustainability and

    quality have been recently illustrated (Bouzembrak et al., 2019;

    Marvin and Bouzembrak, 2020; Marvin et al., 2020; Sharma A.

    et al., 2021). A recent review paper has given a general overview

    of implications of AI in precision agriculture to analyze data from

    sensors, drones, and satellites and optimize many farming practices,

    such as irrigation, fertilization (Taneja et al., 2023).

    Big data and cloud technologies have been predicted to

    grow along with AI, especially after COVID-19. Handling the

    large amount of data generated along the food supply chain

    is still challenging and time-consuming and requires a large

    computational infrastructure. Although cloud computing has

    emerged as a solution in other sectors, its use with the food

    chain has just begun (Wang and Wang, 2021; Rejeb et al.,

    2022b). Cloud computing might accelerate the implementation

    of the “lab-to-sample” approach in which food safety data is

    generated on-site using, for example, portable devices and sensors,

    and transferring it to a central cloud-based infrastructure, where

    it is processed and analyzed on-line. The results would then

    be sent back to plant operators allowing real-time decisions to

    assure compliance with food safety legislation and standards. This

    approach would further reduce costs and enhance the eﬃciency

    of food safety controls since fewer samples will be needed

    for the laboratory analysis. If IoT can be applied, a potential

    food safety risk could be detected quickly allowing actions to

    mitigate the risks (Jin et al., 2020; Kamble et al., 2020; Marvin

    et al., 2022). The use of big data in agriculture and smart

    farming has led to signiﬁcant advantages suc has crop modeling

    for targeting genotypes to diﬀerent environments, forecasting

    crop harvest and improve agriculture monitoring, and increasing

    eﬃciency of agricultural operations (Jin et al., 2020; Rejeb et al.,

    2022a,b).

    2.2. IoT and smart sensing

    IoT provides numerous options for gathering data in real-

    time from any stage of the food supply chain using sophisticated

    sensors and other devices to monitor the environment and

    production conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, conductivity,

    pH, and color of products) starting at the farm. Other sensors can

    provide information on quality and machine operations both in

    the manufacturing plant, and during transportation and storage

    (Bouzembrak et al., 2019; Marvin et al., 2022). IoT sensors can

    be used to predict quality and shelf-life of agricultural products,

    detect food adulteration, and improve food safety. For example,

    IoT-based sensors are being developed to monitor temperature

    and oxygen content in frozen food and packaged products. The

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    04

    frontiersin.org

    Hassoun et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2023.1217813

    used sensing technologies are based on photoacoustic spectroscopy,

    quasi-imaging spectrometry and temperature, which are integrated

    in a multi sensor device for real-time monitoring of several

    quality parameters. Thus, IoT and smart sensors can provide full

    tracking of the product, along with its ingredients, properties,

    and production history (Misra et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022).

    In agriculture, smart sensors are being increasingly applied for

    many purposes such as assessment of weather conditions and

    soil quality, and crop monitoring, achieving higher crop yields

    and less cost (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más, 2020; Ullo and Sinha,

    2021).

    2.3. IoT and blockchain

    Blockchain creates digital, decentralized, and distributed

    ledgers that store records of transactions in a peer-to-peer

    network in “blocks.” Each link in the supply chain adds

    a block that once added cannot be changed with all links

    having access. The use of blockchain technology combined

    with IoT represents a promising strategy to guarantee real-

    time visibility, transparency, security, immutability, irrevocability,

    neutrality, and reliability of the information and actions of

    all the supply chain actors. It can track in real-time the

    food’s properties along the supply chain to ensure food safety

    and quality, especially when combined with IoT (Zhao et al.,

    2019; Jin et al., 2020; Bigliardi et al., 2022; Kayikci et al.,

    2022). The potential of blockchain in agriculture has been

    highlighted as a promising technology toward a transparent supply

    chain of food, providing signiﬁcant beneﬁts to all participants

    (including provider, producer, processing, distribution, retailer, and

    consumer) involved along the food supply chain (Kamilaris et al.,

    2019).

    2.4. Robotics and smart machinery

    Agricultural automation and robotics using automatic controls

    and AI can be used at all levels of the agricultural production

    and the following manufacturing processes (Marvin et al., 2022;

    Ramirez-Asis et al., 2022). Smart machines can independently

    complete several tasks, such as cultivation, sowing, transplanting,

    fertilization, spraying, feeding, irrigation, picking, and harvesting.

    These machines can also collect information on soil and water

    quality, and plant or animal growth, which provides technical

    support for the implementation of precision agriculture and better

    breeding choices (Xu et al., 2022). Robots can perform many

    tasks along the post-harvest supply chain, such as sorting, storing,

    picking and packing, and shipping (Chauhan et al., 2022). Current

    robotic development is focused on replacing manual operations in

    food handling and processing, food packaging, food delivery, and

    other operations along the food supply chain (Duong et al., 2020;

    Sulaiman et al., 2021). Advanced robotics are being increasingly

    involved in many agricultural practices such as sowing, planting,

    plant treatment, harvesting, yield estimation and phenotyping

    (Oliveira et al., 2021).

    2.5. Digital twins and virtual or augmented

    reality

    A digital twin is a digital representation of a real-world

    physical entity (i.e., a real process operation or physical system).

    Digital twins can be used to model activities that will lead to

    increased productivity, resource eﬃciency, energy eﬃciency, and

    cost reduction (Verboven et al., 2020; Kamble et al., 2022).

    Augmented reality technology is being used in several sectors,

    including the food sector (Rejeb et al., 2021; Chai et al., 2022). A

    recent study showed that virtual reality could help adults be more

    successful in weight management, e.g., enabling them to reduce

    food intake after strenuous physical activity (Chai et al., 2022).

    However, the use of digital twins and virtual or augmented reality

    in agriculture is still very limited.

    2.6. Other industry 4.0 technologies

    Many other Industry 4.0 smart technologies including remote

    sensing technologies, such as imagery from satellite sensors,

    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and drones, as well as other

    advanced technologies, such as 3D food printing have been

    developed or are under development in smart farming and smart

    food factories (Bedoya et al., 2022; Boursianis et al., 2022; Javaid

    et al., 2022).

    3. Examples of applications of digital

    technologies in agriculture and food

    sectors

    The need for high-quality food and improved sustainability

    has accelerated the integration of digital and smart technologies in

    food manufacturing (smart factories), agriculture and production

    systems (smart/precision agriculture and farming), and other

    applications along the food value chain. This section will present

    some examples of these applications.

    3.1. Precision agriculture and smart farming

    Digital technologies and other advanced innovations (e.g., AI

    and big data, IoT, smart sensors, satellite imagery, and drones)

    and smart machinery are being increasingly adapted for use in

    agriculture, leading to the emergence of new concepts, such as

    precision agriculture and smart farming (Idoje et al., 2021; Kumar

    et al., 2021; Musa and Basir, 2021; Javaid et al., 2022; Rejeb et al.,

    2022a).

    The use of AI with smart agriculture has been shown to be

    eﬃcient in predicting agricultural performance based on present

    and past conditions, achieving many beneﬁts, such as minimizing

    crop diseases and pest infestation and predicting the weather, soil

    properties, and crop yield, among others (Pathan et al., 2020;

    Sharma A. et al., 2021; Tomar and Kaur, 2021). Moreover, AI-based

    models are being investigated for the development of innovative

    food production systems such as vertical farming (Siregar et al.,

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    05

    frontiersin.org

    Hassoun et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2023.1217813

    2022). AI models are often used in combination with other

    cornerstones of smart farming, especially IoT (in addition to big

    data, smart sensors, and cloud computing). As most farming

    processes are becoming increasingly data-driven and data-enabled,

    data management can be a challenging task, which accentuates

    the need for innovative approaches. For example, Ouaﬁq et al.

    (2022) proposed an AI-based comprehensive architecture called

    Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture that includes big

    data technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based systems

    to ensure agricultural sustainability and environmental protection,

    and achieve high quality, productivity, and eﬃciency.

    IoT has been widely applied in smart farming, and can

    enable soil monitoring, irrigation, crop, and waste management,

    livestock surveillance, among others, boosting farming activities

    to new heights (Musa and Basir, 2021; Holzinger et al., 2022;

    Sinha and Dhanalakshmi, 2022). Recently, it was argued that IoT

    has signiﬁcant potentials to speed up the transition to precision

    agriculture, highlighting publication trends and important topics

    in agricultural IoT research, as well as agricultural resources that

    are impacted by IoT (Rejeb et al., 2022c). The main application

    areas of IoT in the agricultural sector include monitoring, control,

    logistics and prediction (Bouzembrak et al., 2019). A recent study

    investigated the possibility of using IoT coupled with UAV and AI

    for monitoring pests in the rice ﬁeld during the production (Bhoi

    et al., 2021). As this study focused only on rice ﬁeld monitoring,

    the authors envisaged further investigations to develop similar

    models that can be used in the following rice production stages.

    Srivastava et al. (2020) proposed a simple and cost-eﬀective IoT-

    based system involving sensors that could measure and monitor

    important soil parameters, such as moisture content. IoT and other

    advanced technologies help take preventive measures to reduce

    losses, increase the productivity of crops, and achieve higher yields

    and better-quality produce.

    Drones, robotics, UAV, satellites, and other smart machinery

    and remote sensing technologies are being increasingly applied

    in the transition to smart farming and digital agriculture. With

    recent developments in deep learning, machine learning, and

    IoT, the application of drones in precision agriculture has been

    growing steadily over the last years, as recently highlighted by

    Rejeb et al. (2022a). Robotics are being used to perform many

    tasks that are often tedious and sometimes strenuous in plant

    agriculture, such as land preparation, sowing, planting, plant

    treatment, harvesting, yield estimation, and weeding (Lezoche

    et al., 2020; Sharma A. et al., 2021; Misra et al., 2022). For example,

    a harvester robot using dual-arm manipulation combined with an

    image segmentation algorithm with a dynamic planning algorithm

    and an occlusion algorithm was developed for automatic aubergine

    harvesting (Sepúlveda et al., 2020). The system had a success rate of

    92% and an average cycle time of 26 s/harvested aubergine.

    Precision

    livestock

    farming

    systems

    involve

    monitoring

    animals and their environment using smart sensors, AI, and other

    digital technologies to maintain productivity and proﬁtability,

    improve animal health, and decrease the environmental footprint

    (Bao and Xie, 2022; Fuentes et al., 2022). For example, in smart

    swine farming, relevant information can be collected from

    diﬀerent sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, accelerometers or

    radio-frequency identiﬁcation transponders), images, and sounds,

    among others, to enable non-invasive monitoring of animals and

    ensure good health, welfare and optimum production (Racewicz

    et al., 2021). Nasirahmadi et al. (2019) developed a system to detect

    the standing and lying postures of pigs with commercial farm

    conditions using a two-dimensional imaging system combined

    with diﬀerent deep learning approaches. The system worked well

    with diﬀerent lighting conditions, ages of animals, and skin color,

    oﬀering promising opportunities to achieve real-time, continuous

    computer-based monitoring of livestock. In a recent study, a

    machine learning framework was developed to predict daily milk

    yield, composition (fat and protein content) and the frequency

    of individual cow milking needs, achieving a high accuracy of

    prediction (Ji et al., 2022).

    However, smart farming (producing crops and raising animals)

    still seems to have had limited practical applications in industry due

    to numerous challenges that need to be solved (Musa and Basir,

    2021; Fuentes et al., 2022). For example, farmers are often lacking

    proper infrastructure and skills needed to use digital technologies

    and other advanced innovations. Moreover, high costs, privacy,

    data security and ethical issues, and organizational barriers and

    regulations are still hindering the wider spread of smart farming

    and precision agriculture in rural and poorer areas, especially in

    developing countries (Demestichas et al., 2020; Musa and Basir,

    2021; Rejeb et al., 2022a,c).

    3.2. Digital technologies for smart factories

    The “smart food factory” is based on adopting high levels of

    automation and digitalization to increase productivity, production

    eﬃciency, and food quality and safety (Chen et al., 2017;

    Shi et al., 2020; Echegaray et al., 2022). Many manufacturing

    industries are moving to connecting processing lines and intelligent

    machines to communicate with each other in an automated

    production chain, with minimal human involvement (Kumar

    et al., 2021; Watson et al., 2021; Dzedzickis et al., 2022). Among

    the diﬀerent Industry 4.0 innovations, robots, AI, big data,

    cloud computing, blockchain, and smart sensors are considered

    the main contributors to the smart food factory (Figure 4).

    Growing research shows that the implementation of these advanced

    technologies in food manufacturing has the potential to contribute

    to environmental sustainability by reducing production costs and

    human errors, maximizing eﬃciency, and achieving autonomous

    predictive management.

    Food manufacturing is becoming more complex, including

    several steps where robotics can help. For example, in the

    meat industry a human-robot collaboration can be achieved

    to address many challenges (e.g., heterogeneity of meat pieces

    and inconsistency of cutting trajectories) to help modernize the

    production line (Romanov et al., 2022). The rapid development of

    AI technologies oﬀers unprecedented opportunities to accelerate

    advances in robotics technology with both hardware and software

    control systems (Dzedzickis et al., 2022). The most common robotic

    systems in the food industry do “pick and place,” i.e., they handle

    a speciﬁc type of object presented in a consistent, pre-deﬁned

    orientation. Any variation in the object’s shape and size can lead to

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    failure to complete the pick and place task, making precise handling

    of irregular, naturally varying objects, such as vegetables and fruit,

    a greater challenge (Bader and Rahimifard, 2020; Chauhan et al.,

    2022). Soft robotics technology, soft grippers, and machine learning

    techniques have shown the potential to practically address the

    handling of irregular and naturally varying objects with low cost

    (Navas et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). For example, the application

    of automation using intelligent machines and robots to perform

    many tasks in red meat slaughter processes, such as carcass cutting

    and deboning in abattoirs was recently highlighted (de Medeiros

    Esper et al., 2021; Ross et al., 2022). A recent study focused on the

    digitalization of the supply chain of the food and beverage industry

    in Indonesia (Saryatmo and Sukhotu, 2021). The authors found

    that the adoption of digital technologies, such as robotics, big data,

    cloud computing, blockchain, and IoT can positively inﬂuence the

    quality, productivity, and cost reduction performance, and create

    considerable value-added and monetary gain.

    AI solutions oﬀer the potential to revolutionize diﬀerent areas

    of the food sector, such as developing indicators that reduce or

    eliminate food safety risks before they appear (Kudashkina et al.,

    2022; Ramirez-Asis et al., 2022). A broader application of AI in the

    food industry can increase digitalization and real-time surveillance,

    leading to greater resilience and supporting the transition toward

    more sustainable food production systems (Kumar et al., 2021;

    Marvin et al., 2022). However, using AI within the food supply

    chain raises ethical questions related to privacy, accessibility,

    accountability, and responsibility that should be addressed by

    developing suitable protocols (Manning et al., 2022).

    Another important feature of a smart food factory is the

    prevalence of smart sensors for real-time monitoring. For example,

    using smart sensors and IoT has the possibility to detect faults

    and quickly adjust processing conditions, such as the internal

    temperature and humidity of a processing line (Misra et al.,

    2022). The application of miniaturized smart sensors based on

    spectroscopy principles for monitoring food quality is another

    important research area (McVey et al., 2021).

    3D food printing is another promising digitalized innovative

    technology that has been gaining growing interest in recent years

    and can be considered as one of the smart food factory technologies.

    Recent advances in AI and other digital technologies make it

    possible to use 3D printing to create food of complex shapes or to

    develop protein food from novel protein sources, such as, insects,

    fungi, and algae (Dankar et al., 2018; Addanki et al., 2022; Bedoya

    et al., 2022).

    3.3. Blockchain technology in the agri-food

    supply chain

    The agri-food supply chain is an interlinked chain with

    multiple actors. Diﬀerent participants are involved in diﬀerent

    tasks, such as farming, processing, shipping, distributing, and

    retailing. Blockchain technology could solve diﬀerent problems

    related to food security, safety and integrity, and support

    increased competitiveness of small farmers if equal access to these

    technologies can be developed (Hassoun et al., 2022a; Kayikci et al.,

    2022; Zhang et al., 2022).

    Tracing food products along the entire supply chain is

    important for achieving better management of food products.

    Various frameworks and traceability systems based on blockchain

    technology have been proposed in recent years for many

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    07

    frontiersin.org

    Hassoun et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2023.1217813

    applications in the agri-food sector. For example, Wang L. et al.

    (2022) proposed a traceability system framework integrating a

    decentralized blockchain-enabled data storage platform (used for

    data management) and a radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID)

    technology (used for data collection and limited data storage).

    A creative blockchain-based RFID tag that can be attached to a

    food package was designed to have a high-security level and low

    cost. Another interesting application of blockchain technology and

    IoT was suggested by Khan M. A. et al. (2022), who developed

    a “Shrimp Chain”: a blockchain-based transparent and traceable

    framework to help with the export of Bangladeshi shrimp. They

    proposed a scoring-based certiﬁcation method for supply chain

    stakeholders involved with shrimp to detect fraud in packaged

    shrimps along the entire shrimp supply chain, and to encourage

    traceability and food safety. A platform based on blockchain was

    designed for the traceability of the supply chain of Fontina cheese

    produced in the Aosta Valley region in Italy, but can be used for

    any other dairy product (Varavallo et al., 2022). This blockchain

    design was characterized as “green” due to low energy consumption

    and minimum environmental impact. Other blockchain-based

    traceability systems were suggested for fruits and vegetables (Yang

    et al., 2021).

    The combination of blockchain with other digital technologies

    (such as IoT and big data) can enhance transparency in food

    safety and quality. For example, the combination of blockchain

    with IoT was reported to improve business processes and customer

    satisfaction (Grecuccio et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2022) reported

    that blockchain combined with IoT can collect and provide

    consumers with reliable data about when and where the fruit was

    picked. However, current applications of blockchain technology in

    the agri-food sector are still facing many challenges that need to be

    addressed. These include among others privacy concerns, high cost,

    lack of standards and regulations, as well as lack of skills (Zhao et al.,

    2019; Kayikci et al., 2022).

    3.4. IoT for food waste management

    IoT represents a promising approach and a viable solution to

    reduce waste since it provides transparency and the real-time status

    of resources consumed or wasted at various stages in the food

    supply chain through smart systems (Amentae and Gebresenbet,

    2021; Bigliardi et al., 2022). An interesting application of IoT for

    food waste management was developed for the potato industry by

    Jagtap et al. (2019). The authors proposed an automated and real-

    time system to measure the overall amount of waste as well as the

    reasons for waste generation in real-time by using image processing

    and load cell technologies. The camera images were processed using

    a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the damaged

    and unusable potatoes into seven categories: diseased, blackened,

    cracked, sprouted, green, uncleaned, and cut-marked. The results

    could be used to implement corrective actions. In a recent study,

    the use of IoT in rearing black soldier ﬂy was investigated to

    mitigate food waste (Cheng et al., 2022). The results showed

    that the implementation of sensors/devices, software, and mobile

    application could help to monitor this farming remotely. Another

    study showed the potential of using IoT in decentralized biogas

    plants, enabling a remote monitoring of food waste treatment

    (Logan et al., 2019).

    4. Role of the COVID-19 pandemic in

    accelerating the food digital

    transformation

    4.1. The COVID-19 pandemic and the

    agri-food industry

    The COVID-19 pandemic has created signiﬁcant challenges for

    humanity and caused many disruptions in diﬀerent supply chains,

    including the agri-food industry, showing their weaknesses and

    vulnerability. This pandemic and its socio-economic consequences

    have had direct implications for food sectors, primarily aﬀecting

    food safety, food security, and food sustainability (Knorr and

    Augustin, 2021; Rahaman et al., 2021).

    The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed

    many governments to impose lockdowns and severe restrictions of

    human movements that have led to labor shortages, including the

    food supply chain, disrupting the relatively seamless ﬂow of raw

    materials in agriculture, food, and beverage industries. The impact

    of the crisis was visible at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak

    (in early 2020) with images of empty supermarket shelves appearing

    in mainstream media due to panic buying and stockpiling of

    essential goods, especially toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and masks.

    However, COVID-19 pandemic has been an innovation booster

    and digital stimulator in many ﬁelds, including the agri-food

    systems (Bakalis et al., 2020; Barrett et al., 2021).

    New trends have emerged, including a renewed focus on locally

    produced foods, a shift in demand from food service to food

    retail, and an emphasis on reduced food waste. These trends have

    highlighted the need to implement radical changes and transform

    the existing food systems to make them more sustainable (Bisoﬃ

    et al., 2021; Knorr and Augustin, 2021).

    4.2. Application of digital technologies to

    mitigate the COVID-19 impact on various

    food sectors

    The

    pandemic

    has

    accentuated

    the

    pressing

    need

    for

    technological innovations and highlighted the importance of

    implementing new solutions to reduce human-to-human and

    human-to-food contact (Chitrakar et al., 2021). Many digital

    innovations (Figure 5) have been developed to mitigate the

    negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate the

    move toward more sustainable food systems.

    4.2.1. Sustainable food systems and food supply

    chains

    The realization of sustainable food systems from farm to fork

    requires a full consideration of the economic, environmental, and

    social dimensions of all aspects related to the production and

    consumption of suﬃcient and healthy food (Barrett et al., 2021;

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    Hassoun et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2023.1217813

    FIGURE 5

    The role of the COVID-19 pandemic in accelerating the digitalization in many food-related
    areas.

    Bisoﬃ et al., 2021; Marvin et al., 2022). Marvin et al. (2022)

    highlighted the need for a system approach based on digitalization

    and AI, and the importance of data availability for actors from

    farmers to consumers to achieve sustainable food systems. The

    authors made valuable policy recommendations for a successful

    future implementation of AI to support the transition toward more

    sustainable food systems.

    Big data, the cloud, and information and communication

    technologies are predicted to accelerate together with AI especially

    after the COVID-19 pandemic (Amentae and Gebresenbet, 2021;

    Wang and Wang, 2021). As mentioned earlier, handling the

    large amount of data generated along the food supply chain

    is still challenging and time-consuming, and requires a large

    computational infrastructure. Although cloud computing has

    emerged as a solution in other sectors, its use in the food chain

    remains limited (Jin et al., 2020; Rejeb et al., 2022b). Cloud

    computing might accelerate the implementation of the “lab-to-

    sample” approach in which food safety data is generated on-site

    (e.g., portable devices and sensors) and transferred to a central

    cloud-based infrastructure, where it is processed and analyzed

    online. The results are returned to the appropriate users allowing

    immediate relevant decisions that might not otherwise be possible

    (Jin et al., 2020; Kamble et al., 2020; Marvin et al., 2022).

    Blockchain technology can also help food supply chains

    in controlling demand and supply shocks and providing real-

    time monitoring and information sharing. It can be a catalyst

    to improve ﬂexibility, traceability, and develop shorter supply

    chains, which may assist in mitigating risk and disruption in

    the event of another pandemic or other disruptors (Sharma

    M. et al., 2021). For example, integrating satellite imagery

    and blockchain technology might address ﬁsh supply chain

    challenges

    to

    generate

    new

    opportunities

    for

    low

    income

    ﬁsher-folks, especially in developing nations (Sengupta et al.,

    2021).

    The implementation of digital technologies in the agri-food

    supply chain requires ﬁrst and foremost the availability of

    adequate, cheap, and sustainable energy sources. The current

    energy crisis in many parts of the world underlines the need,

    at this time more than ever before, for innovative solutions

    to

    mitigate

    the

    negative

    consequences

    of

    the

    COVID-19

    pandemic

    and

    achieve

    sustainable

    economic

    development

    and

    growth,

    especially

    in

    developing

    countries

    (Oruma

    et

    al.,

    2021).

    Promoting

    digital

    solutions

    and

    innovative

    thinking in agriculture and the food industry is undoubtedly

    crucial

    to

    transform

    agri-food

    systems

    (Hassoun

    et

    al.,

    2022g).

    10.3389/fsufs.2023.1217813

    4.2.2. Inspections for food quality, safety, and

    traceability

    Ensuring food quality, safety, and traceability during the

    COVID-19 pandemic has been a topmost priority. Many innovative

    strategies, such as smart monitoring technologies and smart

    detection systems have been developed and suggested as possible

    solutions to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic

    and to enhance food quality and safety (Chitrakar et al., 2021;

    Alabi and Ngwenyama, 2022). The role of packaging has been a

    focus, particularly with the recent development of nanocarriers

    that can be used as part of active packaging to increase shelf life

    and maintain food quality during food transportation (Pascuta and

    Vodnar, 2022).

    Recent publications have highlighted the role of Industry 4.0

    technologies to enhance food quality (Hassoun et al., 2023c) and

    food traceability (Hassoun et al., 2022a). For example, the use of

    IoT, big data, blockchain, and digital twins has been proposed to

    improve meat quality and ensure meat safety (Ren et al., 2022).

    A new framework based on IoT combined with blockchain was

    suggested to ensure food safety and reliable traceability of food cold

    chain systems (Qian et al., 2022). The proposed system can improve

    cold chain management, reducing the risk of contaminated

    products by making a rapid response to incidents possible. Digital

    technologies can provide full transparency across the supply chain

    and help consumers to trace the origin of products they purchased.

    For example, a blockchain-based traceability system was developed

    to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 transmission through the

    frozen meat supply chain by applying a tamper-proof tracing

    strategy (Iftekhar and Cui, 2021).

    4.2.3. Food waste management

    Food waste reduction has become one of the trendiest topics

    during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the increased focus on

    the environment and sustainability. Reducing food waste can

    enhance the three sustainability pillars—environmental, economic,

    and social (Barbar et al., 2022; Hassoun et al., 2022g). However,

    food waste increased early in the crisis due to panic-buying and

    food stockpiling by consumers, on the one hand, and the lockdown,

    restrictions on human movement, and closure of food production

    facilities, on the other hand. This led to more food wastes at the

    production and distribution levels along with those at the consumer

    level (Bhakta et al., 2020; Benyam et al., 2021; Boyacι-Gündüz et al.,

    2021). Therefore, a growing demand for the use of Industry 4.0

    technologies (such as AI, IoT, blockchain, and smart sensors that

    allow real-time monitoring and tracking of food and food waste)

    has been seen during the COVID-19 crisis, to reduce food loss

    and waste (Galanakis et al., 2021). Among the various Industry

    4.0 enablers, the IoT has attracted particular attention due to its

    ability to ensure higher levels of traceability and safety in supply

    chains and to reduce waste (Bigliardi et al., 2022). Moreover, the

    COVID-19 pandemic has also shown the importance of blockchain

    to ensure food safety and freshness as an additional way to reduce

    food waste (Khan H. H. et al., 2022).

    The development of biodegradable packaging made from food

    wastes and by-products intensiﬁed during the pandemic (Barone

    et al., 2021). New extraction methods are being applied to valorize

    various food waste and by-products to obtain a range of bioactive

    compounds (Thirumdas et al., 2021; Madureira et al., 2022). The

    application of Industry 4.0 technologies in the food packaging

    (called Packaging 4.0) can provide diverse advantages, such as real-

    time monitoring food quality and safety, extension of the shelf life,

    in addition to the reduction of food waste (Sadeghi et al., 2022).

    Another eﬃcient strategy that can be used to achieve a sustainable

    management of food waste is the development of 3D printed

    foods using food waste materials (Lee, 2021). This innovative

    technology has a huge potential in designing personalized healthy

    diets, reducing the dangerous eﬀects of COVID-19 on people

    health, as well as mitigating the issue of food waste (Derossi et al.,

    2021).

    4.2.4. Food service and food delivery

    Food service includes commercial (e.g., restaurants, coﬀee

    shops, and hotels) and institutional (e.g., hospitals, schools, and

    institutions) sectors. As these sectors normally involve socializing,

    the social distancing regulations imposed by COVID-19 have

    negatively impacted the food service industry (de Souza et al.,

    2022). Although WHO and FAO reported that transmission of the

    COVID-19 through food is highly unlikely, many consumers still

    fear the possible transmission of the virus via food and packaging

    (Han et al., 2021). To cope with these concerns, the adoption of

    digital technologies, such as contactless digital payment, service

    robots, online ordering and delivery applications has increased

    considerably in recent years (de Souza et al., 2022).

    Many restaurants, which are no longer a part of a consumer

    accessible facility, have started to use cloud kitchens (often referred

    to as ghost, virtual, dark, or cyber kitchens). These emerging

    business models for restaurants lead to less labor and lower capital

    expenditures compared to conventional restaurants (John, 2021).

    Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted innovation in the

    development of new solutions for home delivery and take-out (de

    Souza et al., 2022).

    The use of drones and robots (such as cooking, serving, and

    delivery robots) increased during the pandemic as ways to limit the

    spread of the virus (Choe et al., 2021). For example, an increasing

    number of coﬀee shops are using a robot serving barista. A study

    of 300 people using the robot barista in a coﬀee shop in South

    Korea showed that the service provided induced positive emotions

    and behavioral intentions (Yoo et al., 2022). However, the high

    price of delivery drones and robots in addition to the time needed

    for consumers to become familiar with their operating procedures,

    along with privacy and security issues need to be solved (Choe et al.,

    2021).

    Because of the pandemic and the government imposed social

    distancing, many restaurants have had to change their business

    models by implementing innovative approaches to online food

    delivery (OFD) services. The rapid growth of OFD has been backed

    by the development of a range of user-friendly food delivery

    applications (such as Deliveroo, Uber Eat, and Just Eat) and an

    increase in smartphone users (Partridge et al., 2020; Zanetta et al.,

    2021).

    Although these new business models have experienced

    booming progress, some obstacles remain. Among the challenges

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    10

    frontiersin.org

    Hassoun et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2023.1217813

    are developing products that travel well and packaging that

    preserves food quality so as to increase the experiential value

    perceived by consumers that, in turn, increases consumers’

    willingness to order food online (Gavilan et al., 2021). However,

    the greater use of OFD could also lead to poorer food choices

    (Jia et al., 2022). For example, independent takeaway outlets using

    Sydney’s market-leading OFD platform (i.e., Uber Eats) showed

    that cereal-based meals such as pizzas, burgers, pies, pasta, wraps,

    and sandwiches were the largest category selected (Wang et al.,

    2021).

    5. Barriers facing the adoption of

    digital and other new technologies

    The

    food

    and

    agricultural

    sectors

    are

    complex

    and

    multidimensional, and they require digital and other advanced

    technologies (including AI, big data, IoT, smart sensors, robotics,

    blockchain, digital twins, and augmented reality) to meet the

    current unprecedented challenges. However, there are many

    obstacles and pitfalls that still limit the possibilities of a wider

    adoption of digitalization in agri-food systems. The main barriers

    include the lack of adequate infrastructure, limited institutional

    capacities, high costs and the investment involved, farm size,

    industrial set-up, lack of essential training for the personnel

    using the systems, and ﬁnally integrating these systems into

    the routines of all the decision-makers. In addition, there are

    the

    regional

    socio-economic-environmental-political

    hurdles

    inﬂuencing

    the

    practical

    applications

    of

    new

    technologies

    (Amentae and Gebresenbet, 2021; Chapman et al., 2021; Herrero

    et al., 2021). These challenges to digitalization existed since the

    emergence of Industry 4.0 but became more obvious during the

    COVID-19 pandemic.

    Two types of obstacles that are reducing the uptake of digital

    technologies can be highlighted: (i) general challenges, that are

    valid for almost all technologies, and (ii) speciﬁc challenges that are

    related to each Industry 4.0 element.

    The investment required to successfully adopt the new

    technology is among the main challenges for farmers and

    food companies that always need to consider proﬁtability, and

    implementing digitalization depends on an increased proﬁt after

    investments, i.e., a reasonable return of investment. Paudel et al.

    (2020) investigated the reasons behind the adoption of advanced

    technologies (precision technologies), based on evidence from U.S.

    cotton producers, and found that the proﬁtability was the main

    motivation, followed by the environmental beneﬁt and/or the

    desire to be at the forefront of the technology. Another general

    challenge is the conservative nature of the food industry, such as

    the silo mentality of a range of actors and organizations involved

    in the food supply chain that could slow the acceptance of new

    technology, collaboration, or data sharing (Serazetdinova et al.,

    2019; Hassoun et al., 2020). Moreover, lack of knowledge and digital

    skills, lack of familiarity with digitalization, and the absence of

    appropriate education and training programs can lead to a mistrust

    of the technology and hinder the understanding of the beneﬁts of

    the use of new technologies and their incorporation into the supply

    chain (Amentae and Gebresenbet, 2021; Chapman et al., 2021).

    Besides

    these

    common

    challenges,

    speciﬁc

    limitations

    associated with each enabler of the digital transformation have

    been identiﬁed. For example, ethical considerations should be

    taken into account when developing and deploying AI in the food

    and agricultural sectors (Manning et al., 2022). Big data provides

    large opportunities to make real-time decision, inﬂuencing the

    entire food supply chain, but issues related to data ownership,

    privacy, and security need to be addressed (Jin et al., 2020; Rejeb

    et al., 2022b). Blockchain has become a signiﬁcant contributor

    to smart farming/precision agriculture and smart food factories,

    enabling full traceability, transparency, integrity, and secure

    transactions (Kayikci et al., 2022; Khan H. H. et al., 2022).

    However, its implementation is facing multiple barriers. Zhao et al.

    (2019) identiﬁed six challenges related to blockchain technology,

    including privacy leakage, storage capacity and scalability, lack of

    skills, high costs, regulatory problems, and throughput and latency

    issues (i.e., limited transaction capacity and the long time required

    for generating blocks and validating transactions). Research shows

    promising applications of IoT in several food-related ﬁelds, such as

    food safety and traceability, although issues related to inadequate

    security features and diﬀerent standards for IoT communication

    protocols need to be addressed (Bouzembrak et al., 2019).

    Replacing humans with smart robots and drones may

    be eﬃcient, particularly in the current pandemic era, but

    implementing costs and the overall maintenance can be expensive,

    especially for small-scale farming and production facilities (Kumar

    et al., 2021; Rejeb et al., 2022a). Although smart sensors have

    the ability to make processes more intelligent and eﬃcient, lack

    of cost-eﬀective sensing technologies capable of monitoring key

    parameters and converting sensor data into actionable information

    remain challenging (Watson et al., 2021). Limited applications

    of digital twins for food process operations have been reported,

    since many obstacles (e.g., the need for speciﬁc programming and

    diﬀerent modeling methods) still need to be overcome (Verboven

    et al., 2020). Likewise, only a few examples have been found in

    the literature about the application of augmented reality in the

    agriculture and food sector. This seems to be due to technical

    challenges associated with the strong dependence on the coverage

    and speed of connection, eﬀect of background on food recognition

    rate, diﬃculties to identify objects in the complex and dynamic

    world, such as real-time processing, among others (Chai et al.,

    2022).

    While these barriers are valid, they are not insurmountable.

    Respect for data privacy, safeguarding of intellectual property

    rights, mutual trust among all stakeholders involved, overcoming

    cybersecurity breaches, as well as eﬀective decision-making

    processes and government policies can all facilitate the adoption

    of digital technologies in the agri-food sector. Cross-learning,

    multi-stakeholder, and multi-disciplinary approaches are necessary

    to achieve greater sustainability and resilience in food systems.

    Recently, the role of collaborative practices between the diﬀerent

    actors on the digital food supply chain has been highlighted as a

    way to solve problems, such as food waste (Annosi et al., 2021).

    Investments in innovations, especially bundling innovations, is

    another important success factor that should be prioritized to

    transform agri-food systems (Serazetdinova et al., 2019; Barrett

    et al., 2020; Galanakis et al., 2021).

    6. Conclusions and future direction

    The global challenges for economic, social, and environmental

    aspects of sustainable development have become more acute

    over the last years, especially during and in the wake of

    the COVID-19 pandemic. The shift to digital technologies

    has accelerated in many ﬁelds, including the agri-food sector,

    to adapt to the negative consequences of this pandemic on

    various aspects of food production and consumption. Herein, a

    comprehensive overview of the up-to-date research progress with

    Industry 4.0 technologies and their signiﬁcant implications to

    achieving a digital transformation has been provided. Moreover,

    the

    role

    of

    the

    COVID-19

    pandemic

    in

    accelerating

    the

    digital transformation in agriculture and the food industry has

    been highlighted.

    Industry 4.0 innovations, especially IoT, AI, big data, smart

    sensors, blockchain, robotics, digital twins, and virtual and

    augmented reality have improved many sectors of agriculture

    and food. Even in pre-COVID-19 times, the process of adopting

    these technologies in agriculture and the food industry had

    begun including concepts, such as precision agriculture/ smart

    farming, and smart food factories. These technologies have

    the potential to enhance food quality, safety, and traceability,

    increase proﬁtability, and reduce food waste and production

    costs. The severe disruptions caused by the pandemic due

    to lockdowns and travel restrictions, supply/demand shocks

    resulted from stockpiling and panic buying, and the stress

    on food transportation and distribution have accelerated the

    adoption

    of

    digital

    technologies.

    Growing

    research

    shows

    that the integration and application of digital technologies

    can promote precision agriculture and smart factories and

    contribute to building more resilient and sustainable food

    supply chains.

    Precision agriculture/smart farming and smart food factories

    are the embodiment of Industry 4.0 in agriculture and the

    food industry, respectively. Smart farms and smart food factories

    are characterized by the prevalence of data analytics solutions,

    sensing technologies, and automated intelligent machines for

    a complete digitized food production environment. The new

    possibilities of data collection, processing and evaluation, and data

    storage, as well as connectivity and information exchange provide

    new insights and enable much higher precision in applications

    in automatic and robotic systems. Robots and drones could

    provide solutions to, among others, the labor shortage caused

    by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as war and conﬂicts in

    many parts of world. Nowadays, robotics is increasingly used

    to perform many agricultural tasks, automate operations in food

    processing plants, and replace humans in food service and food

    delivery. In addition, recent advances in IoT and smart sensors

    make it possible to ensure food quality and safety, reduce

    food waste, and track food from farm to fork. Moreover, the

    food supply chain security can be increased, and traceability

    and transparency can be enhanced using blockchain and other

    emerging technologies.

    The pandemic is not over, and climate change and war will

    likely have greater disruptions to the global food supply and

    exacerbate food insecurity. Therefore, eﬀective harnessing of digital

    technologies is expected to help overcome these extraordinary

    challenges. The results of our literature search show that the digital

    transformation holds signiﬁcant potential and opens promising

    opportunities for accelerating the move toward enhanced food

    sustainability in the agri-food sector. However, compared to other

    industries, the adoption of digital and other advanced technologies

    in agriculture and food sectors is still slow. A huge gap can

    be noticed between Industry 4.0 achievements and practical

    applications in current agriculture and food industries. This is due

    to many obstacles (e.g., lack of investments and digital skills, fear

    of new technologies, and multiple technical and governance issues)

    that need to be overcome with future research.

    The following four concrete recommendations are proposed

    to achieve an inclusive digital transformation and enhance food

    security and food sustainability:

    1. Transformation of mindsets and development of digital skills are

    one of the important elements to foster a deeper integration of

    digital technologies into agriculture and the food industry. For

    this end, training programs and sharing knowledge and learning

    should be prioritized.

    2. Establishment of adequate digital infrastructure and services,

    especially in developing countries is crucial to accelerate the

    digital transformation. This will require more government

    investment and support, as well as active involvement of political

    decision-making actors.

    3. Interdisciplinarity in large and long-term research eﬀorts as well

    as private-public partnership are required to release synergies

    within emerging ﬁelds. This interdisciplinary and participatory

    approach is in line with the core principle of industry 4.0,

    namely the fusion of various scientiﬁc ﬁelds and expertise.

    Therefore, more adoption of digital technologies in agriculture

    and the food industry will depend ﬁrst and foremost on the

    wide cross-border collaboration between all actors in the agri-

    food system, including researchers with various expertise and

    backgrounds, food producers and consumers, in addition to

    regulatory agencies and policymakers.

    4. Digital technologies have transformed food production and

    manufacturing industries into data producers. Eﬀective data

    governance and cybersecurity strategies should be provided for

    the captured data to be easily shared and interpreted.

    The transition to digital space is expected to continue at a fast

    pace in the coming few years, especially with the emergence of

    new technologies and the implementation of innovative strategies

    Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth of any country.
    With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited
    resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the
    present population. Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged
    as an innovative tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability.
    The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML).
    It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML
    together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components
    of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic
    review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused
    are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content,
    crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection.
    ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set
    of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This
    approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility
    patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using
    data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip
    irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces
    human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates how knowledge-based
    agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality of the product.

    I. Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately
    thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase
    by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture
    will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated
    country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production.
    The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable
    weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock
    mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change
    in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth
    has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent
    droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According
    to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions,
    reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of
    the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture
    also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable
    farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies,
    software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture
    [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are
    the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision
    farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1.
    Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990
    for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system
    (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the
    production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision
    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment

    with its statistical and performance analysis. Comparison of performance parameters
    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    Very well into the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0), humankind\
    \ can hardly distinguish between what is\nartiﬁcial and what is natural (e.g.,\
    \ man-made virus and natural virus). Tus, the level of discombobulation among\
    \ people,\ncompanies, or countries is indeed unprecedented. Te fact that industry\
    \ 4.0 is explosively disrupting or retroﬁtting each and every\nindustrial sector\
    \ makes industry 4.0 the famous buzzword amongst researchers today. However, the\
    \ insight of industry 4.0\ndisruption into the industrial sectors remains ill-deﬁned\
    \ in both academic and nonacademic literature. Te present study aimed at\nidentifying\
    \ industry 4.0 neologisms, understanding the industry 4.0 disruption and illustrating\
    \ the disruptive technology\nconvergence in the major industrial sectors. A total\
    \ of 99 neologisms of industry 4.0 were identiﬁed. Industry 4.0 disruption in\
    \ the\neducation industry (education 4.0), energy industry (energy 4.0), agriculture\
    \ industry (agriculture 4.0), healthcare industry\n(healthcare 4.0), and logistics\
    \ industry (logistics 4.0) was described. Te convergence of 12 disruptive technologies\
    \ including 3D\nprinting, artiﬁcial intelligence, augmented reality, big data,\
    \ blockchain, cloud computing, drones, Internet of Tings, nano-\ntechnology, robotics,\
    \ simulation, and synthetic biology in agriculture, healthcare, and logistics\
    \ industries was illustrated. Te study\ndivulged the need for extensive research\
    \ to expand the application areas of the disruptive technologies in the industrial\
    \ sectors.\n1. Introduction\nIn the second decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century,\
    \ the world\nstands on the cusp of industry 4.0 paradigm which has\nremarkably\
    \ become global emergence with a core of in-\ndustrial transformation, revitalization,\
    \ and development [1].\nSimply put, industry 4.0 is the integration of cyber and\n\
    physical worlds through introduction of new technologies in\nthe industrial ﬁelds\
    \ [2, 3]. In other words, it is a technological\nrevolution in every production\
    \ system including operator\nand maintenance [4], which is quite unique from the\
    \ pre-\nvious revolutions as shown in Table 1 [5–9]. Industry 4.0 is\nthe digitization\
    \ of the industrial value chain which has\nbecome unexampled for economic and\
    \ social development\nHindawi\nJournal of Engineering\nVolume 2020, Article ID\
    \ 8090521, 45 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8090521\nin the recent years\
    \ [10–12]. On the one hand, it allows high-\nwage countries to maintain their\
    \ business responsiveness\nand competitiveness [13]. On the other hand, research\
    \ and\ndevelopment units are organizationally, personally, and\nmethodically being\
    \ aligned for innovation competitiveness\n[14, 15].\nIndustry 4.0 is a data-driven\
    \ production system which is\nprogressing exponentially while reshaping the way\
    \ indi-\nviduals live and work essentially. Terefore, the public re-\nmains optimistic\
    \ regarding the opportunities it may oﬀer for\nsustainability and the future of\
    \ quality work in the global\ndigital economy [16–20]. Actually, industry 4.0\
    \ is increas-\ningly being promoted as the key for improving productivity,\npromoting\
    \ economic growth, and ensuring the sustainability\nof manufacturing companies\
    \ [21–23]. Moreover, it aims to\nimprove the ﬂexibility, adaptability, and resilience\
    \ of the\nindustrial systems [24, 25].\nIndustry 4.0 has been considered a new\
    \ industrial stage\nin which several emerging or disruptive technologies in-\n\
    cluding Internet of Tings (IoT), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\n3D printing, and\
    \ big data are converging to provide digital\nsolutions [26, 27]. Industry 4.0\
    \ is characterized by the mass\nemployment of smart objects in highly reconﬁgurable\
    \ and\nthoroughly connected industrial product-service systems\n[28]. In this\
    \ respect, industry 4.0 phenomenon is bringing\nunprecedented disruptions for\
    \ all traditional production/\nservice systems and business models (value chains)\
    \ and\nhotfooting the need for redesign and digitization of activities\n[29–32].\
    \ Tout ensemble is retroﬁtting and/or redeﬁning the\npatterns of value creation\
    \ and annexations, production\nnetworks, and supplier base and customer interfaces\n\
    [33–35].\nTe concept of industry 4.0 is greatly linked to other\nconcepts such\
    \ as servitization [36, 37], crowdsourcing [38],\ncircular economy (sharing economy)\
    \ [39–44], green econ-\nomy, and bioeconomy [45]. Besides being complemental to\
    \ a\nvast number of existing concepts, the main strength of\nindustry 4.0 is the\
    \ promises for shorter delivery time, more\neﬃcient and automated processes, higher\
    \ quality, agility in\nproduction,\nand\nproﬁtable\nand\ncustomized\nproducts\n\
    [46, 47]. Furthermore, it is expected to create extra values as\nthe world is\
    \ massively experiencing digital transformation\n[48]. In this regard, industry\
    \ 4.0 has not only opened\nwindows of opportunity for emerging economies but also\n\
    brought its own bureaucracy in terms of the main challenges\nthat these changes\
    \ pose to ﬁrms, industrial systems, and\npolicy approaches [49].\nTe curiosity\
    \ and the need to contemplate the meaning\nand concept of industry 4.0 have been\
    \ ubiquitous among\nacademic and business communities and thus make industry\n\
    4.0 to be one of the most important topics in the modern\nworld as a result of\
    \ digital milestones in the innovation area\n[50]. So far so good, there are several\
    \ ambiguities with al-\nmost 100 deﬁnitions and related concepts of industry 4.0\n\
    already in existence among academic and nonacademic\nliterature [51]. In the academic\
    \ community, engineering has\nincredibly gained more attention to the industry\
    \ 4.0 topic\nthan other subject areas including computer science,\nchemistry,\
    \ and energy (Figure 1) [52].\nTe rapid and fascinating adoption of the industry\
    \ 4.0\ntopic among academic and business entities has led to the\nmassive use\
    \ of icon or neologism “4.0” to depict industry 4.0\ndisruption in the systems,\
    \ processes, activities, or even in-\ndustrial sectors. However, the collective\
    \ numbers and names\nof the existing industry 4.0 neologisms have remained un-\n\
    clear [53]. In addition, industry 4.0 disruption through the\nconvergence of its\
    \ technologies has been ill-deﬁned among\nprevious researchers [26]. To this end,\
    \ the outstanding\ncontributions of the present study are trifold: (1) identify\n\
    industry 4.0 neologisms used among the academic and\nbusiness communities, (2)\
    \ clearly understand industry 4.0\ndisruption in education industry (education\
    \ 4.0), energy\nindustry (energy 4.0), agriculture industry (agriculture 4.0),\n\
    healthcare industry (healthcare 4.0), and logistics industry\nTable 1: Transition\

    Te\nconcept\nof\nindustry\n4.0\noriginated\nfrom\nthe\nmanufacturing industry\
    \ purposely to improve the engi-\nneering excellence from machine building to\
    \ informatiza-\ntion [55]. However, nowadays, the concept of industry 4.0\nhas\
    \ expanded enormously, and its deﬁnition spans beyond\nengineering, smart and\
    \ connected machines, and systems\nand has become a more general concept with\
    \ mainstream\nappeal and applicability [56]. Tis can be evidenced by a\nmultitude\
    \ of neologisms such as fashion 4.0 and care 4.0.\nInterestingly, the icon “4.0”\
    \ and beyond (e.g., “5.0”) have\nspread exceedingly as witnessed by the fact that\
    \ the com-\nbination of a noun and the icon “4.0” is used to signal and\nusher\
    \ in discussions about the future of business and society\n[53]. In this study,\
    \ 99 industry 4.0 neologisms were iden-\ntiﬁed and categorized into 6 areas based\
    \ on the subject of the\npublished literature as depicted in Table 2. However,\
    \ the\nprevious study done by Madsen [53] reported only 37 ne-\nologisms. Tis\

    4. Major Industrial Sectors\n4.1. Education 4.0\n4.1.1. Overview of Education\
    \ 4.0. Te disruptive landscape of\nindustry 4.0 is so strong that change is inevitable,\
    \ including\nwithin the education industry [176], making education 4.0\nthe illustrious\
    \ cant among educationists today [177, 178].\nEducation 4.0 is an advanced education\
    \ and networked\necosystem capable of developing skills and building com-\npetences\
    \ for the new era of manufacturing [106]. In other\nwords, education 4.0 is advanced\
    \ engineering education for\nindustry 4.0 [179, 180]. Furthermore, it is termed\
    \ as higher\neducation in the fourth industrial revolution [181–184].\nMoreover,\
    \ education 4.0 can be deﬁned in terms of OECD\nfuture education and skills 2030\
    \ [185] and PhD program in\nthe era of industry 4.0 [186]. Simply put, education\
    \ 4.0 is\ncreativity-focused technology education in the age of in-\ndustry 4.0\
    \ [187].\nGenerally, education 4.0 came forth in response to in-\ndustry 4.0 which\
    \ is a technology- and data-fueled world\n[188]. It has similar remarkable trends\
    \ of (r)evolution just as\nindustry 4.0. Table 3 shows the characteristics of\
    \ each ed-\nucation evolution [189–195]. Education 4.0 is the most\ncomplex system\
    \ as compared to the previous evolutions.\nTis is derived from the fact that industry\
    \ 4.0 disruption is\nintroducing rapid and unbelievable changes and challenges\n\
    including the issue of skills and job proﬁles [196]. Terefore,\nit poses the question\
    \ of how to educate and prepare new\nlogical innovations and to develop not only\
    \ left-brain skills\nbut also right-brain skills [197]. As a result, education\
    \ 4.0\ntopic has attracted a number of researchers in the recent\nyear. Lately,\
    \ the World Economic Forum developed edu-\ncation 4.0 framework that can be easily\
    \ adopted and\nimplemented by any institution, government, or university\nas presented\
    \ in Table 4 [198].\n4.1.2. Learning Factory. As far as education 4.0 is concerned,\n\
    adequate and innovative manufacturing education and\ntraining are required in\
    \ order to prepare employees for\nchanges in their working environment related\
    \ to quickly\nadvancing digitalization. Most importantly, theoretical\nknowledge\
    \ and practical skills regarding data acquisition,\nprocessing, visualization,\
    \ and interpretation are needed to\nexploit the full potential of digitalization\
    \ [199]. Conse-\nquently, the concepts of learning factory (LF)/teaching\nfactory\
    \ and innovation laboratory have egressed in the re-\ncent epoch as the lucrative\
    \ approaches for qualiﬁcation of\nparticipants from the ﬁeld of engineering, especially\
    \ in-\ndustrial and mechanical engineering [200–204].\nLFs oﬀer a suitable environment\
    \ to combine theoretical\nlearning and practical application and are therefore\
    \ pre-\ndestined to impart industry 4.0 knowledge and skills [205].\nLFs are employed\

    level factory [208]. Furthermore, LFs are an eﬀective solu-\ntion to deal with\
    \ new technologies, concepts, and methods\n[209]. Generally, LFs develop a uniform,\
    \ unambiguous\nconcept of competence that can be applied to production\ntechnology\
    \ in the engineering community [210]. However,\nthe requirements for the planning,\
    \ implementation, and\noperation of an academic LF vary depending on the speciﬁc\n\
    area of the respective institution [211]. For instance, the use\nof LFs diﬀers\
    \ for education in maintenance, manufacturing,\nproduction design, and technology\
    \ adoption [212]. To this\nend, several learning factory concepts have been developed\n\
    including\ngame-based\nlearning\nor\ngamiﬁcation\nfor\nmanufacturing education\
    \ [213] and Internet of Tings\nlaboratory (IoT lab) [214]. Table 5 outlines some\
    \ examples of\nthe learning factories launched majorly by institutions.\n4.2.\
    \ Energy 4.0\n4.2.1. Overview of Energy 4.0. Despite the tremendous im-\nprovement\
    \ in the industrial systems brought about by in-\ndustry 4.0 in terms of the rudimentary\
    \ achievements on\nhigher level of operational eﬃciency, productivity, and\nautomatization,\
    \ it brought bureaucracy as huge amount of\nenergy and materials is demanded and\
    \ extremely large\namount of solid, liquid, and gaseous wastes or greenhouse\n\
    gases is generated from these complex industrial systems\n[237, 238]. Terefore,\
    \ smart factories need to be sustainable\nand renewable in terms of energy pattern\
    \ (electric system\nindustry) [124, 239–241]. Furthermore, the United Nations\n\
    Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has set the\nrelevancy of industry\
    \ 4.0 and sustainability in the global\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG 7 and\
    \ 9) that digital\nindustrial development should support the growth of in-\ndustrial\
    \ sustainable energy [242]. Tis has pointed towards\nthe evolution of new energy\
    \ concept known as energy 4.0.\nEnergy 4.0 is a digital revolution in the energy\
    \ sector and\nalso known as smart energy or green energy [99]. It presents\nopportunities\
    \ for companies to establish new business models\nand sustainable strategies of\
    \ producing and delivering energy\n[99]. Moreover, the idea of energy 4.0 is based\
    \ on accelerating\nclean energy through adoption of the industry 4.0 concept in\n\
    the energy sector [243]. Te energy transition from 1.0 to 4.0\ncan be traced back\
    \ in a similar manner to that of the web\nsystem as illustrated in Figure 3 [99,\
    \ 101, 102].\n4.2.2. Te Drivers of Energy 4.0. Te concept of energy 4.0 is\nnascent,\
    \ and therefore, no clear information on its concept\nexists so far in the literature\
    \ [99]. Nevertheless, renewable\nenergy is fundamental to the energy 4.0 epoch.\
    \ However, the\ntransition to intermittent energy production from renewable\n\
    energy sources increases the complexity of providing reliable\nenergy supply.\
    \ Tis has been handled with the introduction of\ndigital or smart energy systems\
    \ [244]. Te truth is that smart\nrenewable energy ware systems lie at the core\
    \ of industry 4.0,\nand a number of recent advanced technologies and ap-\nproaches\
    \ play pivotal roles by exploiting innovative tech-\nnologies and optimization\
    \ methods [241]. For instance, the\nproduction of crude biofuels obtained from\
    \ biomass and\nrenewable energy sources is unheard-of. Te biomass crude\noil generation\
    \ technology is currently up-to-date in terms of\nreducing dangerous emissions\
    \ into the environment [245]. In\naddition, oﬀshore and onshore wind energy harvesting\
    \ has\nbecome the driving force towards the realization of energy 4.0\nin most\
    \ developed and developing countries [100].\nAnother key driver of energy 4.0\
    \ is how to reduce energy\nconsumption whilst maintaining or increasing proﬁts\
    \ and\nproductivity. Te fact that energy requirements have grown\ndue to automation\
    \ of industrial systems makes energy op-\ntimization central in energy 4.0. Tus,\
    \ a number of so-\nphisticated energy-eﬃcient mechanisms and software have\nbeen\
    \ developed including real-time embedded systems [246]\nand computational modeling\
    \ (e.g., energy eﬃciency analysis\nmodeling system) [247–249].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the advancement in power distribution is\nanother driver of energy 4.0. Tis\
    \ is accomplished through\nthe integration of conventional power grid system with\n\
    industry 4.0 technologies including IoT, big data, and AI.\nTe combination of\
    \ these technologies and power grid has\nbeen cited as smart grid [99].\nFurthermore,\
    \ the advancement in the energy storage system\nwhich employed nanotechnology\
    \ as one of the core technologies\nfor its development is emblematic to energy\
    \ 4.0. Currently, the\nnext-generation lithium-ion batteries are under rapid devel-\n\
    opment using various nanostructured materials including sili-\ncon nanowires and\
    \ silicon nanotubes which are two promising\nanode materials due to their high\
    \ speciﬁc capacities [250].\n4.3. Agriculture 4.0\n4.3.1. Overview of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. Te disruptive waves of\nindustry 4.0 in agriculture and food systems (agri-food)\
    \ can\nbe witnessed from the digital transformation of the pro-\nduction infrastructures\
    \ such as connected farms, new farm\nequipment, and connected tractors and machines\
    \ [251, 252].\nTe driving force behind this is the need to increase eﬃ-\nciency,\
    \ productivity, and quality in agri-food systems and\nenvironmental\nprotection\n\
    (reduce\nglobal\nwarming)\n[253, 254], that is, the sustainability of agricultural\
    \ systems\nwhich is paramount important for the survival and wellbeing\nof humans\
    \ worldwide [255]. In fact, agriculture plays a great\nrole in providing human\
    \ food security and sustainability in\nany country [256]. Terefore, to meet this\
    \ ever-increasing\nfood demand in the epoch of industry 4.0, the new concept\n\
    “agriculture 4.0” was born [82].\nAgriculture 4.0 is known with several names\
    \ including\ndata-driven and automated agriculture [172, 257], intelli-\ngence\
    \ agriculture [258], smart agriculture [259], digital\nagriculture [260], digital\
    \ farming [261], smart farming [262],\nand farming 4.0 [83]. Agriculture 4.0 emerged\
    \ when tele-\nmatics and data management were combined to the already\nknown concept\
    \ of precision agriculture (improving the\naccuracy of operations) [172]. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 can further be\ndeﬁned as farming in the era of industry 4.0 through dig-\n\
    italization [263]. Moreover, it is the future of farming\ntechnology which is\
    \ based on the emergence of smart\n8\nJournal of Engineering\ntechnology including\
    \ smart devices (sensors and actuators)\nand communication technology [263, 264].\
    \ Simply put,\nagriculture 4.0 is the fourth evolution in the farming\ntechnology\
    \ which is unparalleled to the previous (r)evolu-\ntions (Figure 4) [168, 172,\
    \ 265]. Some authors have argued\nthat it should be called “agriculture 5.0” [171],\
    \ but it is not yet\ncommon among the academic and nonacademic literature.\nSimilar\
    \ to industry 4.0, agriculture 4.0 is universally\ncomplemental to a number of\
    \ concepts including vertical\nfarming and food systems, bioeconomy, circular\
    \ agriculture,\nand aquaponics [266]. Agriculture 4.0 is composed of\nexisting\
    \ or developing technologies such as robotics,\nnanotechnology, synthetic protein,\
    \ cellular agriculture, gene\nediting technology, AI, blockchain, and cloud computing\n\
    [266].\nImportantly, food and farming systems must reconcile\nthe need to produce\
    \ enough healthy and aﬀordable food\nwith the equally important motive of ensuring\
    \ that humans\ndo not degrade the ecosystems on which they entirely de-\npend\
    \ for sustenance [171]. On the one hand, agriculture\nindustry is critical to\
    \ sustainable development, and agri-\ncultural production by smallholders in\n\
    lower-income\nTable 5: Examples of learning factories.\nS/N\nExample\nDescription\n\

    \ On the other hand,\nfood industry is a key issue in the economic structure due\

    \ and potential [268]. In order to harness\nand control both agriculture and food\
    \ industries, a complex\nindustry (agri-food) has emerged, better known as “agri-\n\
    food 4.0,” in the era of the fourth industrial revolution\n[96, 98, 269]. In fact,\

    10\nJournal of Engineering\nliterature search was conducted to identify the mentioned\n\
    use cases or applications of industry 4.0 technologies (dis-\nruptive technologies)\
    \ in the published literature. Disruptive\ntechnologies are the technologies that\
    \ create disruption on\nthe status quo as they produce unique sets of values.\
    \ In this\nrespect, 12 disruptive technologies were considered [27], and\nthese\
    \ included 3D printing (3DP), AI, augmented reality\n(AR), big data, blockchain\
    \ (BC), cloud computing (cloud),\ndrones, IoT, nanotechnology (nanotech), robotics\
    \ (robots),\nsimulation (Sim), and synthetic biology (Syn-Bio). Te\nidentiﬁed\
    \ applications were categorized into 10 major ap-\nplication areas in agriculture\
    \ and food systems, namely, food\nprocessing and management (FPM), farm equipment\
    \ and\nfacility maintenance (FEFM), agriculture machinery auto-\nmation (AMA),\
    \ general agri-food planning and operation\nmanagement (GAFPOM), yield prediction\
    \ and precision\nfarming (YPPF), weather and environment management\n(WEM),\n\
    land\npreparation\nand\nplanting\noptimization\n(LPPO), crop and livestock growth,\
    \ improvement and\nprotection (CLGIP), food packaging and storage (FPS), and\n\
    irrigation and water management (IWM) as shown in Ta-\nble 6. Tese application\
    \ areas were derived just from the\nmentioned applications in the collected relevant\
    \ publica-\ntions. So, by mapping the application areas with the dis-\nruptive\
    \ technologies, the convergence of these technologies\nis clearly visible as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 5. Te quantitative\nanalysis involved counting the converging technologies\
    \ in\neach application area and calculating the percentage con-\nvergence as shown\
    \ in Table 7. Te result demonstrates that\nthe application areas GAFPOM and YPPF\
    \ were the domi-\nnant with 17% technology convergence followed by WEM\nand CLGIP\
    \ with 15% and then LPPO (11%) (Figure 6).\nHowever, each application area has\
    \ totally diﬀerent sets of\ntechnologies in convergence. For instance, the technologies\n\
    converging in the GAFPOM application area include AI,\nAR, big data, blockchain,\
    \ cloud computing, drones, IoT,\nrobotics, and simulation, whilst the technologies\
    \ converging\nin YPPF include AI, AR, big data, cloud computing, drones,\nIoT,\
    \ nanotechnology, robotics, and synthetic biology. Tese\ndiﬀerences were also\
    \ observed in the other application areas.\n4.4. Healthcare 4.0\n4.4.1. Overview\
    \ of Healthcare 4.0. Te disruptive and\ntransformative waves of industry 4.0 which\
    \ are incredibly\nretroﬁtting many industries have also paved its way into the\n\
    healthcare industry or medical ﬁelds including orthopaedics\nand dentistry. As\
    \ the result of the tremendous disruption\ninto the healthcare system, a new concept\
    \ termed as\n“healthcare 4.0” has evolved [398–401]. Although the\nimplementation\
    \ of the healthcare 4.0 concept has been\ncharacterized as being highly complex\
    \ and costly and re-\nquires a more skilled labor force, a number of hospitals\
    \ in the\nadvanced countries are already embracing it [402, 403]. Te\ndriving\
    \ force behind this healthcare (r)evolution is the need\nto deploy industry 4.0\
    \ technologies to deliver more eﬀective\nand eﬃcient healthcare services including\
    \ high security and\nprivacy on the patients’ data electronic health record while\n\
    allowing remote and real-time access and diagnosis by the\ndoctors or healthcare\
    \ personnel [404–407].\nHealthcare 4.0 is also known as hospital 4.0 [123]. It\
    \ is a\nterm that has egressed recently and derived from industry\n4.0. Simply\
    \ put, healthcare 4.0 is digital health or the use of\ndigital technologies for\
    \ health. Te term digital health is\nrooted in electronic health (eHealth). eHealth\
    \ is deﬁned as\nthe use of ICT in support of health and health-related ﬁelds,\n\
    while mobile health (mHealth), which is a subset of eHealth,\nentails the use\
    \ of mobile wireless technologies for health. On\nthe contrary, healthcare 4.0\
    \ germinated as a broad umbrella\nterm encompassing eHealth (which includes mHealth),\
    \ as\nwell as emerging areas, such as the use of industry 4.0\ntechnologies including\
    \ IoT, big data, 5G, AI, computing\n(cloud, fog, and edge), and blockchain [408–414].\
    \ Holisti-\ncally, the World Health Organization (WHO) [408] reit-\nerated the\
    \ term healthcare 4.0 as a discrete functionality of\ndigital technology that\
    \ is applied to achieve health objectives\nand is implemented within digital health\
    \ applications and\nICT systems, including communication channels such as\ntext\
    \ messages. In a similar manner to industry 4.0, the\nhealthcare industry has\
    \ revolutionized from 1.0 to 4.0 as\nillustrated in Figure 7 [415–417]. Besides\
    \ the implementa-\ntion of industry 4.0 technologies in the healthcare system,\n\
    there are ongoing studies in the development of healthcare\nservices including\
    \ the Social Cooperation for Integrated\nAssisted Living (SOCIAL) [418], OpenEHR\
    \ [419], GraphQL,\nand HL7 FHIR [420]. Tis is because healthcare service and\n\
    management plays an essential role in the human society\n[421, 422]. Tese are\
    \ also contributing a lot to shaping the\njourney of healthcare 4.0.\nOne of the\
    \ factors that is boosting the adoption of\nhealthcare 4.0 is the concept of smart\
    \ city. Smart healthcare\nis an essential part of creating a smart city because\
    \ anyone\ncan go to the hospital for treatment [423]. To this far, some\nof the\
    \ major players in healthcare 4.0 include Abbott Lab-\noratories, Philips Healthcare,\
    \ Life Watch, GE Healthcare,\nOmron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare, and Honeywell\n\
    International Inc. [424]. Nevertheless, the healthcare in-\ndustry lags behind\
    \ other industries in protecting its data\nfrom cyber attacks [425]. Te strength\
    \ and the beneﬁt of\nhealthcare 4.0 adoption have been witnessed in the ﬁght of\n\
    the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [426].\nCoronavirus is one of the\
    \ viral respiratory illnesses and can\nbe fatal to some immunocompromised patients\
    \ [427].\nHowever, combating this pandemic has become a global\nhurdle. As a lifesaving\
    \ strategy, a number of healthcare\nfacilities have devoted to using 3D-printed\
    \ patient respi-\nratory ventilators and breathing equipment to sustain the life\n\
    of patients [428].\n4.4.2. Convergence of Disruptive Technologies in Healthcare.\n\
    As with agriculture 4.0, the convergence of industry 4.0\ntechnologies in healthcare\
    \ has been demonstrated. Here, the\nanalysis was based on 10 application areas\
    \ which included\nmedical education, research and training (MERT), medical\ndevices\
    \ and equipment (MDE), pharmaceuticals, drug de-\nlivery\nand\ndiscovery\n(PDDD),\n\

    For the case of supply chain management, industry 4.0 with\nits associated technological\
    \ advances is increasing supply\nchain resilience or lean supply chain management\
    \ which is\nhighly linked to the general operation and performance of\nthe logistics\
    \ industry [538–540].\nGenerally, logistics 4.0 refers to the combination of using\n\
    logistics with the innovations and applications added by the\ncyber-physical system.\
    \ However, so many related concepts\nand deﬁnitions of logistic 4.0 exist today\
    \ including smart\nservices and products [541], green logistics [542], smart\n\
    logistics or intelligent logistics, and smart warehouses\n[543–547]. Furthermore,\
    \ logistics 4.0 reﬂects logistics in-\nnovation [548], digitization in maritime\
    \ logistics [549],\ndigital supply chain [550, 551], smart ships, smart containers\n\

    \ globalization\nin the era of industry 4.0 has taken a quantum leap into a\n\
    new concept known as “globalization 4.0” which is among\nthe main drivers of logistic\
    \ 4.0 [579]. One of the key\ncountries behind globalization 4.0 is China. China’s\
    \ Belt and\nRoad Initiative is an important vector for globalization 4.0 as\n\
    it helps to bring its enabling infrastructure and technologies\nto all corners\
    \ of the globe [580]. Table 11 depicts the\ntransition or (r) evolution from 1.0\
    \ to 4.0 for globalization,\nleadership, and society [581–585].\nSimilarly, ﬁnance\
    \ sectors in the logistic industry are\nleapfrogging as disruptive technologies\
    \ paved their ways into\nservices and ﬁnancial inclusion. In most organizations\
    \ to-\nday, ﬁnance professionals are being asked to learn new skills,\noften related\
    \ to such technologies, because work is morphing\ninto more project-oriented opportunities.\
    \ For instance, the\nmajor challenges that chief ﬁnance oﬃcers of the logistics\n\
    industry are facing include handling massively big data,\nliquidity and cash ﬂow,\
    \ complicated cash lifecycle ﬁnding,\nand retaining good talent [586]. In order\
    \ to overcome these\nhurdles in ﬁnance systems for the logistics industry, a new\n\
    concept of ﬁnance called “ﬁnance 4.0” was born, which is\ndriven by digital transformation\
    \ in the ﬁnance and banking\nsystem [587–589]. Figure 10 elaborates three generations\
    \ of\nﬁnance\nand\nbanking\nsystems\nfrom\n2.0\nto\n4.0\n[145, 586–588, 590].\n\

    \ light set-up in the morning, the disruptive\nlandscape of industry 4.0 in the\
    \ industrial sectors is unlimited.\nTis can be evidenced from the explosive use\
    \ of neologism\n“4.0” among the academic and business communities. Te\nconvergence\
    \ of disruptive technologies is incredible, and this\nis the remarkable power\
    \ of industry 4.0 disruption in any\nindustrial sector. Adoption of education\
    \ 4.0 through imple-\nmentation of the learning factory is paramount important\
    \ for\nbuilding the requisite skills into the workforce for industry\n4.0. Te\
    \ concept of energy 4.0 is still nascent, and thus, much\nresearch is required\
    \ to ensure its success because the amount\nof energy requirement has reached\
    \ unprecedented level due to\nthe automation of the industrial plants to make\
    \ them industry\n4.0-compliant. Te present study demonstrated the conver-\ngence\
    \ of disruptive technologies in agriculture, healthcare,\nand logistics industries.\
    \ Tis might not depict the real-life\nsituation because the study was solely based\
    \ on the published\nliterature and therefore limited by the availability of infor-\n\
    mation. Nonetheless, it provides an insight into the con-\nvergence of industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies in the industrial sectors.\nA number of disruptive technologies,\
    \ however, have received\nvery few applications in these selected industries.\
    \ Tis points\nout the need for more research to increase the application\nareas\
    \ of these technologies. More especially, application of\nsynthetic biology in\
    \ logistics needs to be investigated. Ad-\nditionally, application of disruptive\
    \ technologies in the ﬁeld of\ndentistry should be expanded. Te convergence of\
    \ disruptive\ntechnologies in education and energy sectors should also be\ninvestigated.\n\

    \ and machine learning is a hotspot research area in the domain of agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture \nanalytics is a data intensive multidisciplinary problem. Big data\
    \ analytics becomes a key technology to perform analysis \nof voluminous data.\
    \ Irrigation water management is a challenging task for sustainable agriculture.\
    \ It depends on various \nparameters related to climate, soil and weather conditions.\
    \ For accurate estimation of requirement of water for a crop a strong \nmodeling\
    \ is required. This paper aims to review the application of big data based decision\
    \ support system framework for \nsustainable water irrigation management using\
    \ intelligent learning approaches. We examined how such developments can be \n\
    leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, analytics\
    \ and decision support tools for agriculture \nirrigation water system. Moreover,\
    \ water irrigation management need to rapidly adapt state-of-the-art using big\
    \ data technolo-\ngies and ICT information technologies with the focus of developing\
    \ application based on analytical modeling approach. This \nstudy introduces the\
    \ area of research, including a irrigation water management in smart agriculture,\
    \ the crop water model \nrequirement, and the methods of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ decision support system, and research motivation.\n1 Introduction\nWATER-Every\
    \ drop is precious, save it.  Water is the main \nlimiting factor of agricultural\
    \ development in semi-arid and \narid climates. It is a critical input for enhancing\
    \ agricultural \nproductivity. Arthur Keith said that the advancement of agri-\n\
    culture is the first major step for civilized life [1]. Even after \nsix decades\
    \ of planned development, agriculture has played \nan important role in the Indian\
    \ economy. However, the agri-\nculture sector of India has been transformed via\
    \ the effective \ndeployment of Information and Communication Technolo-\ngies\
    \ (ICTs) in traditional to modern practices which pro-\nvide various services\
    \ (such as- IoT agriculture, smart water \nmanagement, soil management, plant\
    \ diseases, crop manage-\nment, geo-spatial image and livestock monitoring).\n\
    In India, the demand of water for the agriculture and \nindustry sectors is continuously\
    \ increasing to fulfill the \nneeds of 1.366 billion people. Central Indian Punjab\
    \ is well-\nknown for its agricultural activities and has occupied a high \npercentage\
    \ of the land area all over India, and its agricultural \nproduction mainly depends\
    \ on irrigation.\nPunjab has 97.95% highest gross irrigation of the total \ncropped\
    \ area [2]. Recently, the achievement of the Green \nRevolution is endangered\
    \ by a significant decline in water \nresources. As a result, water conservation\
    \ and precision agri-\nculture are becoming vital issues in tropical climate areas.\
    \ \nWheat and Maize are the most commonly cultivated crops \nand have high water\
    \ consumption in Punjab, India. The \nmajor challenge in agriculture sustainability\
    \ and dawdling \nis due to climate change; therefore, every drop of freshwater\
    \ \nneeds to be utilize effectively and efficiently.\nTo overcome these challenges,\
    \ the multivariate, complex, \nand unpredictable agricultural ecosystems must\
    \ be well \nunderstood by continuously analyzing, measuring, and mon-\nitoring\
    \ several physical aspects and phenomena [3]. New \ntechnologies and knowledge\
    \ can help in this complex deci-\nsion-making. The fundamental idea is that the\
    \ DSS should \nserve as a farm management tool, supporting farm managers \nin\
    \ making decisions on irrigation, whether to irrigate and, \nif so, which field\
    \ with how much water. Wani et al. [4] pre-\nsented a thorough investigation to\
    \ evaluate the possibility of \nusing Machine Learning models to identify plant\
    \ diseases.\nIn the early twentieth century, irrigation is the most \ncrucial\
    \ practice no doubt and needs effective utilization. \n * Mandeep Kaur Saggi \n\

    \ \n1 3\nFarmers required to predict the need of water for the crops, \nto confirm\
    \ the data provided by agricultural weather stations \nor to get insight the free\
    \ water surface evaporation in lakes \nor dams. Agricultural irrigation scheduling\
    \ is becoming a \nvery important managerial activity whose ultimate purpose \n\
    is to achieve effective and efficient utilization of water. The \nprimary objective\
    \ of good irrigation scheduling is to apply \nthe right amount of water at right\
    \ time.\nIrrigation scheduling improves the water use efficiency \nand focus on\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods \nfor understanding of spatial variations\
    \ of ET. It determine \nirrigation applications such as identifying the water\
    \ balance \ncomponent, integrated various sensing technologies into \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling models and control, new improved \nsensor technology and integrated\
    \ water quality constraints \ninto irrigation scheduling and control [5]. Figure 1\
    \ presents \nthe six identified relevant works, indicating the smart water \n\
    management related research work such as crop water mod-\neling, soil monitoring,\
    \ water quality, drones field monitor-\ning, weather forecasting, and irrigation\
    \ scheduling.\nThe ultimate irrigation potential of India has been esti-\nmated\
    \ to be 139.5 million ha, comprising 58.5 million ha \nfrom major and medium schemes,\
    \ 15 million ha from minor \nirrigation schemes, 66 million ha from groundwater\
    \ exploi-\ntation, and an estimated 77 million ha beyond 2025 from \nfreshwater\
    \ use for irrigation [6]. It is approximated that after \ngaining the full potential\
    \ of the irrigation, nearly 50% of the \ntotal cultivated area will hold out rain-fed.\n\
    Irrigation is the most important factor for escalating the \nagricultural production\
    \ of plants. It is essential to determine \nthe quantity of water to get the optimal\
    \ benefits from the irri-\ngation, which depends on some factors such as the environ-\n\
    ment, type of crop, subsurface geo-hydrological condition, \nand the stage of\
    \ its growth.\nThe questions arise in the irrigation scheduling are as \nfollows:\
    \ (i) How to apply irrigation water?, (ii) How much \nto irrigate?, (iii) When\
    \ to irrigate. Currently, irrigation deci-\nsion-making systems are enforced to\
    \ the agricultural field \naiming for specific crop at a given area [7]. It is\
    \ difficult to \nbe practiced to different crops and areas. Under the grow-\n\
    ing environment, the amount of irrigation is defined as the \ndepth of water required\
    \ to meet the crop water loss through \nevapotranspiration. It can be obtained\
    \ via prediction using \nindirect channels or field measurement techniques. However,\
    \ \nthe amount and timing of water have major impact on qual-\nity of crop and\
    \ its yield. Several methods are applied for the \nirrigation scheduling such\
    \ as pan evaporation, soil moisture \nbasis, leaf water potential, and based on\
    \ growth-stages. The \ndemand of water can be fulfill by full or partial irrigation\
    \ in \nall methods.\n1.1  Motivation\nAs technology rapidly spread in a few decades,\
    \ precision \nagriculture is the key to fostering a new revolution in Irriga-\n\
    tion scheduling. The United Nations statistical data indicate \nthat agriculture\
    \ consumes 70% of the overall use of water \nworldwide, compared with 20% for\
    \ industry and 10% for \ndomestic use [8]. To ensure the proper use of water sup-\n\
    plies in irrigation we need more effective technologies. \nAutomatic irrigation\
    \ scheduling techniques replaced man-\nual irrigation which was based upon crop\
    \ water estimation. \nThe crop evapotranspiration can be determined by weather\
    \ \nparameters such as max–min temperature, humidity, wind \nspeed, solar radiations,\
    \ and even the crop factors such as the \nstage of growth, crop height, and the\
    \ soil properties for the \ndevelopment of irrigation scheduling. The machine\
    \ learning \nand deep learning advanced technologies provide direction \nand motivation\
    \ to propose a novel application on crop water \nmodeling. The influence of several\
    \ factors on crop yields and \ntemperature, precipitation have been found to have\
    \ maxi-\nmum influence on the yields of different crops [9].\n2  Reference Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\n“Evapotranspiration contains two processes, evapo-\nration in which water\
    \ is lost from the soil and plant \nsurface, and transpiration from plant surfaces\
    \ to the \natmosphere” [10].\nFig. 1  Smart water management in smart agriculture\n\
    4457\nA Survey Towards Decision Support System on Smart Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\nThe water irrigation is enforced to match the\
    \ needs of evapo-\ntranspiration of crop. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nneeds to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration accu-\nrately. Evapotranspiration\
    \ of crops differs significantly over \nthe growing season mainly due to alterations\
    \ in climatic \nconditions and crop cover. It also varies among the crops. \n\
    The information about crop water demand (i.e., ET) is a \ncrucial practical consideration\
    \ in the planning, developing, \nand working of water and irrigation management\
    \ systems. \nFigure 2 presented the concept of ETo.\nTable 1 presented the ET\
    \ that affecting by weather ele-\nment. The reference evapotranspiration is approximated\
    \ \nfrom meteorological data (humidity, temperature, wind \nrun/wind speed, sunshine\
    \ hours/solar radiation) by using \nthe Penman-Monteith equation. However, the\
    \ adjusted pan \nevaporation measurements are also used.\n2.1  Factors Affecting\
    \ ETo\nClimate and weather play crucial role in determining \nlong-term and day-to-day\
    \ activities in the agriculture. The \ndemand of crop water is determined largely\
    \ by weather vari-\nables. Rainfall is the foremost weather variable that affects\
    \ \nthe water resources development planning, irrigation plan-\nning and agricultural\
    \ cropping. The main climatic/weather \ncomponents crucial for agriculture are\
    \ rainfall, maximum/\nminimum temperature, solar radiation, sunshine duration,\
    \ \nhumidity, photo-period or sunshine hour, wind speed, and \nnight temperature\
    \ [11] as depicted in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows \nthe different empirical methods\
    \ with weather parameters for \nestimation of ETo.\nWeather elements controls\
    \ the crop water demand and \ncrop ET. The ET depends upon the different weather\

    \ \n(Allen et al. 1998) [10] is the most dominant as compared \nto others empirical\
    \ methods  [20, 21]. But, it requires sev-\neral climatic data factors [22].\n\
    The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM56) [10] has \nbeen broadly used to analyze\
    \ ETo from meteorological fac-\ntors and it is suggested as the standard technique\

    where, ETo is the reference evapotranspiration (mm∕day−1);  \nΔ = slope of saturation\
    \ vapor pressure function (kPa °C−1 ); \nR n = net radiation (MJ m−2day−1 ); 훾\
    \ = psychometric constant \n(kPa °C−1); G = soil heat flux density (MJ m−2day−1\
    \ ); W s = \naverage 24-h wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1) ; T mean = mean \nair\
    \ temperature (°C); e a = actual vapour pressure(kPa); e s \n= saturation vapour\
    \ pressure(kPa); and (es − ea ) = vapour \npressure deficit (kPa).\nHowever, ETo\
    \ can be determined accurately by this \nmethod, large scale meteorological data\
    \ requirement at spe-\ncific spatio-temporal scales (vapor pressure deficit, wind\
    \ \nspeed, minimum and maximum air temperatures, and solar \nradiation) are quite\
    \ often not available in many develop-\ning countries [24]. Thus, the alternate\
    \ models are needed to \nestimate ETo when the available data are either insufficient\
    \ \nor limited. So, it is important to explore a simpler model to \ncalculate\
    \ ETo using fewer weather properties and a reason-\nable precision.\nThe need\
    \ of crop water depends on some factors: crop \ngrowth/stages, crop type and the\
    \ climate are given in detail \n[25]:\n3  Crop Evapotranspiration ETc\n“The crop\
    \ evapotranspiration denoted as ETc,is the \ncrop water requirements or crop water\
    \ need.”\nThe need for crop water is the depth (or quantify of water \nrequired\
    \ to cope with the loss of water through evapotranspi-\nration. In other words,\
    \ water needs to be cultivated optimally \nby different crops. Crop-growth models\
    \ were developed to \nimprove the understanding of crop dynamics and to pre-\n\
    dict crop growth and production under various agronomic \nconditions [35]. The\
    \ continuous monitoring of the soil sta-\ntus water, the conditions of crop growth,\
    \ and its spatial and \ntemporal patterns will help in irrigation and precision\
    \ water \nplanning. Evaporation and transpiration variations in the \nfield and\
    \ grass crops can be integrated into dual crop coeffi-\ncient or single crop coefficient\
    \ (Kc ): a soil evaporation coef-\nficient (Ke ) and a basal crop (Kcb ) and calculated\
    \ by Eq. (2).\n3.1  Climate Based ETc\nThe combination of two different processes\
    \ by which water \nevaporates from the soil surface and transpiration from the\
    \ \nplant is referred as evapotranspiration. It is determined \n(1)\nETo =\n0.408\
    \ ⋅ Δ ⋅ (Rn − G) + 훾 ⋅\n900\nTmean+273 ⋅ u2 ⋅ (es − ea)\nΔ + 훾(1 + 0.34Ws)\n(2)\n\
    (Kc) = (Kcb) + (Ke).\nby climatic factors including solar radiation, temperature,\
    \ \nwind, and humidity as well as environmental factors. The \nevaporation account\
    \ for approximately 10% of the overall \nevapotranspiration and the transpiration\
    \ of crops constitutes \nthe remaining 90%. Hence, there is a need for crop water\
    \ \nin hot, dry, windy, and sunny areas. For the lowest values \nwhen the wind\
    \ is cold, humid, and cloudy, with little to no \nwind. Climate impact on crop\
    \ water requirements is deter-\nmined by reference crop evapotranspiration ETo\
    \ and gener-\nally expressed per unit of time in millimeters., e.g. mm/day, \n\
    mm/month, or mm/season.\n3.1.1  Crop Type\nThe effect of the crop type in daily\
    \ crop water requirements \nis often referred to as a fully grown crop; Plant\
    \ height has \nreached maximum; Plants cover the ground optimally; prob-\nably\
    \ they began to flowering or developing to set grain; The \nwater demand is greatest\
    \ when the crop is fully cultivated. \nTheir water needs are called the “peak\
    \ period”.\nThe type of crop that has also affected the total growing \nduration\
    \ of crop development is known by seasonal crop \nwater need and can be obtained.\
    \ The best possible local \ndata can be obtained on the duration of the total\
    \ seasons of \nthe various plants cultivated in a region. Such data can be \n\
    collected from, for example, the seed supplier, the Exten-\nsion Service, the\
    \ Irrigation Department, or the Ministry of \nAgriculture.\n3.1.2  Growth Stages\
    \ of the Crop\nWhile planting and in the initial stage, evaporation is more \n\
    essential than transpiration. When the crop is fully devel-\noped, the need for\
    \ crop water is estimated to be 50% during \nthe mid-season phase. At the stage\
    \ of development, the crop \ndemand moderately increases from 50% of the maximum\
    \ \ncrop water requirement to the maximum crop water. Thus, \nthe maximum amount\
    \ of crop water is extended to the end \nof crop development stage, which is the\
    \ starting of mid-\nseason stage.\nThe value of K c depends on different factors\
    \ such as can-\nopy cover density, agriculture operations, weather variable, \n\
    type of crop, soil moisture, and growth stage [10]. The idea \nof crop coefficient\
    \ K c is proposed by Jensen [36] and has \nbeen improved by many researchers [37,\
    \ 38].\nHowever, K c method has the capability to determine the \nactual crop\
    \ evapotranspiration ETc precisely. According to \nthe FAO methodology, the four\
    \ growing stages of a crop are \nthe initial stage, crop development stage, mid-season\
    \ stage, \nand end-season stage (Allen et al. 1998) [10]. The crop coef-\nficient\
    \ method can be expressed as follows:\n4460\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\nThe\
    \ two-step crop coefficient K c reference evapotranspi-\nration has been a successful\
    \ method to predict the evapo-\ntranspiration (ET) and crop water requirements.\
    \ The total \ngrowing period is divided into 4 growth stages shown in \nFig. 4\
    \ [39]:\n• The initial stage the period ranges from transplanting or \nsowing\
    \ till crop covers the 10% of ground.\n• The crop development stage the period\
    \ begins at the com-\npletion of the initial stage and remains until the full\
    \ ground \nhas been covered (ground cover 70–80%). It does not cer-\ntainly mean\
    \ that the crop is at its maximum height.\n• The mid-season stage the period begins\
    \ at the completion \nof the crop development stage and remains till maturity;\
    \ it \nconsists grain-setting and flowering.\n• The late-season stage the period\
    \ starts at the completion \nof mid-season stage and remains until the last day\
    \ of the \nharvest; it consists ripening.\nwhere ETc represents the requirement\
    \ of crop water (mm \nd −1 ), ETo the reference crop water requirement (mm d −1\
    \ ), \nand K c the crop coefficient and calculated by Eq. (3). \nBesides, Kingra\
    \ et al. (2004) computed crop water require-\nment for Wheat and transplanted\
    \ Rice at Ludhiana, reported \nthat the Wheat crop used about 315 mm water whereas\
    \ the \nrice crop used about 780 mm water during its growing sea-\nson [40]. Saggi\
    \ et al. [41] collected the K c values as case \nstudy from Punjab agricultural\
    \ University (PAU), Ludhi-\nana and estimated the ETc for two crops. The K c values\
    \ of \nWheat1 crop were 0.4, 1.15 & 0.4 while for Wheat2 were \n0.5, 1.36, 1.42,\
    \ and 0.42 for the initial, mid and last stage of \ngrowth respectively. The length\
    \ of time (days) for four sea-\nsons of Wheat1 were 29, 55, 14 32 days while for\
    \ Wheat2 24, \n46, 35, 42 days. The K c values of Maize crop were 0.7, 0.85, \n\
    1.15 & 1.05 for the initial, mid, and end-stage of growth \n(3)\nETc = Kc × ETo\n\
    respectively. The length of time (days) for four seasons of \nMaize were 35, 18,\
    \ 17, and 15 days used in different stages. \nDetail of selected crops and period\
    \ of data for the study.\n4  Irrigation Scheduling\nIn 1996, Howell explored the\
    \ effects on water use and irri-\ngation scheduling [42]. It is an application\
    \ mechanism that \ncan lead to the effective and efficient use of water. This\
    \ \nefficiency can be enhanced by using advanced methods \nof irrigation. However,\
    \ even in advanced irrigation meth-\nods, irrigation scheduling at the farm level\
    \ is required. It \nis necessary when rainfall is deficient to remunerate for\
    \ \nthe water lost by evapotranspiration. The irrigation water \nneed is described\
    \ as the crop water requirement minus the \nfruitful rainfall. It is defined in\
    \ mm/month or mm/day. The \nmain goal of good irrigation scheduling is to apply\
    \ the cor-\nrect amount of water at the right time, and make sure that \nwater\
    \ is accessible when the crop requires it.\nAccording to predetermined schedules,\
    \ the irrigation \nwater is supplied to the cultivation by keep track of the \n\
    following [43]:\n• The status of soil water;\n• The need of crop water.\nThe purpose\
    \ of our research work is to present, analyze, \nand optimize some measure of\
    \ performance of the crop \nproduction under a set of specified conditions, such\
    \ as the \nlimited or unlimited total volume of water for the growing \nseason.\
    \ The main factors that influence the solution and \nimplementation of the irrigation\
    \ scheduling problem are \nthe characteristics of climate soil, crop, irrigation\
    \ water, \nand irrigation technology.\nJudicious usage of water for crop production\
    \ needs \nknowledge of water quality, soil, weather, crop, and drain-\nage situation.\
    \ The increase in efficiency of pumping sys-\ntems and conveyance need to review.\n\
    The soil types and climatic conditions have a consid-\nerable effect on the major\
    \ practical aspects of irrigation \nsuch as how much amount of water should be\
    \ supplied and \nwhen to a selected crop.\nA time-consuming and complex process\
    \ is a precise \nestimation of the irrigation schedule [25]. However, the \nadvent\
    \ of advanced technology has made it simpler and \nthe water supply can be scheduled\
    \ precisely to meet the \nwater requirements of cultivation. The timing for irriga-\n\
    tion applications can be fixed dates or on flexible dates. \nThe quantity should\
    \ not exceed the crop requirements per \napplication, including the leaching of\
    \ salts; otherwise, \nany excess water would not only reduce the efficiency of\
    \ \nits usage but can hinder the crop development. Standard \nFig. 4  Various\

    \ performance metrics are crop yields \nand net benefits per unit area.\nThe optimal\
    \ irrigation schedule is any schedule that \noptimizes the adopted output measurement\
    \ while meeting \nseveral defined constraints. Any schedule that optimizes \n\
    the adopted measure of performance while satisfying some \nspecified constraints\
    \ is the optimal irrigation schedule.\n4.1  Methods of Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    Different techniques can be apply to the plants with irriga-\ntion water and each\
    \ approach has its benefits and limita-\ntions. In this context, the best approach\
    \ to accommodate \nlocal conditions should be taken into account. Earlier, the\
    \ \nprimary irrigation method is applied via the source of supply \nsuch as a\
    \ bucket watering or a well. Although, it is a time-\nconsuming method.\nMore\
    \ advanced water application methods are used in \nlarger areas where irrigation\
    \ is needed. The suitability of \nseveral irrigation methods, i.e. sprinkler,\
    \ surface, or drip \nirrigation, depends on the following aspects: Natural condi-\n\
    tions, type of crop, type of technology, previous experience \nwith irrigation,\
    \ required labor inputs and costs and benefits.\nSurface irrigation may be categorized\
    \ based on mode of \nwater application as depicted in Fig. 5. [44] and Fig. 6\
    \ shown \nthe different types of irrigation methods. Table 3 presented \nthe different\
    \ types of irrigation methods, advantages and \ntheir applications.\nFig. 5  Irrigation\
    \ methods\nFig. 6  Types of irrigation \nscheduling\n4462\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain\
    \ \n1 3\n4.1.1  Border Irrigation\nSurface irrigation is where the water is applied\
    \ to the sur-\nface of field by gravity flow. The water is applied into small\
    \ \nchannels (furrows) or complete surface is flooded with water \n(basin irrigation)\
    \ or strips of land (borders). Border irriga-\ntion is a modern method of surface\
    \ irrigation. Borders are \nuniformly graded strips of land and long, set apart\
    \ by earth \nbunds. They are also known as border strips. There are sev-\neral\
    \ ways to fed the irrigation water to the border such as by \nusing small gates,\
    \ launching the channel bank, using spiles \nor siphons. A sheet of water is guided\
    \ by the earth bunds and \nflows down the slope of the border. It is mostly suited\
    \ to gen-\nerate long uninterrupted field lengths for facility of machine \noperations\
    \ in the huge mechanized farms. Borders can be up \nto 3-30m wide and at least\
    \ 800m in length depend on several \nfactors. It is less applicable to farms on\
    \ small-scale consist-\ning animal-powered cultivation techniques or hand labor.\n\
    4.1.2  Sprinkler Irrigation\nIt is equivalent to natural rainfall, where water\
    \ is pumped \nusing a pipe system and then rotating sprinkler heads used \nto\
    \ spray onto the crops. Further, the spray is applied into the \nair via sprinklers\
    \ to breaks it into small drops of water that \nfall on the ground. The sprinklers,\
    \ pump supply system, and \noperating conditions must be developed to apply the\
    \ water \nuniformly. It is well suited for the most field, row, and tree \ncrops.\
    \ Water can be sprayed under or over the crop canopy. \nAlthough, large sprinklers\
    \ are not suggested for delicate \ncrops such as lettuce due to the large size\
    \ water drops gen-\nerated by the sprinklers can harm the crops.\n4.1.3  Drip\
    \ Irrigation\nIt involves application of dripping water to the soil from a \n\
    small diameter plastic pipe systems attached with outlets \ncalled emitters or\
    \ drippers at very low rates (2–20 l/h). It is \nalso called as trickle irrigation.\
    \ Water is applied very close \nto plants so that only part of the soil in which\
    \ the roots grow \nis wetted, instead of sprinkler and surface irrigation, which\
    \ \nconsists wetting the complete soil profile [25]. It is well suited \nfor trees,\
    \ vine crops and row crops (vegetables, soft fruit), \nwhere one or more emitters\
    \ can be given for each plant. It is \nconsidered for high-value crops only due\
    \ to high capital costs \nrequired for installation of a drip system.\n4.1.4 \
    \ Need of Irrigation Scheduling\nHydrological, climatologist, and agronomical\
    \ processes play \nan significant part in the development of irrigation agriculture\
    \ \nproduction. These studies were mainly developed to estimate \ndaily, weekly,\
    \ or monthly evapotranspiration. The precise \napproximation of evapotranspiration\
    \ is an important process \nthat plays a key role in crop planning, deployment\
    \ and produc-\ntion of irrigation systems.\nIn recent years, several approaches\
    \ have been developed to \novercome the problems and obstacles that occur with\
    \ smart \nfarming, such as species recognition, yield prediction, disease \ndetection,\
    \ drought, crop productivity problems and irrigation \nmanagement.\nSo, there\
    \ is a great need to explore more research studies \nto enhance the scalability\
    \ of irrigation scheduling based on \nadvanced data analytic and machine learning.\
    \ Some research \nhas been done in the decision support system to improve the\

    \ Irrigation Scheduling Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\n5  Decision Support System\n\
    The idea of a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation \nwater management\
    \ is introduced in the 1970’s to assist \nusers in complex decision- making processes\
    \ and efficient \nuse of irrigation water at the farm level [53].\nDecision support\
    \ system (DSS) has great potential \nin agriculture era, if the water irrigation\
    \ management \nresearch is combined with the modeling approach using \nmachine\
    \ learning analytics and agriculture statistical, \nthe research level will be\
    \ achieved in different levels of \nthe agricultural development sector. The decision\
    \ sup-\nport system for crop water irrigation scheduling based on \ncrop water\
    \ model by estimation of evapotranspiration as \nweather parameter, historical\
    \ dataset, and using of differ-\nent Irrigation water management methods.\nThe\
    \ decision support system is an integrated approach \nto solve complex problems,\
    \ combining the computer cal-\nculation and data storage capacities with human\
    \ language \nand perception, support of mathematical model statistics, \nproviding\
    \ decision-maker. It is known as a primary tool \nin management for better decision\
    \ making and environ-\nmental resources. In 1985, Guariso et al. firstly intro-\n\
    duced the concept of DSS. Various researchers surveyed \nthe advanced use of the\
    \ management of DSS for water \nresources [54]. Today, it is required for the\
    \ on-farm irri-\ngation water management due to its use of the computer \nto relate\
    \ soil, crop, and water quality conditions. It can be \nused for analyzing and\
    \ determining how much water is \nneeded and when it should give next time.\n\
    5.1  Statistics\nThe statistical approach leads to the process of collection,\
    \ \npresentation, analyze, and apply the data to make deci-\nsions, problems solving,\
    \ design products, and processes. It \nis very useful for us to explore the description\
    \ and under-\nstand the variability. Statistical methods contributed for \nmaking\
    \ scientific judgments in the face of variation uncer-\ntainty. Russo et al. (2015)\
    \ Bayesian method is used to esti-\nmate the hydrological properties and irrigation\
    \ needs for \nan under-constrained mass balance model. They presented \nan approach\
    \ Markov chain Montecarlo algorithm to solve \nfor spreading of values for each\
    \ unknown parameter in a \nconceptual mass balance model [55].\n5.2  Machine Learning\n\
    From the last decade, machine learning and data analytics is \na hot-spot research\
    \ area in the domain of agriculture. Among \nthe other definitions, machine learning\
    \ is described as the \nscientific are that allows the machines to learn without\
    \ being \nstrictly programmed [56].\nMachine learning models have demonstrated\
    \ excellent \nresults for crop-based modeling in recent days. There is a \nvariety\
    \ of machine learning models based on prediction \nfor reference crop evapotranspiration.\
    \ The main contri-\nbution of our research prediction, by applying machine-\n\
    learning and data analytics based modeling to predict crop \nevapotranspiration.\n\
    Yamaç and Todorovic [57], revealed the satisfactory out-\nputs of ML with R2 ranged\
    \ from 0.81 to 0.97 [58] by apply-\ning several ML models on the climatic data.\
    \ A comparative \nanalysis was performed by Shiri et al. [59] to estimate the\
    \ \nETo using various intelligent models, namely ANN, ANFIS, \nsupport vector\
    \ machine (SVM), and GEP. In the domain \nof agriculture, big data analytic technologies\
    \ have offered \nnewly predictive models for ETo estimation, e.g. generalized\
    \ \nneuro-fuzzy models [60], artificial neural network (ANN), \n[61], adaptive\
    \ neuro-fuzzy inference system [62], multi-layer \nPerceptrons neural network\
    \ (MLPNN), Zaji and Bonakdari \n[63], extreme learning machine (ELM) Abdullah\
    \ et al. [64], \nmultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and least \n\
    square support vector regression (LSSVM) [65], GRNN \n(2016), ELM, WNN and GANN\
    \ [66]. Moreover, the Auto-\nML technique is found to show excellence in application\
    \ of \nirrigation scheduling where border irrigation and sprinkler \nirrigation\
    \ methods are deployed.\n5.3  Deep Learning\nThe deep learning technique is now\
    \ practical to address mil-\nlions or even billions of weights among neurons for\
    \ better \nunderstanding of behaviors due to current advances in com-\nputational\
    \ power, in terms of software, hardware and parallel \nprocessing. It is accepted\
    \ to have established a revolutionary \nera since it can address the issues that\
    \ have countered AI for \na long time.\nDeep feed-forward neural networks are\
    \ based on multi-\nlayer Perceptrons (MLPs) published by Alexey Ivakhnenko \n\
    and Lapa in 1965 [67]. It can be used to model the com-\nplicated relationship\
    \ between input and output due of its \nhigh hierarchical structure model training,\
    \ construction and \nfeature learning [68]. It has been used in the hydrological\
    \ \nand agricultural fields because of the difficulty of software \ndata availability,\
    \ costs, and complexity, e.g., approximation \nand modeling of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ [42], Wang et al. \n(2018) determined that traditional ML and DL models are\
    \ \nequivalent as a data-driven artificial intelligence method that \ncan be used\
    \ to model the complicated relationship between \ninput and output [68]. However,\
    \ DL has a benefit over tra-\nditional ML, due to wits high hierarchical structure\
    \ model.\n4464\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\n5.4  Big Data Analytics\nBig Data\
    \ is a fascinating new field at the joint of advanced \nanalytics, data science,\
    \ statistics, and machine learning. Big \ndata and analytics have tremendous development\
    \ benefits \nin the agriculture economy. Advanced big data analytics \nhave improved\
    \ the tools and technologies that changed the \nway of real-time applications\
    \ to make better decision pro-\ncessing, high-performance platform to efficiently\
    \ analyze, \ncapturing, storing and managing large scale of big data. In \naddition,\
    \ agriculture practices are becoming increasingly \ndata-derived and data-enabled\

    1 3\nPunjab is one of India’s largest contributors to the central \ngrain pool.\
    \ In India, ground-water (GW) is an essential \nsource of water supply in agriculture\
    \ and Rice-Wheat crop-\nping system has resulted in significant increase in irrigation\
    \ \nwater need approximately 73% with GW in Punjab. India is \na seventh largest\
    \ subcontinent country by geographical area \nin South Asia, nowadays India ranks\
    \ 2nd worldwide in farm \nproduction and 1st largest country in irrigated land\
    \ area. \nWater conservation and precision agriculture is becoming a \nvital issue\
    \ in the tropical climate areas. Central Indian Pun-\njab is a well-known for\
    \ its agriculture activities and occupied \nhigh percentage of land area in all\
    \ over India.\n6.1  A Bibliometric Perspective of Irrigation \nScheduling\nIn\
    \ this section, the articles from Science direct digital data-\nbase is considered.\
    \ Figure 8 shows the number of papers \npublished from 1995 to 2021 in field of\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning, reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspira-\n\
    tion. We have selected only elsevier science direct library \nto find out research\
    \ articles, where we found 34,083 results \nin area of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ 32,775 papers in reference \nevapotranspiration and 14,261 results articles\
    \ in crop evapo-\ntranspiration (crop water need).\nIrrigation scheduling, ETo\
    \ and ETc trends are represented \nby Green, Blue, and Yellow colored lines respectively.\
    \ Fig-\nure 8 shows the article type in which review reports, case \nreports,\
    \ data articles, mini review, and many more articles. \nFigure 8 shows the number\
    \ of top-journal publications. \nSeveral computer simulation techniques and decision\
    \ sup-\nport systems have been developed to estimate ETo , ETc and \nCrop Water\
    \ Requirement (CWR). It is important to identify \nchanges in the hydrological\
    \ cycle when we want to predict \nthe impacts of climate change. However, current\
    \ studies on \nclimate change must be expanded to cover the entire globe. \nThe\
    \ two main components of the global water cycle are \nevaporation and precipitation.\n\
    Methods for measuring evapotranspiration from meteoro-\nlogical data include a\
    \ number of climatology, and the physi-\ncal inputs which is directly estimated\
    \ in weather stations. \nOther parameters are associated with measured data and\
    \ can \nbe obtained by directly or empirical methods. Meteorologi-\ncal data can\
    \ be expressed in several units.\n6.2  Estimation and Forecasting \nof Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\nThe application of Evapotranspiration (ETo ) in irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ is divided into different categories for literature \nsection such as statistical,\
    \ machine learning, evolutionary \nmodels, and decision support system [42, 71,\
    \ 72]. We have \npresented a comprehensive review literature for reference \n\
    evapotranspiration as follows:\nFigure 9 presented the process of DSS for crop\
    \ water irri-\ngation scheduling. ETo is an imperative aspect of the hydro-\n\
    logical cycle that is stirring water availability on the earth \nsurface. It is\
    \ one of the significant criteria of accurate quan-\ntification of crop water\
    \ requirement that influence various \nhydrological processes, planing of water\
    \ management and \nresources [62], and requirement of irrigation [73]. Tradition-\n\
    ally, the ETo is estimated at the field scale, but it consumes \nlot of time and\
    \ is difficult to process by complex mathemati-\ncal calculations with various\
    \ climatic variables. Methods \nfor measuring evapotranspiration from meteorological\
    \ data \ninclude a number of climatology, and the field inputs which \nis directly\
    \ estimated in weather stations. Some parameters \nare associated with measured\
    \ data, where as others can be \nobtained directly or through empirical methods.\n\
    6.2.1  Existing Methods Based on Empirical\nSince many years, various researchers\
    \ have established \nreference evapotranspiration ETo estimation with empiri-\n\
    cal methods. There are few categories of ETo estimation \nmethods: Temperature-based,\
    \ Radiation-based, Empirical, \nPan, and many more. Commonly, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith\
    \ \nmethod is applied as the scientific, standard and temperature \nbased method\
    \ to estimate the ETo [10, 74]. FAO-PM has \nbeen extensively adopted because\
    \ to its positive outcomes \nin a variety of climates across the world. However,\
    \ it needs \na significant amount of meteorological data obtained from \nregular\
    \ meteorological observation stations [75].\nTo overcome the existing limitation\
    \ of the FAO-PM \nmodel, various attempts aiming to estimate ETo with limited\
    \ \nobserved data have been made. A large number of studies \nhave focused on\
    \ estimating ETo using empirical methods \nwith limited ground-level data such\
    \ as the Hargreaves and \nSamani equation, Priestley-Taylor equation, and Thorn-\n\
    thwaite equation have been used for estimating (ETo ) by \nTomas-Burguera et al.\
    \ [76].\nETo is estimated with simplified or empirical methods \n(e.g. Lysimetric\
    \ measurements) and it is highly difficult to \nachieve more precise and robust\
    \ approaches [77, 78]. HS \nequation is the most simple and accurate approach\
    \ based on \ntemperature [10, 31]. There are many empirical approaches \nto predict\
    \ the ETo using five mass transfer-based models \n(Ivanov, WMO, Penman, Trabert,\
    \ and Mahringer), five \nradiation-based approach (Tu, PT, Ab, JH, and Mk), and\
    \ \nfive temperature-based approach (HS, modified Hargreaves-\nSamani1 ) (Th,\
    \ BC, MHS1 , and MHS2 ) [79]. Table 4 shows \nthe literature of empirical methods\
    \ for estimation of ETo.\nMalamos et al. [80] investigated the monthly Geo-spa-\n\
    tial ETo with FAO Penman–Monteith using line, polygon, \nand point through a geometry\
    \ independent algorithm. They \n4466\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\nFig. 8  Number\

    \ to cal-\nculate the daily potential evapotranspiration ETo with FAO-\n56 Penman–Monteith\
    \ using T mean , u 2 , R H,and I s parame-\nters. The Potential ETo is estimated\
    \ for current and future \ndrought condition using PDSI tool, Spatial, and Temperature\
    \ \nbased models such as Penman–Monteith, Thornthwaite, and \nHamon methods. They\
    \ have selected T mean , u 2 , R H , I s input \nvariable, and analyzed on MATLAB\
    \ GUI [82].\nYang et al. [83] analyses the daily reference evapotranspi-\nration\
    \ (ETo ) using short-term forecasting with FAO-56 Pen-\nman–Monteith equation,\
    \ Hargreaves–Samani equation, and \nReduced-set Penman–Monteith (RPM). The R language\
    \ is \nused to simulate with various climate parameters including \nT mean , T\
    \ max , T min , u 2 , RHmean , I s , and Vapor pressure (ea).\n6.2.2  Existing\
    \ Methods Based on Machine Learning\nThere have been many studies on hybrid models\
    \ with \nmachine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to estima-\ntion of ETo\
    \ with few climate parameters around the world.\nPatil and Deka [85] investigated\
    \ the performance of \nextreme machine learning (ELM) to quantify the weekly \n\
    ETo in the Thar Desert of India. Also, they have showed \nthe comparison of Artificial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN) with \nthree input variable. The ELM model gives slightly\
    \ higher \naccuracy than empirical, and ANN models.\nWu et al. [86] proposed hybrid\
    \ model using machine \nlearning and soft-computing to estimate the monthly ETo\
    \ in \nsouth China with 26 data stations. The proposed (Kmeans-\nFFA-KELM) approach\
    \ developed with the three approaches \n(K-means clustering, Firefly Algorithms,\
    \ and Kernel \nExtreme Learning Machine model) found higher accuracy \nusing three\
    \ input variables (Temperaturemax , Temperaturemin , \nand R a ). Another study\
    \ showed performance of six remote-\nsensing based ML models to predict the daily\
    \ ETo in the \nAndalusian. The two ELM and MLP models found higher \naccuracy\
    \ than RF, SVM, GRNN, and XGBoost models [87].\nStacking and blending ensemble\
    \ based ML models are \nused to calculate the daily ETo with limited input variables.\
    \ \nTwo-layer ensemble model is build with RF, SVR, MLP, \nLR and KNN models and\
    \ found higher accuracy in terms \nof R 2 ranged from (0.66 to 0.99) as compared\
    \ to empirical \nmodels [88]. Another, ensemble based model is build with \nANN,\
    \ SVM and RF to estimate the ETo with geno-types \nand optimize the ETo with time\
    \ series data, and found the \ncorrect results [89].\nBai et al. [90] proposed\
    \ ensemble-based four ML mod-\nels with RF, BMA, KNN, SVM and MLP to calculate\
    \ the \nETo . The MLP-based ensemble model provides the efficient \nresults. However,\
    \ the ML and DL based models are proposed \nto estimate a urban ETo with Flux\
    \ Footprint, Remote Sens-\ning and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The\
    \ \nRF model provides slightly better result in terms of R 2 of \n(0.840) and\
    \ RMSE of (0.0239 mm) than CNN model [91].\nAdnan et al. [92] demonstrated the\
    \ capability of dif-\nferent Neuro-Fuzzy methods to estimate the pan evapora-\n\
    tion monthly using climatic inputs of different parameters \nobtained from Uttarakhand,\
    \ (India). Recently, Adnan et al. \n[93] demonstrated the capability of dynamic\
    \ evolving Neu-\nral-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) and Least-Square \nSupport\
    \ Vector Regression with a Gravitational Search \nAlgorithm (LSSVR-GSA) for estimating\
    \ ETo.\nIt has been shown that the extraterrestrial radiation or \ntemperature-based\
    \ LSSVR-GSA models are superior to \nFig. 9  Process of DSS for crop water irrigation\

    \ \nPruned Extreme Learning Machine (OPELM) in the Medi-\nterranean region of\
    \ Algeria. The OPELM models showed \ngood performances as compared to OSELM models.\n\
    Recently, Tikhamarine et al. [96] combined the Support \nVector Regression and\
    \ Grey Wolf Optimizer (SVR-GWO) \nto predict the monthly ETo at Annaba, Algiers,\
    \ and Tlem-\ncen stations in North Algeria. Moreover, the proposed \nmodel is\
    \ compared with the existing variants of SVR and \nshowed that the performance\
    \ of the SVR-GWO gives occa-\nsionally competitive and very promising results.\
    \ Marouf-\npoorb et al. [34] proposed the concept of hybrid Artificial \nNeural\
    \ Network-Gray Wolf Optimization (ANN-GWO) \nmodel and predicted the ETo for Iran.\n\
    Further, the proposed model showed more efficient \nand accurate results as compared\
    \ to ANN and LS-SVR. \nMohammadi and Mehdizadeh [97] proposed a hybrid of \ntwo\
    \ models Support Vector Regression and Whale Optimi-\nzation Algorithm to predict\
    \ the daily reference evapotran-\nspiration at three stations in Iran. It has\
    \ been shown that \nhybrid models outperformed the support vector regres-\nsions\
    \ models. Kisi [65] obtained weather dataset from \nTurkish Meteorological Organization\
    \ (TMO) for 2 sta-\ntions from 1982 to 2006 and applied MARS, LSSVR, and \nM5-Tree\
    \ to estimate ETo.\nValipour et al. [79] collected data for the period of \n(1961–2010)\
    \ with 50 climate parameters from 18 regions \nof Iran to estimate monthly ETo\
    \ using five models namely \n(mass transfer, radiation and temperature based).\n\

    \ presented gene \nexpression programming (GEP) and empirical models to \nestimate\
    \ ETo.\nTao [99] presented the hybrid intelligent ETo model using \ndata of three\
    \ meteorological stations during 1998 to 2012. \nThey used the Adaptive Neuron\
    \ Fuzzy Inference System \n(ANFIS), Firefly Optimization Algorithm with ANFIS\
    \ \n(ANFIS-FA) and Penman–Monteith models.\nCo-active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System\
    \ (CANFIS) \nmodel is proposed for modeling the monthly evaporation of \nLake\
    \ Nasser, Egypt [110]. The Gene Expression Program-\nming (GEP), Support Vector\
    \ Machine (SVM), Classifica-\ntion and Regression Tree (CART), the Cascade Correlation\
    \ \nNeural Network (CCNNs), and are proposed for estimating \nevaporation by Yaseen\
    \ et al. [100].\nFalamarzi et al. [101] estimated the daily ETo for water \nresources\
    \ with ANN and WNN models from the period of \n2009 to 2012. They have applied\
    \ RMSE, APE, N.S., R 2 met-\nrics to check the model accuracy with three input\
    \ parameters \nsuch as T min , T max , and u 2 . Models LS-SVM, MARS, and \nM5\
    \ models have been applied to estimate the Pan evapora-\ntion for Reservoir and\
    \ water resources management. They \nhave applied four input variable, T mean\
    \ , R s , u 2 , and R h with \ndataset of period 1986 to 2006 [102]. Another,\
    \ ANN model \nis applied to forecast the ETo for application of real-time \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling with T mean , R s , u 2 , and R h input param-\neters using dataset\
    \ of (2011 to 2012) [103].\nYassin et al. [73] analyzed the performance of ANN,\
    \ \nand GEP models to quantify the ETo with various climate \nparameters using\
    \ dataset from 1980 to 2010. The GeneX-\npro Tools 5.0, and Propagation version\
    \ 2.2.4 were used to \ndeveloped the model and also provide the accuracy on the\
    \ \nbasis of these metrics MAE, RMSE, R 2 , and OI. Gocic et al. \n[71] forecasted\
    \ the ETo using SVM, FFA, DWT, ANN, and \nGEP models with climate parameters for\
    \ the period of 1980 \nto 2010. Goyal et al. [104] explored the four ML models\
    \ \nnamely ANN, LS-SVR, FL, ANFIS, and Gamma Test to \nestimate the pan evaporation\
    \ for the duration of 2000 to \n2010. They have found the efficient results with\
    \ the FG and \nLS-SVR models using various climate parameters on MAT-\nLAB platform.\n\
    However, Chen et al. [105] found the best performance \nof Bayesian Model Averaging\

    \ ele-\nment of the hydrological system for irrigation scheduling. \nThe crop\
    \ coefficient K c method multiplied with (ETo ) is \nmost widely-used to determine\
    \ the (ETc ) Eq. (3). Different \nestimations and methods having their own advantages\
    \ and \ndisadvantages are available. For the estimation of ETc using \nMachine\
    \ Learning, Deep Learning and Evolutionary Algo-\nrithms, some potential literature\
    \ work are presented in this \nsection. The literature analysis of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ \nmethods is presented in Table 6.\n7.1  Existing Methods Based on Statistics\n\
    The need of precise estimation of crop water is an crucial \naspect of agricultural\
    \ planning and there exists several meth-\nods for determining ET in crop land\
    \ [124]. The significant \nfield based estimations are required, appropriate for\
    \ monitor-\ning the crop-water status at the land-scale level [125, 126].\nThe\
    \ FAO-Penman, PM, and 1963 Penman applied to \nforecasting the ET for rice crop\
    \ using meteorological data \nby Shah and Edling (2000). They have found the crop\
    \ coef-\nficients for initial, middle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and \n1.43\
    \ [127]. The derivation and development of crop K c were \nidentified for Castor\
    \ and Maize crops of Rajendranganagar \nby Reddy et al. [128]. Ko et al. [129]\
    \ conducted study to \nestimate the crop water requirement for Cotton and Wheat\
    \ \ncrops at Uvalde, TX, USA. Fang and Ping (2013) presented \nan optimal the\
    \ uncertainty approaches of interval regression \nanalysis and crop water production\
    \ function for irrigation \nand Penman-Monteith method used to obtain ETo . LINGO\
    \ \nsoftware introduced to solve above model [57].\n7.2  Machine Learning and Evolutionary\
    \ Models\nThe Back-propagation Neural Network (BP-NN) model is \nproposed to evaluate\
    \ the crop evapotranspiration ETc with \ncombination of various climate parameters\
    \ (Tmax , T min , \nRHmean , S h , RF and crop coefficient K c ). It is observed\
    \ that \nthe combination of Eddy Covariance method and BP model \nachieved the\
    \ best accuracy in terms of R 2 (0.87) and accu-\nracy (91.44%) than MLR model\
    \ [130]. Mehta et al. [131] \nestimated the ETo , ETc and K c of Wheat and Maize\
    \ crops \nof Gujarat using climate data. They applied the various tem-\nperature\
    \ and radiation based empirical methods to calculate \nand estimate the crop water\
    \ requirement.\nIt is observed that the accurate value of K c for Wheat crop \n\
    is more efficient as compared to FAO-56 Penman–Monteith \nmethod results. Whereas\
    \ in case of maize crop the outcomes \nwere found less accurate at Surat and higher\
    \ outcomes as \ncompared to FAO method at Bharuch station.\nSaggi et al. [41]\
    \ proposed a novel multi-layer ensemble \nmodel based on fuzzy-genetic and regularization\
    \ random \nforest (FG-RRF) for predicting the K c and ETc of Ludhiana \nstation.\
    \ They found that the models had high performance \nfor modeling K c and ETc.\n\
    Elbeltagi et al. [132] presented the deep learning model \nto estimate the Wheat\
    \ ETc from 1970-2017 and forecasting \nthe future changes from 2022-2035 of Nile\
    \ Delta in Egypt \nusing Visual Gene Developer technology. For calibration R 2\
    \ \nof 0.95, 0.96, 0.97 and for testing R 2 of 0.94, 0.95, 0.95 have \nbeen found\
    \ efficient result respectively. Russo et al. [55] pre-\nsented the MCMC and Bayesian\
    \ algorithms to analysis the \nirrigation requirements for ground water mass balance\
    \ with \nsoil tensiometer of Rice crop. They have optimized the man-\nagement\
    \ decisions on crop replacement and increased the \nirrigation efficiency. The\
    \ NN model and regression model \nare explored to estimate a greenhouse tomato\
    \ crop yield, its \ngrowth, and efficiency in use of water with CropAssist and\
    \ \nNeuralWare platforms [133]. Maurya et al. [134] developed \na novel fuzzy-based\
    \ energy-efficient routing protocol based \non automated irrigation system for\
    \ Maize crop on MAT-\nLAB platform. The FIS-DSS (Flexible Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ \nDecision Support System) is proposed to analyze the optimal \nallocation of\
    \ water resources of irrigation system. Fuzzy-\ninference and knowledge based\
    \ user-friendly optimization \ntool is developed for Wheat and corn crops [135].\
    \ Chauhan \net al. [136] proposed a web-based DSS to enhance irrigation \nwater\

    \ methods and sensors based on soil mois-\nture. Tabari et al. [138] explored\
    \ a ANFIS and SVM model \nperformance for Potato crop evapotranspiration ETc using\
    \ \nmeteorological data.\nYamaç et al. [139] applied the four scenarios based\
    \ on \nfeatures subset to accurately estimate the ETc of Potato \ncrop using ANN,\
    \ ABM and KNN models. Further, ANN \nand SVM models are also applied to estimate\
    \ the garlic ETc \nby Abyaneh et al. [140] and the outcomes are found accurate\
    \ \nas compared to lysimeter performance.\nThe need of precise estimation of crop\
    \ water is an crucial \naspect of agricultural planning and there exists several\
    \ meth-\nods for determining ET in crop land [124]. The field based \nestimations\
    \ are required and appropriate for monitoring the \ncrop-water status at the land-scale\
    \ level [125] [126].\nThe FAO-Penman and Penman methods are applied \nto forecast\
    \ the ET for rice crop using meteorological data \n[127]. They have found the\
    \ crop coefficients for initial, mid-\ndle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and 1.43.\
    \ The derivation \nand development of crop K c are identified for Castor and \n\
    Maize crops of Rajendranganagar by Reddy et al. [128]. Ko \net al. [129] conducted\
    \ a analyses report to evaluate the crop \nwater requirement for Cotton, and Wheat\
    \ crops at Uvalde, \nTX, USA. Fang and Ping [57] presented an optimal solution\
    \ \nto estimate the ETo using interval regression analysis, crop \nwater production\
    \ function and Penman-Monteith method \nwith LINGO software.\nNumerous experiments\
    \ have been conducted in recent \ndecades to investigate the possible effect of\
    \ climate change \non evapotranspiration ETc . For efficient crop evapotranspi-\n\
    ration ETc modeling using VIP (Vegetation Interface Pro-\ncesses) for Wheat and\
    \ Maize [141], durum Wheat in Tuni-\nsia [142], APSIM-Maize model [143], SEBAL\
    \ model for \nyield, WUE, IWUE and HUE for Wheat crop [144], weigh-\ning lysimeter\
    \ for K c and ETc [145], farm-level operational \nservices in smart agriculture\
    \ [146], crop water model based \non Crop2ML framework [147] have been used.\n\
    The ETc estimation results proved that the ML and EA \napproaches performed better\
    \ than existing classical methods. \nHowever, several studies have investigated\
    \ the estimation \nof ETc with empirical methods. But limited studies have \n\
    reported the estimation of ETc using ML, and EA models \nas shown in Table 6.\n\
    8  Decision Support System for Irrigation \nScheduling\nThis section considers\
    \ the Decision support system (DSS) \nbased on research that have included ETo\
    \ , ETc , and irri-\ngation requirement. An irrigation management system can \n\
    offer farmers with appropriate decision-making tools in \norder to regulate the\
    \ amount of water supplied to crops.\nA decision support system PETP V2.0.0 is\
    \ developed to \nanalysis and estimate the potential evapotranspiration ETo \n\
    using various empirical approaches namely Hargreaves, \nJensen-Haise, Penman-Monteith,\
    \ Priestley-Taylor, etc. Vis-\nual Studio 2010 software is used to build the computational\
    \ \ntool to estimate the accurate results for water requirement \nof crop [148].\n\
    Navarro et al. [149] developed smart irrigation DSS for \nmanaging the irrigation\
    \ scheduling. They purposed 2 ML \ntechniques i.e. PLSR and ANFIS. Maximum and\
    \ mini-\nmum relative humidity, temperature, and direction of wind, \nglobal radiation,\
    \ vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, dew point \nare the variables used to predict\
    \ the daily ETo with FAO \nPenman–Monteith method. Zizhong and Zenghui [150] pre-\n\
    sented a single irrigation system that enhanced higher corn \nproduction and also\
    \ provided efficiency in use of water in \nNortheast China. They include climate\
    \ parameters namely \naverage, max and min of air temperatures, max and min of\
    \ \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours from 1980 \nto 2012. Penman–Monteith\
    \ approach is used to determine \nthe soil evaporation and ETc.\nThe knowledge\
    \ of the irrigation management has an \nimpact on crop water requirements, maintaining\
    \ water bal-\nance and is the practical considerations to enhance produc-\ntivity\
    \ of crop [157]. Various research work in Punjab have \ndemonstrated the requirements\
    \ of crop water irrigation, irri-\ngation water based on ET and pan evaporation,\
    \ [158], but \nfew studies have focused on Soil Water Deficit (SWD) [159].\nParaskevopoulos\
    \ and Singels [151] investigated the inte-\ngrated content of soil water recordings\
    \ of real-time field into \nthe MyCanesim system to estimate its use in 15 sugarcane\
    \ \nfields of South Africa for supporting irrigation system. It is \nused to determine\
    \ the decision making for irrigation sched-\nuling based on the status of forecasts\
    \ of crop, soil water, \nand the next irrigation date. Ying et al. [152] represented\
    \ \nthe evaluation for summer Wheat and winter Maize crop-\nping system for optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Further, they \ndescribed topical versions of the SWAP\
    \ and Wofost models \nfor crop growing simulation and obtaining efficiency in\
    \ use \nof water.\nAfzal et al. [160] improved water resources management \nusing\
    \ different irrigation strategies and water qualities by \nfield, and modeling\
    \ study. To deficit irrigation PRD and RDI \nmethods are used to estimate the\
    \ effects of waste and fresh \nwater on salinity distribution, soil moisture,\
    \ and crop yield \nof Potato, Maize in Italy, Bologna through field experiments.\n\
    The fuzzy, evolutionary, and machine learning models \nare used to develop a DSS\
    \ model for irrigation schedul-\ning. Gaiqiang et al. [135] developed a FIS-DSS\
    \ software \nbased on knowledge, interface for user, and an inference \nengine\
    \ for wheat, corn and cotton crops. It is a fuzzy interval \n4472\n \nM. K. Saggi,\
    \ S. Jain \n1 3\nprogramming model having multiple objectives and con-\nstraints,\
    \ flexibility of model, data processing, and an alterna-\ntive solving algorithm.\
    \ The main objective is to maximize \nthe economic-based benefits for crop-land\
    \ in China. The NN \nmodel is used to train the model with precipitation and his-\n\
    torical climate parameters.\nGiusti and Marsili-Libelli [153] developed a fuzzy-DSS\
    \ \nto schedule the daily irrigation need of crop based on soil \nmoisture as\
    \ a predictive model and an inference model \nas irrigation decision maker. This\
    \ model determines the \nactual need of water for kiwi, corn, and potato crops\
    \ with \npast irrigation soil moisture, climatic parameters, and ETc . \nThey\
    \ used meteorological data including temperature, solar \nradiation, wind, rain,\
    \ etc. The objective of FDSS model is \nto reduce the water usage and provide\
    \ the efficient result in \nterms of saving water up-to 13.55, 18.3, and 72.95\
    \ water \nunits for irrigating three crops respectively. Sahoo et al. \n[161]\
    \ proposed fuzzy multi objective linear programming \napproach for planing of\
    \ land-water-crop system. The mete-\norological data like daily rainfall, evaporation,\
    \ temperature, \nsolar radiation, daily sunshine hours, humidity, wind veloc-\n\
    ity, and albedo are collected from the Central Rice Research \nInstitute, Cuttack.\
    \ The objective function is to optimize, \nmaximized crop production, net return,\
    \ and to minimize the \nlabor requirement for various vegetables and pulses.\n\
    Reddy and Kumar [162] demonstrated a multi-objective \nmethod for the optimal\
    \ crop pattern and multi-crop irriga-\ntion reservoir scheme by several procedures.\
    \ Adeyemo and \nOtieno [163] explored a method to solve the multi objective \n\
    crop planning model by an evolutionary algorithm. They \nhave found excellent\
    \ results in minimizing total water irri-\ngation, maximizing the yield productivity,\
    \ and net income \nfrom farming.\nIrrigation water management is numerically intensive\
    \ \nfor computations and provides model interpretation and \ndiscretization. Neural\
    \ networks and evolutionary algo-\nrithms demonstrated to estimate the irrigation\
    \ volume and \nalso determined the effectiveness to diminish irrigation \napplication\
    \ and maximize production [164]. Ortega Álva-\nrez et al. [154] proposed a non-linear\
    \ model to recognize \nyield schemes and water irrigation management plannings\
    \ \nusing the genetic algorithms. Further, they estimated crop \nyield, gross\
    \ margin and production as a function of irrigation \ndepth. Schmitz et al. [165]\
    \ simulated 92 percent greater pro-\nduction for corn using evolutionary algorithm\
    \ as compared \nto dynamic programming.\nApplication and web based DSS models\
    \ are developed \nfor the irrigation water scheduling by various researchers.\
    \ \nRecently, a web-based DSS is proposed to estimate the soil-\nwater balance\
    \ for irrigation system with limited input param-\neters such as (dual crop-coefficient\
    \ and meteorological). The \nirrigation parameters are computed through soil moisture\
    \ \nand requirement of water. A web-based irrigation decision \nsupport system\
    \ is introduced with limited inputs (WIDSSLI) \nfor summer corn and winter Wheat\
    \ irrigation management \nin North China Plain (NCP) [155].\nTable 7 presents\
    \ the estimation of ETo , ETc , and irriga-\ntion with DSS systems. Antonopoulou\
    \ et al. [166] presented \nan appropriate decision support system for crops which\
    \ is \nimplemented on web-based software. They introduced this \napproach by using\
    \ the Java and PHP technologies for spe-\ncific irrigation technique and soil\
    \ improvement instructions. \nDutta et al. [167] developed a mobile application\
    \ based on \nsustainable irrigation DSS. They proposed cloud sensors \nbased approach\
    \ to evaluate the ground water usage and avail-\nability of water. This approach\
    \ includes the CSIRO sensor \nbased cloud computing organization and integrated\
    \ big data \nthat includes machine learning technologies. Bonfante et al. \n[168]\
    \ proposed an irrigation water supply management tool \nto obtain the maximum\
    \ yield of Maize with W-tens, IRRI-\nSAT, and W-Mod approaches. W-Mod and IRRISAT\
    \ models \nfound more accurate results as compared to W-Tens in terms \nof irrigation\
    \ water use efficiency.\nA Climate-Smart Decision-Support System (CSDSS) \ntool\
    \ is proposed to evaluate the requirement of rice crop in \nMalaysia. They determine\

    \ proposed a SALTMED model which \nincludes the to partial root drying or deficit\
    \ irrigation, sub-\nsurface irrigation, soil nitrogen fertilizer application,\
    \ ferti-\ngation, dry matter production, plant nitrogen uptake, and \nnitrate\
    \ leaching.\nFor the model calibration and endorsement the statistical \nmeasurements\
    \ are used such as R2 coefficient, RMSE, and \npercentage error. The DIDAS software\
    \ package for irrigation \nsystem decision-making strategies of drip irrigation\
    \ systems \nis developed [46].\nA DSS framework have been introduced which includes\
    \ \n22 ETo estimation approaches using user-friendly GUI \n(Microsoft Visual Basic\
    \ 6.0) of 133 selected stations of \nIndia [170]. Potential-ETo and FAO56-PM ETo\
    \ are used to \nestimate the ETo in the Geisenheim Irrigation Scheduling \n(GS)\
    \ for vegetable crops using sprinkler irrigation [171]. \nBallesteros et al. [103]\
    \ estimated the ETo using FORETO \nsoftware with Hargreaves Samani (HS) equation\
    \ or the Pen-\nman Monteith (PM) and Artificial neural networks (ANNs) \nmodels.\
    \ Modern platforms (.NET and Java) software applied \nto calculate the daily/monthly\
    \ ETo using meteorological \nparameters [172]. There are various crop simulation\
    \ based \nmodels exists such as CropSyst [173], STICS (Brisson et al. \n1998)\
    \ [174], EPIC [175], DSSAT [176], VegSyst simulation \nmodel [177], and CERES\
    \ [178].\nA single approach, that can address all operational cir-\ncumstances\
    \ (weather information, crop growth monitoring, \nfield data, agricultural expertise\
    \ and infrastructure etc.), \nas well as the associated expenses for farmers which\
    \ may \nlimit the usage of these systems. Therefore, DSS’s for irri-\ngation scheduling\
    \ have been developed to integrating vari-\nous approaches in terms of (data collection\
    \ from meteoro-\nlogical), pre-processing techniques and modeling based on \n\
    empirical or artificial intelligence.\n9  Conclusion\nOverall agricultural systems\
    \ modeling needs to rapidly adopt \nand absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies\
    \ with \na focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating \nthose who\
    \ develop applications of their models. In spite of \nthe vast literature available,\
    \ the subject of irrigation water \nmanagement and crop water modeling for machine\
    \ learning \ntechniques are yet in its emerging phase. Although there \nis wide\
    \ literature available on statistics, machine learning, \ndecision support system\
    \ for general manifolds. To estimate \ncrop water modeling on general manifolds,\
    \ we have different \napproaches available in literature.\nMoreover, the water\
    \ balance is well-entrenched \napproach for estimating irrigation amount and time\
    \ \n(i.e. irrigation frequency) in irrigation scheduling. This \napproach is simple\
    \ to use, typically inexpensive and \nvery effective approach to estimates the\
    \ ETo , and ETc . \nThe major objective is to adopt the several approaches to\
    \ \ndevelop a flexible system that supports irrigation water \nrequirement system,\
    \ which may fit into diverse fields of \noperational activities (weather information,\
    \ field data \ncollection, crop coefficients etc.). This study provides \nan overview\
    \ of the irrigation water scheduling. It also \npresented the concept of reference\
    \ evapotranspiration \nand crop evapotranspiration for crop water modeling. It\
    \ \nalso presents the various methods of irrigation schedul-\ning. It also address\
    \ the need of decision support system \nand its various approaches that lead to\
    \ irrigation water \nmanagement.\nAcknowledgements Mandeep Kaur Saggi was supported\

    Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully entered industrial applications, including\
    \ aerospace,\nmanufacturing, and healthcare [1–3]. Smart farming, on the other\
    \ hand, which employs\nthe latest technological innovations to optimize crop production,\
    \ is revolutionizing the\nagriculture industry. As virtual replicas of physical\
    \ objects or systems, DTs represent a\nhighly promising advancement in this ﬁeld\
    \ [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable\nagriculture experts, researchers,\
    \ and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different\nstrategies, and predict\
    \ outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative\npossibilities,\
    \ revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling optimization\n\
    of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and enhancing crop\
    \ yields for\na sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural ecosystem.\nHowever, despite\
    \ the signiﬁcant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many\nquestions and\
    \ challenges still need to be addressed. Farming, a traditionally labor-intensive\n\
    sector, after its transformation to a technology-intensive sector in the last\
    \ decade, has\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167128\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n2 of 38\nbecome more complex and technologically advanced\
    \ in recent years, moving toward inno-\nvative technologies, particularly with\
    \ the explosion of precision agriculture and other digital\ntechnologies [5].\
    \ These technologies help farmers make more informed decisions about crop\nmanagement,\
    \ soil health, and various factors inﬂuencing crop yields and economic viability,\n\
    enhancing overall agricultural productivity and proﬁtability. However, these technologies\n\
    can also require specialized knowledge and skills and signiﬁcant investment in\
    \ hardware,\nsoftware, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors\
    \ such as climate change,\nchanging consumer preferences, and market ﬂuctuations\
    \ can add to the complexity of\nmodern farming. While these challenges can make\
    \ farming more complicated, they also\noffer opportunities for innovation and\
    \ growth in the agriculture domain.\nIn this era of smart farming, the incorporation\
    \ of cutting-edge technologies such\nas computing, communication, personal and\
    \ cloud computing, the Internet of Things\n(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has revolutionized\nthe landscape in agriculture.\
    \ These technologies bring additional capabilities beyond the\nphysical realm,\
    \ allowing for enhanced information and an improved understanding of\nthe physical\
    \ structures involved. The concept of DTs plays a pivotal role in providing\n\
    comprehensive and accurate information about physical systems, surpassing the\
    \ limita-\ntions of traditional modelling and simulation approaches. By leveraging\
    \ real-time data\ncollection, processing, and analysis, DTs offer a digital representation\
    \ of physical systems,\nenabling precise monitoring and forecasting of current\
    \ and future system states and re-\nbuilding existing models and re-design systems\
    \ and procedures. These advancements are\ninstrumental in transforming smart systems\
    \ and addressing the evolving challenges in the\nagricultural domain.\nThis review\
    \ paper offers a comprehensive and distinctive outline of the recent research\n\
    results regarding DTs in the context of smart agriculture, highlighting key ﬁndings\
    \ and\nidentifying areas for future research. Speciﬁcally, we report and discuss\
    \ the various types\nof digital twins used in smart farming, such as crop, weather,\
    \ and soil models, and explore\nhow they optimize crop production. We also examine\
    \ the challenges and limitations\nof deploying DTs in smart farming related to\
    \ data management, model accuracy, and\nscalability. By providing a comprehensive\
    \ review of the literature on DTs in smart farming,\nthis paper aims to advance\
    \ the understanding of this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, illustrate the\ngaps in existing\
    \ deployments, and identify opportunities for future research and innovation.\n\
    We proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementa-\n\
    tion architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the\
    \ critical\ncomponents taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation\
    \ of such im-\nplementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing\
    \ technical aspects,\nled to signiﬁcant conclusions regarding DT implementations\
    \ and related limitations that\nseem beneﬁcial to investigate. For example, although\
    \ the necessity of a DT model and\npractical implementations in agriculture is\
    \ addressed in most reviewed papers mentioning\nthe concept and deﬁnition, the\
    \ DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept lacking\nsubstantial support\
    \ from implemented case studies. While the DTs seem continuously\nevolving, authors\
    \ refer to simulation models merely as proposals for future practical im-\nplementation.\
    \ Our research seeks to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates\n\
    DTs and address the limitations of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by\
    \ mere\ntelemetry implementations.\nThe structure of this study proceeds as follows:\
    \ Section 2 delves into the concept of\nDTs and investigates their usage in the\
    \ realm of smart farming. Section 3 addresses the\nchallenges and confronting\
    \ measures regarding DT building components and relevant\ntechnologies. In Section\
    \ 4, DT applications in the agricultural domain are reviewed, while\nconclusions\
    \ and comments are unfolded in the Discussion in Section 5. Finally, in Section\
    \ 6,\nfuture directions for research and development are outlined respectively.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n3 of 38\n2. The Deﬁnition of Digital Twins\nThe fundamental\
    \ concept of a DT, which involves a connected virtual representation\nof a physical\
    \ object or system [6], appears to be relatively straightforward. However, its\n\
    application and implementation can differ significantly across various domains\
    \ and industries.\nAlthough it is quite clear that in addition to their core purpose\

    \ integration of physical and digital \ndomains. \nFigure 1. The generic representation\
    \ of a DT scheme’s dynamic integration of physical and digital domains.\nAccording\
    \ to Dyck G. et al. [9], the concept of DTs emerged from NASA’s pioneering\nwork\
    \ in integrating physical models and simulations [10,11] to analyze intricate\
    \ systems.\nOriginally conﬁned to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs expanded\
    \ to encompass\nproduct lifecycle management across diverse industries. At its\
    \ core, as initially proposed\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n4 of 38\nby Grieves & Vickers\
    \ [6,7,12], a DT comprises a physical object, its corresponding digi-\ntal representation,\
    \ and the interconnectedness between the two that it is established for\nboth\
    \ ways.\nOngoing research continues to explore the wide-ranging applications and\
    \ integration\nas interfaces of the DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing,\
    \ IoT, and Industry 4.0,\nwhere explicitly stated that the provided response is\
    \ a unique formulation based on the\ngiven information [13,14].\nHence, DTs serve\
    \ as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created using sensor\ndata and\
    \ serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or systems throughout\n\
    various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power of simulation and data\
    \ integration,\nDTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment that mirrors the\
    \ characteristics and\nbehaviour of their physical counterparts. This enables\
    \ continuous real-time monitoring,\nanalysis, and enhancement of the physical\
    \ objects or systems, resulting in enhanced perfor-\nmance, efﬁciency, and informed\
    \ decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1].\nDTs utilize actual\
    \ data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and\nsimulation\
    \ combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-\n\
    making processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities,\
    \ including\ndevices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of\
    \ the IoT has spurred\nthe advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse\
    \ domains and use cases support-\ning simulation, optimization, and prediction.\
    \ Thus, major improvement steps have been\ntaken in the realm of decision-making\
    \ so that various sectors, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, and smart cities,\
    \ have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements facilitated by di-\nverse technologies\
    \ like simulation software, IoT, and AI utilized in the ﬁeld of modelling\nand\
    \ simulation [4,13,15,16].\nTo simulate and model the physical system to succeed\
    \ in implementing the DTs, the\nuse of mathematical models is mandatory [17].\
    \ Once the observed physical phenomena of\ninterest are captured, foundational\
    \ mathematical equations are formulated to depict and\ncharacterize the dynamics\
    \ of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathemat-\nical models,\
    \ researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior\n\
    and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that\
    \ are\ndeveloped need to be validated by experimental stages on the ﬁeld or in\
    \ laboratory setups\nto verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration\
    \ soundly. Therefore,\nin advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization\
    \ of extensive datasets to establish\ndata-driven models. This approach operates\
    \ under the assumption that the data obtained\nfrom the system serves as a powerful\
    \ source of insight, offering profound revelations about\nits physical behavior.\
    \ As a result, these well-reﬁned DTs leverage the abundance of data\nto construct\
    \ accurate and thorough models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the\n\
    system’s behavior [18]. The interaction of data between the physical entity and\
    \ its digital\nrepresentation in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2.\nBy using\
    \ AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artiﬁcial neural networks, or while\nutilizing\
    \ data processing, the system’s behavior against events may be predicted. Actions\n\

    \ Adopting semantic\ntechnologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs is crucial\

    \ solution for the complex task of pro-\ncessing vast amounts of data in various\
    \ sectors, particularly in conjunction with the advent\nof the Industrial IoT\
    \ (IIoT). The IIoT, a subset of the IoT speciﬁcally designed for industrial\n\
    applications, involves deploying numerous smart devices within industrial systems\
    \ to\nenable real-time data processing after collection and sensing. Given the\
    \ nature of industrial\nenvironments, IIoT systems demand enhanced levels of secure\
    \ and robust communication\nto ensure optimal production performance [22]. IIoT\
    \ applications that connect machines,\nsensors, and actuators like data collected\
    \ from agriculture stakeholders to be combined for\neffective decision-making\
    \ and analysis of future trends occasionally produce a large volume\nof non-uniform\
    \ data that needs to be processed in real-time. IoT gateways that provide\nconnectivity\
    \ between one or more ﬁeld devices and a service cloud offer accessibility to\n\
    previously hidden data from sensors, embedded controllers and IO devices and analyze\n\
    such data for multiple purposes, such as remote monitoring, preventive maintenance,\n\
    production optimization and building automation. IoT gateways are critical to\
    \ ensure data\nsecurity and communication security within the IIoT systems. A\
    \ data breach in such IIoT\nsystems could compromise agricultural production,\
    \ i.e., crop health degradation, transport\nand product processing, leading to\
    \ inferior production performance [23].\nThe exponential growth of IIoT and its\
    \ associated technologies has signiﬁcantly con-\ntributed to the advancement of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the\nunderlying framework\
    \ for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices\nplay a vital\
    \ role in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial ele-\n\
    ment. While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to\
    \ address\noutstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full\
    \ potential and achieve\nits envisioned advantages.\nCDT systems integrate data\
    \ from different stakeholders as they combine several\nparameters, mainly concerning\
    \ immense amounts of data sharing, demanding measures\nto ensure security, privacy,\
    \ and protection of intellectual property (IP) concerning data.\nCDTs incorporate\
    \ cybersecurity infrastructure and employ data encryption mechanisms\nto address\
    \ these critical aspects effectively. These measures are implemented to regulate\n\
    transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection of intellectual property (IP), and\
    \ facilitate\nintegrated development processes [8,24].\nSimilarly, the notion\
    \ of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation of an enter-\nprise, encompassing\
    \ its resources, processes, workforce, locations, and systems to support\nstrategic\
    \ decision-making from the systems used for reporting operational data within\
    \ the\norganization, such as accounting, personnel planning, and sales [25]. This\
    \ type of DT which\nretrieves real-time data from the systems used for reporting\
    \ operational data within an\norganization, as mentioned earlier, is referred\
    \ to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the\nindustrial DT that gathers information\
    \ from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization\ntool that allows managers\
    \ to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time\nconstraints.\
    \ By simulating different strategic options through computer models, managers\n\
    can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches in the\
    \ real world.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n7 of 38\n2.2. DTs in Agriculture\nAs stated\
    \ above, the implementation of DTs seems to extend to various ﬁelds vastly.\n\
    The objective of this review is to illuminate the ﬁeld of agriculture in the following\
    \ manner.\nA DT for agriculture, in particular, may be addressed as a virtual\
    \ model of a physical\nfarm or agricultural operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies like sensors,\nIoT devices, and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize\
    \ the DT to simulate and enhance\ntheir farming methods within a virtual setting,\
    \ enabling them to reﬁne their practices before\napplying them in reality [26,27].\
    \ Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth report on DTs\nin agriculture,\
    \ encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the key value-added features\nof\
    \ DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight the capacity of DT usage\
    \ in\nagriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances, capturing, and interpreting\
    \ data,\nautonomously managing system actuators in the ﬁeld, and delivering customized\
    \ services\nto individuals, such as reports and transparent information. The DT\
    \ enables capturing\nreal-time data on crop growth rates, weather conditions,\
    \ ambient temperatures, and even\nsoil moisture levels as various environmental\
    \ and operational factors. A dynamic model of\nthe farm may be created by using\
    \ this data to test different scenarios and optimize various\naspects of the farming\
    \ operation, including crop yields, resource utilization, and overall efﬁ-\nciency.\
    \ By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their farming practices\
    \ impact\nthe environment and identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.\
    \ They can\nalso use the DT to test new technologies and techniques, such as precision\
    \ agriculture and\nautomation, before investing in them for their physical operation.\

    \ with the use of Digital\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) tools,\
    \ referring to agricultural pieces of\nmachinery, such as tractors, combined harvesters,\
    \ fertilizers, and sprayers.\nAccording to Dyck G et al. [9], the DTs seem to\
    \ ﬁnd their way in post-harvest processes,\nencompassing the various stages involved\
    \ in handling agricultural products after harvest-\ning. These products must be\
    \ dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing\nprocedures. Digital\

    \ losses, optimizing food processing, improving storage conditions, stream-\n\
    lining transportation, and enhancing marketing efﬁciency. These strategies facilitate\
    \ the\nlive tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading to increased\
    \ robustness,\nresilience and reduced food waste and losses.\nIoT technology following\

    extensive real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing\
    \ a sensor\ndata processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves\
    \ preliminary data\nprocessing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting\
    \ in reporting and pre-\ndicting the emotional states of cattle based on their\

    \ blood sampling or surveys, for assessing the\nemotional states of livestock\
    \ usually cause interruptions to farming processes while being\ntime-consuming,\
    \ and farm animals frequently experience fear, frustration, and distress. AI\n\
    technologies facilitate the recognition of cattle states, empowering animal caregivers\
    \ and\nethologists to understand animal behavior and optimize their well-being\
    \ and productivity.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n9 of 38\nDTs may support decision-making\
    \ and farm management optimization by simulating\ndifferent scenarios regarding\
    \ environmental conditions or genetic factors on animal perfor-\nmance and production\
    \ outcomes while improving production efﬁciency and minimizing\nenvironmental\
    \ impacts. Furthermore, connections with other digital platforms, such as\nfarm\
    \ management systems, supply chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing\
    \ for\nseamless data sharing and analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing\
    \ traceability, quality\nassurance, and decision-making throughout the value chain.\n\
    In summary, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize animal farming by\n\
    providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and decision support. They\
    \ can\noptimize animal health, welfare, and production efﬁciency while promoting\
    \ sustainable\nfarming practices. Continued research and development in this area\
    \ will be crucial to fully\nharness the beneﬁts of DTs in animal farming and address\
    \ the associated challenges.\nAn Aquaculture 4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based\
    \ intelligent ﬁsh farm man-\nagement system for precision aquaculture is discussed\
    \ in [34], addressing the design\nconsiderations, data integration, analytics,\
    \ and control mechanisms to optimize ﬁsh farm\noperations. The proposed implementation\
    \ utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing\nML realizations, computer vision,\
    \ and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT) to\nmonitor and control automated\
    \ aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production\nin various environments\
    \ throughout the different stages of ﬁsh farming, the system aims\nto maximize\
    \ efﬁciency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in ﬁshponds to\n\
    monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea cages, and\
    \ RGB or sonar\ncamera devices may collect environmental data and data related\
    \ to ﬁsh populations to es-\ntablish data-driven prediction models. On the other\
    \ hand, land-based monitoring systems\nsend appropriate commands to activate surveillance\
    \ sensors, thus enabling ﬁsh-feeding\nbehavior monitoring, disease spread, and\
    \ ﬁsh population growth.\nFurthermore, DTs address optimization solutions regarding\
    \ water ﬂow and treatment\nprocesses related to water quality reduction following\
    \ ﬂoods and stormwater within trans-\nboundary water security projects due to\
    \ urban expansion [17]. DT models are employed\nto monitor the quality of urban\
    \ water by integrating physical entities and utilizing sen-\nsors in urban drainage\
    \ systems. The models consider natural processes related to soil,\nvegetation,\
    \ clogging, and biological activity in water treatment. This approach enables\n\
    comprehensive monitoring and analysis of urban water systems for effective management\n\
    and maintenance.\n3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components\nAlthough\

    \ modelling,\nsimulation, analytics, decision support, visualization, and control,\
    \ ultimately aiding in\noptimizing farm operations and improving decision-making\
    \ processes.\nFurthermore, the interconnections among these entities play a vital\
    \ role as they are\nessential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated\
    \ manner, as emphasized by\nPedersen et al. in their research [17].\n3.1. Technologies\
    \ Involved in DTs\nTherefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several\
    \ deﬁning keys that have\nemerged along with key technologies [1] from various\
    \ domains, industries, and scientiﬁc\ndisciplines that pose a decisive entity,\
    \ such as the following.\n3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality\nDTs rely\
    \ on Augmented (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As\nan\
    \ example, they can be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented\n\
    as holograms or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft\n\
    HoloLens. Using sensors installed in the ﬁeld, their real-time digital twin can\
    \ be generated\nand projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables\
    \ individuals in different\nlocations to engage in interactions that simulate\
    \ being physically present in the same space.\nCommunication enhancement in digital\
    \ twins is derived by integrating tactile feedback,\nsimulating the sensation\
    \ of physical interaction via haptics. Furthermore, DTs can leverage\nhumanoid\
    \ and soft robotics technologies to enable physical actions on behalf of their\
    \ real-\nlife counterparts. This means digital twins can physically engage with\
    \ the environment\nor perform tasks, utilizing robotic systems that mimic human-like\
    \ or ﬂexible movements.\nThese advancements in augmented, virtual, mixed reality,\
    \ haptics, and robotics greatly en-\nhance the capabilities of digital twins,\
    \ enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations,\nand physical engagement,\
    \ expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration.\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n11 of 38\n3.1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ integration into physical assets that lack it inherently is a\nkey advantage\
    \ of DTs. This introduces a specialized intelligence capable of efﬁciently com-\n\
    prehending vast amounts of numerical data and deriving domain-speciﬁc insights\
    \ faster\nthan human experts. Consequently, the data obtained from the digital\
    \ twin’s surroundings\nand physical counterpart should lead to valuable and actionable\
    \ conclusions [36]. As an\nemerging technology, AI empowers computers to exhibit\
    \ intelligent behaviors, including\nbehavioral learning. By amalgamating various\
    \ technologies, including AI, to create twin\nmodels of physical objects, it becomes\
    \ feasible to generate virtual representations that\nclosely resemble the original\
    \ objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive\ninformation [37].\
    \ As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize ontologies, ML,\n\
    and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift and intelligent\
    \ decision-\nmaking on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover, AI signiﬁcantly\
    \ processes IoT\ndata through continuously enhanced algorithms that leverage updated\
    \ user data. Leverag-\ning such time-series data, a user’s DT has the potential\
    \ to suggest actions for controlling or\nmitigating potentially hazardous situations\
    \ regarding crop health and productivity, in cases\nsuch as droughts to direct\
    \ asses irrigation efﬁciency or even failures of safety mechanisms\nof farm machinery,\
    \ plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage\nequipment\
    \ situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders or even\
    \ take\nimmediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction of\
    \ crop production [29].\n3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes\nDTs rely\
    \ on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the\n\
    environment, their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is\
    \ particularly\nsigniﬁcant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication\
    \ must occa-\nsionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating\
    \ compliance with 5G and\ntactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and\
    \ safety-critical schemes, coupled with\nthe need for stringent communication\
    \ standards, lead to a growing demand for repeatable\nand cost-effective veriﬁcation\
    \ procedures. Data transmission within a speciﬁc time window\nbecomes crucial\
    \ for time-sensitive and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency\n\
    limitations in addition to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs\
    \ outline\nbasic wireless communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations.\n\
    (a)\nRFID technology offers fast and accurate object identiﬁcation using sensor\
    \ tags, reader\nantennas, and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit,\
    \ and a substrate utilize\na tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading\
    \ or writing. The reader antennas\ncommunicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating\
    \ data transfer to the database\nsystem. This technology ﬁnds extensive applications\
    \ in storage and inventory man-\nagement, supply chain monitoring, access control,\
    \ aviation transportation, agriculture,\nhealthcare, and more, improving efﬁciency\
    \ and automation in various ﬁelds [39].\n(b)\nWireless Networks, in particular,\
    \ suggest an immense role in sending data from\na source to a connected gateway,\
    \ a role supported by a variety of wireless net-\nwork technologies such as WPAN,\
    \ WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are addressed\nin [18,39–47]. The existing commercial\
    \ 4G or 5G LTE communication networks, utiliz-\ning the transmission of data packets\
    \ through the well-established Internet Protocol\n(IP), serves as a base to sustain\
    \ the architecture of wireless communication networks\nin general.\ni\nWireless\
    \ Personal Area Networks (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate\nwith less\
    \ extensive infrastructure. They are designed to function within a\nlimited range,\
    \ typically within a single room or a small area. Unlike traditional\nnetworks\
    \ that rely on cables, WPANs enable the wireless connectivity of de-\nvices nearby,\
    \ facilitating the connection of devices like wireless keyboards or\nmice to computers\
    \ and supporting printing services. The most common WPAN\ntechnologies include\
    \ Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean, NFC, and\nRFID, each employing different\
    \ techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN [40].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n12 of\
    \ 38\nBluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within\
    \ a\nlimited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used\
    \ in a\nwide variety of devices [41].\nii\nWireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)\
    \ are wireless networks that allow de-\nvices to connect and communicate over\
    \ a local area without the need for\nphysical cables within a speciﬁc coverage\
    \ area, such as a home, ofﬁce, or public\nspace. These networks utilize the widely\
    \ recognized IEEE 802.11 standard,\ncommonly known as Wi-Fi, to enable devices\
    \ like smartphones, laptops, and\ntablets to enable wireless interconnection between\
    \ them and connection to\nthe internet. The Wi-Fi—802.11 wireless network, introduced\
    \ in 1997, using\nthe 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting up to 2 Mbps data\
    \ transmission\nrates, evolved to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4\
    \ GHz and 5 GHz\nbands, achieving a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple\
    \ users, with\na minimum of 500 Mbps. WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs,\
    \ span-\nning multiple rooms or entire buildings, making them suitable for larger-scale\n\
    wireless networking requirements. They provide convenient and ﬂexible con-\nnectivity\
    \ for various devices and applications, including internet access, ﬁle\nsharing,\
    \ video streaming, and more.\niii\nWireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) provide\
    \ wireless connectivity on\na larger scale, spanning cities, regions, or even\
    \ entire countries. WWAN\ntechnologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\
    \ 5G, and the evolving\n6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support\
    \ a wide range of\nservices, including voice communication, video streaming, and\
    \ data transfer.\nThese networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly\
    \ used for\nmobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected\
    \ while\non the go.\niv\nLow Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network\
    \ technologies\nideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage,\
    \ and low cost.\nUnlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily\
    \ designed\nfor high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs\
    \ target\nenergy efﬁciency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity\
    \ in\nindustrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,\n\
    covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense\nurban\
    \ areas. Their main advantages include energy efﬁciency, a battery life\nexceeding\
    \ ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that\nrequire small-scale\
    \ data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have\nbeen developed and\
    \ deployed in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands,\nsuch as Long-Range\
    \ (LoRa), Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), each employing\ndifferent techniques to achieve\
    \ the goals of LPWAN [49].\n•\nLoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology\
    \ for low-bandwidth\nIoT applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption\
    \ ser-\nvices. It uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-\n\
    range and low power consumption, operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz\nISM band\
    \ available worldwide [50].\n•\nNB-IoT is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting\
    \ various devices\nand services through cellular networks. It operates in a narrow\
    \ band-\nwidth of 180 kHz, providing extensive network coverage and low latency.\n\
    Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes\n\
    LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE infrastructure. Coex-\nisting\
    \ with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efﬁcient connectivity and\nleverages\
    \ compatible technologies for seamless integration [51].\nThe main technical features\

    \ application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth\ntechnology can be used,\
    \ as mentioned in the article [44], but it has signiﬁcantly higher\npower consumption\
    \ compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x and\n200 m for\
    \ Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identiﬁcation and detection,\
    \ such\nas products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations, RFID\
    \ technology is a\nsuitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications\
    \ that require a high data rate\nand need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision\
    \ of electrical power is necessary. Finally,\nonce DTs rely on data exchange,\
    \ real-time monitoring, and interaction with their physical\ncounterparts, wireless\
    \ networks provide a ﬂexible and efﬁcient means of communication\nfor these purposes\
    \ [8].\n3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility\nReliability, integrity,\
    \ and credibility are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive\ntasks involving\
    \ transaction management with their real counterparts. It becomes imper-\native\
    \ for the real twin to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities\
    \ and\nactions. Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin\
    \ and the DT is\ncrucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable\
    \ decision-making, and ensuring\nsecure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation\
    \ of trust becomes indispensable\nfor the successful operation and advancement\
    \ of DT-enabled systems [52]. Therefore,\nprivacy and security arise as paramount\
    \ considerations in the realm of DTs. To enable the\nconﬁdentiality and privacy\
    \ of their real twins, DTs should implement robust measures for\nidentity protection.\
    \ This can be achieved using dedicated cryptography algorithms and\nadvanced biometric\
    \ techniques such as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these\ntechniques,\
    \ the identity and privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded.\n\
    In addition to identity protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security,\
    \ and privacy.\nMeasures should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and\
    \ interception of data across\nthe network. Unauthorized users should be promptly\
    \ detected and repelled to prevent any\ncompromise of data integrity or security.\
    \ To ensure the authenticity and reliability of data\nsources, rigorous measures\
    \ for data authentication should be implemented before integrat-\ning the data\
    \ into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate comprehensive privacy\n\
    and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s identity, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ and\nintegrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms, employing biometric\
    \ techniques,\nand implementing strict data authentication protocols, DTs can\
    \ effectively address privacy\nand security concerns, fostering a trustworthy\
    \ and secure environment for the real twins\nand their digital counterparts.\n\
    3.1.5. Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain\nIn recent times, Distributed\
    \ Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53],\nhave emerged to add\
    \ to user authentication and data integrity regarding data sharing. To\nunlock\
    \ its full potential and achieve its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding\n\
    concerns surrounding the technology is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized\
    \ approach\nthat eliminates the need for a central authority or database, distinguishing\
    \ it from traditional\ndata-sharing methods. The distributed nature of this system\
    \ allows for the secure sharing\nof data in a trustless environment. The signiﬁcance\
    \ of DLT has garnered considerable\ninterest from researchers and practitioners\
    \ alike. Various systems and platforms based\non Distributed Ledger Technology\
    \ (DLT), such as private ledgers, public ledgers, and\npermissioned ledgers, have\
    \ been created to address diverse use cases and speciﬁc needs [54].\nProposed\
    \ technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI, DT, and DLT have been put\nforward\
    \ to address the monitoring and tracking of products within the realm of food\n\
    supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected data to facilitate decision-making\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n15 of 38\nprocesses [55]. Given the numerous advantages\
    \ associated with DLT, it presents itself as a\npromising technology that can\
    \ signiﬁcantly contribute to achieving the vision of CDT.\nBlockchain technologies,\
    \ in particular, seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating\nusers, storing\
    \ data records, and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and\n\
    decentralized system of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions.\n\
    It allows transactions to be recorded in a veriﬁable manner without intermediaries.\
    \ Each\npreceding block’s hash is included in the next block and is generated\
    \ through a distributed\nconsensus algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain\
    \ ensures data integrity\nand prevents tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain\
    \ scheme, provides an alternative\nprotocol for decentralized applications that,\
    \ unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin, is\nnot just a payment network but\
    \ also allows for the creation and use of smart contracts.\nIt uses its digital\
    \ currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete programming lan-\nguage\
    \ (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces of code stored on\
    \ the\nblockchain that enables decentralized transactions without a trusted central\
    \ authority are\ncalled Smart contracts [57].\nOn the other hand, the Helium Blockchain\
    \ is referred to as the major public decen-\ntralized LoRaWAN network in the world,\
    \ that enables devices anywhere in the world\nto wirelessly connect to the internet\
    \ and have a speciﬁc geographical placement without\nthe need for energy-consuming\
    \ satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].\nHelium offers low\
    \ transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures end-to-end\nencryption,\
    \ which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.\nThe use of blockchain,\
    \ such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for\nsmart agriculture\
    \ applications has the following advantages:\n•\nTransparency and trust: Blockchain\
    \ provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof\ndistributed ledger, allowing\
    \ all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can\nhelp build trust\
    \ among different entities in the agricultural supply chain and prevent\nfraud\
    \ or unauthorized interventions.\n•\nBlockchain enhances Data security [59] as\
    \ it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This\nis crucial for safeguarding\
    \ sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as\ndata on plant health,\
    \ soil quality, and food production.\n•\nAutomation and smart contracts on the\
    \ blockchain enable programmable automatic\nexecution of conditions and actions\
    \ based on speciﬁc information, events, and opera-\ntions such as automated irrigation,\
    \ temperature control, and plant health monitoring\nin smart agriculture.\n•\n\
    The distributed architecture of blockchain ensures that information is stored\
    \ and\nveriﬁed by multiple nodes in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity\
    \ of\ndata and reducing dependency on a central authority.\n3.1.6. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing presents a valuable opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability\n\
    and availability, assisting their real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging\
    \ cloud\ncomputing infrastructures, computation and control tasks can be ofﬂoaded\
    \ from the local\nenvironment to remote servers, enabling DTs to handle complex\
    \ processes and ensure\nseamless availability efﬁciently. The scalability of DTs\
    \ is signiﬁcantly improved through\ncloud computing, as the computational resources\
    \ can be dynamically allocated and scaled\nbased on demand. This allows DTs to\
    \ handle larger datasets, called Big Data sets (BD), per-\nform sophisticated\
    \ analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without local hardware\nlimitations.\
    \ As the DT model involves the creation and management of virtual replicas that\n\
    closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires extensive data acquisition,\
    \ storage,\nand processing capabilities for collecting and analyzing a massive\
    \ volume of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, IoT devices, and other\
    \ data-generating components [7],\nfacts that necessitate cloud computing. The\
    \ elastic nature of cloud computing ensures\nthat DTs can adapt to varying workloads\
    \ and seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in\ncomputational requirements.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n16 of 38\nFurthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of\
    \ ubiquitous accessibility by using\nopen-source communication platforms, such\
    \ as OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (UA) commu-\nnication protocol and frameworks, for\
    \ data exchange from sensors to cloud applications\nused in DTs. Real twins can\
    \ access and interact with their DTs from any location and at any\ntime, provided\
    \ an active internet connection is in place. This fosters a ﬂexible and versatile\n\
    environment where real twins can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless\
    \ of their\nphysical location.\n3.1.7. Internet of Things\nInternet of Things\
    \ (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet (TI) entity meanings have\nemerged as\
    \ groundbreaking technologies, ushering in a new era of communication with\ntheir\
    \ focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency. This shift in communication\n\
    paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented is especially signiﬁcant for\
    \ applica-\ntions that involve human-in-the-loop interactions, demanding minimal\
    \ delays and seamless\nintegration of communication and control mechanisms as\
    \ demanded in DT infrastructure.\nWithin this context, DTs play a pivotal role\
    \ by establishing a continuously operational twin\nfeedback loop, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This\nseamless real-time feedback\
    \ communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor,\nanalyze, and adapt to\
    \ the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a\nresult,\
    \ precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the\nphysical systems’ overall service quality and performance.\nThrough the\
    \ IoT, users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while\nreceiving\
    \ feedback that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment,\n\
    both locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required\
    \ to\ntransmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity\
    \ to the data entity,\nenabling seamless connectivity and communication between\
    \ connected devices [17], as\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128 \n17\

    \ entities over an IoT platform overview. \nThe capabilities of DTs are enhanced\
    \ by contextual data, and the IoT serves as a pow-\nerful conduit for feeding\
    \ such data from users to their DTs and vice versa. This exchange \nof information\
    \ enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, whether in \n\
    close proximity or at remote locations. Additionally, digital twins can provide\
    \ valuable \nfeedback to the environment, further enriching the user experience\
    \ and enabling a more \nintegrated and interconnected ecosystem.  \n3.1.8. Modelling\

    \ and Simulation Software\nA DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i)\
    \ an object model, in conjunction\nwith (ii) an expansive set of data that is\
    \ directly following the object that may evolve,\nand ﬁnally, (iii) a method for\
    \ modifying and reﬁning the model based on the available\ndata [17,62]. The experts\
    \ decide the need and selection of the training, validation and\nveriﬁcation data\
    \ concerning speciﬁc case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant\n\
    height, regarding the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data\
    \ processing\ndepends on speciﬁc plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated\
    \ sensors, ML and\nDL applicable methods and big data analytics software.\nOne\
    \ of the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately\n\
    depict objects or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of\
    \ dynamic\nand evolving data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend\
    \ the application\nof a validated model across timescales during which the object\
    \ and its behavior undergo\nsigniﬁcant variations. A validated model may offer\
    \ an instant representation of an object’s\nbehavior at a speciﬁc moment, thus\
    \ highlighting the importance of associating the DT with\na corresponding physical\
    \ counterpart and the signiﬁcance of choosing a model according\nto the speciﬁc\
    \ implementation.\nWithout a physical twin, the DT would be considered nothing\
    \ more than a model.\nFurthermore, the availability of a comprehensive and up-to-date\
    \ dataset plays a crucial\nrole in accurately capturing the object’s changes over\
    \ time and ensuring the model is\nadjusted and updated to reﬂect the current system\
    \ conditions. Any model approximating\nthe physical twinned can be used for DTs\
    \ that utilize physics-based models encompassing\nall relevant processes that\
    \ can inﬂuence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario with\ninstantaneous\
    \ computing and ﬂawless accuracy, these models would accurately simulate\nand\
    \ update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time operations.\
    \ For\ninstance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of metal, considering\
    \ factors\nlike temperature and part shape, and dynamically update information\
    \ about tool wear\nbased on real-time measurements. This enables proactive and\
    \ effective industrial plant\nfacilities maintenance, enhancing overall efﬁciency\
    \ [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant\nin agriculture, a digital model\
    \ could represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions that are changing over time.\nAccording to researchers, a categorization\
    \ standard centered around the degree of\ndata fusion and integration between\
    \ the PO and its virtual representation can be used as\nan indicator to deﬁne\
    \ and delimit the scope of the proposed concept. Given that this term\nwas initially\
    \ created for the manufacturing industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating\n\
    agricultural DTs’ development, convergences, and divergences compared to contemporary\n\
    deﬁnitions. Thus, three integration levels represent the digital twin’s ﬁeld.\
    \ First is the\nDigital Model (DM), second is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third\
    \ is the DT. The DM is a\ndepiction of the entity in a digital format without\
    \ the use of an automated data transfer\nsystem. It is equivalent to a Digital\
    \ Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible\nintegration level. The DS\
    \ refers to a digital representation that enables the automatic\nexchange of information\
    \ from the physical entity to its virtual object, reﬂecting changes\nin the entity’s\
    \ state. This one-way information ﬂow is like a DT model, which in contrast,\n\
    involves an automated bi-directional ﬂow of digital information. Like the DS,\
    \ the DT has a\nvirtual representation whose alterations are reﬂected in the physical\
    \ entity’s state. However,\nwhat sets the DT apart is its capacity to impact the\
    \ condition of the physical entity as well,\nalthough the speciﬁc means of inﬂuence\
    \ depend on the type of entity and its context [63].\nIn summary, a DM represents\
    \ a physical system in a digital format but lacks auto-\nmated data exchange.\
    \ A DS involves a one-way automated data ﬂow reaching the digital\ncounterpart\
    \ originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless and\n\
    fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of the\
    \ physical\nsystem and the physical system itself.\nDeﬁning the objectives of\
    \ the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model\nfor an integrated\
    \ process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n18 of 38\nessential, as diverse objectives can provide different\
    \ levels of complexity in representing\nthe actual procedure. For this reason,\
    \ it is crucial to identify the goal of the model before the\nbuild [64]. Therefore,\
    \ complex systems like an agriculture model should be ﬁrst designed\nand objectively\
    \ deﬁned so their DT model is accurate. Spreadsheet software such as\nMicrosoft\
    \ Excel is commonly employed for process calculations and analyses. This is\n\
    due to its widespread availability and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and other\nprofessionals. In contrast, the concept of DTs is somehow new and\
    \ still emerging. The\nspreadsheet’s cells allow users to enter data, make computations,\
    \ and produce results\nwhile they can plot data from them in several graphs. Software\
    \ programs like process\nsimulators allow users to describe and analyze integrated\
    \ processes. The purpose of\nthese tools is to simulate continuous processes and\
    \ their transient behavior. The scientiﬁc\nliterature concerning process simulation\
    \ tools is continuously growing, encompassing\nvarious areas such as techno-economic\
    \ analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural\nprocess enhancements, and\
    \ the exploration of alternative processes to existing ones [64].\nGiven that\
    \ a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature, never being an\n\
    exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation of it, and different\
    \ objectives\nmay produce various modelling abstractions with varying levels of\
    \ detail concerning the\nactual process. It is crucial to identify the goal of\
    \ the model before we develop it.\nSince cloud computing has many beneﬁts, it\
    \ is the most practical method for introduc-\ning DT services. Due to its ability\
    \ to provide on-demand services, computational resources,\nand ubiquitous network\
    \ access, the implementation of the next-generation information\ntechnology architecture\
    \ is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments,\ndata owners\
    \ generate data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in\
    \ a\nvirtual environment, and subsequently share the insights and ﬁndings of the\
    \ simulation\nwith the data owner. Users can request access to the data at any\
    \ time [59]. In construct-\ning complex DT production systems, like industrial\
    \ or agricultural systems, “machine\nlearning” and “simulation tools” are two\
    \ complementary technologies. Creating stochastic\nsimulations for complicated\
    \ systems takes time and effort. However, these simulations\nare essential for\
    \ DT construction because they have two crucial capabilities. The ﬁrst is\n“uncertainty\
    \ modelling” and the second is “explainable analytics”. Focusing on how ML\nand\
    \ reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation, many issues arise in digital\
    \ twin use\ncases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing\
    \ technologies\nhas signiﬁcantly accelerated the progress of digital twins. It\
    \ is widely believed that digital\ntwins will soon become a vital catalyst for\
    \ digital transformation, as evidenced by the com-\nmon theme present in various\
    \ research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing\na secure, reliable\
    \ method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally, there is a\nneed\
    \ for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages the beneﬁts\
    \ of\nblockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned earlier.\n\
    3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations\nIn the realm of digital twins,\
    \ components denote the distinct constituents or elements\nthat constitute a digital\
    \ twin system. A representative ensemble follows.\n3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators\n\
    DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great signiﬁcance that offer valuable\n\
    data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory\n\
    capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and\
    \ actuators\nare deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products\
    \ to industrial set-\ntings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors\
    \ capture critical information\nrelated to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure,\
    \ chemical components, and material\ncomposition, forming the foundation for digital\
    \ twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real\ntwins (physical entities) with sensors,\
    \ DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight,\ntemperature, sound, humidity,\
    \ and touch through appropriate actuators. For example,\nin the agricultural domain,\
    \ a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 7128\n19 of 38\nmaintenance services or simulate and optimize the production\
    \ process. This allows for the\ngeneration of actionable insights and the enhancement\
    \ of operational efﬁciency. DTs rely on\nthe integration of actuator and sensor\
    \ technologies to gather continuous and accurate data.\nThe representation of\
    \ a physical asset in digital forms, like a sensor-equipped machine,\nrelies on\
    \ the synchronized operation of virtual sensors and actuators. These software-based\n\
    counterparts replicate the functionalities of physical sensors and actuators,\
    \ aggregating\ndata from multiple sources. Integrating sensors and actuators within\
    \ the digital twin\nframework enables real-time monitoring, data-driven analytics,\
    \ and the ability to simulate\nvarious scenarios for optimization purposes. By\
    \ bridging the physical and digital realms,\ndigital twins empower industries\
    \ and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased\nefﬁciency, and cost\
    \ savings.\n3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of Entities\nIn the context of DTs, each twin\
    \ is assigned a distinct identiﬁer that facilitates seamless\ncommunication with\
    \ its physical counterpart. This unique identiﬁer encapsulates vital\ninformation\
    \ about the physical object’s structure, capabilities, and technical speciﬁcations,\n\
    as well as its expected performance under speciﬁc conditions. When creating a\
    \ DT, it is\ncrucial to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure\
    \ an accurate represen-\ntation [67]. Even if two physical items are identical,\
    \ they may exhibit different behaviors\nwhen subjected to varying conditions.\
    \ Hence, each digital twin is assigned its unique iden-\ntiﬁer, reﬂecting the\
    \ individual characteristics and attributes of the corresponding physical\nobject.\
    \ By leveraging the DT’s unique identiﬁer, we can accurately simulate and analyze\
    \ its\nproperties and behaviours.\nFurthermore, the expansive network of interconnected\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators\nhighlights the need for real-time collection\
    \ and sharing of identiﬁed contextual data with\ndigital twins. This data encompasses\
    \ various parameters such as location, environmen-\ntal conditions, user preferences,\
    \ and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely\nidentiﬁed contextual\
    \ data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s context\nand needs\
    \ can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information System\n(GIS)\
    \ as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various data types\
    \ and\nlinks IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information, referred\
    \ to as spatial\ndata, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis for\
    \ mapping and analysis utilized\nacross multiple industries and scientiﬁc ﬁelds.\
    \ With GIS, users gain insights into patterns,\nrelationships, and the geographical\
    \ context of their data, as in [68].\n3.2.3. Visualization and Representation\n\
    Visualization and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms\n\
    of virtual representation depending on the speciﬁc application. DTs can leverage\
    \ 3D\nvisualizations to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending\
    \ on the context,\nthese connections can manifest in various forms, such as a\
    \ 3D representation, hologram,\nhumanoid social robot, or purely as software components\
    \ without physical attendance.\nConsequently, DT commonly refers to the digital\
    \ depiction of a real-world object, system, or\nentity’s physical twin that faithfully\
    \ replicates a unique item, process, person, organization,\nor even a legendary\
    \ narrative. Composite digital twins are formed when multiple digital\ntwins merge.\
    \ These DTs, as reﬂections of the actual world, share similar characteristics,\n\
    necessitating the modelling of digital processes and objects with composition,\
    \ ﬂexibility,\nsensing, collaboration, and simulation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ predictions suggest that\nfuture DTs will evolve toward a holistic virtual world\
    \ [70].\n3.2.4. Devices\nDevices that continuously capture data concerning physiological\
    \ and environmental\nfactors information can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the real\ntwin’s well-being and lifestyle. Such wearable devices,\
    \ for example, smartwatches, ﬁtness\ntrackers, and other health monitoring devices\
    \ have enabled individuals to collect and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n20 of 38\n\
    track various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data\
    \ presents\na unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for\
    \ their real twins more\nefﬁciently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables\
    \ into the DT model, real-time\ninsights and personalized recommendations can\
    \ be generated as feedback or alerts based on\nspeciﬁc needs and goals. Furthermore,\
    \ the continuous monitoring and analysis of wearable\ndata by DTs enable proactive\
    \ interventions whilst identifying patterns or deviations from\nnormal physiological\
    \ parameters and providing early warnings or interventions to address\npotential\
    \ health risks or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute\
    \ to\npreventive healthcare, early detection of health issues, and overall well-being\
    \ management.\nIn summary, the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates\
    \ 3D ani-\nmation, modelling, IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables\
    \ the seamless con-\nnection and management of physical and virtual models within\
    \ a digital environment [72].\nAs human civilization grows, agriculture remains\
    \ crucial for our progress and well-being.\nIntelligent DT systems can analyze\
    \ and digitize agricultural areas, enabling macro and\nmicro-level visual processes.\
    \ These systems can provide intelligent recommendations and\nsuggestions that\
    \ can be implemented to achieve multiple beneﬁts in agriculture.\n4. Reviewing\

    \ address the signiﬁcance of a DT case study in\nagriculture. The concept of DTs\
    \ is mainly addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers\nthough [19,26–28,64,73,82],\
    \ the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus\nposing the signiﬁcance\
    \ of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture.\nAccording to the reviewed literature\
    \ summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an\nimplementation of agriculture 4.0\
    \ [19,26–29,45,63,73,75–77,79–88] includes smart irrigation\nstrategies by monitoring\
    \ and controlling various farming stages [28], implementing data\nacquisition\
    \ techniques [27] for automatically controlling actuator systems in agriculture\
    \ or\neven in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79]. Furthermore, via simulation,\
    \ monitoring,\ncontrolling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural\
    \ sites [87], DTs\nimprove predictive control in precision irrigation [28,73,88],\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and\norganic vegetable and livestock farming. Smart\
    \ farming enhances remote detection and\nmonitoring of vegetation and crop stress\
    \ in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and\nforecasting plant yield in greenhouses,\
    \ vertical farms, or outdoor ﬁelds [76,77], or even in\nurban and indoor farming,\
    \ of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics, aqua-\nculture, and\
    \ aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85] as well as the\n\
    sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming and management\
    \ [75,76]\nvia the adoption of digital technologies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ [27,29,64], leading the\nway to digital representations of plants [9], inventory\
    \ quality in agriculture, greenhouse\nproduction ﬂow, and food safety and quality\
    \ within the food supply chain [45]. Although\nthe DTs remain a major issue in\
    \ our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83–85], they are\nimplied as such.\
    \ In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed\n\
    as a signiﬁcant future issue to address and study.\n4.2. The Second Categorization\

    DTs go along with monitoring systems to gather and analyze information. Sensors\n\
    pose a critical role in smart agriculture by facilitating the collection of real-time\
    \ data and\noffering valuable insights into a wide range of environmental and\
    \ agricultural parameters.\nField or soil probes that measure air and ground temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil moisture,\nand ambient light [28,45,73,81,82,88], added to CO2\
    \ sensors measuring relative CO2 con-\ncentration [80,81], and infrared (IR) thermometers\
    \ provide data acquisition modules for\nautomatically controlled actuator systems\
    \ in agriculture approaching digital modelling\nto the food process [64] monitoring\
    \ activities of livestock, optimization of crops, reducing\nemissions to air,\
    \ soil, and water. Drone image cameras [88] and high-resolution photo-\ngraphic\
    \ cameras seem ideal for AR and VR by constructing virtual natural low-polygon\n\
    3D plant models as proposed in [35,74]. Building Information Modeling (BIM) models\
    \ of\nhigh-tech data-driven greenhouses are made feasible as in [79] and provide\
    \ a VR presenta-\ntion of the farm or ﬁeld with the aid of a head-mounted display\
    \ (HMD) with two handheld\ncontrollers serving as handy sensors for manual stimulus.\

    \ sensors and multispectral cameras following an Arduino single-board microcon-\n\
    trollers programmable platform or single-board computer Raspberry Pi-3 enhance\
    \ IoT\nsensor nodes to acquire and transmit farm data to IoT gateways or edge\
    \ devices, thus\ncultivating DT requirements for vertical farms, for the greenhouse\
    \ production process and\nﬁnally models in sustainable agriculture.\nRemote detection\
    \ and monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem\nfeasible based\
    \ on [86] utilizing LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-\nspectral\
    \ imagery, passive microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active mi-\n\
    crowave remote sensing (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88].\n\
    Location determination in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in\nthe remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions\
    \ in agriculture [88].\nIoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware\
    \ communication pro-\ntocols such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous\
    \ serial communication\nwith conﬁgurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM)\
    \ for driving actuators [77,81],\nin correlation with programmable logic controllers\
    \ (PLC) for data recording [29], monitor-\ning, and optimization aided occasionally\
    \ by fuzzy interference systems (FIS) [73].\nThe decision-making and actions once\
    \ undertaken by the farmers now have given\nway to data-driven agricultural decision-making,\
    \ i.e., assisting them to undertake informed\ndecisions related to planting, fertilization,\
    \ pest control, harvesting, and overall farm man-\nagement. Likewise, derived\
    \ from the smart water management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75]\na hands-on approach\
    \ is being utilized to develop a precision irrigation platform based on\nIoT technology\
    \ for smart water management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain.\n4.3. The\
    \ Third Categorization of Research Literature That Is Related to Speciﬁc Technical\n\
    Research Aspects\nDTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their\
    \ physical counterparts. The\nsoftware component of a DT enables the collection,\
    \ processing, and analysis of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, actuators,\
    \ and other connected devices.\nIn [28,77], the high-level programming language\
    \ Python is used for software develop-\nment, scripting, and data analysis, serving\
    \ the purposes of DT applications, implementing\nthe Arduino IDE platform, and\
    \ exploiting the Debian Buster OS to produce a plant simula-\ntion model. Likewise,\
    \ RPi software for the Raspberry Pi platform is used with goal-oriented\nrequirement\
    \ language (GRL) for modelling [80]. We should point out the use of an open\n\
    standard ﬁle format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for\
    \ data repre-\nsentation and communication between systems and is widely adopted\
    \ and supported by\nvarious programming languages and platforms. Speciﬁc software\
    \ packages are utilized\nfor constructing 3D plant models, such as Unreal Engine\
    \ 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop,\nMesh Model Construction, Autodesk, Maya [74],\
    \ Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and\nReality [35]. Other speciﬁc software\
    \ packages serving, for example, the construction of\na DT ﬂowsheet model as in\

    Simulation software was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting\

    As previously mentioned, in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software\n\
    was used, and in [74], the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed\n\
    with virtual plant datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck\
    \ by\nmultiple captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App.\n\

    Structure\nmodelling\nsimulation\nOn the other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms\
    \ seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],\nleading to Big Data analytics\
    \ [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily on real-time\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n31 of 38\navailable data ﬂow. The immense amount of data is stored\
    \ in databases such as Mongo\nDB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81],\
    \ besides using Excel CSV ﬁles for\nretrieving height values [79] or generally\
    \ mentioned Knowledge bases as in [75] leading to\ncloud big data manipulation\
    \ schemes in [45,81,85]. Major cloud computing platforms such\nas Alibaba Cloud,\
    \ Amazon web services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure\nare examples\
    \ of cloud computing services provided by leading technology companies that\n\
    serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].\nCloud IoT service broker agents come into\
    \ place as a software component or intermedi-\nary that facilitates the interaction\
    \ between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)\nand cloud service\
    \ providers like FIWARE. In [28,73], FIWARE cloud applications are ex-\nploited,\
    \ adding to IoT broker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management of context\n\
    information. The procedure includes converting various communication protocols\
    \ into a\nshared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality through\
    \ the processing,\nanalysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE generally\
    \ is used as an open-\nsource platform to provide a standardized framework and\
    \ a set of reusable components for\nbuilding smart applications and services in\
    \ the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI)\ndomains. It aims to simplify\
    \ the development of innovative and interoperable solutions\nby offering a collection\
    \ of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the\ndevelopment\
    \ of smart applications and services.\nA fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive\
    \ and learning capabilities. It handles\nnonlinear and complex relationships between\
    \ variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens\nindustrial plant simulation software\
    \ for plant simulation model production with a weather\nstation. In [67,79], the\
    \ Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other\ndedicated\
    \ software such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientiﬁc Software & Code Repository\n\
    hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate\
    \ a DT\neditor in [75,76].\nLastly, wireless network communication technologies\
    \ are addressed in the research\nliterature. Initially, the wired networking technology\
    \ Ethernet is mentioned in [28,73,77],\nwhile the wireless networking technologies\
    \ such as Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87],\nLoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile\
    \ or cellular in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory\nin [29,82].\
    \ Bluetooth, RFID, and NB-IoT are exploited in [85].\n5. Discussion\nA ﬁrst attempt\
    \ to comment on speciﬁc aspects of the reviewed literature has been done\nin Section\
    \ 2. In total, 14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published\
    \ book,\npropose case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture,\
    \ contrary to\nthe rest published review papers that sufﬁce to merely describe\
    \ the topic and record the\nachievements of the scientiﬁc community referring\
    \ to it.\nIt is interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference\
    \ papers and a\npublished book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly\
    \ overcome the amount\nof the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The\
    \ limited practical application of digital\ntwin technologies is obvious, even\
    \ stated in the literature by the authors.\nEven though [9,86,87] are review papers,\
    \ the authors either describe the necessity of a\nDT model as in [9] for the agriculture\
    \ supply chain management domain, even addressing\nsensors such as level, ﬂow,\
    \ identiﬁcation sensors, RFID or DNA tags, or highlight the need\nfor future study\
    \ on DT models as in [86] making use of remote detection and monitoring\nschemes,\
    \ LiDAR sensors, passive microwave sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors\nonboard\
    \ UAVs and satellites, for monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing\
    \ farm\noperations at agricultural sites by IoT sensor nodes as in [87].\nThe\
    \ signiﬁcance of using Sensors as part of a dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism\n\
    as demanded in DT infrastructure should be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79–81,87,88]\n\
    where soil probes, drone image cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras,\
    \ IR\nthermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors, a mesh of sensors measuring temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n32 of 38\nluminosity, and relative CO2 concentration,\
    \ and air velocity are addressed as essential\nelements to materialize relevant\
    \ IoT platforms accordingly.\nIn [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart water\
    \ management platform is men-\ntioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed,\
    \ and in the journal [82], IoT is only\nmentioned as well in the review papers\
    \ [63,85,87], where the IoT is stated as a promising\nconcept. The fact that in\
    \ [73] an OPC UA server is recommended for implementation,\nin [77] an Arduino\
    \ single-board computer is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as\nin\
    \ [80,81] in a total of 14 articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms\
    \ or vaguely\npresent a case study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] means\
    \ that the practical imple-\nmentation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the\
    \ time being.\nThe necessary software to operate such platforms is focused on\
    \ Python [28,77], ded-\nicated FIS, Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent,\
    \ OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80],\nArduino IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies\
    \ previously mentioned. These make use\nof Ethernet communication technologies\
    \ [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in addition\nto [35,74] that make use\
    \ of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies that\nfacilitate near\
    \ real-time interaction with the environment.\nThe concept and deﬁnition of DT\
    \ seem to be continuously evolving, but in general,\nit refers to a speciﬁc collection\
    \ of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent\na physical process\
    \ or object. These models are used for simulation and future behavior\nforecasting,\
    \ guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control node to the Physical\n\
    entity, as profoundly visualized in Figures 3–5. The ongoing feedback loop between\
    \ the\nphysical farm and the DT is imperative to update the DT model to optimize\
    \ and enhance\nperformance and efﬁciency.\nSeveral attempts have been made in\
    \ this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the\nconcept of the DT model\
    \ is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an imple-\nmented case study.\
    \ Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete\nevent\
    \ simulation blending and ﬂow models [9], and structure modelling simulation and\n\
    future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop\
    \ growth\nmodels for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals\
    \ giving way to future\npractical implementations. On the other hand, in [28],\
    \ simulation software utilizing a\nsimple plant simulation model is employed to\
    \ create a virtual environment for an irrigation\nsystem’s digital twin. In [73],\
    \ the Siemens industrial plant simulation software for the\ndata model is used,\
    \ a model of the Earth system is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation\nof a\
    \ farm in [81], while in [82] it continuous adaption and learning procedure of\
    \ the DT\nmodelling is mentioned as a need that relies heavily on available data.\
    \ A more concise\nproposal to the origin of the holistic DT modelling and simulation\
    \ concept appears in [76],\nwhere a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system\
    \ in Java claimed to be developed, includ-\ning an ontology editor, a digital\
    \ twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In [88],\nsimulation, analysis,\
    \ and prediction are addressed by making progress in implementing\nmodelling and\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and pollution\
    \ chal-\nlenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil agents (hydrological\
    \ models,\nsoil data), crop agents and predictive control models, where the adjustment\
    \ of control\nprocesses such as heating and ventilation is automated based on\
    \ short-term temperature\npredictions, ensuring efﬁcient regulation, as an IoT\
    \ derivative scheme.\nA ﬂowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the widespread\
    \ spreadsheet\napplications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with simulation\
    \ software such as Aspen\nPlus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington,\
    \ MA, USA), ChemCAD\nfrom Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design\
    \ from Honeywell (Charlotte,\nNC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France)\
    \ and PRO/II from AVEVA Group\nplc, merely to implement a digital modelling approach\
    \ to food processing.\nSpreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve\
    \ height values of plants in high-\ntech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79],\
    \ a fact that proves that process calculations\nand analyses may be conducted\
    \ using popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n\
    33 of 38\ndue to its wide accessibility and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and professionals\nfrom various ﬁelds.\nEnhanced 3D modelling software derived\
    \ from the game industry, i.e., Unity game en-\ngine dictates BIM models in Film\
    \ box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations\nof greenhouses, providing\
    \ a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture imple-\nmentation. Virtual\
    \ representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture,\nPhotoshop,\
    \ Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models of Plant\nDatasets\
    \ for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and AR Perpetual\n\
    Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple captured\
    \ images\nin 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck\
    \ software. Ad-\nditionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are\
    \ used for 3D plant models\noffering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively\
    \ sufﬁce the wheat multi-agent\nplanning module. Using multiple captured images\
    \ taken in 3D space to support the AR\nPerpetual Garden App, they produce botanically\
    \ correct plant models for use in museums\nand for educational purposes. A promising\
    \ perspective, if by any chance associated with\nthe essential elements of the\
    \ holistic DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on\nvarious environmental\
    \ and operational factors via communication technologies leading to\na dynamic\
    \ 3D model of a farm entity.\nBesides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT\
    \ Dashboards [87], such as Grafana in\nparticular [28,73] for real-time data presentation\
    \ and analysis or even GUI prototypes [81],\nare proposed, although used on a\
    \ small scale for facilitating near real-time interaction of\nDTs with the environment.\
    \ To reliably transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even\non a smaller\
    \ scale, as in [45,87], while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods\n\
    that enable data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large\
    \ datasets,\nare addressed in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics\
    \ pose a major issue for\nthe advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87],\
    \ not to omit the signiﬁcance of\ndatabases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used\
    \ in [28,73] or SQLite in [80], and Cloud\ncomputing service providers such as\
    \ Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Microsoft\nAzure and Google Cloud platform\
    \ [87].\nVarious factors, with technical hurdles being the primary challenge,\
    \ seem to be step-\nping behind to allow even further the adoption of the DT technologies.\
    \ It is essential\nto meticulously design and clearly deﬁne intricate agricultural\
    \ systems to guarantee the\naccuracy of their corresponding DT models.\n6. Future\
    \ Directions\nOnce addressing a DT as a tight combination of an object model,\
    \ in conjunction with\nexpansive sets of data that directly follow the object\
    \ that may evolve and continually modify\nand adapt the model based on the available\
    \ data, it is made clear that future research should\nbe realized to overcome\
    \ the current profound lack of reference models and case studies\naccordingly.\
    \ That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and development.\nTo broaden\
    \ the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome the limitations\n\
    of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till now, further research\n\
    in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization, and simulation schemes\
    \ tar-\ngeting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR, and GIS information\
    \ systems should\nbe realized.\nFurther research into the holistic model perception\
    \ of plant DTs to overcome the focus\nmerely on the phenotype of plants could\
    \ vastly support DT research. We can pursue\nenhancing the accuracy of depicting\
    \ real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm\nby combining non-georeferenced\
    \ visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially\nreferenced 3D geo visualizations.\n\
    Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that adhere to the mentioned\n\
    principles can address challenges related to reliable aggregating and handling\
    \ of data\nfrom diverse sources, integrating multiple streams of information,\
    \ and employing ad-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n34 of 38\nvanced computational methods\
    \ for data processing and analysis, which could enhance the\nunderstanding of\
    \ the subject and aid further studies.\nFurther decommissioning of data in the\
    \ future resulting from search—Tables 1–3\nmight be promising. The diverse and\
    \ abundant potential advantages of DTs in agriculture\ncreate anticipation for\
    \ the future evolution of this technology and its profound impact on\nthe farming\
    \ sector.\nWe aspire for our work to inspire fellow researchers to explore the\
    \ application of DTs\nin agriculture even further.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ converting the data is passed to the \ncontroller. Controller transfers the\
    \ data to the farm \nPC. Farm PC is the temporary storage.  \n \nStep 4: Farmer\
    \ has to provide the information of soil \ntype and crop type to that system.\
    \ After collection all \nthe data, it transfer towards to the cloud computing.\
    \  \n \nStep 5: The ANN algorithm is applied without \ngeneration any error it\
    \ means that system will give \naccurate output. After comparing all data then\
    \ it will \nmove towards the controller.  \n \nStep 6: Controller is used here\
    \ to control device \ndriver. Its role is to give command to motor start. And\
    \ \nprovide the efficient water to whole farm or crop. \nMotor will be switch\
    \ on for some period of time . It is \nautomatic system so time is fixed automatically.\
    \ Time \nperiod is dependent on input data. \n \nA. Source Node: \nSource node\
    \ is that which senses the input data from \nthe sensors. We are using temperature\
    \ sensor and \nmoisture sensor. Temperature sensor senses the \ntemperature from\
    \ farm and moisture sensor senses the \nmoisture level in the farm, according\
    \ to this values the \nsystem automatically decide the what amount of water \n\
    should be provide to the farm. Then this values \ntransfer to the intermediate\
    \ nodes for next process. \n \nB. Intermediate Nodes: \nIn the intermediate node\
    \ there are some sub nodes \nwhich processes next action on that in-put data that\
    \ \nhas taken from source node. When sensors data came \nfrom source nodes that\
    \ data is in the form of analog \nsignals. So we need to convert that data into\
    \ digital \nsignal. So there is Signal conditioner to send input to \nADC.ADC\
    \ is used to convert analog data to digital \nform. After converting the data\
    \ is passed to the \ncontroller. Controllers transfer the data to the farm \n\
    PC. Farm PC is the temporary storage. Farmer has to \nprovide the information\
    \ of soil type and crop type to \nthat system. After collection all the data,\
    \ it transfer \ntowards to the cloud computing. \n \nC. Destination Node: \nThis\
    \ is the last node which provides the system \noutput. The ANN algorithm is applied\
    \ with-out \ngeneration any error it means that system will give \naccurate output.\
    \ After comparing all data then it will \nmove   towards the controller. Controller\
    \ is used here \nto control de-vice driver. Its role is to give command \nto motor\
    \ start. And provide the eﬃcient water to \nwhole farm or crop. Motor will be\
    \ switch on for some \nperiod of time. It is automatic system so time is fixed\
    \ \nautomatically. Time period is dependent on input \ndata. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION\
    \ \n \nThus, the IoT agricultural applications are making it \npossible for ranchers\
    \ and farmers to collect \nmeaningful data. Large landowners and small farmers\
    \ \nmust understand the potential of IoT market for \nagriculture by installing\
    \ smart technologies to \nincrease competitiveness and sustainability in their\
    \ \nproductions. The demand for growing population can \nbe successfully met if\

    \ taxonomy of a definite and specific species or plant disease are \ngenerally\
    \ obstructed by several difficulties such as time consumption, the limited number\
    \ of expert specialists and the \nincrease in the number of the defined characteristics\
    \ of each species. The steady progress of the computational   \ntechnology over\
    \ the last few years concerning the automated species recognition including plant\
    \ structures is be easier \nparticularly in the presence of huge databases of\
    \ information and the enhancement of classification and analyzing \nimage technology.\
    \ Several investigators are currently working in agriculture field mainly those\
    \ concerned with plant \nidentification or of plant disease recognition through\
    \ image processing, extraction of identical features and classifying \nthem into\
    \ exact classes. In this review, the integration of computer science with agriculture\
    \ has been discussed to \ndetect, quantify, predict, early identify and classify\
    \ plant diseases as well as forecasting agricultural crops using \ndifferent machine\
    \ learning techniques. Weather forecasting, smart irrigation system, plant leaf\
    \ identification, etc will \nalso discussed. The aim of this paper is to provide\
    \ the investigators particularly biologists with computational \nrecognition techniques\
    \ as well as the possibility of using image informative morphological features\
    \ of a species or a \ngroup of related species in recognition of many biological\
    \ organisms including plants and microorganisms. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence,\
    \ Agriculture, Image Processing, Recognition \n \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \n \nMachine\
    \ Learning (ML) is a division of artificial intelligence in the field of computer\
    \ science that lets software \napplications to be more truthful in prediction\
    \ of the outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic principle \n\
    of ML is to construct algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical\
    \ techniques to predict an output while \nupdating outputs as new data becomes\

    \ to investigating the recognition pattern and artificial intelligence, ML expands\
    \ to investigation of the \nconstruction of algorithms that can learn from and\
    \ make predictions on data. ML is employed with good performance \nin a variety\
    \ of computational tasks such as programming, building models and designing including\
    \ as examples email \nfiltering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders\
    \ working towards a data breach (Dickson, 2017) [2] \noptical character recognition\
    \ (Wernick, 2010) [3] learning to rank, and computer vision. ML is firmly identified\
    \ with \n(and frequently covers with) computational insights, which additionally\
    \ centers around forecast making using \ncomputer. It has solid connections to\
    \ scientific enhancement, which conveys strategies, hypothesis and application\
    \ \nareas to the field. ML is now and probably conflated with information mining\
    \ (Mannila, 1996) [4] where the subfield \nconcentrates more on exploratory information\
    \ investigation and is known as unsupervised learning (Bishop, 2006) [5]. \nMachine\
    \ learning can likewise be unsupervised and be utilized to learn and build up\
    \ pattern conduct profiles for \ndifferent elements and afterward used to find\
    \ important irregularities. Within the field of information investigation, ML\
    \ \nis a technique used to devise complex models and calculations that loan themselves\
    \ to forecast; in commercial use, this \nis known as predictive investigation.\
    \ These explanatory models permit specialists, data researchers, designers, and\
    \ \nexperts to \"create dependable, repeatable choices and results\" and reveal\
    \ \"concealed insights\" through gaining from \nchronicled connections and data\
    \ pattern. Over the last few years, several models and methods of automated \n\
    classification systems of specimens` images have been considered. The accuracy\
    \ of automated recognition systems for \nbiological images is greatly dependent\
    \ on the quantity and quality of learned images. The images are firstly processed\
    \ \nusing various preprocessing techniques to extract relevant features that can\
    \ be employed for classification. Feature \nextraction techniques are useful in\
    \ image processing applications and feature selection is critical to the whole\
    \ \nidentification process as the poorly attained features probably result in\
    \ poor recognition (Kumar and Bhatia, 2014) [6].  \nThis review describes a general\
    \ overview of the different techniques and methods that have been employed in\

    \ last few years, various researchers have focused into this area to provide optimized\
    \ solution. Popular \nmethods have utilized ML, image processing and classification\
    \ based approaches to identify and detect the diseases on \nagricultural products.\
    \  \n \nThe techniques for disease detection have utilized various image processing\
    \ methods followed by various classification \ntechniques. Identifying disease\
    \ from the images of the plant is one of the interesting research areas in computer\
    \ and in \nagriculture field. ML methods have been discussed by several investigators\
    \ to detect, quantify and classify plant \ndiseases (Al-Hiary et al, 2011 [7],\
    \ Wang et al, 2012[8], Barbedo, 2013[9], Khirade and Patil, 2015[10], Singh and\
    \ \nMisra, 2017[11]). Disease detection includes rice disease identification using\
    \ pattern recognition techniques,  pattern \ndiscrimination models, extraction\
    \ of rice leaf disease image based on back-propagation neural network and application\
    \ \nof support vector machine for detection of rice diseases using shape and color\
    \ texture features (Phadikar  and Sil, 2008 \n[12], Liu and Zhou, 2009 [13], Yao\
    \ et al. 2009[14]), image processing techniques for diagnosis of paddy diseases\
    \ \n(Kurniawati et al. 2009 [15], Anthonys and Wickramarachchi, 2009[16], Majid\
    \ et al. 2013[17], Kahar et al. 2015 [18], \nSuman and Dhruvakumar, 2015 [19]),\
    \ ANN for recognition of flower diseases (Tigistu and Assabie, 2015 [20]). The\
    \ \ndistinctive strategies shoed higher exactness contrasted with the conventional\
    \ traditional techniques like regression \ninvestigation. These techniques are\
    \ concerned with noisy and multi-faceted information (Suraksha et al. (S. I. S.\
    \ S. B) \n2016 [21], Donatelli et al. 2017[22], Evert et al. 2017[23]). Early\
    \ crop infection recognition and order has been finished \nutilizing SVM (Ruß\
    \ et al. 2008 [24]).  SVM technique was implemented for sugar beet diseases and\
    \ offered in the \nreport published by Rumpf et al.  (2010)[25], where the classification\
    \ accuracy was between 65 and 90%, depending on \nthe type and stage of disease.\
    \ Likewise, Zhou and Chen earlier in 2002 [26] indicated methods that combine\
    \ the feature \nextraction and neural network ensemble (NNE) for plant disease\
    \ recognition. Through training a definite number of \nneural networks and combining\
    \ their results after that, NNE offers a better generalization of learning ability.\
    \ Such \nmethod was implemented only for recognizing tea leaf diseases with final\
    \ testing accuracy of 91% (Chandrakarmokar  \net al. 2015) [27]. \n \nAn alternative\
    \ method based on leaf images and using artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a\
    \ technique for an \nautomatic recognition and classification of plant diseases\
    \ was used in conjunction with -means as a clustering \nprocedure proposed by\
    \ Al-Hiary et al (2011) [7]. ANN consisted of 10 hidden layers. The number of\
    \ outputs was 6 \nwhich was the number of classes representing five diseases along\
    \ with the case of a healthy leaf. On average, the \naccuracy of classification\
    \ using this approach was 94.67%. Several authors (Lenz et al., 2015[28], Alipanahi\
    \ et al. 2015 \n[29], Arevalo et al. 2015 [30], Zhang et al. 2016 [31]) employed\
    \ the deep learning methods for solving most complex \ntasks in different areas\
    \ of research in biology, bioinformatics, biomedicine, robotics, and 3D technologies.\
    \ \n \nThere are a few elements like soil quality, crop cycle, seed quality which\
    \ can prompt weakness and diseases in crops. \nMachine learning calculations viably\
    \ think about all the conceivable components, memorable information and in \n\
    addition satellite/sensor information of fields to give significant infection\
    \ classifiers. Disease location utilizing pictures \nof harvest leaves has been\
    \ executed utilizing pattern regonition branch of ML. It works by getting designs\
    \ from input \ninformation and isolating them into classes of ailments (Wolfert,\
    \ 2017) [32].  \n \nThe early and exact visual diagnosis of plant disease is very\
    \ important although it is not enough and probably the \nprocess exposed to some\
    \ human error. More accurete diagnosis and disease recognition by a trained computer\
    \ After \nsorting through hundreds of thousands of images of infected plants,\
    \ a ML algorithm can spot disease type, severity, and \nin the future, may even\
    \ recommend management practices to control and manage plant diseases. ML in agriculture\
    \ \nallows for more accurate disease diagnosis and help in elimination of the\
    \ wasted energy and resources from \nmisdiagnoses. Farmers can upload field images\
    \ taken by satellites, UAVs, land based rovers, pictures from \nsmartphones, and\
    \ use this software to diagnose and develop a management plan (Khirade and Patil,\
    \ 2015) [10], Fig. 1. \nThe image processing methods are connected to the attained\
    \ images to extricate helpful highlights that are essential for \nimage examination.\
    \ Dhaygude and Kumbhar (2013) [33] indicated that there are mainly four steps\
    \ in developed \nprocessing scheme which are RGB (red, green and blue), image\
    \ acquisition, transformation of the input image from \nRGB to Hue, Saturation,\
    \ and Value (HSV) format, masking and removal of the green-pixels by using pre-computed\
    \ \nthreshold level which is useful  for segment extraction. HSV model is an ideal\
    \ tool for color perception (Siddiqi et al. \n2009) [34].  Ananthi and Varthini\
    \ (2012) [35] indicated that the color transformation structure into Hue saturation\
    \ \nintensity (HSI) shading space portrayal is used to facilitate the particular\
    \ of colors in some standard, by and large \napproved way. HSI color model is\
    \ a mainstream color model since it depends on human recognition (Gonzalez and\
    \ \nWoods, 2002) [36]. Hue is a color attribute that indicates to the prevailing\
    \ color as seen by a spectator. Saturation \ndenotes to the relative purity and\
    \ abundance of white light. Color spaces can be easily changed from one space\
    \ to \nanother. After the change in procedure, the Hue component is considered\
    \ for further examination (Fig. 2). S and I are \ndropped since they doesn't give\
    \ extra data. Fig. 2 demonstrates the H, S and I components. \nIJIREEICE \nISSN\

    \ the applied technique is color co-occurrence method. It is the methodology in\
    \ which both the \ntexture and color of an image are utilized, to come to the\
    \ distinctive features, which reveals that image. The color co-\nevent surface\
    \ examination strategy is created through the spatial gray-level dependence matrices\
    \ (SGDM). SGDM is a \nmeasurable method to illustrate shape by statistically testing\
    \ the manner in which certain grey levels happen in \nconnection to other grey\
    \ levels (Argenti et al. 1990) [38]. These frames measure the prospect that a\
    \ pixel at one specific \ndark level will happen at a distinctive distance and\
    \ introduction from any pixel given that pixel has a second specific \ngrey level.\
    \ There are three major mathematical processes in the color co-occurrence method.\
    \ First, conversion of the \nRGB images of leaves is done into HIS color space\

    \ are extracted from segmented regions using standard feature extraction techniques\
    \ \n(Singh and Misra, 2017) [37] (Fig. 4). These features are then used for classification\
    \ into disease type. Experimental \nresults indicated that the proposed technique\

    \ approach for \naccomplishing a powerful answer for several complex agricultural\
    \ issues and gives numerous viable calculations which \ncan distinguish the input\
    \ and yield relationship as well as yield forecast and prediction and selection.\
    \ Ghosh and  Koley  \n(2014) [50] trained Back Propagation Networks(BPN) with\
    \ reference crops‘ growth properties available nutrient status \nand its ability\
    \ to provide nutrients out of its own reserves and through external applications\
    \ for crop production in both \ncases, BPN was able to find and suggest the correct\
    \ correlation percentage among those properties. The performance of \nthe Back\
    \ Propagation Neural network model was evaluated using a test data set and their\
    \ results showed that artificial \nneural network with certain number of neurons\
    \ in hidden layer had better performance in predicting soil properties than \n\
    multivariate regression.  \n \nAccording to Mishra et al. (2016) [51], there are\
    \ various types of ML techniques such as supervised and unsupervised \nlearning.\
    \ Supervised learning means there is one supervisor to supervise the thing that\
    \ is the program is trained by \ntraining examples and then that can be used to\
    \ find the accurate conclusion for new data. Artificial neural network, \nBayesian\
    \ network, decision tree, support vector machines, ID3, k-nearest neighbor, hidden\
    \ markov model etc. are some \nof the examples of supervised learning. The unsupervised\
    \ machine learning means a vast amount of data is given to the \nprogram and the\
    \ program will find the patterns and the relations between them. So hidden patterns\
    \ in the data can be \ndiscovered using unsupervised learning Some examples of\
    \ unsupervised learning algorithms are k-nearest neighbor, \nself-organizing map,\
    \ and partial based clustering, hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering etc.\
    \ \n \nProcedures like Artificial neural systems, K-closest neighbors and decision\
    \ trees have huge parts in the setting of crop \ndetermination which depends on\
    \ different elements. Crop choice in view of the impact of regular disasters like\
    \ \nstarvations has been performed by Okori and Obua (2011) [52] in view of ML.\
    \ The utilization of ANN to pick the crop \nin light of soil and environmental\
    \ weather has been appeared by specialists (Snehal, and Sandeep, 2014) [53]. A\
    \ plant \nsupplement administration framework has been proposed in view of ML\
    \ strategies to address and manage the issues of \nsoil and keep up its fertility\
    \ levels and thus enhance the product yield (Ghosh and Koley, 2010) [50]. A crop\
    \ choice \ntechnique called CSM has been proposed (Kumar et al. 2015) [54] which\
    \ helps in crop determination in light of its \nyield forecast and different environmental\
    \ variables.The method depends on various parameters such as production \nrate,\
    \ market price and government policies. Many researchers studied prediction of\
    \ yield rate of crop, prediction of \nweather, soil classification and crop classification\
    \ for agriculture planning using statistics methods or ML techniques. If \nthere\
    \ is more than one option to plant a crop at a time using limited land resource,\
    \ then selection of crop is a puzzle. \nCSM is also employed to solve crop selection\
    \ problem, and maximize net yield rate of crop over season and \nsubsequently\
    \ achieves maximum economic growth of the country. The proposed method may improve\
    \ net yield rate of \ncrops.  \n \nShastry et al. (2016) [55] contrasted two recognized\
    \ prediction systems to expect wheat yield which are artificial neural \nNetworks\
    \ (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The researchers considered a several\
    \ parameters like \nprecipitation amount, crop biomass, soil evaporation, transpiration,\
    \ extractable soil water (ESW) and fertilizer added \n(NO3). They demonstrated\
    \ that the customized artificial neural networks (C-ANN) display performs better\
    \ with a \nhigher R2 measurement and a lower rate forecast error than the MLR\
    \ and Default-artificial neural networks (D-ANN) \nmodels on the test dataset\
    \ (Fig. 5). Another strategy for quick and non-damaging assessment of the general\
    \ assimilation \ncapacity of plants with the use of leaf spectral reflectance\
    \ was recently suggested by some workers (Serbin et al., 2012 \n[56]; Ainsworth\
    \ et al., 2014 [57]; Yendrek et al., 2017 [58]). The reflectance spectrum ranging\
    \ from the visible over the \nnear infrared to the intermediate infrared (350\
    \ to 2500 nm) gives data on the physical and chemical state as well as \nsurface\
    \ and texture properties of the material under survey. Reflectance spectra from\
    \ crop canopies helped in the \nassessment of the plants‘ composition, nutritional\
    \ status, as well as certain stress parameters. This includes estimates of \n\
    nutrient components and macronutrient concentration (Gillon et al., 1999 [59];\
    \ Zhai et al., 2013 [60]), water content \nand water use efficiency (Wang et al.,\
    \ 2012a, 2012b) [61, 62], chlorophyll content (Atzberger et al., 2010)[63], cell\

    \ computer science with agriculture helps in forecasting agricultural \ncrops.\
    \ Few evaluations have been conducted to determine the impact of including weather\
    \ forecasts, as opposed to \nusing historical weather data (commonly used) in\
    \ crop models. In literature, several published papers showed that the \nmost\
    \ important effective meteorological factors on crop yield, was quantity and quality\
    \ of rainfall, but the most \nsensitivity stages relative to rainfall are flowering\
    \ and heading. Therefore, it is required to build on objective \nmethodology for\
    \ preharvest crop forecasting. Building up a suitable model will have certain\
    \ merits over the traditional \nforecasting method. Historically, several important\

    \ other hand, crop yield differs spatially and temporally with a non-linear behavior\
    \ (Liu et al., 2001[48]; \nDrummond et al., 2003[104]; Schlenker & Roberts, 2006[105]),\
    \ introducing large deviations from one year to another. \nThus, more efficient\
    \ methods have been developed, which can be classified as crop growth models and\
    \ data driven \nmodels. Crop models perform an abstraction of the dynamic mechanistic\
    \ of the plant‘s physiological stages by fitting \nthem into a mathematical model\
    \ (Safa et al., 2004)[106]. Most of the mechanistic models are crop specific:\
    \ SOYGRO \nfor legumes (Wilkerson et al., 1983)[107]; AFRCWHEAT2 (Porter, 1993)[108]\
    \ and Sirius (Jamieson et al., 1998)[109] \nfor wheat; CERES-Maize (Jones & Kiniry,\
    \ 1986)[110] for corn. Some others, such as SUCROS (Spitters et al., \n1988)[111],\
    \ SUCROS2 (Goudriaan & van Laar, 1994)[112] and STICS (Brisson et al., 1998)[113]\
    \ are available for \nvarious crop types through parameter fitting. An evaluation\
    \ performed by Jamieson et al. (1998)[109] for the wheat \ncrop shows that some\
    \ of these models has a reasonable accuracy, with deviations within 10%. Regrettably,\
    \ as reported \nby Varcoe (1990)[114] and Drummond et al. (2003)[104], this kind\
    \ of models is expensive in terms of time and money, \nbeing impractical for massive\
    \ application and agricultural planning. The Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity\
    \ \n(ARCH) model introduced by Engle (1982)[115] explicitly recognizes the difference\
    \ between the unconditional and the \nconditional variance allowing the latter\
    \ to change over time as a function of past errors. The statistical properties\
    \ of this \nnew parametric class of models has been studied further in Weiss (1982)[116].\
    \ Two years later, Bollerslev introduced \nthe Generalized Autoregressive Conditional\
    \ Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to allow for past conditional variances \n\
    in the current conditional variance equation for analysis of the variability.\
    \ In the ARCH model, variability of rainfall \nstations exceeding a normal condition,\
    \ are computed in a specified long-period. The ARCH model can be denominated \n\
    based on the effects variance of the error term of an actual series. The ARCH\
    \ family include ARCH, GARCH, ARCH \nin Mean (ARCH-M), Exponential GARCH (EGARCH),\
    \ Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle (GJR) and Threshold \nAutoregressive Conditional\
    \ Heteroskedasticity (TARCH). The favorable choice of ARCH family models are the\
    \ spatial \ndistributions in the characters and designs of rainfall, but these\
    \ also can be nonlinear as they can response in very \ndifferent rainfall variability\
    \ (Javari, 2016)[117] among stations (Gouriéroux, 2012[118]; Hafner et al , 2015[119];\
    \ \nShimizu, 2014[120]). \n \nWeather prediction based on machine learning technique\
    \ called Support Vector Machines had been proposed (Radhika \nand M.Shashi, 2009)[121].\
    \ These algorithms have shown better results over the conventional algorithms\
    \ and hence \nhave a bright future for acceptance. For rainfall linear and nonlinear\
    \ variability modeling, the Autoregressive Integrated \nMoving Average (ARIMA)\
    \ models and ARCH family models have been used for predicting the monthly and\
    \ annual \nrainfall series (Javari, 2016)[117].  Accurate estimation of rainfall\
    \ has an important role in the optimal water resources \nmanagement, as well as\
    \ hydrological and climatological studies. Mehdizadeh et al. (2017)[122] investigated\
    \ two novel \ntypes of hybrid models, namely gene expression programming-autoregressive\
    \ conditional heteroscedasticity (GEP-\nARCH) and artificial neural networks-autoregressive\
    \ conditional heteroscedasticity (ANN-ARCH) to estimate monthly \nrainfall time\
    \ series. They found that the proposed GEP-ARCH and ANN-ARCH models give a much\
    \ better \nperformance than the GEP and ANN in all of the investigated stations\
    \ with various climates.  \n \nMoreover, the ANN-ARCH model mostly offers better\
    \ performance in comparison with the GEP-ARCH model. As an \ninnovation, the same\
    \ authors introduced three new hybrid models by integrating soft computing methods\
    \ including \nmultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Bayesian networks\
    \ (BN) and GEP with a time series model, namely \ngeneralized autoregressive conditional\
    \ heteroscedasticity (GARCH) for modeling of the monthly precipitation \n(Mehdizadeh\
    \ et al. 2017)[123]. Neural networks and statistical models are not opposing techniques\
    \ for data analysis \nalthough there is an overlap between the two fields. Neural\
    \ networks include several models, such as MLPs that are \nbeneficial for statistical\
    \ applications. Statistical methodology is directly applicable to neural networks\
    \ in different ways \nsuch as optimization algorithms, estimation criteria, confidence\
    \ intervals and graphical methods. The suggested \nsuccessive steps in following\
    \ weather, crop yield and cost forecasting are proposed by Mohan and Patil \n\

    \ \nD. \nSmart Irrigation System  \nIn some of the old-fashioned irrigation system,\
    \ irrigation is planned by monitoring the soil and water status by using \ntension\
    \ meter. Farming sector consumes high labor cost in the fields for irrigation,\
    \ which is a huge crisis being faced by \nfarmers. In addition, a huge portion\
    \ of water is consumed in developing countries due to absence of lacking automating\
    \ \ncontroller system particularly in sandy soil. As well, the global warming\
    \ results in climate changes and increasing \ndroughts due to the daily dropping\
    \ of the ground water level. In Egypt, The river water for irrigation is a big\
    \ issue of \ndispute among many countries which share of the Nile waters. To overcome\
    \ the shortage of water, some companies \nhave come up with sensor based technology\
    \ for smart agricultural irrigation. The Smart Irrigation System is used for \n\
    the optimum amount of water in agricultural field without the involvement of farmer\
    \ by using soil moisture Sensor that \nmonitors the the level of water, soil temperature,\
    \ nutrient content and weather forecasting (Gupta et al. 2016)[126]. The \nmonitoring\
    \ is performed by Microcontroller that automatically turn ON/OFF a pump according\
    \ to the need of water for \nirrigation and hence is useful in saving water. Machine\
    \ to machine (M2M) communication is developing technology \nwhich allows devices,\
    \ objects to communicate among each other and send data to Server or Cloud through\
    \ the Core \nNetwork (Shekhar et al. 2017)[127]. The current irrigation methodology\
    \ adopted employ uniform water distribution \n(Edordu and Sacks, 2006 [128], Kim\
    \ et al. 2008[129]) which is not optimal. So accordingly technologies being applied\
    \ \ntowards agricultural monitoring which is required by farmers So as such standalone\
    \ monitoring station been developed \nemploying ―MSP 430‖ microcontroller along\
    \ with set of meteorological sensors which includes temperature and \nhumidity.\
    \ In addition to the standalone monitoring station, Wireless Sensor based monitoring\
    \ system (Deshpande and \nPrasad 2015)[130] been developed which is composed of\
    \ number of wireless sensor nodes and a gateway. This system \nhere provides a\
    \ unique, wireless and easy solution with better spatial and temporal resolutions\
    \ In addition to employing \ntechnologies in monitoring the agriculture for automating\
    \ the irrigation system, there is need for some intelligence \nwhich allows machines\
    \ to apply some intelligence in interpreting agricultural data captured and accordingly\
    \ analyze \ndata towards predicting the output rather than following traditional\
    \ rule based algorithm.  \n \nSome investigator suggested M2M system which facilitate\
    \ the connection of different devices without the need of \ninterfering human.\
    \ The system depends on the data recorded by temperature and moisture sensors\
    \ to an IoT based \nautomated irrigation system (Rumpf et al. 2010)[25] or sending\
    \ the data through  Bluetooth wireless transmitter (kim et \nal 2008)[129].  Wall\
    \ and King (2004)[131] established an automated specific irrigation system with\
    \ soil moisture \nsensor and sprinkler valve controller. These systems did not\
    \ consider monitoring the water pollution and do not \nconsider M2M communication\
    \ model. Yang et al. (2007) [132] proposed monitoring system with a self-organizing\
    \ \nintensive sensor based irrigation. The system construction consisted of bottom\
    \ layer and upper layer as shown in Fig. 7 \n(left and right). Wall and King (2004)[131]\
    \ developed a hierarchical wireless network architecture that was placed in \n\
    the bottom and the nodes send the data that are receiving by the base station\
    \ which is connected by wirelss LAN \nadjusted with software.  To monitor and\
    \ control the irrigation in the agricultural fields, Konstantinos et al. (2007)[133]\
    \ \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system (A2S) based on deploying sensor network\
    \ with wireless sensors \ncommunicated among themselves to self-organize a wireless\
    \ network. In this system, long distance communication \nbetween sensor network\
    \ and server is brought by means of wireless LAN. The subsystem management includes\
    \ \ndatabase, application and web server. Data from sensors are received by the\
    \ server which is stored in the database \nserver.  \n \nIJIREEICE \nISSN (Online)\

    \ objective of plant systematics is the identification of plant species or \n\
    group of species based on their characteristics and similarities. The identification\
    \ of a species is followed by grouping \nor classification of similar species\
    \ into a genus and grouping of similar genera to family and so on. The botanists\
    \ use \nseveral criteria for classification including leaves, flowers, seeds,\
    \ roots, stem, etc. Even with each previous item sub-\nclassification may be considered\
    \ such as size, shape, color, texture, leaf veins, branching, seeds and seedlings\
    \ of plants. \nMoreover, the taxonomy may be difficult due to the high number\
    \ of species probably due to climatic and environmental \nconditions related to\
    \ the variation in phytogeographical areas. Some expertized taxonomists develop\
    \ technical keys \nwhich is classically limited to few number of species and usually\
    \ with limited familiarity in plant recognition. \n \nDue to the difficulties\
    \ with the manual biological identification, and the difficulties of the taxonomic\
    \ information \nlanguage, vocabularies and formats of the manual classification\
    \ key, several researchers suggested the automated \nidentification. ANNs are\
    \ a computing model imitative from the human brain and can basically simulate\
    \ regular \nintelligence since they investigate skills and considered to be superior\
    \ to other techniques. Moreover, they contain \nseveral numbers of interconnected\
    \ operation elements known as neurons derived from the huge number of datasets\
    \ \n(Mohamed, 2013[134], Pirouzmand and Dehdashti, 2015[135]). The system comprise\
    \ 3 successive layers; an input \nlayer, hidden layer, and output layer. They\
    \ have the ability to learn, save and make relevance between inputs and \noutputs,\
    \ which have the ability to be missed from experiential processes (Elsafi, 2014[136],\
    \ Mattar, 2015[137]). This \nidea was trained by several workers including Leow\
    \ et al. (2015)[138], Kalafi et al. (2016)[139], Morwenna et al. \n(2016)[140],\

    \ their ‗‗knowledge‘‘ to new situations \nrelated to the classification. The recognition\
    \ of a plant species involves several methods, the most important of which is\
    \ \nthe definition of the features followed by classification, segmentation, extraction\
    \ and comparing the features to those \nfrom a labeled database. Feature variables\
    \ (predictors), input variables whether individual or shared, are the input \n\
    signals that offer the materials and data for pattern recognition. Each feature\
    \ variable is weighted according to its \nimportance (Haykin, 2008)[144]. The\
    \ weight of each signal is summed and managed by activation function. Weight is\
    \ \nactually the coefficient of each predictor. The signal processing technique\
    \ can be mathematically denoted as: \n \ny(x)=Φ (∑ni=1wi⋅xi) \n \nwhere y is the\
    \ output signal, (Φ) is the activation function, x is input variables and w is\
    \ weight assigned to each input \nvariables. Suppose there are n input variables.\
    \ To better understand ANN, it can be compared to the regression model. \nEach\
    \ input variable is in analogue to the predictors of a regression model.  \n \n\
    Artificial neural networks (ANN) are one of early methodology utilized to identify\
    \ organisms based on morphological \ncharacters due to its efficiency in management\
    \ of large datasets and its generalizability. ANN technique was proposed \nfor\
    \ the identification and classification and has revealed adequate results in complex\
    \ classifications of biological \nimages and has proposed for the identification\
    \ of wide variety of biological samples including insects e.g. mosquito \n(Banerjee\

    \ of 2420 leaves from 151 species variables. Clark et al. (2012)[169] \ntrained\

    \ species of the genus Tilia, and \nreached 44% accuracy. Cope et al. (2012)[170]\
    \ discussed a wide range of analytical methods employed in the \nidentification\
    \ of plant species using digital morphometric, computational, and image processing\
    \ that have been \nproposed to analyze plant images. Aakif and FaisalKhan (2015)[171]\
    \ extracted different morphological leaf features \nand used Fourier descriptors\
    \ and a newly proposed shape-defining feature. Their trained algorithm using ANN\
    \ gave \nmore than 96% accuracy. Akbar et al. (2018)[172] developed an ANN based\
    \ prediction model by using the data of \nessential oil of 131 rhizome of turmeric\
    \ (Curcuma longa L.) germplasms obtained from 8 agro-climatic regions. The \n\
    researcher and his co-workers used  11 parameters for each sample for test and\
    \ training the ANN model and the results \nrevealed that multilayer-feed-forward\
    \ neural networks with 12 nodes (MLFN-12) was the most favourable and model \n\
    to employ with R2 value of 0.88. Sabzi and Abbaspour-Gilandeh (2018)[173] applied\
    \ ANN- particle swarm \noptimization algorithm (PSO) method using Bayesian classifier\
    \ for classification of the inputs as potato plants or \nweeds.  The techniques\
    \ achieved an accuracy of 99.0% and 71.7%, respectively, for the test set. These\
    \ results indicate \nthat a accurate site-specific herbicide sprayer can be designed\
    \ using the achieved approach, to get rid of the harmful \nweeds associated with\
    \ potato plants and minimize the amount of the herbicide sprayed. \n \nMany foliar\

    \ \n \nAgriculture is the back bone and important sector of several developing\
    \ countries‘s economy. It contributes in the \ndevelopment and is considered as\
    \ an important source of national income. The delay in manual discovery of the\
    \ plant \ndisease, crop yield prediction, inadequate timing irrigation,  prediction\
    \ of different various environmental factors or the \nrecognition of plant species\
    \  necessitate looking for advanced approach or specific modern innovation approach\
    \ to \nreplace the dependence on the manual application. The recent several computational\
    \ techniques are steadily growing \nand help in facilitating and solving several\
    \ agricultural difficulties. Several practices mainly using machine learning \n\
    techniques can be used fundamentally to improve crop yield. Machine learning techniques\
    \ depend on historic \ninformation, huge number of data and trained computer.\
    \ The application of specific technique depend on the target \nupon which it will\
    \ be employed. Mostly the techniques offer an accurate prediction of crop production.\

    \ This study aimed to simulate dynamic irrigation management zones (MZs) in two\
    \ maize\nfields for a variable rate hose reel fertigation machine (VRFM) with\
    \ a four-section boom control. Soil\nmoisture content was measured from nine and\
    \ four soil moisture sensors in Field 1 (8.2 ha) and\nField 2 (2.5 ha), respectively,\
    \ on different dates during the 2022 crop season. Three and five MZs\nscenarios\
    \ were simulated per irrigation and the theoretical maps were processed for implementation.\n\
    The application maps fitted to the VRFM showed significant spatiotemporal variations\
    \ in irrigation\nrequirements. For instance, in Field 1, 3-MZ modelling showed\
    \ that the areas requiring high (H),\nmedium (M), and low (L)-level irrigation\
    \ on 21 July were 1.60, 4.84, and 1.85 ha, respectively, even\nthough the farmer\
    \ applied uniform rate over the whole field. H-level sub-areas ranged between\n\
    1.22 ha (25 July) and 3.25 ha (7 July), showing a coefficient of variation (CV)\
    \ of 43.32% for the three\nMZs, whereas H-level sub-areas for the five MZs varied\
    \ from 0.41 ha (2 July) to 1.49 ha (7 July) with\na CV value of 48.84%. High levels\
    \ of within-field variability can be addressed using precise and\ndynamic irrigation\
    \ MZs fitted to the irrigation technology used.\nKeywords: irrigation; maize;\
    \ management zones; variable rate irrigation; wireless soil moisture\nsensor;\

    \ common and significantly\naffect agricultural production [1]. Commonly used\
    \ in arid farming regions and during\ntimes of low rainfall, irrigation is the\
    \ process of adding water to the soil to increase crop\ngrowth and replant degraded\
    \ soil [2]. Irrigation depends on regional climatic conditions;\nhowever, as climate\
    \ change begins to affect new regions that were not affected by drought\nin the\
    \ past, the need for irrigation also arises in these regions. According to research\
    \ and\ncurrent practices, farmers’ use of irrigation is increasing, even in northern\
    \ EU countries. In\ncountries where irrigation is widely used, irrigation technologies\
    \ have improved substan-\ntially. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that\
    \ irrigation will receive greater attention\nin parts of the world where it was\
    \ not a priority before. Precision irrigation is necessary\nbecause of the rising\
    \ demand for water to combat climate concerns. To achieve higher\nagricultural\

    Soil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n2 of 23\nThe four most popular methods of operation for\
    \ irrigation scheduling, namely evapotran-\nspiration and water balance (ET-WB),\
    \ soil moisture status, plant water status, and crop\nmodels, along with their\
    \ advantages and disadvantages, are introduced and contrasted to\nbetter understand\
    \ their fundamental processes and principles [3]. It is necessary to have\nknowledge\
    \ of soil properties, including texture, water-holding capacity (WHC), wetness,\n\
    and crop water requirements, at different growth stages [4].\nWith the advancement\
    \ of contemporary sensors and sensing technology, a variety\nof technologies,\
    \ such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), remote sensing (RS), global\nnavigation\
    \ satellite system (GNSS), geographic information systems (GIS), LoRaWAN, and\n\
    Bluetooth can now be used to collect field data for precision irrigation. WSNs\
    \ have been\nwidely used in agriculture for automated irrigation management because\
    \ they are cost-\neffective and have low energy consumption [5–8]. In addition\
    \ to wired solutions, wireless\nsensor technologies have become more important\
    \ and widely used [9], particularly in\nweather forecasting, early warning systems,\
    \ soil and crop monitoring, and automated and\nsmart irrigation [10–12]. Wireless\
    \ sensor networks with cloud capabilities are promising\nbecause the end-user\
    \ does not have to handle collecting and storing the data.\nIt has been well documented\
    \ that parameters affecting the yield of any crop exhibit\nspatial and temporal\
    \ variations [13–16]. Despite awareness of this, the great majority of\nfarmers\
    \ today are known to apply a constant rate over the field while they vary the\
    \ total\namount of water from one irrigation to another during the irrigation\
    \ season depending on\nthe soil, plant, and weather conditions. At present, a\
    \ limited number of farmers seem to\ndetermine irrigation needs based on climate\
    \ data and some sensor data, if any. One of the\nmost important factors affecting\
    \ the adoption of precision or smart irrigation technologies\nis that the accuracy\
    \ of the moisture sensor changes with time in the field, necessitating\noccasional\
    \ calibration. Other factors that cause difficulties for the average end-user\
    \ include\ncost, installation, data collection, and interpretation issues. Although\
    \ the advantages of\nvariable rate irrigation have been documented, the adoption\
    \ rate of this technology has\nbeen low; however, efforts to develop the technology\
    \ should continue for several reasons,\nincluding climate change, declining water\
    \ resources, nutrient management regulations,\nand water management policies [17].\n\
    The development of variable-rate irrigation control systems has attracted considerable\n\
    attention since the early 2000s. Some of these studies focused on center-pivot\
    \ and linearly\nmoving irrigation systems [18–20]. The development of smart irrigation\
    \ systems is of\nthe utmost interest and requires the accurate determination of\
    \ all parameters affecting\nirrigation [10,21]. Smart systems require not only\
    \ sensor-based monitoring but also the\nintegration of Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ and cloud technologies [10,22–26]. Ref. [27] reviewed\nvarious water management\
    \ techniques and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep\nlearning (DL),\
    \ along with the IoT network and case studies. Although previous studies have\n\
    covered new techniques to apply irrigation water more intelligently, there is\
    \ still a need to\nimprove the current applications by considering the dynamic\
    \ variations in irrigation needs\nwithin fields more precisely. There have been\
    \ studies focusing on variable rate irrigation\n(VRI) using hose reel machines,\
    \ but they usually use the full-swath width as the lateral\nresolution [28–32].\
    \ There appears to be a research gap regarding improvements in the lateral\nand\
    \ longitudinal resolutions of VRI applications using hose reel machines. Furthermore,\n\
    spatial and temporal changes during the irrigation period should be addressed\
    \ in the\nmanagement of VRI.\nThe general objective of this study was to simulate\
    \ spatiotemporal variations in\nirrigation needs of maize crops based on dynamic\
    \ irrigation management zones using\na wireless soil moisture sensor network and\
    \ GIS capabilities. This study compared the\nconstant user rates of irrigation\
    \ water on different irrigation dates with that of the sensor-\nbased simulated\
    \ variable irrigation rate. It assesses the right time and rate for irrigation,\n\
    determines the accuracy of user rate applications, and analyses the dynamic irrigation\n\
    management zones to be applied by VRFM.\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n3 of 23\n2. Materials\

    \ (AW), according to [37].\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n5 of 23\nThe irrigation efficiency\
    \ (EF) was taken (Equation (6)) as 90% for the drip irrigation\nsystem [38], to\
    \ calculate sensor-based irrigation needs based on field capacity and moisture\n\
    measurement. The irrigation time was based on MAD + 30% limit, which was taken\
    \ to be\n30% of the difference between the FC and MAD values.\nThe irrigations\
    \ started before the sensors were ready to collect real-time MC data.\nAfter processing\
    \ the sensor data, only eight irrigation applications were considered for the\n\
    analyses.\n2.3.1. Water Use Comparison between User- and Sensor-Based Constant\
    \ Irrigation Rates\nThe farmer used inline linear drippers (Eurodrip-Eolos, Rivulis,\
    \ Gvat, Israel) in the\nirrigations with an irrigation intensity of 28.8 t h−1\
    \ ha−1 at an operating pressure of\n3 bar. The pressure at the end of each secondary\
    \ line was measured using a handheld\nanalog pressure gauge (Pakkens 0–6 bar)\
    \ so that the flow rate was the same and the water\ndistribution was uniform in\
    \ each irrigation plot. For each irrigation, the farmer varied the\nirrigation\
    \ time from 6 to 10 h per irrigation, depending on the job and employee status.\
    \ The\nuser irrigation rate was determined by the experience of the farmer, crop\
    \ water demands\ngiven in the irrigation guide for the Bursa-Karacabey district,\
    \ and evapotranspiration\nvalues provided by the farmer’s weather station (Metos\
    \ IMT280).\nWireless MC sensors were configured to deliver MC data every 20 min\
    \ in this study. To\nconfirm a sensor-based constant irrigation recommendation\
    \ on a given irrigation day, the\nMC value measured just before irrigation was\
    \ obtained from each sensor, and the average of\nall sensor readings was used\
    \ as the sensor-based field-scale soil MC value. Equation (6) was\nused to determine\
    \ the amount of water to be applied (irrigation need) to bring the moisture\n\
    content of the field to the field capacity for a given irrigation date. The differences\
    \ among\nthe soil moisture sensor measurements for each irrigation date were calculated\
    \ to reveal the\nrange of soil moisture content within the field. Within-field\
    \ soil moisture content variations\nwere evaluated to assess the accuracy of uniform\
    \ irrigation in the trial fields. A descriptive\nstatistics analysis was performed\
    \ in terms average, difference, standard deviation, and\ncoefficient of variance\
    \ (CV).\n2.3.2. Variable Rate Irrigation Recommendations\nThe ordinary kriging\
    \ (OK) interpolation method was implemented using ArcGIS\nArcMap v10.8 (ESRI Redlands,\
    \ Redlands, CA, USA) software to generate variable rate\nirrigation (VRI) maps.\
    \ The irrigation needs (IN, mm da−1, where 1.0 da = 0.1 ha) were\nmapped with\
    \ three and five management zones (MZs) for each field to compare the effects\n\
    of different resolutions for irrigation. The three and five MZs were selected\
    \ to see the effects\nof the number of MZs on the variability in irrigation needs.\n\
    First, a theoretical application map was produced for the irrigation dates (2,\
    \ 5, 7, 13,\n17, 21, 25 July and 4 August) for F1 and F2, resulting in 32 maps\
    \ (8 days × 2 different\nzone maps × 2 fields). The amount of water to be applied\
    \ in each irrigation MZ was\ntabulated based on the irrigation rate and the total\
    \ area of each irrigation management zone\nin each field. The user-applied uniform\
    \ rates and variable-rate irrigation recommendations\nwere then compared to meet\
    \ the irrigation demands of the soil based on the postulated\nirrigation zones.\n\
    Then, the theoretical 3- and 5-zone irrigation need maps were further processed\
    \ for\nVRI application to be applied using a variable rate hose reel fertigation\
    \ system being\ndeveloped as part of the project. The VRFM has a working width\
    \ of 46 m, and it is proposed\nto have four sections, each to be individually\
    \ controlled for VRI applications. Thus, using\ntheoretical maps, applicable irrigation\
    \ maps were obtained for cell sizes of 11.5 m × 1 m.\nApplicable maps were presented\
    \ for the irrigation dates of 7, 17, and 25 July and 4 August\nto discuss the\
    \ effect of management zones on the water distribution within the fields and\n\
    were compared with theoretical IN maps.\nSentinel 2A satellite data were used\
    \ to generate the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI) maps corresponding\
    \ to the nearest irrigation dates. The Sentinel-2A im-\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n\
    6 of 23\nages were downloaded from https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home (accessed\
    \ on 14\nSeptember 2023) in bottom-of-atmosphere L2A format. A total of eight\
    \ images from 1 July,\n6 July, 13 July, 21 July, 26 July, and 5 August 2022, covering\
    \ the study area, atmospherically\ncorrected, and cloudless were used for analysis.\
    \ For each S2 scene, the red (band 4), and\nNIR (band 8) spectral bands with a\
    \ 10 m spatial resolution were selected for the NDVI\ncalculation according to\
    \ [39] formula.\nAdditionally, the texture (clay, silt, and sand) was mapped for\
    \ F1 and F2 in an attempt\nto find potential cause-and-effects of NDVI and soil\
    \ texture on the spatiotemporal variations\nin irrigation water needs across the\
    \ fields studied.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. User-Rate and Sensor-Based\
    \ Constant Irrigation Comparisons\nNine out of twelve sensors were utilized for\
    \ soil moisture measurements due to\nunexpected weak signals, battery, or installation\
    \ problems in three of the sensors installed\nin F1; four of the six sensors were\
    \ operable in F2 (Table 1). The average FC, PWP, and\nMAD values in F1 were approximately\
    \ 139, 66, and 37 mm, respectively. The average\nvolumetric weight of the soil\
    \ samples was 1.45 (g cm−3) with a small coefficient of variation\n(CV) value\
    \ (1.82%). Other parameters included in Table 1 had variations with CV values\n\
    ranging from approximately 4.2 to 7.3%. In F2, based on measurements performed\
    \ by the\nfour soil moisture sensors, the FC was smaller and VW was higher compared\
    \ with F1. The\nMAD values were smaller than those of F1. The coefficient of variation\
    \ of the measured\nparameters in F2, except for PWP, ranged from 2.02 to 8.46%.\
    \ The high CV value of PWP\nmay be attributed to the fewer sensors used, and hence,\
    \ to fewer data points to be averaged.\nTable 1. Laboratory results for soil samples\

    \ 23.04 t da−1 as a result of 8 h irrigation, which was 14.7% less than the\n\
    recommended rate based on the average of the soil MC measurements. The overall\

    \ and sensor-based irrigations were\n17.28–28.80 mm da−1 and 27.0–47.19 mm da−1,\
    \ respectively (Table 2). On average, through-\nout the irrigation season, the\
    \ user-based rate of irrigation water application was 45.09%\nless than the recommended\
    \ IN. In this case, the difference was more significant than that\nfor F1. Although\
    \ the farmer intended to apply water every 3–4 days after 7 July, due to\nlabor\
    \ shortage, an irrigation was skipped between 7 July and 13 July. Automated irrigation\n\
    systems can reduce the dependency on workers to accomplish time-dependent tasks.\n\
    It should be noted that the above discussion does not account for spatial variations\n\
    in irrigation needs within a field. Even for a constant irrigation rate at the\
    \ whole-field\nscale, the use of soil moisture sensors revealed opportunities\
    \ for implementing irrigation at\nmore accurate times and rates. In [40], it was\
    \ concluded that the total profit was the same\nwhen sensor-based irrigation scheduling\
    \ was compared with the user application, but the\nsensor-based application was\
    \ found to be promising in terms of water and financial savings.\nThe variations\
    \ in the measured MC values on specific irrigation dates are shown in\nFigure\
    \ 3 for F1 and F2. Figure 3 also presents the average FC, PWP, and MAD values\
    \ to\nvisualize when irrigation had to be started and terminated.\nThe MC values\
    \ were expected to be around the MAD line before the irrigation started\nand near\
    \ the FC line after the irrigation was completed. The farmer always started irrigation\n\
    at a soil moisture content slightly below the MAD + 30% value in F1 (Figure 3a).\
    \ The\nirrigation timings were slightly after than the exact irrigation times.\
    \ After irrigation, the\nsoil MC was always lower than the FC. The farmer applied\

    \ the penetration of the maize roots is\nshallower than in the later stages [3];\
    \ thus, maintaining the topsoil moisture should be\nmore important to avoid water\
    \ stress. The soil tended to generate cracks owing to the lack\nof moisture, especially\
    \ during windy periods that are common in the region. Therefore, it\nmay be recommended\
    \ to start irrigation earlier than occurred because the measured MC\nvalues before\
    \ irrigation were lower than the MAD + 30% values. MC values below the\nMAD +\
    \ 30% value in Figure 3a,b suggest that plants might have experienced water stress\n\
    during the early growth stages. To prevent this, frequent and sufficient irrigation\
    \ could\nhave been determined using the sensor-based data.\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8,\
    \ 19\n9 of 23\nFigure 3b suggests that the timing of irrigation was not accurate\
    \ for some irrigation\ndates in Field 2. The farmer started irrigating the field\
    \ at a soil MC level lower than the\nMAD + 30% value in four of the irrigations.\
    \ Furthermore, irrigation was terminated too\nearly since the after-irrigation\
    \ soil MC values were just above the MAD + 30% values and\nnot reaching the targeted\
    \ FC values. As demonstrated in Figure 3b, real-time data could\nbe used to accurately\
    \ determine the correct length and amount of irrigation, either done\nmanually\
    \ or automatically.\nFC and after-irrigation MC values were compared on each irrigation\
    \ day (Table 3). The\nMC of the soil was approximately 110 mm before irrigation\
    \ and increased to 128.2–137.5 mm\nwhile the average FC was 138.9 mm for the field.\
    \ The percent user difference in irrigation\nneeds between the user and the average\

    calculated to range from 35.94 to 47.19 mm for F2, which was a wider range than\
    \ for F1.\nThe average irrigation need for each irrigation date was greater in\
    \ F2 than in F1,\nprobably because of the different ranges between the FC and\
    \ PWP, and hence the MAD\nvalues in the two fields. The average MAD value of F1\
    \ was greater than that of F2, requiring\nmore water delivery to irrigate the\

    \ discussed in the previous subsection, irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture\n\
    sensors has the potential to improve the timing and amount of irrigation water\
    \ required.\nHowever, the above discussion was based on the average of all readings\
    \ from the soil\nmoisture sensors. As the sensors were in different parts of the\
    \ field, it would be more\nuseful to determine the spatial irrigation needs on\
    \ a given irrigation day. Table 5 shows the\ndifference between the average before-irrigation\
    \ MC values and point-based MC values\non each irrigation day. The data show that\
    \ some parts of the field required more or less\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n10 of\

    \ have been applied at S10\nif the average before-irrigation MC values had been\

    The H level irrigation rate corresponded to areas from 0.89 ha to 32.6 ha with\
    \ five-zone\nanalysis in F1 whereas three-zone analysis resulted in 0.14 ha to\
    \ 14.3 ha for H level rates on\ndifferent irrigation days. Dividing the field\
    \ into management zones shows that different\nparts of the field require different\
    \ application rates to bring the soil MC to the FC. Five\nzones depicted the distribution\
    \ of the rates more precisely for each irrigation date. In F2,\nthe zone areas\
    \ were smaller due to the smaller field size compared to that of F1. The CV\n\
    values from about 45–65% both for F1 and F2 also show that the application rates\
    \ for each\nzone need to be changed significantly over time. For instance, the\
    \ CV level of 46.7% for\nM level area in the five-zone analysis was found in areas\
    \ ranging from 3.0 ha (21 July) to\n13.87 ha (4 August). The IN maps shown in\
    \ Figures 5–8 are not readily applicable because\nof the lack of precise application\
    \ technologies that can deliver irrigation water based on\ncontour maps. The length\
    \ of the lateral pipes in a drip irrigation system is designed to\nbe the same\
    \ length in each management zone in sub-plot areas of up to four hectares in\n\
    the current practices in the Karacabey district, intersecting with the simulated\

    \ variable-rate irrigation application.\nTable 7 provides the updated sub-areas\
    \ of each management zone after the maps\nwere fitted to the widths of the sections\
    \ of the VRFM. When rectangular cells with fixed\nwidths and varying lengths were\
    \ used, the total area of each management zone changed\naccordingly. For instance,\
    \ three-zone H-level application areas for F1 ranged from 1.22 ha\nto 3.67 ha\
    \ for different irrigation dates, which were 0.90 ha to 3.26 ha in Table 6. For\
    \ F2,\nL-level areas with five-zone analysis ranged from 0.29 ha (4 August) to\
    \ 0.98 ha (21 July) in\nTable 7, whereas these areas were 0.27 ha and 0.99 ha,\
    \ respectively for 4 August and 21 July\nin Table 6. In terms of the variations\
    \ among irrigation days, the CV values were high in the\napplication maps fitted\
    \ to the VRF machine, ranging from 25.77 to 67.4%.\nThe means of three-zone areas\
    \ for H, M, and L levels were 2.22, 4.34, and 1.71 ha in\nField 1 and 0.50, 1.24,\
    \ 1.24, and 0.75 ha in Field 2. The large area differences among the\nzones show\
    \ that the constant-rate applications introduce large errors in the application\n\
    rates. Similar evaluations can be performed for a specific irrigation date. For\
    \ instance,\nfive-zone areas corresponding to 17 July in F1 range from 0.53 ha\
    \ (H level) to 4.1 ha (M level)\nwith the largest area, showing up to eight-fold\

    \ maps could be converted to applicable grids or cells\nto be used by advanced\
    \ variable rate irrigation systems. A section-controlled variable\nrate hose reel\
    \ irrigation machine (VRIM) is currently under development to implement\nthe solution\
    \ postulated in this study. Future work should adopt data fusion of weather,\n\
    electrical conductivity (EC), leaf area index (LAI), and satellite thermal and\
    \ NDVI data in\nan attempt to improve irrigation management zones for a variable\
    \ rate hose reel irrigation\nsystem. Future irrigation scheduling methods should\
    \ also focus on the management of\nsoil moisture based on an advanced understanding\
    \ of its effects on crop growth, either\nby integrating existing irrigation scheduling\
    \ methods or developing new models using\nadvanced algorithms.\nSoil Syst. 2024,\

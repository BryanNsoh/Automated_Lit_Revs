  description: Internet of things (IoT) is a promising technology that provides efficient
    and reliable techniques for automatically maintaining and monitoring an object
    with minimal human involvement. IoT is used in almost every field, like smart
    homes, automobiles, etc. One of the implementations of IoT can be seen in the
    farming sector. As we know, agriculture plays an essential role from both an economic
    point of view and feeding and providing basic needs for a considerable population.
    To achieve both aspects, the proper maintenance of agriculture is essential, which
    can be achieved by using IoT. In traditional agricultural methods, the productivity
    and quality of crops are not up to the mark, but with the help of IoT, we can
    increase both productivity and quality of crops, as IoT helps in better crop management,
    resource management, and crop monitoring. The real-time implementation of smart
    farming can be categorized into two parts. One part is the hardware section which
    includes all different sensors (soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, etc.)
    and irrigation tools. Another part is the software section, which includes cloud
    computing and network technologies (architecture, layers, and network topologies).
    Since IoT includes software and wireless communications, it can be exposed to
    specific cyber security threats such as data leakage, authorizations, authentication,
    and vulnerabilities in the smart farming ecosystem. IoT-based agriculture faces
    more challenges than security issues such as hardware malfunction, networking,
    and technical issues. Hence, IoT usage in farming is very efficient and effective.

    Location: Beijing, China SECTION I. Introduction In the field of water conservancy
    informatization, the 3D flood visualization system combines 3D visualization technology
    with traditional flood data display methods, which can intuitively display the
    evolution process and occurrence range of floods, and can provide an important
    reference for flood control decision-making. Practical 3D visualization technology
    can not only provide hydrological data to users in the most intuitive way by simulating
    real scenes, but also integrate rich interactive methods with 3D scene roaming
    and display technologies into the 3D visualization system allowing users better
    understand the key information contained in hydrological data. The system can
    greatly improve the efficiency of flood control and emergency flood control system
    scheduling decision-making. At present, the flood visualization system has been
    widely used in various regions’ flood control work, which greatly improves the
    accuracy and effectiveness of decision-making work of flood control and disaster
    prevention. However, in the current application practice of flood visualization
    systems, most of them use a two-dimensional flood evolution simulation system.
    At the visual display level, only pictures are used to mark the flood range and
    location on the map. At the same time, many current systems are based on Client/Server”
    architecture, so most of the water simulations are implemented using interfaces,
    which cannot reflect the characteristics of water well and have shortcomings such
    as poor code reusability and low execution efficiency. Therefore, in the field
    of flood visualization, for the simulation of flood water in the current flood
    visualization system, there are the following two problems: Lack of display of
    flood details; the system’s visualization page lacks flood stage changes such
    as fluctuations, flood peaks and other morphological details of flood changes
    with flow velocity; the fidelity of the flood water body is low, and the visualization
    effect is poor; At present, most of the modeling algorithms for flood water directly
    use the original waveform algorithm for simulation, which has disadvantages such
    as complex calculation and low execution efficiency and the effect of real-time
    rendering is low especially when 3D simulation is performed. Aiming at the above
    problems, this paper proposes a flood simulation method based on Perlin noise
    perturbation of FFT. By integrating the FFT algorithm and the Perlin noise algorithm
    to simulate the flood water body, on the one hand, the complex waveform of the
    flood water surface can be simulated in real time through FFT, and on the other
    hand, the Perlin noise is used to add perturbation to the wave so that the simulated
    water surface can better fit the scene with irregular flood wave surface and improve
    the authenticity of the 3D model. The method proposed in this paper can make the
    3D visualization technology more fully apply to the field of water conservancy.
    Flood routing simulation has always been the key means and important basis for
    government departments to make decisions in the face of flood control and disaster
    reduction. The 3D flood visualization technology of real scene simulation and
    real-time feedback of changes is helpful to help decision makers better analyze
    the real characteristics of flood disasters and improve the scientificity and
    efficiency of decision-making. SECTION II. Related Work Jeschke et al. [1] proposed
    a wavelet transformation that discretizes the liquid motion in terms of amplitude-like
    functions that vary over space, frequency, and direction, effectively generalizing
    Fourier-based methods to handle local interactions. Skrivan et al. [2] proposed
    a method to enhance the visual detail of a water surface simulation which takes
    a simulation as input and increases its apparent resolution by simulating many
    detailed Lagrangian water waves on top of it. The method can produce high frequency
    ripples and is easy to parallelize. Khater et al. [3] harnessed suitable wave
    transformation to make the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Peregrine (BBMP) equation give
    plentiful solitary wave solutions and many solutions have been applied to study
    the shallow water wave in ocean beaches. Ma et al. [4] proposed the method of
    combining the method of using GPU to quickly generate water surface effect simulation
    with light and shadow effects, the method only uses a small amount of sine wave
    superposition to approximately generate water surface, which not only improves
    the authenticity of water surface, but also improves the efficiency of water rendering;
    Stuhlmeier et al. [5] solved the problem of fluctuation transfer in fluid simulation
    by applying Gerstner’s nonlinear solution; Li et al. [6] introduced the idea of
    probability and statistics and proposed a ocean wave simulation method based on
    Gerstner-Rankine model, which improves the real-time performance of rendering
    on the premise of meeting the fidelity of virtual environment; Tessendorf et al.
    [7] proposed a method of retrieving ocean wave spectrum based on FFT from the
    perspective of frequency domain to simulate the water surface, and simulated the
    realistic real-time water surface scene with high flexibility; Chi et al. [8]
    proposed a broadband frequency domain beamforming method based on non-uniform
    FFT for underwater real-time 3D imaging, which greatly reduces the calculation
    order of the algorithm and improves the efficiency of real-time rendering. However,
    the existing water body modeling technology still has the problems of poor water
    modeling effect and distortion of flood simulation when applied to the field of
    flood simulation. In the specific application scenario of flood 3D visualization
    system, existing technology models cannot well reflect the characteristics of
    flood water body, and due to the complexity of modeling, it has the disadvantage
    of low execution efficiency. SECTION III. Preliminaries A. Time and Frequency
    Domains Fourier Transform is a linear integral transform that can be used to transform
    signals between time and frequency domains [9]. While Fast Fourier Transform is
    a general term for a collection of efficient and fast computational methods that
    can perform discrete Fourier transforms in time of 0(n log n). The core idea of
    the water body simulation method based on fast Fourier transform is to use the
    FFT algorithm to calculate the height of the water body surface, so as to construct
    a water body model. In detail, the algorithm combines the wave spectrum obtained
    from theoretical or water measurement statistics and a large number of sine waves
    to superimpose the waveform distribution in the frequency domain, and then performs
    the inverse FFT calculation to obtain the data in the time domain. The calculation
    obtains the real-time height of the water surface fluctuation, so various literatures
    often refer to it as a spectrum-based water body simulation method. The core of
    Fourier transform is the exchange between time domain and frequency domain [10].
    In signal analysis, time domain is used to describe the relationship between a
    physical signal or mathematical function and time, while frequency domain is used
    to describe the space or coordinate system used by frequency. The time domain
    is the most intuitive domain in our daily life. The definitions of physical quantities
    such as speed, current, power, etc. are all related to time. Although defining
    physical quantities with time as a reference will make it easier for us to understand,
    the form that is easy to understand is not necessarily the most convenient to
    calculate. So it needs to be transformed during the calculation to transform the
    intractable problems in the original space into the space that is easy to calculate,
    that is, the conversion from time domain to frequency domain. The relationship
    between time domain and frequency domain is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. The relationship
    between time domain and frequency domain. Show All The time domain image is the
    waveform that we superimpose by sine waves, and the image formed by the frequencies
    of these sine waves is the frequency domain image, also known as the spectrum.
    In Figure 1, the functions displayed in the time domain and the frequency domain
    represent the same information, which is a composite function formed by combining
    several sine functions. In the frequency domain, only one vertical line can be
    used to represent the composite function, so the calculations are greatly simplified.
    Therefore, in order to realize a complex wave, we only need to generate a frequency
    domain image, that is the spectrum, and the water surface wave model corresponding
    to the spectrum can be obtained by inverse Fourier transform. B. Fast Fourier
    Transform Assuming f is a Lebesgue integrable function on the complex plane, the
    continuous Fourier transform F of f for any real number ω can be defined as: F(ω)=
    ∫ ∞ −∞ f(t) e −iωt dt (1) View Source In (1), ω represents the angular frequency
    of the signal function, and F(ω) is a complex number, which represents the amplitude
    and phase of the signal at this frequency. Then the corresponding inverse Fourier
    transform (IFT) is: f(t)= 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ F(ω) e iωt dω (2) View Source In practical
    applications, the functions we usually analyze are discrete in the time and frequency
    domains, and the computer cannot handle the continuous integration behavior in
    the Fourier transform, so it is usually sampled discretely. For discrete samples
    f[n] of the original function f(t) its discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is defined
    as: F[k]= ∑ n=0 N−1 f[n] e − 2π N ikn (3) View Source Then the corresponding inverse
    discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is: f[n]= 1 N ∑ k=0 N−1 F[k] e 2π N ikn (4)
    View Source In (3) and (4), k represents the discrete frequency of the signal
    function, and n is the discrete signal sampling point where 0≤k≤N,0≤n≤N According
    to the above analysis, we can know that if the wave height of the flood h(x, z,
    t) is defined as a time domain signal on the plane x−z , according to the principle
    of Fourier transform, this signal can be approximately regarded as the superposition
    of a large number of sinusoidal signals. Therefore, as long as the frequency spectrum
    h( ω x , ω z ) of the water surface wave is obtained, h(x, z, t) can be obtained
    through IDFT, thus, the height field of water surface waves is obtained. The schematic
    diagram of the relationship between spectrum and water surface simulation is shown
    in Figure 2. Figure 2. The relationship between spectrum and water surface simulation.
    Show All In practical applications, considering the limitation of computer performance,
    the method of solving IDFT by brute force will consume a lot of CPU resources,
    so the FFT algorithm is introduced [10]. The core idea of the FFT algorithm is
    to use the idea of divide and conquer [11]. The schematic diagram is shown in
    Figure 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the original DFT8 is decomposed into two DFT4s through
    the idea of parity divide and conquer. The 2 DFT4s are calculated first, and then
    the result of DFT8 can be obtained by simple processing using butterfly process.
    For an FFT of length N, it can be divided into log 2 N stages, each stage has
    a total of N 2 butterfly units, and each butterfly unit only needs to perform
    one complex multiplication and two complex additions. So a total of complex multiplication
    needs to be calculated N 2 log 2 N times, and complex addition needs to be calculated
    N log 2 N times. The time complexity of the FFT algorithm is N log 2 N , while
    the time complexity of the ordinary Fourier transform algorithm is N2, and when
    N is larger, the efficiency of FFT algorithm is higher. It is a fast method to
    calculate the DFT and can call the computing power of the GPU well, greatly improving
    the computing efficiency. Figure 3. Divide and conquer principle of FFT algorithm
    Show All The water simulation method based on the FFT algorithm is not only globally
    controllable, but also can outline the very rich details of the model, which greatly
    shows the authenticity of the model. Therefore, it is widely used in game development,
    film and television and other water body surface rendering solutions. SECTION
    IV. 3D Modeling Method In this paper, a FFT flood simulation modeling method based
    on Perlin noise perturbation is proposed. The modeling method is shown in Figure
    4, and the specific steps are: First initialize the parameters, that is, set the
    initial plane, time, wave frequency, initial point and coordinates, and then calculate
    the spectrum h ~ ( k X ,  k Z ,t) of each point according to the Philip spectrum,
    where ( k X ,  k Z ) is the frequency domain coordinate, and the parameter t represents
    the spectrum changes with time; The water surface height is defined as the airspace
    signal h(x, z) on the airspace plane, and then according to the spectrum result
    calculated in step (1), the unperturbed water surface height h(x, z, t) is obtained
    through the row IFFT operation and the column IFFT operation respectively, and
    the conversion from the frequency domain to the airspace is realized; Define a
    lattice structure, determine the coordinates of the point as the input of the
    noise algorithm, calculate the distance vector between the input point and each
    adjacent lattice vertex, and multiply the vector to obtain the dot product; Use
    the ease curve to calculate the degree of ease, which is used as a weighting coefficient
    to weight the dot product, and the Perlin noise value corresponding to the input
    point is obtained by interpolation; The water surface height is perturbed by the
    Perlin noise to generate a new water body model. Figure 4. Modeling Method Process
    Show All A. Water Wave Modeling Methods In the actual application of FFT water
    surface simulation, the Phillips spectrum is usually used. Through the calculated
    spectrum, the height of the water surface can be further calculated. The formula
    for calculating the Philip spectrum is as follows: h(k,t)= h 0 ( k ⃗  ) e iω(k)t
    + h ∗ 0 (− k ⃗  ) e −iω(k)t (5) View Source In (5), h ∗ 0 represents the conjugate

    with the transformation process of FFT, the process of FFT simulation of water

    IFFT according to (16) to obtain A( u ′ , v ′ ,t) ; Get each h(x,z,t) according
    to (18). B. Noise Realization Method In computer graphics, the basis for noise
    generation is actually random numbers [12]. White noise is the simplest noise,
    and its generation principle is the generation of a random number. In real-life
    scenes, such as water flow and mountains, the random components in them are not
    completely independent, and their shapes tend to be fractal, containing a variety
    of details. Therefore, simple white noise cannot simulate these natural scenes
    well. In view of the shortcomings of white noise, Ken Perlin [13] proposed the
    Perlin noise algorithm. The core of the algorithm is to use the idea of interpolation
    to make the noise better simulate all things in nature with a smooth change trend
    [14]. The core idea of Perlin noise is to interpolate between two adjacent points
    through randomly generated gradients and mitigation functions, so as to achieve
    the purpose of smooth transition between points [15]. In multivariate differential
    calculus, gradient is defined as the partial derivative of a function for each
    coordinate axis, which represents the direction in which the function changes
    fastest in space, while in Perlin noise, the gradient is randomly generated. Further,
    the noise function is actually a pseudo-random function generation method, which
    has the following two characteristics: For the same input, the function has the
    same output, so it is not really random, but pseudo-random; For different inputs,
    when the variation difference is large, it will cause random variation of the
    output. For one-dimensional Perlin noise, the gradient is a random floating point
    number in the range [0,1]. For two-dimensional or three-dimensional Perlin noise,
    the directional gradients generated by points are usually used to form a random
    gradient vector set and then use Monte Carlo simulation method to selects the
    stochastic gradient vectors that meet the conditions from the set [16]. Two-dimensional
    Perlin noise generally selects some vectors in different directions in the unit
    circle, and three-dimensional Perlin noise selects some vectors in different directions
    in the three-dimensional unit sphere. In order to make the noise appear more realistic,
    Ken Perlin introduced ease curve to ease the interpolation process, which effectively
    solved the problem that adjacent noise points were obviously discontinuous during
    the linear interpolation process. The first ease curve used is the Hermite function,
    which is calculated as follows: φ(x)=−2 x 3 +3 x 2 (19) View Source Since the
    second derivative of Hermite function φ ′′ =−12x+6 is not equal to 0 at x=0 and
    x=1 , this makes their second derivatives discontinuous at adjacent lattices.
    Therefore, Ken Perlin improved on the original curve and proposed a new ease curve:
    φ(x)=6 x 5 −15 x 4 +10 x 3 (20) View Source The new ease curve is a quintic polynomial,
    and its second and first derivatives are both 0 at x=0 and x=1 Compared with the
    original curve, the resulting noise is smoother at the lattice boundaries. This
    new curve solves the problem of the continuity of the second-order derivative
    of the Hermite function, so that the noise generated by the algorithm can better
    simulate various details of natural affairs, thereby further expanding the use
    of noise in computer graphics. Two-dimensional Perlin noise generation process
    is shown in Figure 5, and the specific steps are: Define a lattice structure,
    and each lattice vertex has a pseudo-random gradient vector (actually a vector).
    For two-dimensional Perlin noise, the lattice structure is a plane grid, and for
    three-dimensional it is a cubic grid; Input a point (two-dimensional is two-dimensional
    coordinates, three-dimensional is three-dimensional coordinates, n-dimensional
    is n-dimensional coordinates), we find those lattice vertices adjacent to it (4
    in 2D, 8 in 3D, there are 2n in n dimension), calculate the distance vector from
    the point to each lattice vertex, and then do point multiplication with the gradient
    vector on the vertex respectively to obtain 4n point multiplication results; Use
    ease curve φ(x)=6 x 5 −15 x 4 +10 x 3 to calculate their weighted sums. Use the
    ease curve to calculate the ease between the input point and the adjacent lattice
    vertices, and use it as a scale factor to weight the dot product calculated in
    the previous step, and finally obtain the Perlin noise value corresponding to
    the input point through interpolation. Figure 5. Two-dimensional Perlin noise
    generation process Show All In the research of this paper, using (x, z) in the
    three-dimensional coordinate system as the input point of Perlin noise, a noise
    can be generated to perturb the water surface height value in the current coordinate,
    thereby simulating a more realistic flood scene. As shown in Figure 5, (x, z)
    represents the input point of the noise sought, and floor(x) represents the function
    of rounding down the variable x, then set x 0 =floor(x) , z 0 =floor(z) , x 1
    = x 0 +1 , z 1 = Z 0 +1 ; let Grad(i,j) be the generation function of the pseudo-random
    gradient vector, then the dot product of input point and the point of the adjacent
    lattice vertices is: g 00 =Grad( x 0, , z 0 )⋅((x,z)−( x 0 , z 0 )) (21) View
    Source g 10 =Grad( x 1 , z 0 )⋅((x,z)−( x 1 , z 0 )) (22) View Source g 01 =Grad(
    x 0, , z 1 )⋅((x,z)−( x 0 , z 1 )) (23) View Source g 11 =Grad( x 1 , z 1 )⋅((x,z)−(
    x 1 , z 1 )) (24) View Source Using φ(x)=6 x 5 −15 x 4 +10 x 3 as the ease curve,
    the proportional coefficients φ(x− x 0 ) and φ(z− z 0 ) corresponding to x and
    z can be calculated by substituting x− x 0 and z− z 0 into the ease curve respectively.
    Let α= g 00 +( g 10 − g 00 )⋅φ(x− x 0 ) (25) View Source β= g 01 +( g 11 − g 01
    )⋅φ(x− x 0 ) (26) View Source Then the final calculation formula of two-dimensional
    Perlin noise based on point (x, z) is: Noise perlin (x,z)=α+(β−α)⋅φ(z− z 0 ) (27)
    View Source C. Realization of Water Wave Simulation Algorithm The basic idea of
    the FFT simulation algorithm under Perlin noise perturbation is to superimpose
    the water surface height model generated by the FFT algorithm with the Perlin
    noise to generate a new water surface height map. The core of the FFT to generate
    the water surface model is to generate a number of sinusoids through the spectrum,
    and after the accumulation, the final water surface waveform is obtained. However,
    due to the periodicity of the sinusoidal function, the wave surface of the flood
    model finally formed by the FFT algorithm is relatively stable, symmetrical and
    periodic, so it cannot well simulate the real scene with irregular flood water.
    On the other hand, the fluctuation of the flood water wave surface will have a
    certain impact on the nearby waveforms. Simple white noise is too random and non-directional,
    and cannot simulate the details of the interaction of water surface fluctuations.
    Perlin noise, a kind of lattice-based gradient noise, can solve this problem very
    well. For a given input point (x, z), use the pseudo-random vector of the adjacent
    four integer lattice points to do a dot product with the distance vector of that
    point. The point multiplication result obtained is smoothed by using the easing
    curve, that is, interpolating, so as to construct a two-dimensional noise wave
    model with smooth and easing. And the FFT flood simulation algorithm based on
    Perlin noise perturbation is to use the generated two-dimensional Perlin noise
    as the perturbation in the direction y of the water surface model generated by
    (x, z) in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system XYZ, and perturb the
    height of each point, thereby generates new water surface height field to add
    rich detail to flood surface fluctuations. The calculation formula of FFT water
    surface height and the calculation formula of two-dimensional Perlin noise have
    been deduced above, which are (7) and (27) respectively. The formula for calculating
    the water surface height after Perlin noise perturbation is: H(x,z,t)=h(x,z,t)+
    Noise perlin (x,z) (28) View Source SECTION V. Experimental Results and Analysis
    In this paper, several common water modeling algorithms in the application of
    3D flood visualization under the same operating environment are compared with
    the FFT flood simulation algorithm based on Perlin noise perturbation proposed
    in this paper. The experimental effect diagram of water body is shown below, and
    the experimental setting is shown in Table 1. A. Experimental Environment TABLE
    I Experimental Environment Setting B. Model Presentation Figure 6 is a water body
    model constructed by simulating the wave surface of a sine wave. It can be seen
    from the experimental effect diagram that the peak of the water surface constructed
    by the sine wave is round and periodic, which is more suitable for simulating
    a calm water surface. Figure 6. Water wave simulation model based on sine wave
    Show All Figure 7 is a water body model constructed by simulating the wave surface
    of Gerstner wave. Gerstner wave is an improved method of sine wave. It can be
    seen from the experimental renderings that although the peak of the water surface
    model constructed by Gerstner is sharp, it does not change its periodicity. Therefore,
    it cannot effectively simulate the real scene with irregular flood wave surface.
    Figure 7. Gerstner wave simulates water surface Show All Figure 8 shows the water
    body model constructed by the FFT algorithm based on Perlin perturbation proposed
    in this paper. It can be seen from the experimental results that the algorithm
    proposed in this paper has sharper and more complex water surface crests than
    sine waves and Gerstner waves in line with the real scene of the flood. Figure
    8. FFT simulated water surface under Perlin noise perturbation Show All Figure
    9 is a comparison diagram of the effect of the original FFT algorithm and the
    water model constructed by the FFT algorithm based on Perlin noise perturbation
    proposed in this paper. Figure 9. Comparison of modeling effects Show All From
    the Figure 9, that the water wave surface of the FFT algorithm after adding Perlin
    noise perturbation is more irregular. Because the Perlin noise can better simulate
    the effect of the interaction between flood waves, the improved model can make
    the modeled water body more conform to the laws of nature, thereby effectively
    improving the similarity between the virtual modeling water model and the real
    flood. It can be concluded from the above experiments that the FFT flood simulation
    algorithm based on Perlin noise perturbation proposed in this paper can well simulate
    the real characteristics of floods in 3D scenes, and can greatly improve the authenticity
    of flood virtual simulation in 3D flood visualization system. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    In this paper, through the analysis and derivation of traditional Fourier transform,
    FFT algorithm and Perlin noise algorithm, a FFT flood simulation based on Perlin
    noise perturbation is proposed. The method combines the fast Fourier water body
    model and Perlin noise algorithm. Under the premise of taking full advantage of
    the high real-time water modeling of FFT algorithm, the method effectively simulates
    the specific details of water ripples with the smooth characteristics of Perlin
    noise, and realizes the authenticity of flood water modeling. Applying this method
    to the flood visualization system can more truly simulate the process of flood
    routing and improve the authenticity and timeliness of flood routing simulation.
    It is hoped that the work of this paper can provide some help for flood control.

    Internet is increasing geometrically [2]. In IoT, every device is having its own
    identity, but it is very difficult to identify the particular device among billion
    of devices. Through the sensors, they can sense the environment generate an enormous
    amount of data which is monitored and further processed to get valuable information
    from it. The basic component of the IoT environment are sensors, actuators, software,
    and network [3]. The main goal of creating IoT devices is to make human life easier
    and more comfortable but most of the devices are not designed to face security
    and privacy issues and thus, face major challenges related to security and privacy
    concerns like integrity, confidentiality, authentication, etc. [4]. Self-configuring
    and dynamic behavior are the characteristics of the IoT devices. Along with the
    advantages it has various security and privacy issues as well because of the nature
    of the IoT devices. The major problem in IoT is because of the heterogeneous nature
    of the devices. Every device needs a different kind of security [5]. IoT systems
    are quite complex so the data will go through different types of entities along
    the way, which makes securing IoT applications particularly challenging. Basically,
    it is required to consider the security across different stages. For example-
    It is required to consider secure hardware which will run a secure OS by loading
    a trusted firmware into the smart devices which will be able to establish a secure
    communication channel with the cloud backend. On the cloud side we need to host
    a number of security-related services to ensure the confidentiality, data-integrity
    and availability based on those security services. Sensors and the nodes are exposed
    to the environment and because of resource constrained they are more vulnerable
    to various kinds of attacks. Threats represents the exploit potential of a scenario.
    Every threat has a threat actor, this could be human, or it could be anything.
    The fundamental of information assurance is confidentiality, keeping data secure
    from eavesdropping there are many tools that can be used to enable confidentiality
    of our data but one of the primary tools is cryptography. Integrity protection
    is another critical aspect of information assurance, for this issue another tool
    that is hash algorithm can be used. For ensuring authentication digital signature
    can be used. Non- repudiation is another security service, it requires both technical
    and procedural controls and can result in an entity not being able to later deny
    an action that entity performed. Availability ensures that information is available
    when needed. The threat is based on a vulnerability that can be exploited given
    an identified vulnerability, the threat actor will plan and execute an attack
    against the system If successful this will result in the compromise of that system,
    events do not stop here however, oftentimes once an attacker gains access to a
    system they can pivot to lateral or higher value systems within an enterprise.
    In this paper section 2 presents the architecture of the IoT, about the layers
    and the security concerns related to the layers. In next section Blockchain is
    explained and how it emerged as a solution to the IoT security along with some
    limitations of the blockchain is presented. In section 4, open issues and future
    scope is defined and in the last section conclusion is derived about the paper.
    SECTION II. Architecture of IoT with Security and Privacy Concern There are basically
    three layers in the architecture of IoT that is defined below in detail. Perception
    layer, Network layer and the Application layer. Perception layer is lower most
    layer having components like sensors, RFID etc. that is having the ability to
    sense the environment. The data coming from the sensors are pass on to the next
    layer that will aggregate the data. In the processing layer, it processes the
    data and make it valuable. Finally, the application layer deals with the decision
    making and provides the back- end services. IoT is capable enough to solve various
    problems in different fields but it also faces so many issues in terms of privacy
    and security issues. This section briefly describes about the layers of the architecture
    of IoT along with the possible issues related to each layer. A. Perception Layer
    It is the external or the lower most layer that comprises the sensors that senses
    the environment and gathers the information of the surroundings. It is also known
    as the device layer. The sensors used to sense everything. According to the application
    the corresponding sensors are used and devices like RFID, 2-D barcode, actuators
    etc. are used. Information such as about the weather, air, environment changes,
    about the location. These types of information are recorded by the sensors. The
    security concern in this layer is as the sensors can be easily replaceable by
    the attackers. Thus, raise to security threats like- node capture, Replay Attack,
    Eavesdropping [6]. Other attacks like DoS, Brute force attack, hardware jamming
    [7]. Security mechanisms like sensor data protection or encryption can be used.
    Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer is represented in the table
    I. Node Capture It is one among the serious attack by which attacker can perform
    many types of attacks on the network. The attacker can easily capture the whole
    network and can gets the access of the entire network. It can lead to the security
    breaches and the privacy of the communicating parties The universe is immense
    and it seems to be homogeneous, in a large scale, everywhere we look at. is compromised.
    Communication between the sender and receiver can also be listen by the attacker
    [8]. Thus, it is a very serious hazards in the perception layer. Fig. 1. Architecture
    of IoT with challenges Show All Replay Attack Replay attack is the attack that
    is possible in the perception layer. It is the attack in which an attacker captures
    the network and starts communicating as the authorized user to the authorized
    destination. To prevent this kind of attack sequence number or timestamps can
    be used. It helps in authenticating the user [9]. User having packets of appropriate
    timestamp is only allowed and if the timestamp is beyond the certain limit, then
    that packet will be discarded immediately. Eavesdropping When the unauthorized
    person listens to the communication that is happening between the sender and the
    receiver without the knowledge of these users. It can be of two types active and
    passive. In case of passive eavesdropping the attacker just listens to the communication
    but will not make any changes into that message. But, in case of active one the
    intruder can make changes in the message. Denial of Service In case of this attack,
    it will cause chaos or disruption into the network. DoS attempts to prevent a
    website or some web service from operating normally by overwhelming it with requests.
    Intruder or unauthorized person bombarded the network with false requests as a
    result when the authorized user wants to access the resource the server deny that
    request as it is already down thus not capable enough to handle the additional
    requests [7]. Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer is represented
    in the table I. Table I Security and privacy issues in perception layer B. Network
    Layer This layer is a bridge between the internet and IoT devices. It is the external
    hardware like Wi-Fi, ZigBee, etc. [9]. It helps in transferring and processing
    the data that comes from one layer and transmitted to next layer. This layer commonly
    known as the transmission layer and works as a bridge between the layers. It mainly
    transmits the data that it collected from the perception layer through the sensing
    devices. It is very much sensitive and have some security issues like authentication,
    integrity and others. Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer is represented
    in the table II. Table II Security and privacy issues in network layer C. Application
    Layer Application layer is the topmost layer in the IoT architecture, work of
    this layer is to mainly deals with making the decision and also it provides the
    back-end services. It allows the monitoring of user''s data as well. The application
    of the IoT is defined by this layer. It also defines about the devices or system
    in which IoT has deployed. Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer
    is represented in the table III. Table III Security and privacy issues in application
    layer D. Other Challenges in IoT Major issues faced by the IoT are discussed above
    related to security. Apart from the discussed issues other challenges faced by
    the IoT are related to regulatory issues, economic issues, interoperability, scalability,
    developmental issues are also there [14]. There are Other challenges are big data
    generation, architectural dependencies, robustness, scalability and many more.
    1) Robustness Robustness is mainly the ability to cope up with the execution errors.
    It is the smooth flow of work despite having irregularity in the calculations
    or in the input. In IoT devices it is important to know about the location and
    about their interaction with other devices based on certain parameters like power
    levels of the communication, schedules of waking up and sleeping. 2) Scalability
    Scalability is one of the challenges in the IoT environments as devices are growing
    at faster rate. So, to provide proper storage facility, proving authentications
    are the big issues. The devices are battery operated and some require their own
    source for energy. Data collection and storage and use can affect the scale of
    the IoT. 3) Generation of Big Data Sensors of the IoT devices are collecting enormous
    amount of data continuously from the environment. So, there is a need of the hour
    to build a plan of action to convert these data into useful information. 4) Absence
    of Common Standard As there are many levels of IoT devices and IoT manufacturing
    industries. Therefore, it is a great challenge to distinguish between approved
    and offline devices connected to the Internet [15]. SECTION III. Blockchain as
    a Solution for IoT A. Blockchain Blockchain are becoming more in demand these
    days. It is nothing but the block of chains. Each block contains a number of transactions,
    which record status of certain events. This approach initially defined by the
    researcher''s group and was originally intended to timestamp digital documents.
    This will make the tampering difficult and also impossible to backdate them. They
    have some interesting property like once some data have been recorded inside blockchain,
    it becomes very difficult to change it [16]. The data that is being stored inside
    the block depends on hash and hash of the previous block. The block and the content
    inside the block are identified by the hash and it is always unique like our fingerprint.
    The hash has been calculated at the time of block creation. So, hash gets changed
    as the data changes. So, hash is very useful if we want to detect the changes
    to blocks. Hash of previous block effectively creates a chain of blocks and it''s
    this technique that makes a Blockchain so secure. Blockchain provides a number
    of salient properties like decentralization, which means blockchain is run by
    a committee of nodes in a peer-to-peer manner. Another is immutability, blockchain
    uses cryptographic hash functions to link all of the blocks together to ensure
    data is immutable. Next is transparency, blockchain provides a fully auditable
    and valid ledger of transactions [17]. The fourth property is security and resilience,
    each blockchain node or entity is associated with a pair of private or public
    keys. Fifth one is automation- blockchain enables users to build streamlined applications
    to deal with complex business processes that involve multiple intermediaries using
    a more powerful concept that is smart contract. B. Blockchain with IoT IoT can
    make use of blockchain to secure the IoT system. This integration can be used
    to make policies and can monitor the actions using smart contracts. Integration
    of blockchain with IoT will give valuable results. Blockchain enhances the IoT
    by providing trusted sharing services, the information is traceable. When Blockchain
    is used, the source of the data can be identifiable and thus, security can be
    enhanced. Therefore, Blockchain acts a remedy for securing the IoT and make it
    more reliable. It is also proved that the blockchain is identified as a key to
    the problems related to scalability, reliability and privacy concerns in the IoT
    paradigm. As there are so many salient features of blockchain, if we integrate
    blockchain with IoT then using the decentralization features, it will eliminate
    the single point failures efficiently [18]. Immutability ensures data integrity
    in the system, by using the transparency property, the status of the connected
    devices and the associated physical assets are tracked. Security and resilience
    enable to authenticate users and devices efficiently. Using smart contracts, a
    trust can be built among the different IoT processes and eventually eliminate
    trusted intermediaries and reduce system costs. With blockchain technology and
    smart contracts a trusted IoT systems can be build that can be used to power a
    wide range of IoT applications across different industry sectors. Blockchain can
    be used a remedy for security and privacy issues of IoT as it eliminates the concept
    of central server system of IoT and also it provides to flow the data using the
    distributed ledger of blockchain. As in IoT, a centralized server is responsible
    for collecting, maintaining and for the flow of data. If devices want to access
    the data, then then this central server plays an important role. Thus, there is
    a huge concern that IoT suffers from that is single point failure. To solve this
    issue, Blockchain is capable as to eliminate the central server a decentralized
    network, distributed file system is required [19]. Blockchain helps in enhancing
    the privacy of IoT devices and thus will help in building a robust system. It
    also makes device coordination easy. In Blockchain distributed ledger allows proper
    authentication of data and helps in making accurate interpretation. Blockchain
    with IoT makes the IoT system more secure and more reliable. C. Blockchain Challenges
    There are some issues that arises while we adopt Blockchain with IoT. Blockchain
    integration with IoT can help in many aspects like it can solve the privacy issues
    and also increases the reliability but this technology is also having some limitations
    which can affect the performance. The challenges arise due to the limitation such
    as the lack of skilled person, lack of proper legal issues, lack of storage facility,
    variation in computing capabilities, limited developments in technology, computing
    capabilities, processing time and scalability issues [20]. This integration is
    significant but the nature of both the technology is quite dissimilar. Blockchain
    is designed to work with powerful computers and the reality of IoT is different.
    Some challenges arise due to this integration is Storage capabilities, the scalability
    of blockchain is still having some issues and thus, appears to be not suitable
    for the applications of the IoT. IoT devices generate huge amount of data but
    current blockchain can able to process only few transactions in one second so
    this is a major challenge for the IoT. Other issues with Blockchain are related
    to some legal issues like the laws dealing with the information handling and privacy
    concerns that has to be tackled in the IoT. There are so many advantages of using
    blockchain with the IoT but if we used it carefully and with proper caution then
    only it will become an advantage for securing the IoT. Blockchain can revolutionize
    the IoT as it can help to improve the applications of the IoT. Integration of
    blockchain with IoT solves so many issues that are faced by the IoT system. This
    integration speeds up the interaction between citizens, companies, and the government
    [21]. The main aim of this section is to provide a ground for the future research
    directions for the researcher in the same domain. This section discusses the open
    issues that still need to be addressed to secure the IoT systems. In the security
    of the IoT, challenges like identity management, storage capabilities, unauthorization,
    data communication are still the issue which needs to be taken care of. Fig. 2.
    Blockchain integration benefits Show All SECTION IV. Open Issues and Future Scope
    There are so many advantages of using blockchain with the IoT but if we used it
    carefully and with proper caution then only it will become an advantage for securing
    the IoT. Blockchain can revolutionize the IoT as it can help to improve the applications
    of the IoT [22]. Integration of blockchain with IoT solves so many issues that
    are faced by the IoT system. This integration speeds up the interaction between
    citizens, companies, and the government [23]. The main aim of this section is
    to provide a ground for the future research directions for the researcher in the
    same domain. This section discusses the open issues that still need to be addressed
    to secure the IoT systems. In the security of the IoT, challenges like identity
    management, storage capabilities, un-authorization, data communication are still
    the issue which needs to be taken care of. Conclusion The evolution of IoT makes
    the life better of mankind. The idea of IoT is to modernize the life of a common
    man and to enhance the quality of the life with less human intervention and with
    less human effort. The idea is to connect various devices with the internet and
    how to make intelligent decisions. IoT allows us to automate everything around
    us. The day is not really far when machine will interact with the machine without
    any involvement of the humans and will achieve greater efficiency in every field.
    This paper outlines the major security and privacy issues based on each layer
    of the IoT architecture. Other challenges apart from the security and privacy
    issues like interoperability, scalability, legal issues are also discussed. Blockchain
    is considered as one of the remedies for the possible solution for the IoT. Hence,
    it is the need of the time to develop a secure IoT system based on blockchain
    that will meet up all the requirements of the future. The integration of Blockchain
    with IoT is discussed in a detailed manner. But these are two different technology
    having different nature thus having certain limitations and challenges like data
    storage, some legal issues related with blockchain still need to be addressed.
    This paper tries to give a better idea about the future scope of the integration
    of blockchain as a solution. Still, some open issues are there which need to be
    addressed have been discussed along with the future direction to help the new
    researchers. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Abstract Smart cities are developed to optimize operations across the city such

    communications5GInternet of ThingsSmart cities 1. Introduction A city is considered
    smart when its existing infrastructure is combined with the technology to provide
    a better quality of life [1]. Fig. 1 illustrates the various smart city solutions.
    These solutions can be used for checking the parking space availability [2], weather
    adaptive operation of street lights [3], detection of trash levels in bins for
    optimized collection routes [4], making intelligent highways with warning messages
    according to the weather [5], [6], etc. The physical devices used in these systems
    can be integrated with electronic sensors, mobile devices, and information technology
    in order to provide real time decisive power [7]. Internet of Things (IoT) transforms
    the standalone objects to cyber–physical objects that lead to smarter cities [8].
    IoT provides real time access [9] and monitoring of information like warehouse
    stock details [10], patient health condition in hospital [11], fault intimation
    of machines [12], etc. Statistics indicate that by 2025, 75 billion IoT devices
    [13] will produce 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) of data [14], which is gigantic. Therefore,
    larger bandwidth for communication is required for catering to the requirements
    of IoT networks [15]. Moreover, any latency in the transfer of real time data
    can be catastrophic [16]. Given the above needs, the fifth-generation mobile networks
    (5G) are the most suitable technology for IoT enabled applications of smart cities
    [17] as they would enable higher transmission capabilities like higher bandwidths,
    ultra low latency, etc. [18]. Download : Download high-res image (199KB) Download

    lives. 5G offers cellular as well as Device to Device (D2D) communications to
    provide greater bandwidth and ultra low latency required for IoT enabled applications
    of smart cities [19]. Specifically, the D2D communications that occur in 5G is
    possible through cellular services and through WiFi (wireless fidelity) Direct
    [20]. Although cellular coverage is widely useful but it fails to facilitate smart
    city applications in areas with no or partial coverage [21]. On the other hand,
    WiFi Direct operates without intermediate infrastructure and offers increased
    data rate and even lesser latency [22]. WiFi Direct can easily facilitate the
    close proximity communications for various smart city applications [23]. The review
    of the requirements of smart cities discloses that D2D services provided via WiFi
    Direct is the most appropriate technology to implement smart city applications
    [24], [25]. Although the technology is best fit for the IoT enabled smart city
    applications [26], [27], [28] but has some security threats [29], which if not
    taken care can prove fatal for the whole communication system [30]. There are
    many risk elements that jeopardize the D2D communications. Node impersonation,
    eavesdropping and message modification are some of the major attacks [31]. Attackers
    can easily sneak up on the information being shared on the wireless medium [32].
    Consequently, sensitive data is exposed to misuse [33]. An attacker can also act
    as a legitimate node when it is not one; the receiver cannot decipher the real
    identity of the sender [34]. The message payload can be modified by an attacker,
    resulting in misinterpretation and uncertain outcomes [35]. Illegitimate entities
    can disrupt the private communication between devices, otherwise called as Man-in-the-middle
    (MITM) attack [36]. Hence, it becomes very crucial to verify the legitimacy of
    the sender and receiver which is why mutual authentication is required [37], [38],
    [39]. The communication of the legitimate entities can also be interrupted by
    initiating a flood attack wherein the target device is bombarded with discovery
    requests, making it difficult to communicate with the right device on time [40],
    [41]. Strong discovery protocols are the need of the hour when it comes to D2D
    communications even though it is a very promising technology. Clearly, the D2D
    communications needs protection from these security hazards (e.g., MITM, DoS,
    etc.) in order to be useful for the data transmission. The security measures must
    prevent any unauthorized identity to communicate with the authorized identity.
    There must be some mechanism through which the two genuine parties should exchange
    keys with each other securely without being captured by an attacker. As a solution
    to the aforementioned issues, we propose a mutual authentication and pairwise
    key establishment method that can certify the devices before any actual exchange
    of information occurs. 1.1. Research contribution This article proposes a security
    protocol for the D2D communications to protect the sensitive applications of smart
    cities. The important contributions of the article are summarized as follows:
    • We propose a lightweight and strong mutual authentication and key agreement
    protocol for D2D communications. • To achieve the robustness and lightweightness,

    protocol. 2. Background The direct transmission of data between two devices through
    radio signals without having to go through a base station or cellular network
    in D2D communications brings unprecedented benefits [42]. Bypassing the infrastructure
    to enable communication reduces cost, improves efficiency and offers low latency
    [43]. D2D allows spontaneous sharing and exchange of information that speeds up
    the utility of smart devices enabled by the Internet of things (IoT) [44]. The
    close proximity of devices that enable D2D is making it one of the most essential
    technologies in applications spread across smart cities like smart parking, area
    surveillance, waste management, etc. [21]. The assistance provided by the cloud
    servers in various real time applications [40] is enhanced by the presence of
    the communicating devices in each other’s vicinity as it enables faster data offloading
    [45]. In small spaces, D2D communications using WiFi Direct dispenses a faster
    data rate that saves data exchange and computation costs [46]. D2D using WiFi
    Direct, which is an extension of the traditional WiFi, makes the provision of
    a scalable framework by omitting the need of Access Points (APs) [47]. The devices
    do not require any AP for communication rather the devices themselves act as AP
    to form peer-to-peer groups [48]. The device serving as AP is also recognized
    as group owner (GO) [49]. GO device can send the GO signal as a relay for communication
    amongst all the devices in the group [50]. There is no loss of quality or energy
    in this method of communication as compared to the traditional data exchange through
    WiFi adhoc and IEEE 802.11z [51]. An open network is most susceptible to blockage
    and this is the biggest challenge in D2D communications [52]. Most D2D applications
    consist of sensitive data and any tampering with it can cause irreversible damage
    [53]. The security loopholes of open access channels allow the cyber attackers
    to easily create fake setup links and cause network disruptions [54]. Since the
    open medium is the leverage of the D2D communication, it becomes more obvious
    for the devices to protect themselves [55], [56]. Security offered by the WiFi
    Protection Setup (WPS) is not robust enough for D2D communications [57], [58].
    This is why smart security protocols are the need of the hour considering the
    rising deployment of D2D using 5G in smart city applications [59], [60] directly
    concerning human safety, healthwise and livingwise. Security challenges are a
    rising area of research in D2D technologies but there is still a long way to go
    considering the available methods of protection from attacks like MITM and DoS
    [41]. When the responsibility of security is deemed to lie with the devices themselves,
    a trusted authentication mechanism between two devices can prevent the security
    risks [61]. This trusted mechanism will allow the devices to authenticate each
    other mutually followed by pairwise key establishment to prevent from prior mentioned
    attacks (MITM, DoS, etc.) [62], [63], [64], [65]. This paper introduces a strong
    mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for D2D communications over WiFi
    direct powered by IoT and driven by 5G. 2.1. WiFi Direct overview The WiFi Direct
    protocol enables the devices to establish a wireless connection without any mediator
    [66]. The peer-to-peer (P2P) communication without the access point (or a router)
    is initiated by two or more peer devices which first discover each other and then
    form a P2P group [67] as shown in Fig. 2. The devices set up a communication link
    before the full information exchange begins. Next step is the negotiation for
    the selection of a P2P GO, called the handshake process by sending out an intent
    value [68]. Each device in the P2P group sends out an intent value. The device
    possessing a greater intent value wins the negotiation and becomes the P2P GO
    which then acts as the AP as indicated in Fig. 2. This is followed by the beginning
    of a security process using WPS by the P2P GO [69]. Subsequently, IP addresses
    for both the devices are generated by the GO using Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP) [70]. Thus, the D2D connection is established successfully between
    the devices enabled with WiFi Direct. There are several applications of D2D communications,
    but two majorly witnessed applications are discussed in this section. Through
    WiFi Direct, P2P GO can share its internet services obtained from Base station
    (Cellular) with other devices (clients) of the P2P group [71]. The scenario has
    been illustrated in Fig. 3. Another scenario is presented in Fig. 4 where numerous
    devices form a localized adhoc network [72]. Devices are performing various tasks
    (e.g., image uploading, printing, file sharing, etc.) using WiFi Direct services
    at no extra cost. This feature of WiFi Direct is particularly helpful during the
    absentia of cellular services or an AP. Download : Download high-res image (102KB)

    2.2. Short-Authentication-String (SAS) based key agreement protocol The authors
    of SAS based key agreement protocol claims to introduce a novel mutual authentication
    and key establishment scheme for D2D communications; the scheme operates with
    minimum human interaction and limited cryptography operations. SAS protocol employs
    a commitment scheme where the secret value is enclosed behind the commit/open
    pair. The commit/open pair is designed in such a way that a commitment value alone
    does not disclose any information about the secret value. As demonstrated in Fig.
    5, the commit/open pair intends to provide secure mutual authentication. SAS makes
    use of traditional diffie hellman key exchange protocol as the basic underlying
    mechanism to establish the secret key. Apart from diffie hellman parameters and
    , SAS protocol generates device identifiers and along with nonces, and . Device
    employing SAS protocol generates the secret value, , and afterward computes commit/open
    pair, , wherein ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ represents commitment and disclose value, respectively
    [62]. Let us consider the following commitment scheme wherein F is a cryptographic
    hash function: • Commit: Given , randomly choose , , compute , . • Open: Let ,
    . Output w if , . In simple terms, the receiving device accepts the secret value
    if i.e., earlier received commit value. Consider a scenario, where Alice and Bob
    want to communicate using D2D communications via WiFi Direct. A couple of messages
    are exchanged between them to verify the identity of each other followed by common
    secret key generation. Initially Alice shares a commitment value with Bob as shown
    in Fig. 5. In response, Bob exchanges with Alice. Upon reception of , Alice shares
    the other value of the pair (open value, ) to allow Bob to extract the secret
    value, . Subsequently, the devices verify the identity of each other by computing
    the SAS, and . Post successful verification, both the devices compute to generate
    the secret key. In another instance, if the authentication string does not match
    ( ), the key establishment process is terminated by the devices assuming the presence
    of MITM attack. 2.3. Limitations of WiFi WPS The WiFi Direct is protected through
    the WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) that uses a secure PIN or push button configuration.
    WPS attempts to provide security by letting the WiFi Direct GO act as the registrar
    to send network security credentials to the WiFi Direct clients. Afterward, a
    set of security keys are generated by the WiFi Protected Access (WPA) protocol
    to secure the communications. However, during the investigation by the authors
    in [58], it is found that PIN can be easily discovered by the attacker within
    a small fraction of time, resulting in the revealing of secret keys and comprising
    overall communications. Besides, the attacker exploits the vulnerabilities of
    the push button configuration to get unauthorized access to the registrar or client,
    hence putting the entire ad-hoc network at high risk [73]. Since the attacker
    obtained access, messages can be intercepted and modified that can lead to irreversible
    damage to crucial real-life assets, etc. 2.4. Cryptanalysis of SAS based key agreement
    protocol We have critically analyzed the working of the SAS protocol and observed
    a few vulnerabilities. The attacker can compromise the whole network by exploiting
    these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities and its possible consequences are illustrated
    in Fig. 6 and summarized as follows: 1. Short authentication strings, and are
    said to have been compared over a trusted channel. Ideally, wireless channels
    are always considered vulnerable and subjected to attacks, primarily eavesdropping.
    Lack of trusted wireless channels is the biggest motivation behind the discovery
    of well known diffie hellman and ECC diffie hellman key exchange protocols. The
    security strength of the SAS based key agreement scheme lies in the authentication
    string ( , ) which is shared in plain text over the vulnerable wireless channel.
    Eavesdropping of the authentication string can allow the attacker to successfully
    conduct the MITM attack, thus compromising the communications. 2. The SAS based
    key agreement protocol in itself does not mention any remark on the requirement
    of time synchronization between devices. There is no lifetime ( ) or timestamp
    ( ) associated with the secret values ( , ) and SAS ( , ), thus enabling the attacker
    to misuse the information. Upon reception of the SAS in plain text, the attacker
    device can read and counterfeit the SAS. Further, the attacker can share this
    counterfeited SAS with a legitimate node to gain trust and enable the legitimate
    node to begin computations for secret key establishment. 3. Consider a scenario
    where Alice begins the communication with Bob but somehow Eve (attacker) intervenes.
    Alice initially computes, and transforms it into , pair. Eve pretends to Alice
    as Bob and receives . But Eve cannot determine unless provided with . Similarly,
    Eve pretends to Bob as Alice, computes , and sends the commit value to Bob instead
    of sending . Bob in reply, returns to Eve (considering her as Alice). Eve modifies
    the to ( ) and sends it further to Alice. Afterward, Alice shares the open value,
    with Eve which enables Eve to retrieve ( ). Instead of sending , Eve send to Bob,
    thus allowing Bob to retrieve ( ) from , pair. Currently, Alice knows , , Bob
    knows , whereas Eve knows , , , and . Since the secret values, and are exchanged,
    Alice and Bob begin the computation of a short authentication string, and . The
    computed authentication strings ( , ) are supposed to be shared by Alice and Bob
    with each other for mutual authentication. But the Eve exploits the vulnerability
    of wireless channels and intercepts the short authentication strings shared by
    Alice, , and Bob, . Since the authentication strings are in readable format and
    not tied to any timestamp/lifetime, therefore Eve gets enough time to manipulate
    the information and misuse it. Eve counterfeits the SAS of Alice and Bob and then
    share the counterfeited value, ( ) and ( ) with Alice and Bob, respectively. In
    other instance, Eve instead of counterfeiting can also produce and as Eve already
    has the knowledge of , , and . Alice and Bob verify and , respectively, and concludes
    successful mutual authentication without being aware of fraud by Eve. Post successful
    fraudulent mutual authentication, Alice produces a secret key, , Bob produces
    a secret key, , and Eve produces two secret keys, and . As a result, Alice and
    Eve hold a common key, and Bob and Eve hold a common key. As Alice and Bob are
    not aware about the presence of Eve, therefore they continue to use the fraudulent
    secret key with the belief of securing the communications, however in reality
    they were getting cheated by Eve. Investigations and analysis revealed that SAS
    based key agreement protocol is subjected to MITM attack and also not secure enough
    to be used for D2D communications. 4. SAS based key agreement protocol is partially
    protected against the DoS attack. There is no process to identify and prevent
    the DoS attack in the discovery phase. As a result, the devices waste their precious
    resources in accepting and processing bogus requests (e.g., wasting bandwidth
    and computing power for processing SAS of fraudulent requests, etc.). 5. Though
    SAS based key agreement protocol claims to verify the authentication string (
    , ) for mutual authentication purposes but lacks to verify the establishment of
    identical secret keys ( , ) at both entities. Download : Download high-res image

    attains the following significant security goals. Note that the security goals
    are adopted from [74], [75], [76]. 1. Mutual Authentication: D2D communications
    are vulnerable due to the open access nature of communication. The IoT enabled
    smart city applications produce enormous amounts of sensitive data. The access
    to this data must be restricted to legitimate nodes only to avoid misuse of precious
    information. The D2D communications can be protected by performing mutual authentication
    to verify the legitimacy of nodes before initializing the session. 2. Secret Key
    Establishment: IoT devices deployed in smart cities generate pivotal information.
    The information is exchanged with the cloud and other end users/devices through
    untrusted wireless channels. Nodes with malicious intentions can easily eavesdrop
    the information and use it for exploiting the services of legitimate nodes. Therefore,
    D2D devices must exchange a secret key through a secure process to enable ciphering,
    etc. 3. Message Integrity: Modifications in the message can destroy the essence
    of the information, thus leaving behind the bogus content of no use. Therefore,
    D2D devices must verify the integrity of the messages before using the information
    for further processing. 4. Message Freshness: Adversary can capture the messages
    due to the inherently vulnerable nature of wireless medium. The captured stale
    messages can be replayed by the adversary to get privileged access to information.
    Thus, D2D communications must ensure the use of freshness components in the message
    exchanges to protect from adversarial threats (e.g., replay). 5. Defense against
    prominent attacks: IoT networks are susceptible to threats due to vulnerabilities
    in security protocols. The impact of attack can be mild or severe and may lead
    to temporary or permanent suspension of smart city applications. Therefore, security
    protocols must be robust enough to combat against significant attacks like DoS,
    MITM, etc. 3.3. Adversary model A practical adversary model has been considered
    to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in compromised conditions.
    Considering Dolev–Yao adversary model, it is assumed that the attacker is equipped
    with a digital device and sophisticated tools with abundant computational power
    and storage capabilities. It is believed that the attacker has the knowledge to
    mount various attacks that can harm and disrupt the functioning of the IoT networks.
    For instance, the adversary can send fake requests during the discovery phase
    to the victim IoT node, thus resulting in inefficient utilization of precious
    resources due to unnecessary computation of fake requests. Besides, the attacker
    can also eavesdrop on the messages containing secret credentials that can be misused
    by the adversary to conduct known key attacks. Similarly, adversaries can replay
    the captured messages to gain unauthorized access to privileged information. The
    adversary can cleverly target the IoT nodes with MITM attack, hence resulting
    in compromising of present and future communications. Based on the attacker capabilities,
    it can be concluded that adversarial threats can have mild to severe impact on
    the IoT enabled smart city applications. 4. Proposed protocol D2D communications
    via WiFi Direct is accomplished through four different phases, i.e., discovery,
    negotiation, mutual authentication and key agreement, followed by address configuration.
    The most sensitive phases where the adversary prefers to attack are discovery
    and key agreement phases. The devices operating in the WiFi Direct (WFD) environment
    always remain partially active to respond to the probe requests of the nearby
    devices. However, the adversaries exploit the discovery mechanism by sending bogus
    probe requests to the legitimate devices, thus resulting in draining of precious
    resources such as battery, computing power, storage space, and so forth. Consequently,
    the victimized device fails to deliver the services to the legitimate devices
    i.e., Denial of Service. Besides discovery phase, key agreement phase is also
    victimized by the adversaries because interception of key exchange messages through
    MITM attack could compromise the future correspondence between devices in a D2D
    network. To counter the threat of DoS attack, the proposed scheme employs an intelligent
    filtering mechanism at discovery phase. In addition, a robust and lightweight
    mutual authentication and key establishment (MAKE) scheme at key agreement phase
    is invoked to protect the WFD enabled devices from MITM attack. The intelligent
    filtering mechanism sweeps out the malicious requests whereas the MAKE scheme
    does not allow the impersonated devices to initiate a session with the legitimate
    devices. Therefore, the proposed protocol presented in Fig. 7 can protect the
    D2D communications from DoS and MITM attacks and it can be considered as a potential
    solution for securing various smart city applications. Table 2 discusses the various
    instances where the protocol applies its intelligent algorithm to differentiate
    between malicious and legitimate probe requests. Note that two parameters namely
    Media Access Control (MAC) address and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
    have been used to determine the authenticity of the probe request. MAC address
    alias physical address of the device is considered unique globally, therefore
    it has been used to discriminate between WFD enabled devices [77], [78], [79]
    whereas RSSI has been used to determine the estimated location of the WFD enabled
    devices [80], [81], [82]. The mechanism used in the discovery phase is more effective
    in identifying malicious requests originated from stationery devices. Table 2
    and Algorithm 1 demonstrates the set of rules invoked to effectively discriminate
    between legitimate and malicious probe requests at discovery phase. Download :

    set of actions performed by the device upon reception of the probe request. Assume
    two WFD enabled devices want to communicate with each other. The devices reveal
    their interest by sending the probe request messages (consisting of MAC address
    and other details) to each other. Note that the terms node and device are interchangeably
    used and represent the same meaning. Let us review the set of actions performed
    by a node for filtering malicious requests. Device 1 sends a probe request to
    Device 2 and in turn seeks its probe response to lead further communication. However,
    unlike traditional security protocols, Device 2 examines the credentials before
    issuing the probe response. Device 2 particularly verifies two factors i.e., MAC
    address and RSSI before issuing probe response to the Device 1. Few Assumptions:
    The nodes are installed distributively for performing various tasks in smart cities
    (e.g., smart bins, smart traffic lights, rainwater harvesting, etc.). The devices
    are installed permanently (stationary). MAC address and RSSI can be used to differentiate
    between D2D devices. The factors which affect the RSSI (e.g., weather conditions,
    signal power to antenna unit, and so forth) are considered constant. Download

    retrieves the MAC address and RSSI from the received probe request message that
    arrived from device 1. Afterward, the retrieved information, i.e., MAC address
    and RSSI is compared with the information stored in the memory of device 2. Note
    that indicates the MAC address of device 1 and indicates the strength of the device
    1 signal at the receiving device, . Since no similar request has been facilitated
    by the earlier, therefore the device 2 considers the request as fresh and grants
    the response to continue with GO negotiation phase. It is evident from Table 2
    and Algorithm 1 that in the second instance, the attacker device sends the probe
    request with a forged MAC address ( ) to the legitimate node, . compares the and
    with its database entries. Upon verification, finds that a request has already
    been received earlier with the similar RSSI value, therefore aborts the communication
    considering it as a malicious request. In another instance , receives the request
    with a counterfeited MAC address and similar RSSI value, hence concludes it as
    bogus request with malicious intentions. Consequently, prohibits the processing
    of malicious requests, thus resulting in preservation of resources for legitimate
    nodes. It is evident from the that the proposed protocol easily determines the
    reception of a new probe request from a legitimate WFD enabled device by examining
    the MAC address and RSSI value. It can be observed from algorithm 1 that the alterations
    proposed in the discovery phase of the conventional WiFi Direct protocol can partially
    protect the D2D communications from DoS attacks. The proposed protocol intends
    to fill the shortcomings of the SAS based key agreement protocol. The proposed
    protocol integrates timestamp (TS) and lifetime (LT) to prevent the misuse of
    , , , and by attacker for gaining trust of legitimate nodes. Besides, the proposed
    protocol also protects the D2D communications from MITM attack by prohibiting
    the transmission of short authentication strings in plain text. Moreover, the
    protocol verifies the generation of identical secret keys on both devices to avoid
    use of erroneous keys. Note that errors can be caused due to many reasons: analog
    to digital conversion process, wireless channel fading, modifications by attackers,
    etc. The working of the proposed mutual authentication and key establishment scheme
    is illustrated in Fig. 8 and algorithm 2. Consider a scenario where Alice (Device
    A) wants to communicate with Bob (Device B). Besides, diffie hellman parameters
    ( and ), Alice and Bob generates a random nonce, and , respectively, to add a
    freshness component in the message. A private value is also chosen by Alice ‘
    ’ and Bob ‘ ’ to be applied to diffie hellman parameters, and . After the computations,
    Alice and Bob concatenates the device identifiers ( , ), diffie hellman parameter
    ( , ), and the random nonce ( , ) to form the secret value, ( ) and ( ) respectively.

    Fig. 8. Mutual authentication and secret key establishment between Device A and
    B. But instead of sending to Bob, Alice breaks the information into a commit/open
    pair. The secret value ( ) is divided into two separate components in such a way
    that commitment value ( ) does not disclose anything about hidden secret value
    unless open value ( ) is not applied. Therefore, Alice shares commit value with
    Bob; Bob in turn shares the secret value with Alice. Upon reception of , Alice
    sends the open value to allow Bob retrieve . After the exchange of a couple of
    messages, both Alice and Bob begin the computation of short authentication strings
    for mutual authentication. Alice computes whereas Bob computes . After generating
    the authentication strings, Alice and Bob computes the secret key; Alice computes,
    and Bob computes, . Alice and Bob have formed the secret keys but it remains unused
    unless the devices verify the authenticity of each other. Alice generates the
    TS with LT to avoid replay attacks. It is recommended to keep the lifetime (LT)
    value equivalent to the propagation time of message from source to destination,
    to prohibit the attacker from capturing, modifying and replaying [83]. Alice computes
    the message authentication code of , , and with the secret key, . The message
    authentication code transforms the information to a non-interpretable form, thereby
    not permitting the attacker to interpret, alter, and misuse. Similarly, Bob also
    concatenates the with received and to compute the message authentication code
    with secret key, . Lastly, both the devices exchange and compare the message authentication
    code, if it renders the same value, it indicates successful mutual authentication
    and key establishment. The protocol only makes use of lightweight cryptography
    operations like message authentication code and bit-wise XOR, therefore it can
    be considered as the best fit for resource constrained devices and applications
    of smart cities. Download : Download high-res image (313KB) Download : Download

    analysis The proposed scheme aims to protect the D2D communications from adversarial
    threats, especially DoS and MITM attacks. The performance of the scheme has been
    analyzed through simulations executed on a platform with specifications as: intel
    core - processor with operating frequency of 2.10 GHz, -bit operating system,
    GB RAM, cache memory MB, memory speed MT/s, and supported wireless LAN standards
    IEEE 802.11 . Dev C compiler has been used with the required libraries (types.h,
    socket.h, netinet/in.h) for implementation and testing of the proposed protocol.
    As mentioned earlier, the presented scheme is more effective in protecting against
    DoS attacks triggered by malicious stationary nodes, therefore the current performance
    investigation has been confined to stationary nodes only, whereas evaluation of
    the scheme under the influence of malicious mobile nodes is the future scope of
    the research. The simulation results of the proposed scheme have been demonstrated
    in this section. Initially the interested device sends a probe request to the
    target device during the discovery phase as shown in Fig. 9. Since the probe request
    is fresh, the device 2 allocates the resources to the source node for continuing
    further. The attacker can deploy its malicious node in the network to trigger
    DoS attacks. Malicious node executes the DoS attack by flooding the victim node
    with bogus requests. Consequently, the legitimate node exhausts all its precious
    resources (e.g., system crash) in processing the fake requests, thus preventing
    the node from processing the valid requests [84], [85], [86], [87]. Fig. 10 illustrates
    how the proposed scheme empowers the legitimate node to identify the probe requests
    with forged credentials. Upon verification of the probe request, it is found that
    the request received has arrived from the same node (Device 1) with intentions
    to trigger DoS attack in the network. Therefore, the legitimate node (Device 2)
    refrains from processing the request, thus preserving resources to serve genuine
    requests in future. Download : Download high-res image (170KB) Download : Download

    Case of new neighboring device. As illustrated in Fig. 11, the attacker node tries
    to re-attempt the DoS attack by sending the bogus request, however the device
    2 examines the request and finds out that a request with similar credentials has
    already been processed, thereby discarding the request. When another legitimate
    device in the vicinity reveals its interest through a probe request, the device
    2 follows the same procedure and verifies the credentials. It is evident from
    Fig. 12 that the new device is allocated with the resources because its credentials
    (MAC address and RSSI) are different from the stored credentials in the database.
    Since the scheme is tested for stationary nodes without considering the factors
    affecting RSSI, it can be inferred that the proposed scheme can partially protect
    the D2D communications from DoS attacks. Since the smart city applications contain
    precious information, therefore devices must verify the authenticity of each other
    followed by secret key establishment to secure the communication from adversarial
    threats. Algorithm 2 and Fig. 8 demonstrates the steps of execution while Fig.
    13, Fig. 14 reveals the outcome of execution. It is apparent from the simulations
    that Device A and Device B are able to exchange the secret keys securely after
    successful mutual authentication. Download : Download high-res image (418KB) Download

    of the scheme in diverse compromised conditions. The security analysis has been
    performed using the well known BAN logic. Formal Proof using BAN Logic The formal
    proof using BAN logic [74] evaluates the strength of the protocol using logical
    rules to verify the accomplishment of secret key between both devices in the insecure
    environment. 1. BAN Logic Notations: The notations and symbols used are directly
    adopted from [74] to evaluate the robustness of the scheme as follows: • : Let
    X and Y be two principal entities where ‘X believes Y’. • : Only ‘X sees Y’, i.e.,
    only X can interpret and replicate Y. • : ‘X once said Y’, principal X sent a
    message comprising Y. • : ‘X has control over Y’, the principal X is an authority
    on Y and should be trusted. • : The principal X and Y have message (M) that contains
    the secret parameters. • : Fresh(Y), i.e., Y is not used in earlier message exchanges.
    • : The and used a secret key for securing the communication. It is believed that
    key is disclosed only to the designated legitimate principals. • : Message is
    encrypted using the secret key . • : is amalgamated with the secret parameter
    . • : X has the private key, K. • : X has the public key, K. 2. BAN Logical Rules:
    The logical rules referred from [74] are invoked to examine the protocol as follows:
    (a) Message-meaning rule (b) Nonce-verification rule (c) Control rule (d) If a
    principal sees a formula, then it also sees its components, provided he knows
    the necessary keys (e) Fresh rule If one part of a formula is fresh, then the
    entire formula must also be fresh [74]. 3. Formal Verification of the proposed
    protocol: The evaluation process is carried out in four steps: (i) message idealization,
    (ii) assumptions, (iii) expected goals, and (iv) logic verification. (i) Message
    idealization: Message idealization specify the messages exchanged between Device
    A and B. The idealized messages for the proposed protocol are summarized as follows:
    Between Device A and B: (ii) Assumptions: In proposed protocol, a principal believes
    that (a) nonces are fresh, (b) it has shared secrets and keys, (c) a legitimate
    principal has control over the entitled components and values. The following are
    the intuitive assumptions: Between Device A and B: • For the Device A: • For the
    Device B: (iii) Expected goals: The security goals define the necessary security
    properties that a security protocol should exhibit. The significant security goals
    that the proposed protocol aims to achieve is summarized as follows: (iv) Logic
    verification: Based on the assumptions, message idealization, and rules, the logic
    verification has been performed and proven as follows: According to ( ) and (
    ), believes and the message ( , ) that contain secret parameters which will be
    used to derive the secret session key . computes from pair and obtain: By applying
    message meaning rule and , we obtain If the device believes the device and so
    the , then it also believes in the diffie hellman parameter ( ) shared by device
    . By applying and , we obtain that: Hence, the goal : has been achieved, and similarly,
    the goal can be accomplished. , where , , and are the components of different
    messages sent by . According to : , receives the open value from . computes the
    secret value using the commit/open pair and deduce nonce, . is a random positive
    integer generated by for freshness. By applying rule ‘b’ (Nonce verification),
    rule ‘e’ (Freshness), and , we obtain: Considering , receives in the message from
    . retrieves the and from the . and are incorporated by for freshness and prevention
    against replay attacks. By applying rule ‘d’, rule ‘e’, , and we obtain: Thus,
    the goal has been realized successfully, i.e.,  believes that are fresh. Likewise,
    goal (i.e.,  ) can be attained. Download : Download high-res image (350KB) Download

    with conventional protocols. 5.3. Comparative analysis It is worth noting that
    the proposed scheme is a subset of traditional WiFi Direct and SAS based key agreement
    protocol. The proposed scheme is an initiative to strengthen the security and
    eliminate the vulnerabilities of conventional protocols disclosed by the authors
    in Sections 2.3 Limitations of WiFi WPS, 2.4 Cryptanalysis of SAS based key agreement
    protocol. Fig. 15 illustrates the difference between the WiFi Direct, SAS based
    key agreement, and proposed protocol. In the past, most approaches have not focused
    on safeguarding the discovery phase, despite knowing the fact that adversaries
    prefer to accomplish DoS attacks in this phase. On the contrary, the proposed
    scheme (refer algorithm 1 and Table 2) not only prevents the legitimate devices
    from processing the fake requests but also enhances the active lifetime of the
    devices and ad-hoc networks. The authentication set-up of conventional protocols
    are insufficient to provide complete security solutions. Fig. 16 highlights the
    difference in the mutual authentication and key exchange process of proposed and
    conventional protocols. Despite the fact that SAS based key agreement protocol
    made a decent attempt to prevent MITM attack, the cryptanalysis revealed the vulnerabilities
    that can be easily exploited by the attackers to accomplish the MITM attack. The
    proposed protocol extends the SAS based key agreement approach to overcome the
    limitations, and extend the robustness of the approach. Some significant observations
    can be drawn from Fig. 16 which are summarized as follows: (i) the authentication
    strings are not sent in plain text, (ii) timestamp and lifetime are incorporated
    to prevent replay attacks, and (iii) verifies the establishment of identical key
    at both devices to avoid erroneous use, and so forth. The successful execution,
    robustness verification, and comparative analysis proves the supremacy of the
    proposed scheme in contrast to the traditional approaches. Download : Download

    enabled smart cities have revolutionized the ecosystem by automating the majority
    of the processes, including billing of energy meters, emergency services during
    accidents and disasters, and so on. WiFi Direct, a branch of D2D communications
    used in the 5G technology is the most appropriate candidate to relay the real
    time information with minimum latency. However, due to absentia of intermediate
    infrastructure, and insecure wireless channels, the smart city applications become
    fragile. Few traditional security approaches, to name a few, WPS and SAS based
    key agreement protocol are found vulnerable to PIN disclosure and MITM attacks,
    respectively. Considering the above risk exposures, the authors devised a strong
    mutual authentication and key establishment protocol for WFD enabled devices to
    conquer the adversarial threats. The proposed protocol not only prevents DoS attacks
    in the discovery phase rather protects the network from MITM attacks in the key
    agreement phase. The formal security analysis using BAN logic demonstrates its
    strength against the diverse cyber attacks. It is apparent from the outcomes of
    the research that the proposed scheme can ensure the security of smart city applications.
    The future extension of this research work might include the performance analysis
    of the proposed model considering malicious mobile nodes, inclusion of factors
    affecting RSSI, and multiple malicious nodes triggering the DoS attack simultaneously
    in the ad-hoc network. Additionally, end to end network delay, latency, computation
    overhead, and throughput of the proposed technique will be calculated and presented
    as a part of future research work. CRediT authorship contribution statement Gurjot

  description: Most of the water resource management systems are not migrated to cyber
    physical systems which make control mechanisms implemented insecure. Intruders
    target sustainable environmental systems focused on environmental disaster. User
    identification in modern structures no longer ensures right identity authentication
    and authorisation to digital control system, if the control system is misbehaved
    by the intruder and then it causes extreme damage to the environment. Even though
    current water resource management systems have implemented legacy digital control
    mechanism they have a higher chance of getting compromised through malicious activities.
    The framework proposed in this work involves multilayer authentication of user.
    The first gateway of our architecture uses a cryptographic salting technique,
    where in a random data is used as an additional input to a one way function that
    hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in
    storage. The second gateway imposes an algorithm that uses GPS which has the potential
    to help cyber security professionals to better detect and prevent cyber-attacks
    in real time. The third gateway uses image recognition on android mobile phones,
    from which security system is enhanced detecting image of the user, followed by
    a pattern.

  description: A large amount of freshwater is consumed to irrigate crops. IoT-based
    automatic irrigation systems are needed to reduce water consumption. Security
    and privacy issues, factors concerning climate conditions, and real-time soil
    and air features that affect irrigation control make the development of such system
    challenging. This study introduces a cloud-connected, secure multi-crop smart
    irrigation system (SMCSIS) to address the excessive irrigation problem caused
    by precipitation after irrigation and to reduce water consumption. SMCSIS makes
    real-time watering decision on the basis of soil moisture predicted at the time
    of precipitation. The prediction depends on the data captured from soil moisture
    sensor and climate prediction-based estimated evaporation. An artificial neural
    network is developed and trained using five factors (air temperature, wind speed
    and direction, UV, and humidity) captured from online weather forecasting to obtain
    the estimate evaporation. A database containing the characteristics and irrigation
    information for each crop is also developed for multi-crop irrigation. Access
    control and blockchain technologies are used to maintain privacy and data integrity
    in the system. A prototype has been developed to simulate the system for small
    farms. Experimental results indicate that SMCSIS is functional, and it provides
    an effective solution to overcome excessive irrigation.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture has the key part to play in strengthening the economic backbone of
    any developing country. It functions as the elementary source of income, food,
    employment and dispenses a substantial amount to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
    It is the earliest industry to supply the basic components to many other industries
    and lays the foundation for the Nation. With the scenario in India, agriculture
    devotes nearly 17 % to the total GDP and hands over employment to past 60 % of
    the populace. The cultivation of the Indian food grain production has incremented
    from 51 million tonnes in 1950-51 to a highest of about 250 million tonnes subsequent
    to Indian independence. The world population is near about 7.8 billion people
    now and it is growing at a pace of nearly 1.05 % per year. This is creating a
    hike in the agricultural demand. Gratifying incremented demands on agriculture
    by adopting the current farming techniques is expected to pave way to more critical
    striving for natural resources, incremented greenhouse effusion and additional
    problems like deforestation and land derogation. The regular classical techniques
    for the horticulture of the crops across the entire area drains the soil of a
    specific nutrient and thus, eventually the soil becomes infertile. Hand-operated
    maintenance of the agricultural field often becomes unwieldy and unavailable since
    the current date logistics illustrates that a very minor part of the total world
    populace wishes to pave their ways into the agricultural industries and this number
    continues to decrement at a very fast pace side by side. Keeping up bankroll data
    with perseverance paves way to errors, and the spreading of insecticides and pesticides
    on the entire field without any necessity affects the soil health negatively.
    Zone detection, Geo tagging and weather prediction is also not feasible with traditional
    farming. Adding to these, irrigating the entire field also results in drastic
    waste of water as not all parts of the field require the water at the same time.
    All these sums to the desideratum for a transformative and a developing agricultural
    archetype to maintain the growing surge for food and crop production appropriately
    thus, to ensure a sustainable development [1]. This is where IoT - based agriculture
    or smart agriculture [2] comes to its play. Smart agriculture technologies and
    precision agriculture are getting worldwide acclaim owing to their capability
    of standing up to such an incrementing demand and suffice food dispensing needs
    all over the world. One of the proclaimed smart farming cases in the world is
    that used in Chile where the use of distant and isolated sensors placed in the
    soil for measuring blueberry irrigation has decremented the volume of water used
    in the farming by nearly 70 % [3]. The worldwide smart agriculture barter is envisioned
    to reach 15.3billionbytheyear2025setsidebysideto 5 billion in the year 2016 [4].
    Smart farming chiefly is related to the work done on data which is gathered from
    various sources in the overall management of the operations taking place in the
    agricultural field. Smart farming deploys both IoT (hardware) and SaaS (software)
    to gather the related data and provide executable action plans, may it be prior
    or succeeding to the yield, to maintain all the operations on the farming lands.
    By making farming more associated and smarter, accuracy agriculture diminishes
    in general expenses and improve the quality and number of items, the sustainability
    of farming and the experience for the buyer. Increasing control over production
    leads to better cost management and waste reduction. The capacity to follow irregularities
    in crop development or animals’ wellbeing. Smart farming is important due to the
    grouping of the expanding global population, the increasing demand for advanced
    crop yield, the need to use natural resource efficiently, the growing use and
    sophistication of information and communication knowledge and the increasing need
    for the climate smart agriculture. The data is standardized, easily available,
    and comprises of enough information in every detail of the bankroll, and farm
    instrumentality that can be administered by any user present at any part of the
    world. The IoT concedes tangible objects to communicate with themselves, give
    out information to each other and sum up resolutions, thus helping to transform
    the elemental objects into intelligent ones. The IoT application has been devised
    for smart agriculture by deploying Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), such as irrigation
    sensor networks [5], prediction of frost events [6], precision soil agriculture
    [7], blind entity identification [8], smart farming [9] and precision agriculture
    [10] To devise a green IoT - based agricultural solution [11], there are some
    interests which are to be served adequately. Coming first, the specific sensors
    (for instance, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, etc.) vital for the IoT
    application are to be picked shrewdly. Next, the algorithms should be devised
    keeping in mind all the feasible probabilities vital for the best prediction and
    machine learning should be brought into application adequately. Coming next, the
    sensors are more liable to cripple in the farmland, so custom auditing of these
    are required. Next, the form of the wireless communication should be in accordance
    to the requirement of the sensors to be linked over a specific land area in the
    farmland. Next, comes the coronation of the IoT archetype by deploying the concepts
    of say, cloud computing. Lastly and chiefly, the security and privacy [12] of
    the system should be ascertained by authenticating the established system, assuring
    its concealment, candor and controlled admittance. This study tries to project
    an idea of smart agriculture implementation where the proposed work deploys the
    three sensors namely- 1. Hygrometer, 2. DHT-11, and 3. NFK sensor, to get the
    information concerning the moisture and nutrient content of the soil and this
    is then supplied to the Node MCU from where the data flows to a Google Firebase
    and then to a prediction module. In the prediction module, the gathered soil information
    is correlated with the appropriate requirements to cultivate a specific crop and
    then the decisions are taken so as to vary the environmental conditions to ensure
    the best cultivation of the crop and this entire information is now stored in
    the cloud from where it is broadcasted to the user interface through the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP protocol). SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. System
    modelling The proposed work surrounds around 100 acres of agricultural field.
    This area is reft into 10 chunks, each having a 10-acre land in them. Each of
    these chunks includes the assorted sensors, which would study the encompassing
    habitat and bring about suitable and immediate measures as needed for the best
    crop cultivation possible. Each chunk has four sensors. Firstly, the DHT-11 sensors
    measure the temperature and humidity of the environment. It invariably provides
    the data concerning the amount of voltage scope of 3.3 to 5.6 V. It is finely
    appropriate to low voltage micro controllers. Secondly, the acoustic sensors are
    very advantageous in making certain about the soil texture, that is, to analyse
    whether the soil specimen is fine or coarse. These sensors function by scaling
    the level of noise owing to the synergy of a working equipment with the particles
    of the soil and thus, would successfully measure the soil permeability. Coming
    next, the capacitive soil moisture sensors are dielectric sensors which calculates
    the soil moisture content. These deploy capacitance to calculate the encompassing
    medium’s permitivity. The sensor produces the frequency response of the capacitance
    of the soil owing to its soil moisture content, as the output. Last is the the
    electrochemical sensors which provides the real-time data related to the system’s
    composition. It couples an electrochemical transducer with the recognition element
    (a chemically selective layer) and is liable for calculating the pH level of the
    soil. All of these sensors would be installed across the fields. The data collected
    from these would be broadcasted to the gateway by employing the WiFi module (ESP
    8266). The NodeMCU can be described as a less expensive Open Source for the IoT
    projects. For the precise working of the ESP8266 WiFi chip, it is established
    on the grounds of a LUA scripting language. At the beginning, it included a hardware
    which was established on the grounds of the ESP-12 module and a firmware which
    worked on the ESP8266 WiFi - SOC from the Express of Systems. Now, to give assistance
    to the system, ESP32, 32-bit MCU was installed. It includes prototyping board
    designs and a firmware which are gradually Open Source. The firmware employed
    is established on eLUA project and is fabricated on the Expressif NON-OS SDK to
    back ESP8266. The firmware deploys assorted open source projects like luacjson
    and SPITES. On the other hand, the prototyping hardware used operations such as
    a Dual In Line Package (DIP) which consolidates the small surface - mounted board
    comprising of antenna and MCU with the controller. The water pumps established
    over the specific agricultural land area which are linked to the motor drivers
    would accomplish the accords broadcasted through the ESP 8266. The broadcasting
    of data is accomplished by adopting the LORA (Long Range) wireless technology
    of transmission. The advantage of using this technology is that it can bring about
    long-distance communication (approx. 100Km) held down by low power expenditure.
    The communication radius in open area can catch up to 5Km or more. It is owing
    to the fact that broadcast rates and communication distance of these are proportional
    to each other. In each of the terminal nodes, the master microcontroller of the
    NodeMCU is liable to process and transform the data gathered by the sensors and
    the data regarding the time and position in the GPS module. The process of control
    of ESP 8266 involves four steps. To start with, it is required to power up the
    terminal node and thus, the ESP 8266 initializes and delineates the pins. coming
    next, the LoRa module initializes and fixes the dispatching frequency and power.
    After a itemized deferred time is attained, data acquisition begins. Now, the
    data packet is dispatched through the LoRa module to the sink node. There it has
    ten terminal nodes which will communicate with the centrally located sink node.
    The LoRa sink node module chiefly consists of chief node MCU control platforms.
    This will in turn be linked to GPRS wireless communication module, power module
    and the LoRa wireless communication module. Firstly, the LoRa module obtains the
    data from the terminal node and processes it and this is controlled by the NodeMCU.
    Now, the GPRS wireless communication module dispatches the gathered data of the
    surroundings, knowledge about the location, and time stamps altogether to the
    cloud platform’s server on the controlled action of the NodeMCU on it yet again.
    The control process of the NodeMCU in the sink node involves three steps. Firstly,
    the sink node should be powered up and then, it should initialize the hardware
    like LoRa wireless communication modules and NodeMCU modules. Now, the data is
    received from the terminal node and these are then integrated. Finally, all the
    data is dispatched through the GPRS to the remote monitoring platform’s server.
    Fig 1: Communication protocol for transmission and receiving of data. Show All
    B. Software Modelling The data gathered from the farming lands is dispatched to
    a server which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    is the elemental protocol adopted by the World Wide Web. This protocol delineates
    the way of the formatting and transmitting of the messages and also how the web
    servers and browsers respond in action to the diversified directives. After this,
    the whole project is worked upon the Google Cloud Console, a cloud platform. The
    data is imbibed from the server to a Google Cloud Console product, Cloud pub/sub.
    Pub/sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that processes
    events from services that generates events. Pub/sub brings forward reliable message
    store and message dispatch on real-time basis with high availability and constant
    accomplishment in a long-range rate. Pub/sub servers work in every Google Cloud
    area around the globe. A pub/sub subscription can be composed to dispatch every
    message like an HTTP POST appeals to webhook, a push endpoint URL. In routine,
    the push endpoint must be publicly reachable HTTPS server, handing out an authentic
    SSL certificate endorsed by a certificate authority and which is able to be routed
    by Domain Name System (DNS). Pub/sub will push messages to the subscription from
    every single area where messages are published on the subscription’s subject matter.
    Adding to these, push subscriptions can be composed to supply an authorization
    header to favour the endpoints to corroborate the demands. The affairs are published
    as pub/sub messages which will afterwards be chose after gushing data into Big
    Query by the Cloud Function. Google Cloud Functions is an affair-directed computing
    service which does not involve any server and is present within Google Cloud Platform.
    The developers may use it to devise and realize programmatic functions within
    Google’s public cloud notwithstanding the planning of the elemental cloud framework
    like the server and depot. Big Query is a less expensive, highly ascendable cloud
    data repository without any server, devised to aid us in making intellectual resolutions
    promptly so that it can revamp our venture with comfort. In this paper, to gush
    matter into Big Query, it is required to be in possession of a cloud Storage bucket
    and a target table in Big Query. The chief objective of this bucket is to hoard
    JSON files that are gushed into Big Query, for a brief time. Coming next, it is
    required to set up the content terminal for our files and this would be fulfilled
    by the Big Query Table. Big Query makes us able to determine the schema of the
    table when a new table is created or when data is pushed into the table. As the
    source and destination sinks are devised, it is now required to devise the Cloud
    Function to gush data into Big Query from Cloud Storage. The gushing function
    observes for fresh files added to the bucket and then prompts a process which
    does the following steps. It construes and corroborates the file and finds out
    for corollaries. Fig 2: Representation of the software model. Show All Later it
    injects the file’s subject matter into Big Query and records the ingestion condition
    in Firebase and Logging. Now, it publishes a message to an error or success topic
    in Pub/Sub. The data is downloaded for machine learning insights and reuploaded
    into Big Query. Whilst data is gushed into Big Query it is crucial to comprehend
    the proceedings with every file ingestion. For example, let us consider it will
    have files that were inadequately imported. In such an event, it is required to
    check out the primary source of the problem and secure it to prevent produce corrupted
    data and inaccurate reports at the closure of our pipeline. The gushing function,
    set up in the preceding division, stores the file ingestion status in Firebase
    documents so that it will query the current flaws to troubleshoot any issues.
    Fig 3: Representation of Hardware Model. Show All The firebase can be defined
    as an ascendable database management system along with multipurpose facilities
    to develop mobile, web server development. When the Firebase project is linked
    to Big Query, it will be picked to export Google Analytics for Firebase (including
    some A/B Testing and Dynamic Links data), Crashlytics, Predictions, Cloud Messaging
    and/or Performance Monitoring data to corresponding Big Query datasets on a routine
    basis. The succeeding Figures (2) and (3) illustrates the decision making block
    of the program for the future application on the site of the fields. SECTION III.
    Result and Discussions The proposed work, as presented by us here, gathers the
    related essential data from the field sensors and the data in turn, is processed
    and the outcomes are envisaged in the mode of graphs at the user end to analyze
    and implement effectively the measures as needed for a healthy crop cultivation.
    These visions are provided by running a machine learning program in python. In
    the python program, the first step is to import machine learning libraries like
    NumPy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Pandas and scikit learn. NumPy have a large number of
    mathematical functions used on big arrays of data and matrices. Pandas, on the
    other hand offer operations and Data Structures for maintaining time series and
    numerical tables. The executing part of the program requires scikit learn which
    have functions classification, clustering algorithms and regressions including
    support vector apparatus. At the end matplotlib is as plotting tool in the language.
    After including the libraries, the data which was collected on field and brought
    down to the cloud is imported to the program. The data should be split between
    a dependent variable and independent variable for a single variate linear regression
    model. The variable, that is month, should be encoded with integer because python
    programming does not understand string. It is done by importing label encoder
    imported form scikit learn library. Then, the dataset is divided into the training
    (60 percent) and test (40 percent) set. With the function train test split included
    from sklearn library; the set is trained by using simple linear regression model
    which is also an embedded function of scikit learn. Now it will pass an object
    to the newly created regression model using the regressor.fit function and predict
    the results. The results are then plot using the pyplot.plot function from matplotlib
    library. The results are then provided to the end user who can have an insight
    about what can happen next. The data, thus gathered, is pushed into Big Query
    for using google cloud console’s google firebase for better representation of
    data. The figures for moisture content of the soil of every 10 acres agricultural
    area in each of the seasons and this data is gathered through the capacitive soil
    sensor. A 555 based circuit is used to appraise the capacitance of these sensors.
    This circuit produces a voltage which is equal or proportional to the capacitance
    of the capacitor located inside the soil. The voltage, thus created, is computed
    by using an analog to digital converter which in turn generates a numeric value
    that can construe as the value of the soil moisture content. The graphs henceforth,
    plotted with the help of this retrieved data, are studied, monitored and thus
    the pumps, established over every 10 acres agricultural field area, are turned
    on when the moisture content in a specific agricultural field goes down below
    the threshold level. The data particularly for soil permeability has been collected
    using the acoustic sensors which establishes over every 10 acres of agricultural
    field area. These sensors deploy the method of compelling a particular volume
    of air into the soil at a specific depth up to which it is able to work and thus
    appraises the pressure. The data produced is now, correlated to the properties
    of soil like its structure and soil compaction. This is now analyzed and it helps
    to make the authoritative person aware of the requirement of the soil to be ploughed
    so as to ensure proper aeration. Fig 4: Temperature prediction of the next 25
    weeks. Show All The figures depicted above is the prediction of temperature of
    the location where the farming fields are present. These data are gathered from
    the DHT-11 sensors which measures the relative humidity by appraising the electrical
    resistance between two of the electrodes. The shift in the value of resistance
    between the electrodes is directly analogous to the relative humidity existing
    in the atmosphere. The data appraised is now, analysed and graphs are plotted
    using programming in the language python. The graphs These graphs are finally
    envisaged in the user - end application. Fig 5: Rainfall prediction in next 25
    weeks. Show All The data shown above predicts the essential rainfall for the crops.
    These graphs will provide the necessary data for the user when to start the process
    of cultivation i.e. in this case ploughing. According to the data the user should
    conserve the water after the tenth week for the proper growth of crops and preventing
    the drying up of lands. SECTION IV. Conclusion This paper comes up with the implementation
    of smart soil conditions monitoring system with the aid of cloud computing and
    the Internet of Things. This smart system gathers data like the soil texture,
    temperature, humidity, permeability soil, pH level of soil, and other such analogous
    quantities. These data are now, sent to a cloud where it gets stored and are further
    processed and analysed by adopting some specific algorithms, constituting the
    prediction module. Thus, gradually this system assists the farmers to achieve
    a productive crop harvest. Our proposed system aids with the routine check of
    the soil texture and fertility and thus, ensures the farmers to take the apt measures
    needed for the bountiful and healthy crop cultivation. The algorithms are first
    evaluated where the comparisons between the real-time data of the available soil
    texture gathered by the various sensors in the field and the factual soil texture
    and other requirements which favour the cultivation of a specific crop, are done.
    The graphs so plotted according to the retrieved data are visualized in this process.
    Now, proportionately, according to the analyzations, the subsequent measures like
    ploughing and irrigation are accomplished. This system also helps to curtail the
    wasteful water use in the irrigation process in the fields. The agricultural activities
    and the crop production can be effortlessly supervised and controlled by any user
    sitting at any corner of the world. The virtual store used here, i.e the Google
    Cloud Console, aids to prevent data loss and does not involve any complexities
    in offline data storage maintenance. Thus, the system described in this paper
    is highly efficient, user-friendly and reliable. For the future work of this paper,
    incorporation of image processing and computer vision can be done. This would
    help the farmers to detect any disease by studying the condition of the leaves,
    the yield and thus, help them to take on-time decisions for the spraying of suitable
    amount of pesticides to the crops and other such measures. Adding to these, other
    microcontrollers can be used to reinforce the data processing unit and to aid
    them, precisely and accurately, in analysing problems which come up at the field
    during crop cultivation. Furthermore, the management and protection of the colossal
    data, gathered using the various sensors, against cybersecurity threats should
    be ensured properly. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Matsue, Japan SECTION I. Introduction Today,
    many young people wish to work in agriculture but they lack the relevant experiences.
    With the system proposed in this paper, it is easy to understand the experience
    of other farmers, making planting no longer difficult. By monitoring soil humidity,
    which is beneficial for crop production, water usage can be optimized. The processes
    involved in growing crops can be enhanced if soil humidity can successfully be
    predicted in any area. Knowledge about soil moisture content allows farmers to
    obtain information about the optimal times for sowing and cultivating crops and
    determine whether infiltration of the soil is appropriate. In addition to providing
    a system that automatically generates irrigating rules, a LoRa-based system for
    automatic irrigation is also provided. Since LoRa uses unlicensed wireless band,
    it is suitable for constructing a LoRa-based network for cost consideration. Therefore,
    we employ LoRa-based communication protocol for collecting data and controlling
    irrigation system. Nevertheless, for LoRaWan (Aloha based MAC protocol), the latency
    of downlink communication from gateway to Class-A LoRa node (battery-based sensor)
    is relative long (needs to wait the transmission of a Class-A node). We therefore
    employ an alternative and more cost effective TDMA-based MAC protocol (LoRa P2P)
    to construct the smart irrigation system. The gateway converts the raw sensing
    data received from different devices into human-readable data and store them in
    a database. We provide a mobile application and a website to allow users to easily
    view the crop growing environment data. In addition, the users can trigger events
    according to the machine predicted-rules. There are two types of events, warning
    notifications and control events. Establishing control events helps achieve automatic
    control. We also integrated the controllers with the controlled devices. We established
    LoRa P2P communication between the gateway (master), sensor hubs (slaves), and
    controllers(slaves). SECTION II. Related Works A. Lora and Lorawan LoRa is a physical
    layer or wireless modulation technology that supports a long-range communication
    link. It is based on chirp spread spectrum modulation that not only has the same
    low-power characteristics as frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation but also
    substantially increases the communication range. LoRaWAn [1] defines the MAC communication
    protocol (Aloha based random access) and system architecture (start topology)
    for the network based on LoRa physical layer communication link. To support different
    applications, the nodes of LoRaWAn are classified into three categories: Class-A
    node is battery-based sensor to save power consumption, Class-C is main-powered
    controller to continuously listen the commands from LoRaWAn gateway, and Class-B
    node is battery-based controller. For Class-A node, it will open two slots to
    receive the command or response from the gateway after it initiated a transmission
    to gateway. Thus, the gateway can communicate with a Class-A node only after the
    Class-A node transmitted a packet. Which means the communication time latency
    from gateway to Class-A node is unpredictable, and may not suitable for time-sensitive
    controllers. B. Automation Control System An IoT-based agriculture system has
    been proposed in [4] to provide automatic irrigation service. LoRa is very suitable
    for agriculture application due to its long-distance and low-power characteristics.
    Nevertheless, since LoRaWAn may cause transmission collisions (due to Aloha based
    MAC protocol) and long transmission latency from gateway to Class-A node, we employ
    an alternative and more cost effective TDMA-based MAC protocol (LoRa P2P) to construct
    the smart irrigation system. SECTION III. System Design and Implementation A.
    System Architecture Fig. 1. Architecture of lora p2P network based smart irrigation
    system Show All Several automatic planting and irrigation mechanisms have been
    proposed for agricultural environment [5]–[6]. Machine learning approached are
    also applied for agriculture [7]-[8]. This article proposes a machine learning
    based mechanism to establish a model to learn the irrigation experiences from
    expert farmers. Then the model is used to calculate the amount of water required
    for each day according the collected environment data, such as light intensity,
    soil-temperature, soil-humidity, air-temperature, and air-humidity. And then automatically
    enable the irrigation system to irrigate that amount of water. Figure 1 illustrates
    the architecture of the proposed smart irrigation system based on LoRa P2P network;
    where we have sensor-hubs to collect the environment data, water meters to calculate
    the amount of water used, water solenoid valves to control the irrigation duration,
    and a gateway to receive data from sensors and send commands to controllers. B.
    Sensor-Hub Our sensor-hub supports LoRa communication and equipped with one solar-panel,
    one light intensity sensor, one air-temperature sensor, one air-humidity sensor,
    and four soil sensors with standard RS-485 interface. Sensor-hub acts as a slave
    node in the LoRa P2P network. C. Gateway The gateway acts as a master node in
    the LoRa P2P network which consists of two components: a data processing component
    and a rule engine. The data process component is used to process the data collected
    from slave sensor nodes, and the rule engine is the key component which employs
    multiple linear regression algorithm to determine the precise amount of water
    required for irrigation. Then the gateway will also issue a control command to
    the water controller to start automatic irrigation control. D. Communication In
    the LoRa P2P network, 32 time slots are designed in one cycle and each time slot
    is 0.5 second as shown in Figure 2. There are two types of time slots: reserved
    time slot and free time slot. For each cycle, there are 24 reserved slots and
    8 free slots. A slave node can be assigned up to 3 reserved timeslots for each
    cycle, and a slave node can transmit a packet at each of the reserved slots. A
    free time slot can also be used for contention-based transmission. For example,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2, time slots 1–4 and 17–20 are free time slots. Device
    with ID1 can send packets to the gateway at 5th, 8th, and 13th time slots; device
    with ID2 can send data to the gateway at 11th and 25th time slots. Fig. 2. Transmission
    structure of lora p2P time-slot (tdma) Show All The LoRa P2P network employs a
    master/slave architecture as presented in Figure. 3; where a master node can connect
    to multiple slave nodes. The LoRa gateway is designed as a master node and the
    sensor hubs, water meters, solenoid valves, are designed as slave nodes. Each
    node has a unique node address ranging from 0.0.0 to 255.255.255. The LoRa P2P
    communication module used in our system is Acsip EK-S76SXB. Fig. 3. Lora p2P master-slave
    architecture with tdma. Show All In the LoRa P2P network, we have eight radio
    channels for frequency hopping as illustrated in Figure 4. For each cycle, in
    the beginning, the master will send a Ts slot for synchronization. Then slave
    nodes send their packets based on the reserved slots or free slots (contention-based)
    accordingly. Then the master will use the Tm slot to send the commands or responses
    (such as ACKs for previous transmissions from slave nodes) to the slave nodes.
    If master node has multiple commands to slave nodes, then after a transmission
    on a Tm slot, the channel is then switched to next channel. This is for fitting
    the regulation that a node can not transmit on a channel longer than 0.4 second
    at a time. Fig. 4. Lora p2P frequency hopping based transmission mechanism. Show
    All E. Controller The controller is to control and switch on-off the solenoid
    valve for irrigation. It equipped with a LoRa communication module with LoRa P2P
    firmware module, and acts as a slave node in the LoRa P2P network. SECTION IV.
    Experiment and Result To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed smart irrigation
    system, we designed and implemented the whole system in an organic vegetable farm
    located at Hsin-Chu county, Taiwan. For planting organic vegetable, the most critical
    process is precise irrigation. Usually, the farmer irrigates once or twice a day
    according to his/her experience based on the weather condition and soil condition.
    The experimental farm consists of 12 greenhouses, each of around 100m2. All hardware
    devices, including one LoRa Gateway, 5 sensor-hubs, 3 water meters, and 3 water
    solenoid valve installed in the farm are illustrated in Figure 5. Fig. 5. System
    implemantation at an organic vegetable farm. Show All A. Hardware Devices The
    designed sensor-hub is equipped with a solar panel, a LoRa P2P module, and several
    sensors, including four soil sensors, one air temperature/humidity sensor, and
    one light-insensity sensor (also shown in Figure 1). The sensor-hub is installed
    between two greenhiuses to collect environment data. The collected data are then
    delivered to the master (gateway) via the LoRa P2P communication protocol. Figure
    6 demonstrated the LoRa P2P water meter and LoRa P2P solenoid valve. Both of these
    devices are salve nodes in the LoRa P2P network. The LoRa P2P water meter is actually
    a smart water meter with a LoRa P2P communicaiton module. We can set the time
    interval or frequency for sending back the value of water meter. Currently, since
    the farmer only irrigates once a day, we set the water meter to send back the
    meter value each 12 hours. Fig. 6. Lora p2P-based water meter (up) and solenoid
    valve (down). Show All B. Automatic Rule Gegenation System The main purpose of
    the system is to learn the irrigation experiences of farmers seamlessly and generate
    the irrigation rules automatically. Since planting period for organic vegetable
    is relative short and around 3 -4 weeks, we can collect the data of each period
    very quickly. In this study, we collected the environment data for two months,
    which consists of two planting cycles. Then a linear regression model for these
    data is built. As presented in Table I, a correlation analysis is conducted which
    reveals that the farmer determines the amount of water each time is mainly related
    to air temperature and sunlight intensity. Therefore, these two parameters are
    employed in building the training model. Table I. Correlation analysis Each time
    the farmer irrigates the vegetables according to his experience, our system collects
    the environmental data from the installed sensor-hubs accordingly as well as the
    amount of irrigated water via our LoRa water meter. Then all these data are combined
    into a dataset. Then, the dataset is divided into training data set (75%) and
    testing data set (25%). Of course, the data is also standardized and preprocessed.
    A multiple linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model with two
    highest correlation coefficient features: light intensity and soil humidity. The
    learning curve of k-fold cross-validation is presented in Figure.7; where the
    intercept is 81.2, the coefficient of x 1 is 0.0012, the coefficient of x 2 is
    -2.8, the MSE is 91, and R 2 is 0.74. The function is as follows:where y ^ : length
    of irrigating time (sec), x 1 : the light intensity (lux), and x 2 : the soil
    humidity (%). y ^ =81.2+0.0012 x 1 −2.8 x 2 (1) View Source Fig. 7. Learning curve
    of k-fold cross-validation for multiple linear regression. Show All C. Automatic
    Irrigation System To control the solenoid valve remotely, we combine the LoRa
    P2P module and a relay into the controller. The LoRa P2P solenoid valve is also
    illustrated in Fig. 6 inside the yellow circle. The command format for controlling
    the soleboid is presented in Figure 8. The maximum palyload size of a LoRa packet
    is 40 bytes (the spreading factor SF is set to 9). The command is divided into
    five equal parts, 8 bytes for each part, so that the master (gateway) can issue
    instructions to five different devices simultaneously. As illustrated in Fig.
    8, the first 2 bytes are defined as irrigation equipment to be controlled, the
    next 2 bytes represent the status of the device, and the last 4 bytes indicate
    the control parameter, such as the duration of opening the solenoid valve. For

    we proposed a machine learning-based smart irrigation system with LoRa P2P networks
    to automatically and seamlessly learn the irrigation experiences from expert farmers
    for greenhouse organic vegetable crops. The proposed system will firstly calculate
    the amount of water for each irrigation based on the trained irrigation model
    combined with the environment data, such as air temperature/humidity, soil temperate/humidity,
    light intensity, etc., and then irrigate the crops automatically via the long-distance
    and low-power wireless LoRa P2P network. The original MAC protocol of LoRaWAn
    is Aloha based (random access) and may not be suitable for real-time automatically
    control, especially for Class-A devices. We implemented the proposed AI-based
    automatic irrigation system with LoRa P2P network which is a master-slave and
    TDM-based MAC protocol. Experimental results show that combining the machine learning
    irrigation model with the proposed LoRa P2P network we are able to provide a very
    cost-effective, real-time, and two-way communications for green house precise
    and smart irrigation system. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported by the Ministry

    IEEE Conference Location: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam SECTION I. Introduction The
    automatic irrigation system for the agricultural greenhouse is a system that performs
    the functions of collecting environmental data in the greenhouse and uses them
    to irrigate the crops automatically ensuring maximum water and energy savings.
    The system is usually organized into three levels including field level, control
    level and supervisor level. In recent years, there were many studies in this field.
    For instant, the Intelligent Greenhouse Environment Monitoring System introduced
    in [1], in which research has developed wireless sensor nodes to measure the environmental
    parameters used in control of irrigation, ventilation and lighting in the greenhouse.
    The system is based on ZigBee and embedded technology. It has the limitation that
    the use of medium access control (MAC) method called Pure Aloha reduces the reliability
    of the system especially in the case of large number of nodes in the network.
    A study on applications of wireless sensor network (WSN) for irrigation systems
    [2] has also been conducted. In this study, the authors created a system consisting
    of a central device connected to environmental data collection stations via ZigBee
    standard and developed an automatic irrigation algorithm. However, more irrigation
    algorithms should be developed instead of only one based on soil moisture. Moreover,
    the remote monitoring and control mode is only referred to as a development direction
    that has not yet been implemented in this study. Systems designed to fit the IoT
    trend are also a new research direction. The integrated system between Web Server,
    Ethernet and ZigBee technology specified in [3] is one of them. Although this
    is an advanced system however it is only designed to perform monitoring functions
    without control functions. One common finding in all of these studies is the use
    of ZigBee communication. The advantages of ZigBee such as low power consumption,
    high stability have explained for this. However, the limitation on transmission
    range is the main disadvantage of ZigBee technology (about 100 m), which becomes
    a major barrier when we need to expand the area of greenhouses. From the analysis
    above, we have researched and designed an automatic irrigation system for greenhouse
    crops to overcome the shortcomings of the above studies with a new approach. In
    this study, we have used the LoRa technology with outstanding advantages in transmission
    range and energy saving. In addition, in order to increase the stability of the
    system, we also propose to apply Master/Slave medium access control method for
    LoRa network. The irrigation modes are also more diversified and can be easily
    installed via Local User Interface or Web Interface. SECTION II. LORA TECHNOLOGY
    LoRa is a wireless communication standard that utilizes the Chirp Spread Spectrum
    (CSS) modulation technology. This technique has been used for a variety of military
    applications such as radar systems. LoRa is the world’s first commercially available
    wireless technology with low cost, long transmission range and optimal power consumption.
    The Table I below compares some parameters including transfer rate, transmission
    range, power consumption and cost between some popular wireless technologies.
    Accordingly, LoRa has shown its superiority in many aspects. Its only weakness
    is the data rate. However, in wireless sensor network applications, this is not
    an issue. TABLE I THE COMPARISON OF SOME WIRELESS TECNOLOGY [4] A. Characteristic
    Parameters of LoRa In LoRa technology, there are three main types of parameters
    to consider: Spreading Factor (SF): A tradeoff between data rate and range is
    provided by SF. Choice of higher spreading factor can increase the range but decreases
    the data rate and vice versa. Each symbol is spread by a spreading code of length
    2SF chips Coding Rate (CR): Define the number of bits added in the payload of
    the LoRa Packet that the receiver can use to detect and often to correct errors
    in the message, but it also decreases the effective data rate. Bandwidth (BW):
    LoRa provides three scaleable BW settings of 125 kHz, 250 kHz and 500 kHz. Transmitter
    sends the spread data at a chip rate equal to the system bandwidth in chips per-second-per-Hertz.
    So a LoRa bandwidth of 125 kHz corresponds to a chip rate of 125 kcps. SF, BW
    and CR are the basic and important parameters of the LoRa chipset. In that, SF
    and BW will affect the data rate and range while CR only affect the data rate.
    Depending on the specific application requirements for range, data rate we can
    choose the reasonable values to optimize the transmission. B. LoRa Packet Structure
    Fig. 1. LoRa Packet Structure Show All LoRa offers maximum packet size of 256
    bytes. The LoRa Packet (Fig. 1) is composed as follows: Preamble field: is transmitted
    first for the synchronization purposes of receiver with the incoming data flow.
    Header field: Depends on the selection of one of the two supported modes. In default
    Explicit Mode, the number of bytes in the header field specifies Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) code rate, payload length and presence of CRC in the frame. The
    second Implicit Mode specifies that coding rate and payload in a frame are fixed.
    In this mode, frame does not contains this field, which gives reduction in transmission
    time. Header field also contains 2 bytes CRC field which allows the receiver to
    discard packets with invalid header. Header field along with its CRC field are
    4 bytes long. Payload field: Contains application data transmitted through LoRa.
    Length of payload field varies from 2 to 255 bytes. CRC: Comprises 2 bytes of
    cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection of payload field. This field
    is optional. C. Time on the Air of data packet For LoRa, the actual time on the
    air for a packet can be defined as [5]: T packet = T preamble + T payload (1)
    View Source In this formula, Tpreamble is transmission time of preamble field
    and Tpayload is transmission time of payload field. Tpreamble can be defined as:
    T preamble =( n preamble +4.25)× T sym (2) View Source Where npreamble is preamble
    length and Tsym defines the time required to transmit a symbol: T sym = 2 SF /BW
    (3) View Source with SF as Spreading Factor, BW as Bandwidth The payload transmission
    time is: T payload = n payload × T sym (4) View Source npayload is calculated
    as: { X=ceil[ (8PL−4SF+28+16CRC−20IH) 4(SF−2DE) ] n payload =8+max(X×(CR+4),0)
    View Source In the formula above: PL: number of bytes in payload field. IH: 0
    when the implicit header mode is used and 1 for vice versa. DE: 1 for enabled
    low data rate optimization and 0 for opposite case. CR: code rate (1 corresponds
    to CR = 4/5, 4 corresponds to CR = 4/8). So total time on the air Tpacket can
    be defined by using Equations 1, 2 and 4 T packet =( n preamble + n payload +4.25)×
    T sym (5) View Source SECTION III. LORA NETWORK CONSTRUCTION Fig. 2. Model of
    LoRa network referenced with OSI model Show All Fig. 3. Master/Slave network model
    Show All The LoRa network in this system was designed with star topology. Each
    of the devices in the network is structured in three layers according to the OSI
    model. Where the highest layer is the application layer. Under it, is the MAC
    layer (using master/slave medium access control method). The lowest layer is the
    physical layer (using LoRa modulation) Fig. 2. With this Master/Slave medium access
    control method, the Master station is responsible for allocating access to slaves
    (Fig. 3). Slaves are passive, so they only access the line and exchange the data
    when requested by Master. The Master Station either chose directly a slave to
    communicate with or uses polling method according to the purpose of access. The
    sequence diagram in Fig. 4 illustrates how polling method is implemented by Master.
    Fig. 4. Sequence diagram of master polling Show All The Master/Slave has the advantage
    of being simple and cost-effective because the Master Station is the only one
    that managing all network connections. With a well-designed Master Station, the
    reliability of the network will be guaranteed. The major disadvantage of this
    method is that the exchange of information between the Slave Stations (if any)
    is limited because the data must pass through the intermediate station also known
    as Master. However, in this design, field-level devices (Slaves) do not need to
    exchange information with each other, so the defect does not appear. SECTION IV.
    SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The system architecture is designed as shown in Fig. 5. It
    includes a Concentrator, End Nodes, Local Database & User Interface and Web Server.
    Concentrator: Coordinates the operation of the network, receives data of environmental
    parameters from the Sensor Nodes and forwards this data to the Supervisor Computer
    and Web Server via Wi-Fi or GPRS/3G service. In addition, this device also functions
    to control the irrigation process according to the mode that the user has installed
    from the Computer Interface or Web Interface. In automatic irrigation mode, the
    data sent from Sensor Nodes is used as feedback to control the irrigation process.
    The Concentrator does not directly control the state of the valves, which is done
    through the Control Nodes located at field level. End Nodes: Includes Sensor Nodes
    and Control Nodes. In particular, the Sensor Nodes performs the measurement of
    air temperature, humidity and soil moisture, while the Control Nodes directly
    controls the actuators such as pumps and valves ordered by the Concentrator. Local
    Database & User Interface : This is where all data of the system is stored. User
    are also provided the option of monitoring, installing and managing system. Web
    Server & Web Interface: Is an online Server for storing data from measurement
    points. It not only provides tools for remote monitoring and control but also
    data analysis based on user requirements. Fig. 5. System Architecture Show All
    SECTION V. DESIGN A. Design of Concentrator Fig. 6. Concentrator block diagram
    Show All Fig. 7. Main program flowchart for Concentrator Show All As represented
    in Fig. 6. The main processing unit in the Concentrator is a 32-bit microcontroller
    (STM32F103RCT6) for powerful processing with clock speeds up to 72 MHz. The Concentrator
    is equipped with three types of wireless communication. While LoRa communication
    enables the Concentrator to connect to field-level devices, WiFi (ESP8266) and
    GPRS (SIM 800L) provide internet service for connecting the system to the Web
    Server. These blocks are handled by the central processing unit through UART standard.
    In order to increase the processing capacity and reduce the load on the central
    processing unit, the LoRa communication block is equipped with a particular microprocessor
    connected to the LoRa SX1278 modem via the SPI standard. Nearly every communication
    task in the LoRa network is processed by this microcontroller. Communication between
    the Concentrator and the Supervisor computer in case of configuration is performed
    by serial communication block (CH34G). The flowchart Fig. 7 describes the design
    of software for Concentrator. B. Design of Sensor Node Fig. 8. Sensor Node and
    Control Node block diagram Show All Fig. 9. Main program flowchart for Sensor
    Node Show All There are eight main blocks in the design of Sensor Node (Fig. 8a).
    The central processing unit in Sensor Node handles LoRa communications task and
    communicates with sensors as well as processes the data given by sensor, so the
    STM32F103 microcontroller is selected to meet the requirement of processing capacity.
    The LoRa modem (SX1278) is connected to the central processing unit via SPI. The
    temperature-humidity sensor (DHT11) is operated by the central processing unit
    via one-wire standard measuring from 0 to 50°C (±2 °C) for temperature and 20-90
    %RH (±5 %RH) for air humidity. The parameter of soil moisture is also given by
    a smart sensor that is linked to the central processing unit through 2-wire synchronization
    standard. Besides, the connection between Sensor Node and Computer for address
    configuration is provided by the serial communication block (CH340G). The configuration
    parameters for the device will be stored in the EPROM. Finally, the LEDs show
    the operating status of the device while the button is used to select either setting
    mode or running mode for the Sensor Node. The software’s algorithm for Sensor
    Nodes is pointed out in flowchart Fig. 9. C. Design of Control Node In the block
    diagram of Control Node Fig. 8b, the Control Node also includes a central processing
    unit (STM32F103), Lora communication block (SX1278), EPROM memory with the same
    function as the Sensor Node. Control the actuators such as valves and pumps is
    the main function of the Control Node performed directly by the Relay block. As
    an important part of Control Node, Feedback block provide information about the
    actual operating state of the actuators so that it allows for quick detection
    of unexpected problems. The software of Control Node device is designed as flowchart
    shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10. Main program flowchart for Control Node Node Show All
    D. Design of Local DataBase & User Interface The Local User Interface (Fig. 11)
    is designed with main functions corresponding to 5 interfaces: Data monitoring
    interface: Display data and status of pumps and valves in the system. Control
    Interface: Allows setting of irrigation mode for each area. There are three modes
    of irrigation: Schedule mode, Automatic mode and Handle mode. Setting interface:
    Allows to add, remove farming area, set up the connection, enable the monitoring
    mode via Internet and chose the data sampling cycle. In addition, the interface
    provides advanced settings related to LoRa’s parameters such as address, frequency,
    spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth to devices in the network. Reporting
    interface: Allows us to access the data and displays in the form of line chart
    and table. Data can also be extracted as Excel file. Crop management interface:
    Provide crop management functions, inquire crop information and propose appropriate
    crop. E. Web Server Intergration Currently, we have built-in Web Server (Fig.
    12) based on Ubiodot’s platform providing remote monitoring, control and data
    storage. Depending on the Internet connection technology selected is GPRS or WiFi
    we respectively use the HTTP method Get/Post or use the TCP/IP protocol to send
    and request data interactively to the Web Server. Fig. 11. Computer Interfaces
    Show All Fig. 12. Web interface based on Ubidots Platform Show All SECTION VI.
    TEST AND RESULT Fig. 13. The whole system Show All We have successfully designed
    a test system (Fig. 13) including 1 Concentrator, 2 Sensor Nodes, 2 Control Nodes,
    1 Local Database & User Interface and 1 Web Server (Ubidots). The tests were conducted
    on the campus of Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Accordingly, the
    End Devices are located about 350 meters from the Cordinator. The Control Nodes
    were connected to the pump (12VDC) and the valves to control the irrigation process
    for the areas where the soil moisture sensors of the Sensor Nodes are located.
    The experiments indicate that the system operate stably and meet the functions
    as designed. The irrigation modes also works correctly. The Fig. 14 and Fig. 15
    demonstrates the experimental process of automatic and scheduled irrigation during
    24 hours. Fig. 14. Automatic Irrigation Show All Fig. 15. Scheduled Irrigation
    Show All Fig. 16. The average transmission time of each message Show All Fig.
    17. Message rates must be re-transmitted at least one time Show All In order to
    evaluate the stability of the system using the Master/Slave medium access control
    method compared to the Pure Aloha method, we created the continuous transmission
    of 100 messages (16 bytes per messages) from End Devices to the Concentrator then
    assessed the rate of re-transmitted message and the average transmission time
    of each message. This test was individually conducted in 4 cases with 1, 2, 3
    and 4 End Devices connected in the network. Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 indicate that
    the higher of End Device, the higher average time needed to transmit a message,
    but the rate of re-transmitted message is always low and almost unchanged in case
    of Master/Slave method is used. For the Pure Aloha method, when the number of
    End Devices increases, the rate of re-transmitted messages rises dramatically
    causing the increase in average transmission time of each message. According to
    that trend, if the number of End Devices continues to increase the system may
    fail. In summary, it is clear that Master/Slave medium access control is more
    stable and reliable than Pure Aloha. SECTION VII. CONCLUSION The paper have presented
    the design of an automatic monitoring and control system for greenhouse agriculture
    including the overall structure of the system and the design in detail of each
    component including hardware and software design. In this study we used LoRa technology
    combined with the Master/Slave medium access control method to resolve the remaining
    issues of some previous studies such as range and reliability of wireless network,
    system functionality and irrigation modes are also made more diversified. Furthermore,
    the ability to control and monitor the system remotely via a Web Interface has
    also been integrated. Lastly, we have also provided some experimental results
    to support our study. With the results achieved, the system will be further studied
    to improve the stability and reliability of the system so that it can be put into
    practice in the near future. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

  description: As a typical cyber-physical system (CPS), smart water distribution
    networks require monitoring of underground water pipes with high sample rates
    for precise data analysis and water network control. Due to poor underground wireless
    channel quality and long-range communication requirements, high transmission power
    is typically adopted to communicate high-speed sensor data streams, posing challenges
    for long-term sustainable monitoring. In this article, we develop the first sustainable
    water sensing system, exploiting energy harvesting opportunities from water flows.
    Our system does this by scheduling the transmission of a subset of the data streams,
    whereas other correlated streams are estimated using autoregressive models based
    on the sound-velocity propagation of pressure signals inside water networks. To
    compute the optimal scheduling policy, we formalize a stochastic optimization
    problem to maximize the estimation reliability while ensuring the system's sustainable
    operation under dynamic conditions. We develop data transmission scheduling (DTS),
    an asymptotically optimal scheme, and FAST-DTS, a lightweight online algorithm
    that can adapt to arbitrary energy and correlation dynamics. Using more than 170
    days of real data from our smart water system deployment and conducting in vitro
    experiments to our small-scale testbed, our evaluation demonstrates that Fast-DTS
    significantly outperforms three alternatives, considering data reliability, energy
    utilization, and sustainable operation.

  description: Models of physical systems are the foundation of many scientific and
    decision support systems. These models rely heavily on observational data, typically
    collected from sensors. Increasingly this data comes from a wide range of sources.
    For example, agricultural models often require data from climate observations,
    soil conditions, on-farm equipment, seasonal forecasts, among others. Integration
    of these data with models is very time-consuming and often is repetitious across
    different models. Furthermore, automation of model runs is difficult due to the
    complexity of managing data dependencies. We have developed a distributed system,
    Senaps, to support automation of sensor data retrieval and coupling with model
    execution in a scalable way. It has been developed over many years across scientific
    disciplines, including water management, agriculture, aquaculture, and related
    Information, Communication and Technologies areas. It has been used, and is in
    use, by a diverse range of projects, resulting in a flexible system that is not
    tied to a specific domain. Senaps includes a publish-subscribe subsystem that
    handles ingestion of disparate time-series data. It supports stream processing,
    such as quality assurance and data checking, and automates data ingestion with
    monitoring and recovery. The storage and access subsystem is a scalable time-series
    backend with an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow third party developers
    to build on. It has a range of features including dynamic temporal aggregations;
    fine-grained access control to support data privacy and sharing (users can elect
    to share data between organisations); metadata for sensor data management; and
    controlled vocabularies. The focus of this paper is the model integration subsystem,
    which provides the model integration and automation features. This system builds
    on developments in cloud and container-based computing to isolate a user submitted
    model’s runtime environment and provide access to the data backend. APIs are provided
    to handle environment images (e.g. Linux with R), model definition, workflows
    (instances of a model), and running of model jobs. We have successfully used this
    system to automate model runs and provide continuous results from a number of
    parameterised models. We have hosted a number of models on the platform, including
    a timber drying model and two agricultural prediction models. Being tied to a
    robust sensor-data backend ensures models are run on the most recent data and
    removes the need for model developers to continuously manage model execution.
    Results from the model are automatically available and can be easily shared between
    users and organisations. In this paper, we detail the technical challenges in
    implementation, provide example results from a running model, and describe our
    next research steps.

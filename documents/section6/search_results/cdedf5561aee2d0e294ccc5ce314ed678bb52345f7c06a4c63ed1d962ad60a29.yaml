    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    Keywords: crop management; sustainable agriculture; smart farming; internet-of-things

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    Figure 6. An Internet-of-Things-based network for smart farming.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

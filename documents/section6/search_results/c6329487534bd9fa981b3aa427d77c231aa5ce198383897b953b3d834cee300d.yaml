  description: Robust streamflow simulation at glacial basins is essential for the
    improvement of water sustainability assessment, water security evaluation, and
    water resource management under the rapidly changing climate. Therefore, we proposed
    a hybrid modelling framework to link the SWAT+ model considering glacial hydrological
    processes (GSWAT+) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks to improve
    the model simulations and to establish a framework for the robust simulation and
    forecast of high and low flows in glacial river basins, which could be further
    used for the explorations of extreme hydrological events under a warming climate.
    The performance of different models (GSWAT+, GRU, and GRU-GSWAT+, respectively)
    were thoroughly investigated based on numerical experiments for two data-scarce
    glacial watersheds in Northwest China. The results suggested that the hybrid model
    (GRU-GSWAT+) outperformed both the individual deep learning (DL) model (GRU) and
    the conventional hydrological model (GSWAT+) in terms of simulation and prediction
    accuracy. Notably, the proposed hybrid model considerably enhanced the simulations
    of low and high flows that the conventional GSWAT+ failed to capture. Furthermore,
    utilizing suitable data integration (DI) schemes on feature and target sequences
    can substantially help to strengthen model stability and representativeness for
    monthly and annual streamflow sequences. Specifically, introducing one order differential
    method and decomposition approach, such as ensemble empirical signal decomposition
    (EEMD) and complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), into feature and target
    sequences enriched the learnable ancillary information, which consequently strengthened
    the predictive performance of the proposed model. Overall, the proposed hybrid
    model with the suitable DI scheme has the potential to significantly enhance the
    accuracy of streamflow simulation in data-scarce glacial river basins. This hybrid
    model not only upheld the fundamental physical principles from the GSWAT+ model,
    but also considerably mitigated the accumulated bias errors, which caused by the
    shortage of climate data and inadequate hydrological principles, by using DL based
    model and DI schemes.

    basin 1. Introduction Reliable streamflow simulation is crucial for understanding
    the impacts of climate change and anthropogenetic activities on hydrological processes,
    as well as for water resource monitoring and management under the rapidly changing
    climate. Numerous physically based distributed hydrological models have been developed
    and employed worldwide, which gradually become indispensable tools to investigate
    streamflow dynamics and evaluate the interactions among land-use, climate, and
    agriculture, etc. Distributed hydrological models usually need high spatial- and
    temporal-resolution and long-term hydrometeorological data for calibration and
    validation. However, it is worth noting that only limited attention has been paid
    to the simulation of the streamflow in glacier-melt dominating basins, where the
    performances of distributed hydrological models are often limited by the incomplete
    descriptions of referred physical processes and uncertainties induced by input
    data and parameterization (Chen et al., 2016, Cho and Kim, 2022). Therefore, additional
    approaches should be considered to get more accurate and reasonable simulations
    of streamflow at different temporal scales (e.g., monthly, and yearly) under changing
    climate in data scarce glacial river basins. Distributed rainfall-runoff models
    usually presented poor simulation and forecasts of the streamflow dynamics in
    high mountainous regions, which is basically caused by the inadequate descriptions
    of snow and glacial hydrological processes, especially for the latter process.
    Since snowmelt water and glacier ablation, which are extremely sensitive to temperature
    change, often contributes the majority of streamflow replenishment in high mountain
    river basins, the snow and glacier related hydrological processes are urgently
    needed in conventional hydrological models under a warming climate. Consequently,
    some recent studies have attempted to incorporate the snow and glacier related
    hydrological processes into hydrological models to promote modeling performance.
    For instance, several studies have incorporated the energy-based glacier model
    and simple temperature index model into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)
    model (Zhang et al., 2013, Ren et al., 2018), and the improved models were fully
    calibrated and validated in eastern Pamir and Tibetan Plateau (TP), showing great
    improvements in simulation accuracies compared to the conventional models (Huang
    et al., 2022, Kan et al., 2018, Tong et al., 2016). Similarly, some researchers
    have adopted temperature-index glacier model into the Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool (SWAT) model to overcome the model shortcomings when using the model in glacial
    basins (Luo et al., 2013, Omani et al., 2017, Adnan et al., 2019). However, the
    insufficient meteorological input data, along with the inadequate in-situ streamflow
    data and limited observed data on snow/glacier mass balance, area, and volume
    changes, pose a challenge in calibrating and validating relevant parameters in
    widely applied hydrological models. As a result, these models often present unsatisfactory
    simulation results in mountainous regions, especially when the streamflow primarily
    relies on snow and glacier meltwater. Although deep understandings of hydrological
    regimes have been acquired, uncertainties in hydrological simulations still remain
    as a big challenge (Lehner et al., 2019). Recently, machine learning (ML) and
    deep learning (DL) approaches have been widely applied to streamflow simulations
    and forecast, which have demonstrated promising prospects in hydrological research
    and require less optimizing parameters than physically based models (Herath et
    al., 2021, Sahraei et al., 2021). For instance, fundamental ML models such as
    random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) model, as well as more complicated
    DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks
    (RNN), have been widely employed in streamflow simulations. In particular, many
    previous studies have reported wide applications of the Long Short-term Memory
    networks (LSTM) in streamflow simulations (e.g., at hourly, daily, monthly, and
    annual scales) with good performance and high efficiency (Luppichini et al., 2022,
    Rahimzad et al., 2021). Despite the LSTM networks have been widely used in streamflow
    simulations, the model showed no satisfactory efficiency, especially for large
    training tasks, due to the low convergence rate. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
    networks with a more concise network structure and fewer calibration parameters,
    in contrast, showed a much faster convergence speed while maintained a comparable
    accuracy as the LSTM model (Gao et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2022). Therefore, utilizing
    suitable ML/DL models such as GRU networks in streamflow simulations may accelerate
    training efficiency and derive superior performance. Furthermore, recent studies
    have attempted to integrate ML/DL techniques with physically-based hydrological
    models to reduce uncertainties from hydrological models (Chen and Xu, 2021, Fan
    et al., 2022, Feng et al., 2022, Gauch et al., 2021, Kratzert et al., 2018, Li
    et al., 2022, Nourani and Behfar, 2021). For instance, a hybrid machine learning
    approach (Iceemdam-XGBoost) has been reported to be able to significantly minimize
    the residuals between observed and simulated streamflow in high mountainous regions
    according to comparisons of several widely used machine learning techniques (Fan
    et al., 2022). Similarly, hybrid models that combined the WRF-Hydro model and
    VIC model with LSTM networks was proposed and evaluated in watersheds in South
    Korea (Cho and Kim, 2022, Kim et al., 2023), which implied that the hybrid model
    was superior to each single approach. These studies suggested that ML/DL models
    can overcome the shortcomings of conventional hydrological models in simulating
    extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods, as well as hydrological
    processes highly affected by human activities such as reservoir regulations. However,
    the accuracy of climatic and hydrological input data directly affect the simulation
    results of both hydrological models and ML/DL models (Boulmaiz et al., 2020),
    while these data are often unavailable or scarce in glacial watersheds due to
    geographical isolation and high instrumental maintenance expenses, especially
    in high mountainous regions (Fan et al., 2022). Therefore, lots of efforts have
    been spent on improving the quality of training datasets for these statistical
    methods using ML/DL based models. For instance, it has been demonstrated that
    combing data integration (DI) schemes with LSTM network model are necessary for
    enhancing streamflow forecasting in snow-dominant catchments (Feng et al., 2020).
    Nevertheless, the corresponding influences of different data integration (DI)
    procedures on the performance of hybrid models have not been comprehensively explored
    in prior research. In the present study, we aim to a) improve streamflow simulation
    performance of conventional hydrological model by introducing DL based model in
    data scarce glacial watersheds; b) emphasize the significance of appropriate DI
    schemes for information enhancement as well. To achieve these goals, a hybrid
    model (GRU-GSWAT+ ) that incorporated DL based model (GRU) and a conventional
    hydrological model (GSWAT+ ) was developed. To evaluate the advantage of this
    proposed model, these models was applied for monthly streamflow simulation in
    two data-scarce glacial watersheds in Tarim River Basin, Northwest China. To enhance
    learnable information, various DI scheme combinations were included in GRU and
    GRU-GSWAT+ model as well. Consequently, the impact of different DI schemes on
    these models were investigated, and propriate DI scheme combinations for different
    hydrological stations using the proposed model were identified. Despite of the
    somewhat preliminary research due to limited data, this study still provides a
    new perspective for better understanding of the streamflow simulation in the Tarim
    River Basin, Northwest China. 2. Material and methods 2.1. GSWAT+ model As an
    enhanced version of the widely used SWAT model (Arnold et al., 1993, Neitsch et
    al., 2011), the SWAT+ model provides great flexibility and extended capabilities
    for model modification and maintenance (Bieger et al., 2017). SWAT+ model reconstructed
    the primary model as numerous independent models or spatial objects such as hydrologic
    response units (HRUs), aquifers, channels, reservoirs etc., which gives users
    more control in terms of modification and calibration under the new modularization
    structure. A given watershed was firstly divided into multiple subbasins, and
    then single or multiple landscape units (LSUs), which used for lumping hydrographs
    and routing them to spatial objects. Similar as SWAT, the precipitation was classified
    into liquid rainfall and snowfall in the form of snowpack according to a predefined
    boundary temperature. Then the snow water equivalent (SWE) was simulated with
    the mass balance equation including snowfall, sublimation, and snow melt. Specifically,
    the snow coverage was considered as a fraction over the total HRU and adjusted
    with an area depletion curve, while snow melt was calculated with a simple degree-day
    model that express snow melt as a linear function of snow coverage and air temperature.
    Furthermore, with no consideration of glacial hydrological processes, this model
    could result in unpredictable errors over data-scarce mountainous watershed. Therefore,
    we incorporated a simple yet efficient temperature-index model considering the
    impacts of solar radiation and albedo as introduced previously (Yang et al., 2022a)
    to improve the model accuracy as depicted in Fig. 1. Firstly, glacier inventory
    dataset was introduced for the delineation of glacier hydrological response units
    (GHRUs), combined with the slope, elevation, land use, and soil datasets. Secondly,
    the degree-day module was utilized for the calculation of glacier meltwater in
    each GRHU. Finally, snow and glacier mass balance were updated and then the snow
    and glacier meltwater were routed into the main channel to generate the final
    streamflow series in the study region. Despite the GSWAT+ have significantly improved
    the overall performance of monthly streamflow simulations in glacial river basins,
    considerably underestimation of the low flows and large accumulated monthly bias
    errors were observed in prior research, which requires further improvements for
    further extreme events research. Download : Download high-res image (749KB) Download

    instance. 2.2. GRU network The Gated Recurrent Unit neural network (GRU) is an
    extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), this approach is designed to mitigate
    the limitations of RNNs to strengthen the memory in long-term sequential datasets
    and avoiding the problem of gradient vanishing and explosion. In particular, in
    comparison with the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), a closely related variants
    of RNN, the GRUs own much concise structures and can outperform it both in terms
    of convergence speed, as well as updating parameters and generalization (Chung
    et al., 2014). The primary enhancement of GRU in comparison with traditional RNN
    is to modulate the information flow within gating units, namely update and reset
    gates, respectively. Specifically, the update gate (Z) determines how much cell
    memory vectors update its activation or content, this gate can expose the whole
    hidden state each time instead of forgetting and maintaining the memories separately
    as LSTM; the reset gate (R) denotes the information of the cell state that flows
    towards the next new hidden state. The two gates share the same compute scheme
    as below: x is a sequence data (x1, x2, …, xt, …, xT), where xt denotes the data
    of current time t (1-T). W is the learnable hidden weights of each gate, is a
    logistic sigmoid function, j is the unit number of GRU. Z and R ranges from 0
    to 1, the more it closes to zero, the more the previously computed state will
    be forgotten. With these simple improvements, it can efficiently guarantee the
    information remain unaltered over a long period of time steps, which greatly helps
    to prevent the gradient vanishing or exploding problems in training process. In
    addition, multiple GRU layers can be stacked together, and the final output of
    the last GRU layer can be connected with a dense layer to get the actual prediction
    value. In this study, the GRU model was consist of two GRU layers and two dense
    layers, and dropout and activation layers were introduced to prevent overfitting
    problem. 2.3. GRU-GSWAT+ model Since a simple baseflow equation was introduced
    into SWAT+ to describe complex ground water process and the lack of accessible
    dam operation data, directly utilizing this model may potentially leading to incorrect
    simulation results relating to ground water and reservoir processes. As previously
    noted, although a glacier degree-day module was integrated into SWAT+ model, inadequate
    measured glacier mass balance data, meteorological data, and streamflow data may
    also result in unexpected uncertainties in the simulations. Due to the abovementioned
    complex uncertainty sources, the bias errors generated by the GSWAT+ are difficult
    to remove by conventional physical models. As noted in previous research, the
    bias error sequence can be simulated and forecasted using DL based models (Cho
    and Kim, 2022). Therefore, we proposed a GRU-GSWAT+ model in this study to minimize
    the uncertainties from streamflow simulations in glacial river basins, and the
    framework of this approach was illustrated in Fig. 2. With the combination of
    conventional distributed hydrological model and deep learning techniques, we can
    further improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations using the physically based
    GSWAT+ model and preserve the physical constraints in the model. Download : Download

    GRU-GSWAT+ model. The difference between observed and simulated monthly streamflow
    data series using GSWAT+ was considered as the target of GRU networks which was
    forced by lagged climate data and the target series itself. Both the feature and
    target series were decomposed and standardized and then the involving hyper parameters
    were optimized well to get forecasted bias error series. The predicted bias error
    series and predicted monthly streamflow using GSWAT+ model was added together
    to obtain the bias-corrected streamflow sequence. As presented in Fig. 2, the
    abovementioned climate, soil, land use, and glacier inventory data were utilized
    to simulate streamflow series using GSWAT+ model, the sensitive parameters were
    carefully optimized during calibration period, and the optimized parameter sets
    were then introduced to predict streamflow in validation period. Then, the difference
    between the simulated and observed streamflow data was calculated as the bias
    errors generated by the GSWAT+ model, and then employed as the target for GRU
    networks in the proposed approach. The samples were trained based on the principle
    of the regression among bias errors and climate variables as well as its self-correlation,
    then the hyperparameters were well tuned to find the most suitable model. Finally,
    the optimized model was setup to predict bias errors for the following time steps
    after training period, and then applied to the predicted streamflow data using
    GSWAT+ model to get bias-corrected streamflow data in validation period. Thus,
    the developed GRU-GSWAT+ model further optimized the simulation results from the
    conventional hydrological model by applying the predicted bias errors in data-scarce
    glacial watersheds. 2.4. Case study 2.4.1. Study area The present study focuses
    on two glacial catchments situated within the Tarim River Basin (TRB) located
    in Xinjiang province Northwest China, including Aksu River Basin (ARB) and Weigan
    River Basin (WRB). The Aksu River is an international river which originates in
    Kyrgyzstan and the middle and lower streams draining into the Tarim River. The
    ARB possess about 29% glacier area and consequently is primarily supplied by snow
    and glacier melt water (30–40%), providing the majority of the water resources
    (approximately 73.2%, 8.1 × 109 m3 a-1) among three primary tributaries of the
    Tarim River (Yang et al., 2022b, Yang et al., 2022c). Monthly streamflow series
    from two hydrological stations involving Shaliguilanke located in the upper stream
    and Xidaqiao situated at the outlet of the ARB were collected in this study. Besides,
    the Weigan River is located in the northern TRB and radial distributed after outflow
    from Tianshan Mountains. In contrast of the ARB, the annual streamflow is roughly
    2.2 × 109 m3 a-1 with the variation coefficient of 0.12 (Hu et al., 2017). Similarly,
    monthly streamflow data from two hydrological stations, including Qianfodong station
    situated at the outlet and Tuokexun station in the middle stream of the WRB, were
    derived in this study as well. The detailed geographic locations and extra attributions
    of the study regions are presented in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image

    in the Tarim River Basin (TB), in which monthly streamflow data series from four
    hydrological stations in Aksu River Basin (ARB) and Weigan River Basin (WRB) were
    derived. 2.4.2. Datasets Daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, total
    precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed data series, which spans from 1979
    to 2018 with a spatial resolution of one degree, were collected from the China
    Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD). Specifically, the gridded daily data series
    and basin-wise monthly averaged data were utilized, where the former was employed
    to drive GSWAT+ model and the latter for GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ model. Furthermore,
    the monthly observed streamflow data ranges mainly from 1980 to 2006 of four hydrological
    stations located in the ARB and WRB were derived for model calibration and validation.
    Specifically, streamflow data from the Qianfodong (1980–1990) and Tuokexun station
    (1984–2006) was chosen owing to the relatively high flows in dry season, whereas
    streamflow from the Shaliguilanke and Xidaqiao station (both spans from 1980 to
    2006) were selected due to the abundant water supplement contributed by snow and
    glacier melt water. Moreover, in respect of the two hydrological stations located
    in the outlet of the ARB and WRB, the hydrological regimes are quite complex and
    accordingly tricky to simulate with physically based models, as it was significantly
    altered in the result of extensive irrigation agriculture and other related human
    activities. In addition, with the purpose of establishing the GSWAT+ model, several
    additional datasets are required. Firstly, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
    (SRTM) data with a spatial resolution of 90 m were employed for streamflow and
    watershed delineation, as well as elevation band division. Moreover, a Global
    Land Cover Characterization (GLCC) dataset at approximately 400 m and 1:5,000,000
    soil map conducted by the Food and an Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO) dataset were conducted and reclassified for the recognition of hydrological
    response units (HRUs). In terms of the simulation of glacial hydrological processes,
    the FCGI dataset was introduced to determine the initial glacier states with glacier
    hydrological response units (GHRUs) accompany with land use data, considering
    the input climate datasets originate from the 1980s and the glacier dataset primarily
    derived from the topographical maps with a scale of 100,000 from 1962 to 1977.
    2.4.3. Data integration procedure Considering the model accuracy and efficiency,
    we conducted a sequence of preprocessing procedures, mainly including data cleaning,
    data integration, and scaling, etc. Existing research demonstrated that data integration
    (DI) can significantly leverage observed streamflow to enhance forecasts using
    deep learning models (Feng et al., 2020). In this study, we utilized two primary
    DI methods including decomposition and lagged observations. Firstly, the prior
    research suggested that multi-scale modeling can significantly improve the performance
    of streamflow simulations (Fan et al., 2022). Therefore, a complete ensemble empirical
    mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) approach was utilized to decompose
    non-stationary targets into a set of oscillatory components called Intrinsic Mode
    Functions (IMFs) with added noise (Torres et al., 2011, Colominas et al., 2014,
    Li and Li, 2016, Chen et al., 2020, Mousavi et al., 2022), in which the target
    series refer to monthly streamflow data series for the GRU model and bias errors
    for GRU-GSWAT+ model (Fig. 2). As existing research suggested (Huang et al., 2014),
    removing high frequency components (IMF1) as inputs can significantly avoid large
    uncertainties and disturbance for simulation and forecasting tasks. Then, the
    decomposed features by the mentioned approach as well as the original climate
    features were leveraged to form a multivariate input sequence. After that, each
    component of the decomposed monthly streamflow/bias error data series using CEEMDAN
    was considered as target values as simulated individually using GRU networks.
    Ultimately, several GRU models was established and well optimized while corresponding
    fitness and predictions of each IMF and residual component in the next time step
    were generated and applied to predict future target sequence continuously, then
    the ensemble sequence was regarded as bias-corrected streamflow series. Then,
    the lagged observations were used as inputs for the GRU model. Precisely, the
    feature and target data were transformed to supervised form with rolling time
    window algorithm, which was recommended by prior research for its substantial
    improvements in streamflow simulation using GRU model (Wegayehu and Muluneh, 2021).
    The forcing climate feature data of each component with a fixed sliding window
    was utilized to predict specific step of the monthly streamflow/bias errors for
    the next time step as depicted in Fig. 4. Specifically, we applied the iterative
    forecast method to train a one-month-ahead prediction model and forecast value
    in forward steps iteratively (Sun et al., 2010). Besides, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
    (ADF) test was introduced to determine the presence of serial correlation in the
    target series and the lagged number of input series. In addition, normalization
    or standardization are required to capture slight changes in data series and accelerate
    model convergence before training, and the scaled datasets were then transformed
    inversely to get the real predictions. Specifically, the training and testing
    datasets were standardized, individually, by scaling the reconstructed features
    and targets between zero to one, which can significantly accelerate the convergence
    of model and avoid information leakage. The Min-Max scaler formula this study
    employed can express as following: Download : Download high-res image (456KB)

    model. Twelve-step forward climate and decomposed series were utilized to predict
    one-step ahead target series in each batch. Where xscaled refers to scaled data
    series, and xi is raw series, xmax and xmin are the maximum and minimum feature
    value, and rmax and rmin refer to the specified feature range should be scaled
    to, which is 1 and 0 in this study individually. 2.4.4. Numeric experiments To
    demonstrate the potential of integrating DL based model with conventional hydrological
    model and to determine the optimal DI schemes for each model, several experiments
    were performed using different combinations of DI schemes and models in two glacial
    watersheds in the Tarim Basin (TB). Specifically, a classical seasonal decomposition
    method (STL) as well as empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its variants, including
    ensemble EMD (EEMD) and complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) were employed
    in this study. The STL method splits a time series into trend, seasonal and residual
    components, while the EMD methods decompose the sequence as several Intrinsic
    Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residual component. In addition, monthly streamflow
    data series are often regarded as non-stationary data, therefore a first order
    differential approach was utilized to transform it to stationary data in one experiment
    as well. For the convenience of comparison, we firstly established a GSWAT+ model
    using daily climate forcing datasets and other additional datasets described above
    to simulate streamflow sequences in four hydrological stations in the TB. Then
    a GRU model was trained using monthly averaged climate series as input and the
    hyperparameters were optimized based on the calculated bias error sequence. The
    streamflow sequence simulated by the proposed GUR-GSWAT+ model can be regarded
    as the accumulation of the predicted bias errors by this GRU model and the predictions
    by the GSWAT+ model. Moreover, a standalone GRU model was also trained to simulate
    streamflow series directly instead of bias error sequences. Notably, the above
    DI schemes were utilized into GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ model to determine the suitable
    DI scheme for each model in the give hydrological stations, individually. Furthermore,
    to illustrate the benefits of the proposed hybrid model, the forecasted streamflow
    sequences at the four given hydrological stations using GRU/GRU-GSWAT+ model with
    optimized DI scheme and GSWAT+ model were compared, individually. As suggested
    in prior research (Chadalawada and Babovic, 2019), Normalized Root Mean Square
    Error (NRMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the
    overall agreement of hydrograph shape, while Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient
    (NSE) and logarithmic NSE (logNSE) is sensitive to high flows and low flows, individually.
    Comparative analysis of the performance was therefore evaluated using there four
    metrics for the GSWAT+, GRU, and GRU-GSWAT+ model, the calculation processes are
    calculated as following: (1) (2) (3) (4) Where and denotes simulated streamflow
    and observed streamflow (m3 s-1) at time t, respectively. and refers to average
    simulated and observed streamflow during the whole period (t from 1 to N), individually.
    Moreover, denotes the standard deviation of the observations in the calculation
    of NRMSE. This metric is more suitable than RMSE for the evaluation among different
    models. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Model calibration and validation As described
    above, each combination of DI scheme and model was regarded as a numeric experiment.
    Notably, both the GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ model was configured with two GRU layers
    and two Linear layers, except for the target data and hyperparameter values. Moreover,
    Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root MSE (RMSE) were alternately applied for each
    batch to constrain model losses during training processes during each epoch owing
    to the anomalies in target sequences. The calibration and validation process of
    the GRU model and GSWAT+ model was applied separately. Specifically, the streamflow
    dataset during the last five years was used for validation due to the relatively
    short observed data period in the Qianfodong station, while the last seven years
    were considered as validation and the rest samples were utilized for calibration
    in other hydrological stations. The parameter optimal procedure of GSWAT+ model
    and the detailed optimized values of the sensitive parameters can be referred
    in the prior paper (Yang et al., 2022a). In terms of the tuning process of the
    GRU networks, a dynamic learning rate spans from 0.1 to 0.0001 was tested without
    altering the other hyperparameters. The hidden size for the networks was tested
    with 126, 256, and 512 while the batch size of 32, 64, 128, and 256. The number
    of epochs for the training process was set as 200, 500, and 1000 individually
    for hyperparameter tuning. Likewise, dropout rate from 0.5 to 1 was adjusted to
    help avoiding model overfitting problem. Finally, the tuned hyperparameters in
    this study were a batch size of 64, 500 epochs, hidden layer number of 256, dropout
    rate of 0.9, and activation function of ReLU. Besides, owing to the monthly input
    and output sequences for the models, a look back size (memory length) for backpropagation
    of 11–14 tends to be appropriate according to the ADF test for the four investigated
    hydrological stations. The detailed look back steps for raw streamflow series
    and the series after one order differential procedural with GRU and GRU-SAWAT+
    model in different hydrological stations is listed in Table 1. Table 1. Look back

    based models are much more flexible in comparison with physically based models,
    owing to different preprocessing and feature enhancement schemes can be integrated
    easily into these models. In order to capture more useful feature information
    for further long-term forecasting tasks, we employed a series of data integration
    (DI) procedure including decomposition and rolling time window algorithm, which
    can significantly enhance the performance of GRU model as existing paper reported
    (Rahmani et al., 2021, Xie et al., 2022, Xu et al., 2022). As the rolling time
    window algorithm or lagged observations is a common procedure in neural network
    modelling tasks, this study pays more attention on evaluating the impacts of different
    DI schemes on GRU forecasting tasks with fixed look back number determined by
    ADF test for each hydrological station. The training performance for monthly streamflow
    series using GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ with each combination of DI scheme as Fig. 5 depicted.
    Notably, to keep the comparison objective, all the related hyperparameters such
    as training epochs, batch size, hidden layers, layer number, learning rate, and
    dropout rate were all fixed while the DI scheme changes for each model, the complete
    description of the optimized values for each hyperparameter can be found in above
    section. As expected, the model performance varies on different DI procedure as
    well as hydrological stations for both GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ model. Fig. 5 shows
    that for monthly streamflow simulation using GRU networks, introducing decomposition
    method such as EMD and EEMD on input feature sequences show the most prominent
    performance across all examined hydrological stations. This may relate to the
    regular and significant periodical characteristics of monthly streamflow sequence,
    which allows simple decomposed feature components to provide adequate information
    for 1-month-ahead prediction. It also indicated that applying decomposition method
    on both feature and target sequences may introducing abundant uncertainties. Notably,
    the implementation of differential method on input features for GRU networks can
    well-fitting the fluctuations of monthly streamflow series as stated by standard
    deviation ratio and R2 metrics, while the bias between simulated and observed
    sequences are relatively large according to RMSE values. Download : Download high-res

    performance comparison of GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ networks with different DI scheme
    combinations for the examined hydrological stations during validation period.
    Where pink dash lines in this figure refers to the NRMSE, grey solid lines stand
    for the coefficient of determination (R2) between simulation and observation,
    while the horizontal and vertical axes are the ratio of standard deviation of
    observed and corresponding simulated streamflow sequence. Specifically, REFs located
    in the axes show a standard deviation of zero, which means the simulation perfectly
    matches the observation. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
    figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) In
    terms of the simulation with GRU-GSWAT+ model, each combination of DI scheme outperforms
    the corresponding GRU model as Fig. 5 illustrated, owing to the promising evaluation
    metrics involving standard deviation ratio close to one and NRMSE value less than
    0.5, as well as R2 value greater than 0.8 in all examined hydrological stations.
    Similarly, introducing decompose and differential methods into input sequences
    can help the neural networks to derive additional beneficial information and preserve
    the input dataset as stationary sequence, leading to promising simulation results.
    In contrast, introducing differential method on input features resulted in smaller
    RMSE and R2, whereas the standard deviation ratio is smaller than 1, indicating
    a well-fitting sequence with a greater self-dispersion. This suggested that differential
    approach is an efficient way to enhance the simulation accuracy for the proposed
    GRU-GSWAT+ model. The analysis implied that the bias error sequence tends to be
    a non-stationary data series similar as monthly streamflow series while the periodicity
    is much more complex. Due to this complexity, decomposition on input feature sequences
    with EEMD or CEEMDAN can introduce more useful and detailed information, therefore
    presenting a pronouncing simulation result, specifically for hydrological stations
    located at the outlets of river basins, such as Tuokexun and Xidaqiao station.
    As indicated in Fig. 5, several model configurations were thoroughly compared,
    and the best combinations of model and DI scheme were selected (Table 2) with
    respect of synthetic evaluation of the NRMSE, R2, and standard deviation metrics.

    EMD None Differential Differential Note: None in the above table refers no extra
    transformations have been applied for the corresponding sequence. Here we can
    conclude that, the inclusion of the historical observations as input features
    of the GRU model can enhance the capability to capture the underlying periodic
    patterns and complex dynamics in datasets. The improvement in model performance
    can be attributed to the strong temporal autocorrelation in the monthly streamflow
    series. If decomposition has been conducted on feature series, the same procedure
    is not necessary for target series in case of introducing unpredicted uncertainties
    from the high frequency components. In addition, applying decomposition and differential
    approaches on complex target series can significantly strengthen model performance
    and accelerate training process, while these procedures tend to be unsuitable
    for streamflow simulation which owns singular and significant periodicity, since
    the high frequency components such as IMF1 may introduce unpredictable uncertainties.
    Nevertheless, the given comparison among multiple DI scheme combined models suggested
    that the compound of suitable decomposition approach, differential, lagged observations,
    and GRU networks have significant positive effects on streamflow simulations and
    predictions. We can conclude that these flexible schemes give a new perspective
    to enhance the simulation and forecasting accuracy of hydrological models with
    the assistance of DL based models. 3.3. Predictive performance comparison among
    different models with optimized DI scheme In this section, each model with optimal
    DI scheme combination as prementioned was introduced in Table 2 for predictive
    performance comparison. To comprehensively assess the performance of the models,
    we have calculated multiple indices rather than focusing on individual aspect
    as presented in Table A1. These performance evaluation metrics can provide a more
    deepen understanding of the capabilities of the models, allowing for a more robust
    comparison between the applied models. The simulated and predicted monthly streamflow
    series for the four hydrological stations using the abovementioned models were
    presented in Fig. 6. The evaluation metrics indicated that the GRU and GRU-GSWAT+
    model achieved superior performance compared to the GSWAT+ model across all examined
    hydrological stations, which is consistent with earlier published research (Beven,
    2020). For instance, the NRMSE values of the simulated streamflow were significantly
    reduced using GRU-GSWAT+ and standalone GRU model compared with the GSWAT+ model.
    Specifically, the NRMSE of the streamflow decreased from a mean of 0.6 and 0.5
    using GSWAT+ to a mean of 0.1 and 0.5 using standalone GRU model, and to a mean
    of 0.2 and 0.3 using GRU-GSWAT+ model across all above hydrological stations during
    calibration and validation period, individually. Download : Download high-res

    comparison with GRU, GSWAT+, and GRU-GSWAT+ model, where the black dots stand
    for observed streamflow, and colored lines refer to simulated streamflow using
    different model; subfigure (I) stands for observed monthly streamflow simulation
    versus the corresponding simulation results with abovementioned models during
    the entire period, whereas subfigure (II) and subfigure (III) refers to the comparison
    during calibration (training) and validation (testing) period, individually. Moreover,
    each row wise figure points to a hydrological station. Specifically, (a)-(d) refer
    to four hydrological stations of Qianfodong, Shaliguilanke, Tuokexun, and Xidaqiao,
    individually. As we mentioned above, the primary problem of the GSWAT+ model is
    the failure of capturing extreme values, specifically the underestimation of low
    flows and slightly overestimation of high flows. To overcome this large bias resulted
    by inadequate low flow mechanism and uncertainties from input datasets, DI schemes
    and GRU networks were introduced to assist the GSWAT+ model. The performance of
    high and low flows was evaluated using NSE and logNSE, respectively. Particularly,
    due to the relatively short period of observations at the Qianfodong station,
    in comparison with the GSWAT+ model, the improvements of GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ model
    is not significant, particularly for the simulation of low flows. Except for this
    hydrological station, the results indicated a slight increasing of a mean of NSE
    and logNSE from 0.7 (0.5) with the GSWAT+ model to 0.6 (0.8) with the GRU model
    during validation period. Furthermore, the proposed GRU-GSWAT+ presented a NSE
    and logNSE of 0.8 and 0.7, with a significant improvement of 14.3% and 40% compared
    to the GSWAT+ model, respectively. This indicates a superior performance of GRU-GSWAT+
    model, followed by GRU model and GSWAT+ model. Furthermore, the significant overestimation
    of high flows was rarely existed using GRU-GSWAT+ model compared to the standalone
    GRU model, take the Tuokexun station for instance. As a result of the significant
    seasonal characteristics in monthly data sequence, well fitted hydrograph on monthly
    scale using numerical models is not a challenge work. However, the bias errors
    simulated on monthly scale will be accumulated gradually and could result in large
    bias errors on annual scale, especially when the fluctuations over interannual
    scale is comparatively slight. The cumulative effect of the bias errors of monthly
    scale on the accuracy of annual scale simulation has not been thoroughly discussed
    in previous research. Thus, the simulated results on monthly scale then aggregated
    to annual scale to thoroughly illustrate the advantage of the proposed hybrid
    model as depicted in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (740KB) Download

    GRU, GSWAT+, and GRU-GSWAT+ model, the sub figures share the same order and symbols
    as Fig. 6. Specifically, the black points and lines in subfigure (I) stand for
    observation data, whereas the black dash lines in the other figures refer to 1:1
    line which also refer to observed data. As presented in Fig. 7, the accumulated
    bias errors from monthly scale using GSWAT+ is considerable and could affect further
    interannual variation analysis. In comparison with the GRU and GSWAT+ model, the
    predictive performance of the proposed GRU-GSWAT+ model is superior. Take the
    NRMSE for instance, a mean of 1.7 and 1.3 was considerably reduced to 0.4 and
    0.7 during calibration and validation period across the investigated hydrological
    stations using GSWAT+ and GRU-GSWAT+ model, individually. Additionally, in comparison
    with the GSWAT+ model, the most substantial improvements of the predicted extreme
    streamflow series using GRU-GSWAT+ model were observed at the Qianfodong and Shaliguilanke
    station, with logNSE values increasing from −3.2 and −1.1 to 0.9 and 0.6 while
    NSE increased from −2.4 and −0.7 to 0.9 and 0.7, individually. It should be noted
    that a considerable overfit was observed during validation period at the Tuokexun
    station with a NSE value of −0.9 and −7.7 using GSWAT+ and GRU model, while the
    value of 0.4 is more reasonable using GRU-GSWAT+ model. On the other hand, all
    the tested models exhibited negative NSE values during validation period at the
    Xidaqiao station, indicating that further analysis is necessary to improve the
    model performance in this region. Nevertheless, the above analysis revealed that,
    consistent with prior research (Cho and Kim, 2022, Kim et al., 2023), the proposed
    hybrid model in our study exhibited a superior simulation and forecasting capacities
    in comparison to the standalone models. In particular, the hybrid model is more
    likely to achieve comprehensive optimal simulation results, rather than biased
    to a certain emulation index. This hybrid model not only presented a more accurate
    and robust predictive performance than standalone GRU model, but also significantly
    strengthen the simulation accuracy of low and high flows that GSWAT+ model fails
    to capture in the lack of measured climate data, as well as the unsuitable ground
    water algorithm and other inadequate description of processes in glacial river
    basins. To be concluded, the proposed hybrid model inherited both the efficiency
    and accuracy from DL based GRU model, as well as preserved the physical fundamentals
    from GSWAT+ model. 3.4. Limitations and uncertainties Accurate predictions are
    essential for effectively managing water resources and mitigating the impacts
    of hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts. The aim of this study is
    to introduce deep learning techniques to help enhancing the modelling and forecasting
    accuracy of the conventional physically based hydrological models, GSWAT+ model
    to be specific, in data scarce glacial watersheds. Therefore, several DI schemes
    were explored in this study, implying that suitable DI scheme is beneficial for
    simulation and prediction with DL based model. This also highlights the flexibility
    of DL based models in comparison with physically based models. Specifically, decompose
    target series into several components and model the sub-series individually can
    guarantee a robust simulation and prediction result, yet the computation cost
    is relatively higher than corresponding standalone model. In this study, we applied
    the same networks for each component to preserve model conciseness and simplicity,
    hence introducing suitable DL based models for each component individually may
    help saving computation time. Moreover, the abovementioned DL based model was
    utilized individually for each streamflow series across hydrological stations
    without considering spatial heterology. Further DI procedures may be required
    to include basin attributes such as soil characteristics and land-use types, snow
    and glacier distribution, slope, and elevation conditions to derive spatially
    varying benefits so that the model can transfer it from training to testing process
    and learn regional characteristics, or a spatial–temporal DL based model should
    be developed for basin-wise or even regional scale streamflow simulation and prediction
    in future work. On the other hand, the DL based models are usually considered
    as black-box model, and based on the given objective functions which use restricted
    information to generate simulations without intricate interpretation of the simulation
    process. Therefore, this kind of models often achieve high accuracy and acquire
    less input data in comparison with conventional hydrological model, while the
    interpretability of hydrological regimes is relatively difficult in comparison
    with the physically based models (Hamilton and Papadopoulos, 2023). In terms of
    the proposed GRU-GSWAT+ model, the overall simulated hydrograph is primarily determined
    by the physically based hydrological model (GSWAT+ ), the applied GRU model is
    regarded as an efficient assistant for further improvements. Despite we assumed
    that the underestimated low flows are mainly resulted by the inadequate groundwater
    description in the GSWAT+ model, while the overestimated high flows are affected
    by insufficient input data and related hydrological processes, the improved bias
    errors using GRU model is still lack of validation and well interpretation due
    to the limited observations. As introduced in previous research (Chadalawada et
    al., 2020, Herath et al., 2020, Cai et al., 2022, Jiang et al., 2022), the concept
    of the physical-informed model was to overcome the limitations of the less interpretability
    of data-driven models such as deep learning models, and the poorer predictive
    capabilities of conventional physically based hydrological models. For instance,
    several interpretative deep learning approaches (Ribeiro et al., 2016, Lundberg
    and Lee, 2017, Hamilton and Papadopoulos, 2023), such as Shapley Addictive exPlanations
    (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), and other similar
    frameworks have been introduced in previous research to explore the physical hydrological
    processes. The other approach is directly integrating physical processes into
    DL based models to improve the capabilities to analyze the underlying hydrological
    dynamics. These two approaches may be considered in the future research to enhance
    the interpretable capacities of the proposed hybrid model. Nevertheless, this
    study illustrated the potential capability of DL based model in boosting physically
    based hydrological model simulations by integrating these two types of models.
    This analysis hinted that the DL based models can be utilized to constrain the
    uncertainties from the driven datasets and physically based models, as well as
    to accelerate parameter optimization process, thus improving the simulation and
    prediction accuracy of the conventional hydrological models. In summary, our proposed
    hybrid framework can efficiently improve simulation accuracy with minimal modifications,
    and it can be easily implemented with other DL based and physically based hydrological
    models in various regions. 4. Conclusions The present study proposed a hybrid
    framework, which integrating a DL based GRU model and a conventional physically
    based model (GSWAT+ ), to obtain more accurate and reasonable simulations of streamflow
    at different temporal scales (e.g., monthly, and yearly). Moreover, the influence
    of different DI scheme combinations such as decomposition and differential approaches
    on predictive performance was thoroughly investigated as well. To illustrate the
    improvements of the proposed hybrid model, the GSWAT+, GRU, and GRU-GSWAT+ model
    was applied over four hydrological stations located in two glacial watersheds
    in the Tarim River Basin (TRB), individually. The following conclusions are listed
    according to the above analysis: 1. Multiple Data Integration (DI) approaches
    were introduced for input and output sequences individually, and the DI combinations
    were integrated with GRU and GRU-GSWAT+ model, respectively. The analysis indicated
    that introducing appropriate decomposition method into feature sequences can significantly
    enrich learnable information for monthly streamflow simulation using GRU networks,
    whereas the differential and decomposition method such as EEMD and CEEMDAN are
    more suitable approaches for proposed GRU-GSWAT+ model. 2. The proposed GRU-GSWAT+
    model with optimal DI scheme significantly improved the performance of low and
    high flows that the conventional GSWAT+ model fails to capture. This hybrid model
    exhibited the most robust and accurate predictive performance over the four examined
    hydrological stations in comparison with the standalone GRU and GSWAT+ model.

  description: This paper provides an overview of the progress made in remote sensing
    of water resources in Africa, focusing on various applications such as precipitation
    estimation, land surface temperature analysis, soil moisture assessment, surface
    water extent measurement, surface runoff and streamflow analysis, water quality
    evaluation, land cover/land use mapping, and groundwater analysis. Specifically,
    the study sheds light on the remarkable progress made in remote sensing applications,
    showcasing scientific advancements and highlighting the challenges encountered.
    Moreover, it identifies crucial knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order
    to further advance this field. The review's key findings indicate that the availability
    of sensors and observations, along with analytical models, has contributed to
    monitoring Africa's water resources at various scales. The availability and accessibility
    of hydrological data for monitoring and assessing water resources in Africa have
    been partially improved through the adoption of satellite data and processing
    technologies. Additionally, the emergence of various international remote sensing
    initiatives, North-South research collaborations, and projects has contributed
    to the research progress. Prominent satellite data series such as Landsat, MODIS,
    and GRACE have played significant roles in African hydrological research. However,
    the limited and malfunctioning in-situ hydrological monitoring networks in Africa
    have affected the accurate calibration and validation of remotely sensed hydrological
    models. Insufficient long-term rainfall and climate data pose challenges to long-term
    earth observation research on African water systems. The lack of high-resolution
    spatial and temporal data hampered accurate monitoring of hydrological processes
    at smaller scales. Despite the widespread use of rainfall satellite products,
    validation attempts over Africa, particularly in western and southern regions,
    have been limited. Furthermore, the reliability of hydrological satellite datasets
    is affected by factors such as the number and coverage of surface stations, retrieval
    algorithms, data integration techniques, and cloud cover. Overall, this work demonstrates
    the importance of earth observation in understanding Africa's hydrology, previously
    hindered by the lack of in-situ data. Nevertheless, efforts are therefore needed
    to enhance the adoption and application of remote sensing, particularly in groundwater
    and surface water estimation at smaller scales. Future research should focus on
    multi-source data integration, assimilation, and big data analytics using cloud
    computing and machine learning to address complex hydrological research questions
    at various scales.

    security 1. Introduction Africa''s hydrology exhibits high variability in both
    temporal and spatial dimensions due to its diverse climatic zones, ranging from
    humid tropics to hyper-arid regions (Hughes, 2007). Continuous monitoring and
    assessment are essential to understand subtle changes in hydrological processes.
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Land and Climate
    Change (IPCC SRCL, 2019), highlights the impact of rising temperatures and variable
    rainfall patterns on Africa''s hydrology. Of late, some regions have begun to
    experience extreme droughts, water deficits, runoff decreases, and severe evapotranspiration,
    resulting in increased aridity in some parts of the continent and vice versa.
    Research employing time-series catchment and regional-scale spatial analysis reveals
    that areas reliant on surface water as the primary freshwater source are particularly
    vulnerable to climate change, which has profound consequences for ecosystems,
    economies, and livelihoods (Wilhite et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2017, Huang et
    al., 2018; Chiloane et al., 2020). Severe droughts and resulting water shortages
    have been observed in numerous cities, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, during
    the first two decades of the twenty-first century (Zhang et al., (2019). Notable
    examples include the recent drought in South Africa''s Western Cape province from
    2015 to 2018 (Watson et al., 2022). Aside from aridity, variability in climate
    and water resources, and a lack of in-situ data, integrated water resource management
    in Africa''s shared transboundary river basins remains complex and elusive (Hughes,
    2007). Consequently, the utilization of remotely sensed data products has gained
    prominence in water resource monitoring efforts. The urgency of effective and
    sustainable water resource monitoring and management, as well as long-term water
    resource management (WRM), is paramount in gaining a comprehensive understanding
    of Africa''s hydrology in the face of climate change and variability. Unfortunately,
    financial constraints and inadequate hydro-meteorological infrastructure hinder
    many African countries from generating sufficient data on freshwater availability
    (Hughes, 2007, Awange et al., 2016, Winkler et al., 2017, Muthoni et al., 2019).
    The scarcity of global meteorological stations in Africa compared to other regions
    raises concerns about data coverage and distribution (Fig. 1). Developed countries
    possess a more extensive network of weather stations with extensive historical
    data archives, crucial for calibrating and validating remotely sensed hydrological
    products. The dense network of in-situ hydrological monitoring stations, combined
    with earth observation (EO) technologies, plays a pivotal role in enabling more
    accurate wall-to-wall forecasting and facilitating effective WRM implementation
    strategies. However, it is worth noting that despite the limited availability
    of in-situ data, water-related research continues across the continent. The emergence
    of EO technologies with diverse spatial and temporal scales has sparked significant
    interest in their application for monitoring and assessing water resources, particularly
    at catchment or sub-catchment scales. EO technologies have proven invaluable in
    providing essential hydrological data for regions in Africa where hydro-meteorological
    networks are limited or inaccessible, bridging critical gaps in in-situ data (Fernandez-Prieto
    and Palazzo, 2007, van Dijk and Renzullo, 2011, Sheffield et al., 2018, Gxokwe
    et al., 2020). This trend has been driven by the demand for detailed and timely
    information on water resources, encompassing variables such as rainfall, runoff,
    water quality, and quantity, considering the challenges posed by global climate
    change, competing demands, and the interconnectedness of food and water security.

    across Africa in comparison to the global coverage of monitoring stations (Source:
    The National Centres for Environmental Information - National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration. However, it is important to acknowledge that although African
    national agencies generally have more weather stations, accessing this data remains
    a challenge.) This review critically examines the utilization of Earth Observation
    (EO) techniques for water resources assessment and monitoring in Africa. Specifically,
    it provides a detailed examination of the strengths, weaknesses, and operational
    scales associated with these techniques, drawing insights from previous scientific
    studies. The review highlights the development and application of remote sensing
    in understanding the hydrological cycle, showcasing key studies that have employed
    EO technology in Water Resource Management (WRM). Furthermore, it discusses the
    current challenges and limitations faced in utilizing remote sensing for WRM,
    with a specific focus on data-scarce regions in Africa. The review concludes by
    outlining future prospects and potential advancements in remote sensing, offering
    promising opportunities for enhanced water resource monitoring and management
    across the continent. 2. The hydrology of Africa The African continent is divided
    into climatic zones, which influence its hydrology and the availability of water
    resources (Conway et al., 2009). The northern and southern coasts have a Mediterranean
    climate, with dry summers and long wet winters. The Sahara Desert which borders
    the northern Mediterranean region on the south and east, gradually narrows from
    west to east, encompassing Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. The Sahara Desert
    is the world''s hottest desert, accounting for roughly 30 % of Africa''s total
    land area (Tucker, Dregne and Newcomb, 1991). Rainfall in the Sahara is extremely
    scarce, with rare runoff that is usually of extremely short duration, high levels
    of evaporation, and thus limited surface water sources (Kitambo et al., 2022).
    In the southern tip of Africa, the climate is predominantly Mediterranean, a characteristic
    feature of South Africa''s Western Cape Province. The vegetation in the Mediterranean
    regions consists primarily of shrubs, scrubs, or bushes, which respond differently
    to rainfall, temperature, and land use and land cover dynamics. In the Western
    Cape, for example, the Fynbos vegetation dominates the landscape (Mkunyana et
    al., 2019) though currently threatened by invasive species (Mtengwana et al.,
    2021). In the central parts, the equatorial region is another feature of the African
    climatic zone. This is primarily found in western, central, and eastern Africa,
    and is distinguished by high annual rainfall (Dargie et al., 2017). This region
    includes the Congo River, the world''s second largest hydrological basin in terms
    of drainage area and discharge to the ocean, and the Nile River, the world''s
    longest river (Dai et al., 2009, Kitambo et al., 2022). In contrary, West Africa
    has few large water resources, whereas central Africa has the majority located
    in the Congo basin, the Great Lakes region, and the Nile''s head waters (United
    Nations 1962, Kitambo et al., 2022). The tropical forests that cover much of central
    Africa serve as a carbon sink and are home to a diverse range of plant and animal
    species. The tropics are mostly semi-arid, with rainy summers and dry winters
    and are dominated by the Savannah vegetation. The savannah region is home to three
    of the world''s ten largest freshwater lakes: Lakes Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria
    (Kitambo et al., 2022). Across Africa, the diverse climate zones exhibit notable
    differences in water availability. These variations encompass the amount of rainfall
    received, the volume of water resources present, and the distribution between
    surface water and primarily groundwater sources (Fig. 2 a, b, c and d). In these
    regions, both surface water and groundwater are essential for supporting human
    livelihoods and driving economic development (Chiloane et al., 2022; Mpakairi
    et al., 2022). Presently, the estimated total volume of groundwater in Africa
    is approximately 0.66 million km3 (MacDonald et al., 2012), determined based on
    the combined saturated thickness and effective porosity of aquifers (Fig. 2a and
    b). Smaller water systems like streams, reservoirs, ponds, and tanks contribute
    significantly to the African hydrological system, serving as important sources
    of water, aquatic life, and agricultural production for rural communities in Sub-Saharan
    Africa (Kitambo et al., 2022). Moreover, groundwater is relied upon by a majority
    of the sub-Saharan population for economic and domestic purposes (Xu et al., 2019).
    Hence, recognizing the impact of climate variation on hydrology is vital for understanding
    vegetation dynamics and implementing effective strategies to address water resource
    management challenges. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    of Africa (UNEP, 2010). 3. Development of remote sensing in water resources management
    Over the years, the remote sensing of WRM have undergone significant advancements,
    transitioning from traditional methods like aerial photography to advanced satellite
    systems (Bhaga et al., 2020). These satellite systems now offer routine monitoring
    capabilities for various water balance components and topographic parameters affecting
    water catchments. The availability of open data access and a wealth of new satellite
    resources has provided developing countries with limited in-situ networks unprecedented
    access to freely available products for hydrological research. The development
    of multi-spectral satellite, radar, and drone sensors has made EO datasets more
    attractive for water-related studies, offering wider coverage, diverse products,
    higher frequencies, and low to no cost (Manfreda et al., 2018). This, in turn,
    has facilitated the advancement of modeling and forecasting techniques, resulting
    in more accurate estimation and understanding of water resources and their dynamics
    at various scales. The exponential increase in the number of studies utilizing
    freely available satellite data for surface water monitoring in data-scarce regions,
    particularly drylands, highlights the growing interest and utility of these resources
    (Ozesmi and Bauer, 2002, Chen et al., 2013, Powell et al., 2019). To document
    and consolidate the hydrological research trends of the past decades, this review
    was conducted, encompassing various themes and providing key scientific findings
    and conclusions. By analyzing a wide range of publications, the review identifies
    knowledge gaps, presents insights on African hydrology, and proposes potential
    future research directions. The selection of area-specific keywords and phrases,
    such as ''Remote sensing,'' ''Water resource management,'' ''Sahel region,'' ''Africa,''
    ''Hydrology,'' and ''Sustainable development,'' was employed to identify and analyze
    the number of published studies in the field (Fig. 3). The abundance of scientific
    works in peer-reviewed journals served as the basis for compiling this comprehensive
    review, aiming to contribute to the understanding and advancement of hydrological
    research. Download : Download high-res image (251KB) Download : Download full-size

    remote sensing datasets for water resource management in Africa from 2000 − 2021.
    The analysis focused on two specific searches: Search 1 identified the number
    of papers using direct satellite measures, while Search 2 counted the number of
    papers based on models utilizing satellite indices. 4. Remote sensing for water
    resources management Spatial Water Resource Monitoring Systems (SWRMS) are dedicated
    remote sensing missions that provide valuable information for WRM (van Dijk and
    Renzullo, 2011). SWRMS provides an improved spatial understanding of the hydrological
    processes by providing near /or real-time monitoring of evapotranspiration (Karimi
    and Bastiaanssen, 2015), precipitation (Toté et al., 2015), soil moisture (Ma
    et al., 2019), surface water (Revilla-Romero et al., 2016), water quality (Sagan
    et al., 2020), Land Cover/Land Use (Chang et al., 2018), groundwater (Liu et al.,
    2016), as well as forecasting and early warning systems. The advancements of SWRMS
    have opened new avenues for water resource monitoring in data scarce regions such
    as Africa, allowing a more in-depth understanding of their water balance. This
    has been aided by the presence of several hydrological models developed for simulating
    global hydrology, which have been adopted or adapted for hydrological modelling
    of various catchments and climates throughout Africa. Some of these studies have
    yielded promising results at the river basin or catchment scale. It is important
    to note, however, that the majority of these models, such as the Soil and Water
    Assessment Tool (SWAT), Climatic Research Unit (CRU) (Sood and Smakhtin 2015),
    Surface Energy Balance Model (SEBS) (Shoko et al., 2017; Govender et al., 2022)
    the HEC-HMS model, and plant water use and rainfall estimation models, require
    many parameters to be calibrated at the regional scale, and in most cases, these
    parameter variables are not easily accessible. Furthermore, most of these hydrological
    models use satellite-based weather input data, with coarse spatial resolutions
    (i.e., 250 m to 1 km pixel size or 0.5-degree gridded format), making them only
    useful for large scale hydrological applications, such as long-term assessment
    of the impacts of climate change and impact on global water (Sood and Smakhtin
    2015). As a result, refining these globally oriented hydrological models to fine
    scale applications to address localised water resources and societal issues is
    required. In view of the observations highlighted beforehand, in the sections
    that follow a detailed synthesis and discussion on the applications of EO data
    in precipitation, Land surface temperatures (LST), runoff and evapotranspiration
    (ET), soil moisture, groundwater, water quality, water extent, as well as floods/droughts
    in Africa is provided. 4.1. Precipitation estimations from remotely sensed data
    Accurate measurement of precipitation is crucial for water resource management,
    as it is the primary driver of the hydrological cycle. However, in Africa, the
    existing rain gauge networks are insufficient and dwindling, (De Coning and Poolman,
    2011), making it challenging to obtain reliable rainfall estimate (Sawunyama and
    Hughes, 2008). The meteorological station coverage across the continent is severely
    lacking, with only a few countries having adequate networks (Fig. 1). To supplement
    gauge observations, rainfall satellite products are widely used in Africa. These
    satellite-derived estimates help overcome the limitations of in-situ gauging stations,
    many of which suffer from maintenance issues when they are available. Efforts
    are underway to improve operations by utilizing a combination of multiple satellites
    and merging gauge-calibrated products (Sheffield et al., 2018). This approach
    enables the use of satellite-derived estimates to provide near real-time rainfall
    observations with enhanced spatial distribution and higher temporal frequency
    (Makapela et al., 2015). In the field of remote sensing, both infrared (IR) and
    microwave imagery are still widely used for estimating precipitation (Stephens
    and Kummerow, 2007). Various rainfall estimation products have been developed
    utilizing these techniques, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
    (TRMM) (Bai et al., 2018), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information
    using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) (Awange et al., 2016), Climate Prediction
    Center-Morphing (CMORPH) (Xie et al., 2017), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
    (GSMAP) (Tian et al., 2010), Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with
    Stations (CHIRPS) (Funk et al., 2015), Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation
    (MSWEP) (Beck et al., 2019), as well as SM2RAIN precipitation products. These
    rainfall estimation products are highly regarded due to their ability to integrate
    multiple satellite and ground-based datasets, resulting in improved accuracy and
    reliability. The TRMM mission is equipped with three on-board instruments that
    measure rainfall and energy exchange. These instruments are: (i) TRMM’s Microwave
    Imager (TMI) quantifies water vapour, cloud water and rainfall intensity; the
    (ii) Passive Microwave (PM) sensor provides information on rainfall distribution,
    type, storm depth and height at which snow melts to rain; and the (iii) Visible
    and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) provides cloud-top temperatures (Kummerow, 1998).
    However, this data only ran up to 2015. Fortunately, the Global Precipitation
    Measurement (GPM) mission is the successor of the TRMM, providing more advanced
    capabilities to measure light rain, falling snow and quantifying microphysical
    properties of precipitation (Skofronick-Jackson et al., 2017). This is due to
    the GPM’s Microwave Imager (GMI) that captures precipitation intensities and horizontal
    patterns, as well as a Dual Frequency Precipitation Radar that provides 3-dimesional
    insight of the precipitation structure (Schwaller and Robert Morris, 2011). Despite
    widespread use of most of these satellite derived rainfall products, few attempts
    on validation have been made over Africa, particularly in western and southern
    Africa (Dinku et al., 2007). Furthermore, most of these validation exercises have
    been limited to a small number of products (for example, monthly estimates with
    a spatial resolution of 2.5°x2.5° latitude/longitude). Coupled with various rainfall
    products, various data processing and modelling techniques have been developed
    and tested at various scales and these include statistical downscaling methods
    and blended techniques. Statistical downscaling methods (He et al., 2016) and
    blended techniques (Chappell et al., 2013) have proved to be useful in producing
    higher resolution data required for fine scale estimation. However, because rain-gauge
    stations continue to provide the most reliable rainfall datasets, remotely sensed
    precipitation estimates rely on rain-gauge calibration, and Africa''s sparse network
    of rain-gauge stations provides a poor baseline validation dataset to compare
    against EO datasets (Sun et al., 2018). As a result, when estimating precipitation
    in Africa, uncertainties are frequently high (Awange et al., 2019). EO programs,
    as well as other precipitation data derived from various satellite missions, are
    summarized in (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), along with their specifications. Download : Download

    Satellite missions and data availability between 1970 and 2022. * An online atlas
    that combines a series of different information and data. Despite the uncertainties
    in remote sensing-based precipitation products over Africa, significant progress
    has been made in developing techniques to provide accurate and on-demand information.
    The CHIRPS-v2 product, for example, combines rain gauge and satellite data to
    produce a spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall in areas with significant data
    gaps. This has proven beneficial in all African ecosystems. Muthoni et al., (2019)
    for example, used CHIRPS-v2 to study the spatiotemporal variation of rainfall
    over Eastern and Southern Africa between 1981 and 2017. The study assessed the
    reliability of the CHIRPS-v2 data product using a ''goodness-of-fit'' method adapted
    from the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (a statistical method to analyse the importance
    of different components in a hydrological model). Between 2003 and 2010, Awange
    et al., (2016) compared six popular precipitation products over Africa. ARCv2,
    CMORPH, TRMM, GSMAP, Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite and
    ground-based observations (TAMSAT), and PERSIANN were among the products. The
    study used a ''three-cornered-hat'' (TCH) approach to analyze the uncertainties
    of these products, and then compared the results to data from the Global Precipitation
    Climatology Centre (GPCC), as well as rain gauge data from the Greater Horn of
    Africa. Overall, rain gauge-merged products were found to have lower errors than
    satellite-only products. Furthermore, the PERSIANN product demonstrated the lowest
    uncertainty over the majority of Africa, except for the Greater Horn of Africa,
    where CMORPH and GSMAP demonstrated the lowest uncertainty, demonstrating that
    no single product is suitable for all locations. Similarly, Awange et al., (2019)
    investigated the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP-V2.1) product
    over Australia and Africa between 1981 and 2016. MSWEP-V2.1 is a global rainfall
    product that combines satellite, rain gauge, and re-analysis data to maximize
    their benefits, while minimizing their drawbacks. To compare MSWEP data, the study
    used data from various sources. FLUXNET (a global network of independent micrometeorological
    tower sites), Australia''s Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), the GPCC, CHIRPS, and
    the Agriculture Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (AgCFSR) were among those used.
    MSWEP''s accuracy in producing rainfall estimates was evaluated using a suite
    of statistical methods including Pearson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Principal Component
    Analysis (PCA), and TCH. Overall, MSWEP-V2.1 agreed with BoM data but did not
    outperform in situ observations or CHIRPS data. Furthermore, when compared to
    CHIRPS, MSWEP-V2.1 underestimated major hydro-climate extremes over West, East,
    and Southern Africa. It can therefore be concluded that CHIRPS-v2 and other rainfall
    satellite products provide visibly reliable predictions of high spatial resolution
    rainfall data across Eastern and Southern Africa, supplementing sparse rain gauge
    networks. However, in areas with below-average rainfall, the performance of these
    products remains very poor, necessitating the development of new methodologies
    to aid in the estimation of such areas. 4.2. Assessment of remotely sensed land
    surface temperature & evapotranspiration datasets Evapotranspiration (ET) sustains
    precipitation by replacing water vapour lost through condensation (Ramoelo et
    al., 2014). As a result, quantifying ET is required for climate change modelling,
    monitoring water balances, monitoring agriculture, and assessing environmental
    stresses (Kustas and Norman, 1996, Melesse et al., 2006, P. H. Gowda et al., 2007).
    Satellite-based products, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
    (AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Advanced Space borne
    Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat''s thermal infra-red
    (TIR) sensors have yielded a wealth of ET-related data (Anderson et al., 2012;
    Fensholt et al., 2009). Similarly, METEOSAT land surface analysis (LSA-SA and
    MOD16 ET EO products) are validated using African flux tower data (Ramoelo et
    al., 2014). Unfortunately, currently, ET cannot be measured directly from space.
    ET techniques are primarily based on empirical methods that use vegetation indices
    to project ET ground measurements to larger scales (Glenn et al., 2007), physical
    models that calculate ET using remotely sensed thermal infra-red (TIR) data (Allen
    et al., 2007) or models that calculate ET using a combination of ''Penman-Monteith
    type'' equations and satellite data (Mu et al., 2011). The MODIS-based algorithm
    (Mu et al., 2011) and multi-satellite approach (Vinukollu et al., 2011) for example,
    combine Penman-Monteith estimates with EO data to retrieve daily ET. Similarly,
    combining data from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites with on-the-ground
    observations from flux towers and meteorological stations holds great promise
    for WRM in Africa (Holmes et al., 2018) especially using, models such as the Surface
    Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998) and SEBS
    (Su, 2002). These models are commonly used to estimate ET using the energy balance
    approach (Gibson et al., 2013) and use LST as one of the input model parameters.
    SEBAL is not currently available to unaffiliated researchers, but SEBS is a free
    open-source model that has been validated in several studies (Gibson, 2013, Shoko
    et al., 2015). To estimate ET, advanced algorithms, primarily based on satellite
    LST, are used (Li et al., 2013). Fig. 6 depicts the major EO programs and satellite
    missions used to estimate ET and LST, the spatial and the temporal resolutions
    of the datasets used to derive these products. Most of the techniques have spatial
    resolutions ranging from 250 to 1000 m, allowing them to be used on a large scale,
    with homogeneous land use and land cover. This complements the limitations of
    direct ET measurements from lysimeters (Tyagi et al., 2000), flux towers (Sun
    et al., 2012) and soil measurements (Hillel, 1982; Mbow et al., 2013) all of which
    are point-based and thus inapplicable over large areas (Weerasinghe et al., 2020).
    ET stations, are scarce throughout Africa. Nonetheless, these algorithms have
    great potential (Jarmain et al., 2009, Li et al., 2009, Raoufi and Beighley, 2017),
    hence significant improvements since their inception near the end of the 1970s
    (Shoko et al., 2015). However, high spatial resolution may be required for better
    spatial representation of these estimates in highly heterogeneous landscapes and
    at localised scales. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download

    the use of remote-sensing-based models, hydrological and land surface models remain
    the most used to estimate large-scale ET. Of late, numerous ET products have been
    created by combining machine learning (ML) approaches with eddy-covariance flux
    tower data or model outputs as training sets. However, prior to Weerasinghe et
    al., (2020), few studies evaluated existing ET products that are solely focused
    on Africa, particularly using a water balance approach. As a result, the study
    evaluated the reliability of 9 remotely sensed-derived ET products over Africa.
    CMRSET, ETMonitor, GLEAM, LandFlux-EVAL, MOD16, FLUXNET-MTE, SSEBop, WaPOR, and
    WECANN were among the ET products evaluated. Their results were compared to a
    Water Balance-inferred ET (ETWB) value, checked against the Budyko curve (which
    serves as a reference condition for the water balance and energy balance), and
    assessed for spatial variability. Overall, each product had benefits and drawbacks,
    with CMRSET, SSEBop, and WaPOR consistently ranking highest when estimating long-term
    average ET across Africa. Furthermore, the ETWB had a low overall bias, indicating
    that it is a reliable reference condition for analyses (Weerasinghe et al., 2020).
    Dzikiti et al., (2019) compared two ET-based remote sensing models to actual measured
    ET data from three arid sites in South Africa. Their results indicated that the
    performance of the models varied over space and time. Although promising results
    were found, the study reported worst estimates (R2 < 0.50; Root Mean Square Error
    > 0.80 mm/day) during the prolonged dry spells in summer. The physically based
    Penman-Monteith approach, which has recently been evaluated using a variety of
    satellite products, particularly MOD16 data, has been widely used to provide accurate
    ET estimates. Similarly, because it requires fewer input variables, NASA''s Priestley-Taylor
    modified Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model has received a lot of attention.
    Dzikiti et al., (2019) evaluated the Penman-Monteith MOD16 ET and PT-JPL models
    by comparing them to actual ET estimates from eddy-covariance flux towers and
    a scintillometer-based surface energy balance system. The performance of the two
    models varied across the three sites. Both models initially underestimated daily
    ET, particularly during years with prolonged mid-summer dry spells in summer rainfall
    areas. However, when the parameters were changed, leaf area index (LAI), surface
    conductance, and radiation budget had the greatest impact on simulated ET. A soil
    water stress constraining function was added to the MOD16 ET model to improve
    it. Unfortunately, they discovered little progress when attempting to improve
    the PT-JPL model, concluding that improved parameterization is required to increase
    the accuracy of PT-JPL in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Some of these flaws are
    caused by model parameters such as LAI, normalized difference vegetation indices
    (NDVI), and fraction vegetation cover (FVC), all of which are estimates, resulting
    in error propagation. 4.3. Soil moisture estimation using remotely sensed data
    In 2010, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) designated soil moisture as
    an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) (Piles et al., 2019). Soil moisture/soil water
    is responsible for controlling the amount and rate of precipitation infiltrating
    into the soil, recharge into aquifers (Xu and Beekman, 2019) and enabling the
    identification of wet antecedent conditions that favour flooding (Sheffield et
    al., 2018). Topography, vegetation, and climate all contribute to the high spatiotemporal
    variability of soil moisture content (Crow et al., 2012). The thermogravimetric
    method, which measures the ratio of the mass of water in the soil to the mass
    of dry soil, is the industry standard for measuring soil moisture content (Walker
    et al., 2004). Unfortunately, the labour intensity and time consumption required
    to obtain these estimates have resulted in a scarcity of soil moisture data in
    Southern Africa, with the majority of data coming from private sectors or research
    institutions (Piles et al., 2019). Soil moisture parameters are frequently thought
    to be better estimated from space in this regard. Optical, thermal IR and microwave
    EO techniques have been investigated to estimate the spatio-temporal variations
    of soil moisture at the top 0–15 cm of earth’s surface (Gibson et al., 2009).
    Changes in surface soil moisture are associated with changes in surface emissivity
    and backscattering properties in microwave frequencies (Sheffield et al., 2018),
    giving microwave techniques an advantage. Microwave sensors can also be used in
    all weather conditions, day or night, as well as penetrate certain vegetation
    covers (Walker et al., 2004). Widely used soil moisture products include; National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP)
    satellite mission (Mousa and Shu 2020; Rahman et al., 2019), European Space Agency’s
    (ESA) Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor (Sheffield et al., 2018),
    ESA’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission (Ma et al., 2019),
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental
    Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Soil Moisture Operational Products
    System (SMOPS) (Liu et al., 2016); and ESA Soil Moisture Essential Climate Variable
    (SMECV) programme (Lou et al., 2018). The ability to use a blended technique is
    what makes NOAA''s NESDIS, SMOPS and ESA''s SMECV programs appealing. SMOPS combines
    data from the following sensors: Aqua AMSR-E, Coriolis WindSat, MetOp ASCAT, SMOS,
    and SMAP (Yin et al., 2020), whereas SMECV combines data from the following sensors:
    DMSP SSM/I, TRMM-TMI, Aqua AMSR-E, and SMOS (Yin et al., 2020) sensors. On the
    other handwhereas SMECV combines data from the DMSP SSM/I, TRMM-TMI, Aqua AMSR-E
    and SMOS (Lou et al., 2018) sensors. This enables the products to achieve high
    spatiotemporal accuracy in long-term soil moisture content records. Likewise,
    ESA’s Tiger project SHARE, introduced a semi-operational soil moisture monitoring
    service based on ENVISAT’s Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Global Mode
    sensor (Bartsch et al., 2012). The data allows for operational soil moisture monitoring
    for drought and flood forecasting, particularly in Africa. Unfortunately, little
    research has been conducted in Africa using this dataset. Wagner et al., (2007)
    experimented with ENVISAT''s ASAR data to retrieve soil moisture estimates, concluding
    that more research is needed to develop quantitative methods for errors caused
    by vegetation cover. Fig. 5, Fig. 7 summarizes the currently available EO programs
    and satellite missions for estimating soil moisture, as well as their spatial
    and temporal resolutions. Despite the fact that soil moisture measurements from
    space are still in their infancy, a number of satellite retrieval missions have
    been able to combine long-term data records to provide consistent soil moisture
    estimates. Bunting et al., (2018) for example, used AVHRR- and MODIS-derived vegetation
    indices to show how temperature increases altered available soil moisture, resulting
    in changes in landscape patterns across southern Africa. The study demonstrated
    the feasibility of estimating soil moisture without the use of dedicated soil
    moisture satellite missions. Download : Download high-res image (178KB) Download

    GCO = GCOM-W AMSR2 (2012 to date); ASC = MetOp ASCAT (2006 to date); SEN = Sentinel-1
    (2014 to date). Fortunately, soil moisture dedicated missions do exist and have
    been globally assessed. For example, Piles et al., (2019) investigated the temporal
    variability of surface soil moisture using SMOS from 2010 to 2016, comparing its
    accuracy to the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-Noah model, European
    Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 soil moisture model, and
    REMEDHUS ground-based soil moisture monitoring networks. Overall, SMOS results
    agreed with GLDAS and ERA5 estimates of soil moisture time series. However, long-term
    soil moisture data records based solely on observational datasets are still clearly
    needed. Recent studies frequently highlight the incorporation of remote sensing
    data into hydrological modeling as a method of improving soil moisture spatiotemporal
    estimates (Sinclair and Pegram, 2010, Sheffield et al., 2018). Regrettably, this
    method has yet to be tested in Africa. Furthermore, there is a limitation associated
    with the depth of moisture that remote sensors can detect. In this regard, studies
    should consider the use of field-based soil moisture measurements, which can go
    deeper than microwave sensors. To provide more accurate soil moisture estimates,
    products such as ESA''s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) use data from 9 EO microwave
    sensors, including the Scanning Multi-frequency Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), European
    Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1/2), TMI, Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I),
    Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT)
    Data Products, WindSat, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and SMOS
    mission. Because of its low frequency and higher spatial resolution, the AMSR-E
    instrument has the potential to outperform previous spaceborne radiometers, such
    as the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager
    in terms of soil moisture sensing (approximately 60 km at 6.9 GHz). Cammalleri
    et al., (2017) assessed the suitability of the Lisflood distributed hydrological
    rainfall-runoff model (LIS), MODIS-LST, and CCI products for identifying reliable
    monitoring of soil moisture extreme conditions in specific regions around the
    world, including southern Africa. Stoffelen''s (1998) assessed the CCI''s LIS
    and MODIS-LST accuracy. The TCH analysis demonstrated the superior performance
    of remote sensing data, particularly the CCI, over dry regions such as Australia
    and Africa. Although the finding were associated with some inconsistencies and
    a lack of coverage from one or more datasets, the three products were shown to
    be comparable over most of the globe. Despite these intriguing findings, it is
    important to note that satellite-based soil moisture estimates typically reflect
    soil moisture conditions in the top layer, which may limit their usability/application.
    4.4. Measuring surface water height & extent from remotely sensed datasets The
    primary goal of quantitative surface water measurements is to characterize the
    height and extent of lakes, dams, and wetlands using various gauges. Catchment
    and river authorities managers and different water-related e.g., South Africa’s
    Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) collects and documents daily and weekly
    river flows across different catchments and river basins, as well as monthly volume
    capacities for reservoirs, rivers, lakes, canals, and pipelines (Makapela et al.,
    2015). However, this information is still inadequate for efficient WRM as many
    surface water bodies are unaccounted for. Various strategies have been developed
    using EO-based data sets to estimate surface water quantity from space (Table
    1). Table 1. A sample of EO products and their applications water resources and
    drought assessment and monitoring in Africa. Method Reference of study Applications
    and Key findings Limitations of Index Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) Tirivarombo
    & Hughes, 2011 SPI was calculated for the Zambezi River Basin using long-term
    rainfall data between 1960 and 2002, and the results were compared to those for
    agricultural drought and food security. The SPI must be used in conjunction with
    other indices because it does not account for deficits caused by evapotranspiration,
    infiltration, and runoff. Chisadza et al., 2015 To determine the severity of the
    current drought, SPI was calculated for the uMzingwane catchment in the Limpopo
    River Basin using rainfall data from 1999 to 2013. longer study periods produced
    results that were incredibly accurate. Khezazna et al., 2017 Distinguished between
    dry, normal, and wet periods and analyze variations in annual rainfall over the
    basin, SPI indices were calculated for 13 rainfall stations in Algeria''s Seybouse
    basin The model needs historical rainfall data, which is not always easy to come
    by in the majority of African nations. Tirivarombo et al., 2018 In the Kafue Basin
    in northern Zambia, SPI was able to identify temporal variations in droughts.
    SPI should be used with caution when describing droughts because it only uses
    rainfall data, not temperature data, which is crucial for describing droughts.
    Lawal et al., 2019 SPI was used to gauge the extent of the drought in Southern
    Africa. Low accuracy was attained in areas with little precipitation and brief
    time periods. Kalisa et al., 2020 From 1920 to 2015, SPI over East Africa was
    calculated. The study demonstrated that, particularly in drought-prone areas,
    accurately estimated dryness or wetness can be used to assess the severity of
    a drought. For shorter time scales, the results were highly variable; however,
    for longer time scales, the results were more reliable. Palmer Drought Severity
    Index (PDSI) Mehta et al., 2014 To evaluate the predictability accuracy over Southern
    Africa, PDSI was correlated with the PDSI forecast by the MIROC5 Earth System
    Model (ESM) from 1961 to 2019–2020. This method produced effective results. Longer
    study periods revealed higher accuracies. Zeleke et al., 2017 PDSI obtained precise
    data that identified drought periods from station- and satellite-based observation
    data sets from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency (EMA) for drought
    monitoring in Ethiopia from 1979 to 2014. Based solely on temperature and precipitation
    data, the model only considered the effects of the drought. Asfaw et al., 2018
    Analysis of the extent of meteorological drought from 1951 to 2013 used PDSI data
    from Climate Explorer: KNMI Climate Change Atlas. The Woleka sub-basin in Ethiopia
    showed an increase in drought years since the 2000s, according to the findings.
    The satellite-based model''s short-term use presents challenges because it is
    less accurate than long-term use. Orimoloye et al.,2019 PDSI was used to determine
    Cape Town''s vulnerability to drought. The model''s accuracy performance in areas
    with exceptionally dry vegetation. Ogunrinde et al., 2020 PDSI detected a hydrological
    drought in Nigeria''s River Niger about a year before low flow was experienced.
    The model is more effective in long-term monitoring of meteorological drought
    impacts. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Gelassie, 2012 In Amhara,
    Ethiopia, the growth of biomass was monitored using the NDVI, which demonstrated
    that the model could accurately forecast crop yield. Cloud cover and shadows caused
    noise, which reduced NDVI values. Tonini et al., 2012 In the Tigray region of
    Ethiopia, the NDVI data collected using SPOT 4 and SPOT 5 satellites from 1998
    to 2009 accurately identified which areas are more vulnerable to drought. The
    atmosphere, aerosol scattering, snow, and cloud cover have an impact on accuracy.
    Chisadza et al., 2015 Using the GEONETCast ten-day composite, SPOT VEGETATION,
    NDVI (S10 NDVI) over the Zimbabwean districts of Beitbridge, Esigodini, Mangwe,
    and Mwenezi from 1998 to 2013, researchers evaluated vegetation condition and
    tracked drought severity and occurrence. Background brightness led to lower accuracies.
    Klisch & Atzberger, 2020 Utilizing MODIS data, NDVI was calculated in Mandera
    and Garissa, Kenya, and successfully monitored vegetation. High noise interference
    due to cloud cover compromised the model outcome. Lawal et al., 2019 NDVI was
    used to determine the drought impacts on vegetation in southern African and achieved
    efficient results. Errors in seasonal NDVI data due to different algorithms used
    to translate measured wavelengths. Qu et al., 2019 From 2000 to 2017, drought
    conditions in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia) were
    examined using NDVI data derived from MODIS. Due to its sensitivity to vegetation
    greenness, it is unable to directly monitor droughts. Vegetation Condition Index
    (VCI) Unganai & Kogan, 1998 The temporal and spatial characteristics of the drought
    conditions in Southern Africa were successfully tracked by AVHRR/NOAA data derived
    Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Cloud cover affected drought signal. Gelassie,
    2012 VCI was used to examine spatial drought, and it was discovered that from
    1999 to 2009, drought in the Amhara region of Ethiopia could be detected and mapped.
    Drought conditions can be monitored during the growing season. Ghoneim et al.,
    2017 Analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of drought occurrence in Tunisia
    from 2000 to 2013 using MODIS data to calculate VCI and precisely identify drought
    periods. Problematic when there is excessive rainfall. Qu et al., 2019 A 95% accuracy
    rate was reached when NDVI was calculated using MODIS data from 2000 to 2017 for
    the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia). Cloud contamination
    affected accuracy. Frischen et al., 2020 Zimbabwe''s vegetation health and drought
    conditions were evaluated using VCI from 1989 to 2019; it was discovered that
    it can identify the dynamics of drought. Not suited for analysing one single season.
    Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI) Gelassie 2012 The spatial distribution
    of drought was examined using WRSI in Amhara, Ethiopia. A water balance calculation,
    a detailed crop calendar, and field verification of crops are all essential for
    model performance. Moeletsi & Walker, 2011 Water Requirement Satisfaction Index
    (WRSI) was used to quantify how droughts in the Free State Province, South Africa,
    affected rain-fed maize production. WRSI values in semi-arid areas are locality
    dependent. Jayanthi et al., 2014 WRSI was used to monitor crop productivity in
    Southern Africa Limited hazard and exposure data, therefore long-term synthetic
    rainfall record had to be generated. Legesse & Suryabhagavan, 2014 WRSI was found
    to be a good indicator of agricultural drought when it was used to evaluate the
    spatiotemporal variation in agricultural drought patterns in East Shewa Zone,
    Ethiopia Showed good results for agricultural drought, but further investigation
    is required for other types of droughts.  Surface water body index Reference of
    study Key findings Limitations of index Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)
    El-Asmar et al., 2013 used NDWI data fromTandsat multi-spectral scanner (MSS),
    thematic mapper (TM), enhanced thematic mapper (ETM + ), and SPOT images to accurately
    detected size changes between 1973 and 2011 in the Burullus Lagoon in Egypt. Had
    to apply radiometric normalization to adjust solar angles. Masocha et al., 2018
    Had a 77% overall accuracy when surface water bodies were extracted from Landsat-8
    OLI data in Zimbabwe''s Mutiriki catchment. Cannot suppress the signal from built-up
    features efficiently. Orimoloye et al., 2019 used Landsat 8 data to derive NDWI
    to map changes in water bodies and assess the occurrence of drought in Cape Town,
    South Africa from 2014 to 2018. The outcomes were consistent with the dam levels
    noted by the City of Cape Town. Does not consider soil type, geographic location
    and climate zone. Asfaw et al., 2018 Using Landsat ETM+/ operational land imager
    (OLI) data, NDWI used to track changes in Lake Ziway, Ethiopia from 2009 to 2018
    and achieved an overall accuracy of 91%. Problematic in urban areas with higher
    reflectance. Fujihara et al., 2020 The Gash River in Sudan was classified by NDWI
    using Landsat-8 data, and the resulting Kappa coefficient was a respectable 0.960.
    Problematic in built-up areas, water features often confused with built up. Modified
    Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) El-Asmar et al., 2013 MNDWI data from
    MSS, TM, ETM+, and SPOT images were used to precisely measure size changes in
    the Burullus Lagoon in Egypt between 1973 and 2011. Radiometric normalization
    applied to adjust solar angles. Malahlela, 2016 From 2013 to 2015, MNDWI was calculated
    using Landsat-8 data to extract waterbodies in South Africa, the Republic of the
    Congo, and Madagascar, with an overall accuracy of 78.4%. Classified shadows as
    waterbodies. Masocha et al., 2018 Surface water bodies in the Mutirikwi catchment
    in Zimbabwe were mapped using Landsat-8 OLI data, which had an overall accuracy
    of 84.3%. Higher performance in areas with vegetation when compared to other land
    covered surfaces. Asfaw et al., 2018 Using Landsat ETM+/OLI data and MNDWI, changes
    in Lake Ziway, Ethiopia, between 2009 and 2018 were noted, with 99% overall accuracy.
    Misclassified shadows as waterbodies. Ndehedehe et al., 2020 Used Sentinel-2 derived
    MNDWI to detect changes in the Lake Chad Basin from 2015 to 2019 and achieved
    an overall accuracy of 97.4%. Sensitive to water content in soil and vegetation.
    Slagter et al., 2020 Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data from 2016 to 2018, MNDWI
    was used for wetland mapping and surface water dynamics in the St Lucia wetlands,
    South Africa, and achieved an overall accuracy of 87.1%. Highly vegetated areas
    led to lower accuracies. Land Surface Water Index (LSWI + 5) Jin et al., 2013
    From 1999 to 2009, vegetation phenology was tracked using MODIS data, and results
    were consistent with in-situ data in Southern Africa. Problematic in built-up
    areas. Benefoh et al., 2018 TM, ETM, and OLI data were used to obtain a thorough
    understanding of Ghana''s landscape from 1986 to 2015. Results had an overall
    accuracy of 82.6% and were correlated with in-situ data. Lower accuracies in dry
    regions. Masocha et al., 2018 LSWI + 5 surpassed the other indices when used to
    map surface water bodies in sub-tropical catchments, having an overall accuracy
    of 86% in the Mutirikwi Catchment, Zimbabwe. Further investigation required for
    performance in various climatic zones. Ali et al., 2020 From 2006 to 2016, data
    from Landsat-7 were used to analyze the water content of plants and soil in different
    watersheds in Ethiopia using LSWI + 5. Cloud contamination affected results. Modified
    Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI + 5) Masocha et al., 2018 MDWI + 5 used
    to map the surface water bodies in Zimbabwe''s Mutirikwi Catchment and had a 79.3%
    overall accuracy. Performed best in vegetated areas. Automated Water Extraction
    Index (shadow) (AWEIsh) and Automated Water Extraction Index (non-shadow) (AWEInsh)
    Feyisa et al., 2014 Waterbodies were mapped using Landsat-5 data in South Africa,
    Ethiopia, Denmark, Switzerland, and New Zealand, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.98
    for South Africa and 0.97 for Ethiopia. Variations in the sun''s angle, atmospheric
    composition, and biophysical and chemical changes in waterbodies are among the
    variables that were not tested and could have an impact on accuracy. Malahlela,
    2016 Between 2013 and 2015, waterbodies in South Africa, the Republic of the Congo,
    and Madagascar were extracted using Landsat-8 data, with an overall accuracy of
    83.8%. Classified shadows as water in built-up areas. Masocha et al., 2018 When
    mapping surface water bodies in the Mutirikwi Catchment, Zimbabwe, AWEIsh and
    AWEInsh had overall accuracy rates of 81.6% and 50.3%, respectively. AWEInsh problematic
    due to background noise and unable to differentiate between water bodies and built-up
    areas. Asfaw et al.,2018 Used Landsat ETM+/OLI data to detect changes in Lake
    Ziway, Ethiopia from 2009 to 2018 using and obtained an overall accuracy of 99.2%.
    Problematic in urban areas due to high reflectance. Danladi et al., 2020 Used
    Landsat imagery to delineate coastal erosion and accumulation in Nigeria from
    1973 to 2017. Problematic in built-up areas. Herndon et al., 2020 Achieved an
    overall accuracy of 98% using Landsat-8 data to identify waterbodies in th Nigerian
    Sahel. Background noise led to misclassification. Satellites have been extensively
    used for monitoring inland surface water bodies, either through active (radar)
    or passive (optical) sensors (Sheffield et al., 2018). Radar relies on the low
    backscattering of water surfaces relative to surrounding land surfaces, while
    optical sensors rely on external light sources. Furthermore, semi-automatic classification
    methods aid in identifying surface water extent. These methods are commonly grouped
    into; (i) single-band threshold methods (Feyisa et al., 2014), (ii) machine-learning
    classification methods (Jiang et al., 2014), and (iii) multiband/water index methods
    (Rokni et al., 2014). Multiband methods have gained high popularity, due to their
    ability to combine multiple spectral bands and use mathematical models to enhance
    water features, while simultaneously restricting or eliminating surrounding features.
    For example, the normalised difference water index (NDWI), makes use of the green
    and near Infrared (NIR) bands based on the strong absorption and low radiation
    of surface water bodies in these spectral ranges (McFeeters, 2013). The Landsat
    series is arguably the most notable dataset, as it is one of the longest running
    EO projects. Likewise, MODIS also provides long-term short revisit time data for
    mapping global surface water extent. Sentinel-1 (Seaton and Dube, 2021) and Sentinel-2
    (Seaton et al., 2020) datasets however, are making great strides, due to their
    higher resolution and shorter revisit times. Conversely, radar altimetry is used
    to calculate surface water height, by emitting radar waves and analyzing the return
    signals (Crétaux et al., 2011) with topographic data. Popular satellite missions
    include; the Jason-series (Lambin et al., 2010) and Sentinel-3 (Kittel et al.,
    2021). However, the Global Reservoir and Lake Elevation Database, which uses near
    real-time radar altimetry and inundation information from SSM/I, ERS, and AVHRR
    sensors, is also promising. Key EO products and satellite missions for monitoring
    surface water height and extent are summarised in Fig. 8, with their relevant
    sources as well as significant studies that utilised these datasets both in Africa
    and globally. Cooley et al., (2021) used NASA’s Cloud and land Elevation Satellite
    (ICESat-2) satellite laser altimeter to quantify global water level variabilities
    for 227 386 surface water bodies. The study showed the influence of human activity
    on the seasonal dynamics of those water bodies. This influence is likely to increase
    due to economic development, population growth and climate change, therefore,
    baseline studies, such as these are useful to track human modifications on the
    global hydrological cycle. Likewise, Khandelwal et al., (2017) applied a modified
    supervised classification approach to MODIS multispectral data to map the global
    spatio-temporal variations of 94 reservoirs between 2000 and 2015. The performance
    of MODIS data was compared to known altimetry measurements, matching very well
    with the in-situ height variations. However, this only appears to be valid on
    surface water bodies that showed significant surface area variations, and ineffective
    for smaller or unchanged water bodies. In a different study, Haas et al., (2009)
    used the SPOT VEGETATION (SPOT-VGT) instrument to assess the accuracy of mapping
    temporary small water bodies in sub-Saharan western Africa''s arid, semi-arid,
    and sub-humid regions. The study demonstrated the potential of mapping temporary
    small water bodies in Africa''s arid and semi-arid regions. Fortunately, the introduction
    and advances of high spatial resolution satellite datasets, such as Landsat 8,
    9, Sentinel 2 and WorldView, with improved sensing characteristics allows for
    the detection and monitoring of small waterbodies that are frequently masked out
    by coarse resolution remotely sensed products. Furthermore, the new generation
    of sensors enables the detection of inherent seasonal temporal variations in water
    resources. Download : Download high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size

    allow for a better understanding of smaller bodies of water. For instance, Herndon
    et al., (2020) used WorldView data to precisely map the spatio-temporal dynamics
    of rainfed ephemeral ponds and lakes across the Nigerien Sahel. However, using
    commercial high spatial resolution datasets is difficult, particularly in resource-constrained
    African regions. Such datasets are mostly used for extensive and thorough projects
    or by the private sector, which have the acquisition capacity. Some studies have
    also demonstrated the validity of EO data for surface water dynamics and their
    role in WRM in Africa. Becker et al., (2018) used the Global Inundation Extent
    Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) technique to examine seasonal patterns of surface water
    dynamics in the Congo River Basin (CRB). The technique combines microwave, visible,
    and NIR data to provide global surface water extent and storage, which has been
    validated against in-situ measurements. Overall, it appeared that both datasets
    improved fundamental understanding of the CRB and WRM. Similarly, Zimba et al.,
    (2018) used MODIS data to analyze inundation trends in Zambia''s Barotse Floodplain,
    with Landsat and ground-truthing for validation, as well as Pearson-r to assess
    inundation correlations between discharge and water level. Strong correlations
    were found between inundation extent and water level (r = 0.86), as well as inundation
    extent and discharge (r = 0.89), demonstrating how remote sensing-based approaches
    reduced the use of costly and time-consuming field-based surface water monitoring.
    Jason and TOPEX-POSEIDON, on the other hand, have primarily been used in oceanography.
    Although significant progress has been made in monitoring surface water extent
    in Africa using satellite-based technologies, more work remains to be done to
    operationalize these techniques and contribute to the generation of meaningful
    information that can be used to inform water management strategies and key decision
    making. In addition, the role of drones and drone technologies must be considered
    in validating satellite-based estimates. 4.5. Satellite-based surface runoff &
    streamflow estimations Streamflow/river discharge measurements are primarily done
    through river-gauging stations. River discharge is typically calculated at one
    point along a river, using a mechanical current-meter/Acoustic Doppler Current
    Profiler to measure the velocity and develop a rating curve (Makapela et al.,
    2015). Runoff models also provide valuable information on surface flows. For example,
    the Pitman Model which is rainfall-runoff model estimates monthly discharge using
    rainfall and Potential ET data (Hughes, 2007, Hughes et al., 2014). Likewise,
    WetSpass (Batelaan and De Smedt, 2001) simulates potential runoff based on vegetation,
    soil texture, slope and groundwater saturated areas. Unfortunately, these models
    rely heavily on in-situ measurements and discharge monitoring infrastructure in
    Africa, which is still sparse and underdeveloped (Sivapalan et al., 2003; Kapangaziwiri
    et al., 2009). Nevertheless, by incorporating cutting-edge EO data, these models
    may become more accurate and fill in the gaps of unmeasured areas (Bjerklie et
    al., 2005). River discharge estimates cannot currently be directly measured using
    remotely sensed data. However, because remote sensing can provide other estimates,
    such as rainfall, soil moisture, and Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU), rainfall-runoff
    models will no longer need to rely heavily on in-situ measurements (Hrachowitz
    et al., 2013). Similarly, by combining in-situ data, satellite imagery, and Digital
    Elevation Models (DEMs), the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) (Jacobs
    et al., 2003) and STREAM-TED (King et al., 2005) models have shown promise in
    predicting runoff estimates. Although the SCS-CN method has become the standard
    practical toolset for estimating an event-based rainfall-runoff response, it is
    however, limited to specific geographic regions and land use types due to its
    empirical origins. Furthermore, it does not account for the spatial variability
    of runoff. As a result, its applications in African settings have been limited
    in favour of new spatially explicit approaches, such as the STREAM-TED’s runoff-erosion
    model (King et al., 2005). Considerable studies have therefore utilised the use
    of these spatially explicit approach for run-off modelling. For example, Liebe
    et al., (2009) developed a rainfall-runoff model, based on Thornthwaite-Mather’s
    water balance model, to estimate reservoir volumes in West Africa. The model combined
    ENVISAT ASAR data with SRTM data and, where possible, reservoir gauge data. Overall,
    the study reported that the model accurately reproduced ''observed runoff generation''
    and could be used as a ''runoff gauge'' to better understand the landscape''s
    hydrology. Similarly, Bjerklie et al., (2005) estimated in-bank river discharge
    using aerial photography, orthophotos, topographical maps, DEMs and ERS-1 SAR
    data, to extract river channel width and slope along the Missouri River in California.
    Surface velocity was calculated using a JPL technique, and corrected for the Bragg-resonant
    effect (the bias effect on velocity estimates of wind-driven waves). After calibration,
    the mean accuracy of discharge estimates was within 10 % of observed discharge.
    Their study illustrated relatively accurate estimates of in-bank river discharge
    could be measured from EO data. Unfortunately, this approach has not yet been
    tested along southern African rivers, but as more EO data becomes available (Fig.
    5, Fig. 8), future studies will be able to use these methodologies. In Africa,
    various methods for estimating run-off have been tested and the results are detailed
    in the study by Mushore et al., (2019), who reviewed literature on the progress
    and challenges of rainfall-runoff modelling and the contributions of remote sensing
    in Africa. The review highlighted the works by Andersen et al., (2002), who used
    precipitation estimates from METEOSAT and LAI from NOAAs AVHRR to improve hydrograph
    simulations. To derive runoff characteristics, Hong et al., 2007, Mahmoud, 2014
    used the curve-number approach with TRMM and Landsat-coupled-DEM data as inputs.
    Nonetheless, the limited research on the use of remote sensing data to quantify
    runoff has frequently used coarse datasets that fail to capture the spatial variations
    that play critical roles in determining surface runoff (Table 2). More emphasis
    should be placed on using medium to fine-resolution sensors to estimate surface
    runoff. Table 2. Applications, strengths and weakness of satellite data in hydrological

    Statistical analysis Brakel (1984)Faye et al., (2020) 4.6. Satellite estimations
    of water quality African scientists have extensively monitored water quality in
    lakes and dams using remotely sensed data. Highlights from some recent studies
    that successfully used remotely sensed methods for water quality monitoring are
    summarised here. Abdelmalik (2018) used EO data for monitoring water quality into
    three types based on spatial resolution: high resolution data, moderate resolution
    data, and regional/global resolution data. Dube et al., (2015) examined the use
    of remote sensing applications for monitoring water quality in Sub-Saharan African
    lakes. Shekede et al., (2008) and Dube et al., (2014a) for example, used Landsat-derived
    vegetation indices to map the invasive growth of hyacinth and aquatic weeds in
    Lake Chivero and Lake, respectively. Both studies showed high levels of accuracy,
    as well as an increase in hyacinth and aquatic weeds in these lakes. Dlamini et
    al., (2016) used MODIS to measure chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations as a proxy
    for predicting pollution levels in Zimbabwe''s Lake Chivero. A time series from
    1985 to 2010 revealed that the major contributors to Lake Chivero''s pollution
    levels were decreases in surrounding forestry and increases in urbanisation (Dlamini
    et al., 2016). Gholizadeh et al., (2016) examined the progress of remote sensing
    in measuring water quality parameters such as Chl-a, coloured dissolved organic
    matters (cDOM), Secchi Disk Depth (SDD), turbidity, total suspended sediments
    (TSS), water temperature (WT), total phosphorus (TP), sea surface salinity (SSS),
    dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand
    (COD). The review stated that airborne sensors are better suited for retrieving
    water quality parameters on smaller waterbodies, whereas satellite sensors are
    better suited for larger waterbodies, while also emphasizing the power of hyperspectral
    imagery, which can record up to 200 spectral channels for detecting numerous water
    quality parameters. Abdelmalik, (2018) used ASTER data to map the spatial distribution
    of temperature, turbidity, pH, salinity, TDS, EC, total alkalinity, Total Organic
    Carbon (TOC), and ortho-phosphorus in Egypt''s Qaroun Lake. The results revealed
    a significant correlation between the two datasets for all water quality parameters.
    This study demonstrated a quick, low-cost, and convenient method for obtaining
    the spatial distribution of significant water quality parameters using EO data.
    Various EO techniques for monitoring water quality by estimating optically active
    water parameters have been developed. These are (i) physiochemical parameters
    (such as electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, salinity, and Total Dissolved
    Solids), (ii) organic parameters (such as BOD and TOC), and (iii) microbiological
    parameters (such as Chlorophyll) and phytoplankton (Abdelmalik, 2018). Recently
    launched satellites, such as Sentinel-3, also hold great promise (Soomets et al.,
    2020). Similarly, Sagan et al., (2020) reviewed recent advances in remote sensing
    for monitoring water quality, identifying current system and estimation method
    limitations and suggesting future improvements. Over 200 water quality samples
    were collected from 43 different locations in the United States to test for blue-green
    algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC), Chl-a, DO, specific conductivity (SC), fluorescent
    dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and pollution-sediments. The in-situ
    data were compared to proximal spectral data, ground-based hyperspectral imagery,
    and data from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Because of atmospheric
    interference and short revisit times, proximal spectra data and ground-based hyperspectral
    imagery had higher accuracy than satellite data. As a result, multi-sensor data
    fusion and cloud computing may be a promising strategy for forecasting future
    water pollution outbreaks (Table 2). It is important to note that the majority
    of water quality research in Africa have focused on mapping phytoplankton, which
    is regarded as the greatest threat to the quality of inland water bodies (Matthews
    et al., 2010). Matthews et al., (2012) used ENVISAT''s MERIS data to detect trophic
    status (Chl-a), cyanobacterial blooms, surface scum, and floating vegetation across
    two inland water bodies in the Western Cape and Gauteng Provinces. The study demonstrated
    that Chl-a estimates from Top-of-Atmosphere MERIS data provided significant accuracy
    by utilizing fluorescence and backscatter/absorption related features in the red
    and NIR wavelengths of MERIS. However, combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel data improved
    the results. Fig. 9 shows a summary of widely used EO programs and satellite missions,
    for measuring water quality parameters, their sources, as well as temporal and

    Land cover/land use classification from satellite data Changes in the hydrological
    cycle are driven by global effects of land cover and vegetation. Land cover changes
    affect precipitation and temperature patterns, whereas vegetation cover changes
    affect ET and surface energy patterns (Chase et al., 2000). Remote sensing has
    emerged as the single most effective technique for better understanding the dynamics
    of land cover (Thompson, 1996). For accurate monitoring of land cover change,
    remote sensing techniques can repeatedly group various land features into clusters
    based on their spectral similarities (Fig. 10). Similarly, vegetation dynamics
    can be retrieved using microwave sensors based on their spectral properties (Liu
    et al., 2011). In 1996, the first South African National Land Cover map (NLC 94)
    was published using Landsat data. The map contained 31 classes that were captured
    as a digital vector dataset (Fairbanks et al., 2000). Similarly, in 2009, South
    African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) released an NLC map that made
    use of a mosaic of products as well as thematic products created by the Agricultural
    Research Council (ARC), DWS, and ESKOM (Schoeman et al., 2013). Download : Download

    such as AVHRR''s Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) project
    GIMMS and MODIS''s enhanced vegetation index provide long-term time series of
    NDVI, LAI, and fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) (EVI). These
    products have been evaluated based on their accuracy for global long-term monitoring
    of vegetation cover change (Huete et al., 2002) and data enhancement (Pinzon and
    Tucker, 2014). However, advanced satellites such as Sentinel-2 have also provided
    unprecedented information for deriving vegetation characteristics, being the first
    sensor to include bands in the red edge spectrum, making it suitable for estimating
    canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Clevers and Gitelson, 2013). Similarly,
    NASA''s ECOSTRESS provides groundbreaking data on forest canopy height, vertical
    structure, and surface elevation, with research applications on carbon balance
    and forest structure. However, this data is still limited and more information
    is required. Fig. 10 summarizes major EO and satellite missions for LCLU and vegetation
    monitoring, as well as the key studies that used these data for WRM. Chang et
    al., (2018), state that remotely sensed land use change detection techniques are
    shifting from ''planning and management'' to ''land use change impacts and driving
    factors''. This is extremely beneficial in terms of WRM because it will aid in
    more efficient management strategies and the protection of water resources. Nonetheless,
    attention should be paid to the accuracy of land use classification provided by
    EO technology. Fortunately, databases such as Globeland30 make significant contributions
    to the study of international LULC changes (Chang et al., 2018). Landsat and MODIS
    have also contributed a wealth of global long-term LULC changes. Matlhodi et al.,
    (2019) used Landsat data to assess LULC changes in Botswana between 1984 and 2015.
    The study demonstrated dramatic increases in built-up areas and bare land, as
    well as significant decreases in shrub land and tree savannah. Similarly, Al-Hamdan
    et al., (2017) used Landsat and MODIS-derived LULC products to monitor LULC changes
    and their potential environmental drivers (precipitation, temperature) across
    Africa, as well as a two-level verification process to ensure data accuracy. CHIRPS
    and MODIS were used to assess whether precipitation and temperature changes were
    significant drivers of LULC changes, respectively. All areas are experiencing
    significant deforestation and wetland loss, as well as crop and grass expansion.
    Ultimately, Al-Hamdan et al., (2017) discovered that non-environmental factors
    (such as socioeconomics and government policies) were the primary drivers of LULC
    changes. Finally, Kamwi et al., (2017) discovered no previous evidence on whether
    protected resources in southern Africa are affected by LULC changes and attempted
    to fill this gap using Landsat imagery across the Zambezi region between 1984
    and 2010. Their research revealed clear patterns of LULC change by land tenure
    regime, which has a direct impact on natural land cover resources and suggests
    that more tactical LULC monitoring strategies should be implemented. LULC change
    have been extensively studied across Africa, using single date and multi-date
    high to coarse resolution applications. However, the majority of these studies
    concentrated on the catchment to sub-catchment scale, with a few exceptions on
    the regional and national levels. Furthermore, while there are numerous satellites
    available for land cover mapping, the majority of these have spatial resolutions
    ranging from 1 to 50 m (Fig. 10). However, some of these are not readily available
    or/accessible and are heavily influenced by cloud cover, particularly in the tropics,
    where clouds are often persistent, causing spectral mixing in heterogeneous environment
    (Table 2). 4.8. Groundwater estimation WRM requires an understanding of the patterns
    and magnitude of ground and -surface water interactions (Meijerink, 2007, Webb,
    November 2008). This is because groundwater resources are frequently unsustainable
    due to low recharge rates and declining water tables caused by high abstraction
    levels (Gibson, et al., 2009, Rodell et al., 2018). Groundwater exploration is
    primarily accomplished through the measurement of groundwater levels (piezometers,
    dip meters, and wells), the assessment of groundwater quality (isotopes, carbon-14,
    and chloride mass balance), geochemical sampling, or seepage measurements (Liu
    et al., 2016). Temperature measurements are also a reliable indicator of groundwater-surface
    water interaction because groundwater temperatures are relatively constant while
    surface water temperatures vary (Meijerink et al., 2007). However, the lack of
    comprehensive groundwater data across other parts of the continent has hampered
    its impact and effectiveness. Indirect methods can infer changes in water storage
    by measuring changes in the earth''s gravity field with satellite gravimetry or
    surface elevation with radar interferometry. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment
    (GRACE) satellites from NASA measure changes in the gravity field as well as changes
    in terrestrial water storage (Fig. 5). Changes in the two satellites'' distance
    and speed are caused by changes in the gravity field caused by terrestrial and
    other water storage variations (Tapley et al., 2004). These variations can be
    used to explain changes in groundwater depletion. The use of GRACE in understanding
    groundwater has been successful although fine scale applications remain a challenge.
    In this regard, the review concluded that GRACE has been widely used to assess
    groundwater depletion for large aquifers in various regions. For example, GRACE
    has been used in several studies to better understand water storage in Africa
    (Hassan and Jin 2016; Ramjeawon et al., 2022; Scanlon et al., 2022). These studies
    evaluated GRACE for variations in water storage in the Zambezi, Okavango, and
    Volta basins. Their findings show a significant decrease in water storage, particularly
    during drought periods, implying a good agreement between GRACE-derived estimates
    and rainfall variability. GRACE was also used by Scanlon et al., (2022) to assess
    the spatial–temporal variations in water storage for major African aquifers. The
    findings revealed a high level of agreement between GRACE water storage estimates
    and human activities (irrigation) climate variability (El Nino). Other EO techniques
    involve mapping geological features that influence groundwater recharge and discharge
    (Meijerink et al., 2007). Mapping geological lineaments, for example, may indicate
    shallow groundwater discharge zones, whereas drainage density may indicate a possible
    groundwater recharge zone (Makapela et al., 2015). Previous research has leveraged
    satellite imagery to gain insights into groundwater exploration. One notable study
    conducted by Műnch et al., (2013) demonstrated the application of Earth Observation
    (EO) techniques in quantifying recharge through the utilization of water balance
    relationships. The study quantified groundwater recharge and discharge zones using
    estimates from Precipitation (P) and ET satellite products. Műnch et al., (2013)
    compared three ET models which are ETMODIS, MOD16, and Pitman rainfall-runoff
    data, to calculate spatial regional recharge. The application of P-ET clearly
    identified potential recharge and discharge zones, adding value to the conceptualization
    of hydrogeology along South Africa''s West Coast. Similarly, Lekula and Lubczynski,
    (2019) used remotely sensed data to build integrated hydrological models (IHMs)
    to better understand the hydrology of the Central Kalahari Basin. The model characterized
    spatio-temporal water flux dynamics, provided annual water balances, and evaluated
    groundwater-resource dynamics and replenishment using MODFLOW-NWT and remotely
    sensed P, PET, DEM, LULC, and soil data. Rainfall, surface morphology, unsaturated
    zone thickness, and vegetation characteristics were also discovered to be primary
    determinants of groundwater dynamics by. Although these studies provided useful
    insight on ground water dynamics, they were not dedicated to quantifying groundwater
    parameters from remotely-sensed datasets. The GRACE satellites, on the other hand,
    have provided independent monthly models of the Earth’s gravity field, and variations
    in these values have been widely used on a continental scale to estimate groundwater
    storage variations (Rodell et al., 2018). Furthermore, GRACE has been directly
    related to groundwater masses where long-term depletion is occurring (Wahr et
    al., 2004; Ramjeawon et al., 2022), as well as being validated to show a close
    correspondence to in situ groundwater measurements (Famiglietti et al., 2011).
    Bonsor et al., (2018) used GRACE and Land Surface Models (LSMs) to estimate changes
    in terrestrial water storage (TWS) and groundwater storage (GWS) in 12 African
    sedimentary aquifers between 2002 and 2016. Their findings demonstrated seasonal
    variations in GWS estimates from TWS. Unfortunately, when compared to in situ
    data, the TWS GRACE and LSM results were less plausible in Africa’s semi-arid
    and hyper-arid basins, indicating that more research into in situ observations
    and LSMs is needed. 4.9. Satellite remote sensing for monitoring drought/floods
    and extreme climate events in Africa Droughts and floods are common in Africa,
    with severity varying by region. As a result, researchers and countries have been
    working on methods, frameworks and policies to improve drought and flood mitigation
    and adaptation strategies in recent years. Timely and spatially explicit information
    on the effects of drought and flooding in various regions has become critical
    (Bhaga et al., 2020, Mushore et al., 2019). Various satellite datasets, such as
    DEMs, multispectral, passive microwave observations, radar, and aerial photographs,
    have since been used to map vulnerable and hotspots in Africa (De Groeve 2010;
    Khan et al., 2011; Revilla-Romero et al., 2016). Few of these studies have been
    conducted at regional scale. For instance, Mushore et al., (2019) reviewed the
    literature on surface runoff modelling in southern Africa, and the paper showed
    how the use of remotely sensed data has replaced the use of hydrological models
    and ground-based measurements. Bhaga et al., (2020), on the other hand, investigated
    long-term scientific advancements made in drought monitoring using remote sensing,
    including its applicability in observing climate variability and the hydrological
    effects of drought on surface water resources in sub-Saharan Africa. So far, different
    satellite datasets namely DEMs, multispectral, passive microwave observations
    and radar as well as aerial photographs in conjunction with in-situ field observations
    have been used widely to map droughts and floods in Africa. A majority of these
    studies have been applied at river basin scale. For instance, Asare-Kyei et al.,
    (2015) used hydrological and statistical models along with remotely sensed data
    to define the geographic boundaries of flood hazard zones in a number of communities
    in Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Benin. The method entails estimating peak runoff concentrations
    at various elevations, followed by the use of statistical techniques to create
    a Flood Hazard Index (FHI). However, there is a need for further research that
    integrates multi-data sources to model floods and determine possible hotspots
    as well as provide early warning systems. Droughts in Africa, on the other hand,
    have been thoroughly researched, as noted in the review by Bhaga et al., (2020).
    Although the studies highlighted significant scientific progress in remote sensing
    applications in drought monitoring, issues of scale, operationalization of technologies
    and methods for wall-to-wall mapping, the provision of early warning systems remain
    critical if the impact of remote sensing in Africa is to be realized. 5. Remote
    sensing initiatives and projects for water resource management 5.1. WOIS and the
    TIGER Initiative When ESA realized that EO technology could help with WRM issues,
    it launched the TIGER Initiative, which supports African EO Capacity for WRM by
    collaborating with African water authorities and utilizing EO technologies (Guzinski
    et al., 2014, Crestaz, et al., 2017, Tshikeba Kabantu et al., 2018). TIGER aimed
    to empower African partners to exploit and disseminate EO technology on their
    own for scientific research, WRM programs, capacity building, training, and information
    and knowledge networking. Numerous TIGER projects have resulted in several scientific
    publications (Froehlich, 2020) and over 28 EO data processing solutions for African
    water authorities, such as basin-wide characterization of land and water resources,
    lake water quality monitoring, hydrological modeling, and flood forecasting. In
    addition, it has spawned other initiatives such as the EO African Framework for
    Research, Innovation, Communities, and Applications initiative (EOAFRICA) and
    TIGER-NET since its inception (Froehlich, 2020). The EOAFRICA program recently
    adopted a new focus on water and food security by utilizing innovative tools such
    as cloud computing, digital learning, and open access Sentinel data to collect
    spatio-temporal EO data for use in WRM. TIGER-NET was built in close collaboration
    with European scientists and African water authorities to aid in their decision-making
    (Crestaz et al., 2017). Through the Water Observation and Information System (WOIS),
    TIGER-NET supports satellite-based assessments and WRM. WOIS was an open source
    software that uses EO data from QGIS to assess water resources. This enabled WOIS
    to incorporate satellite data for flood monitoring and forecasting, water body
    mapping for irrigation and livestock, lake water quality, and hydrological modeling.
    Tshikeba Kabantu et al. (2018) used WOIS to assess the spatial distribution of
    soil loss and erosion hazards in Kinshasa, Congo, by combining remote sensing
    inputs and soil erosion factors. Despite providing valuable information indicating
    that the urban area of Kinshasa is more prone to soil erosion, WOIS tended to
    overestimate soil loss at the local level, while underestimating at the regional
    level. The study further reported that effective in-situ measurement validations
    would improve WOIS outcomes. Similarly, South Africa’s DWS uses WOIS for water
    discharge forecasting, land cover-based water demand mapping, and water management-related
    land cover change mapping. The DWS was able to develop high and medium resolution
    basin characterization, urban sanitation planning support, hydrological monitoring,
    and long term seasonal variation of wetlands for the City of Cape Town region
    with the aid of WOIS (Froehlich, 2020). These initiatives make significant contributions
    to improving water resource monitoring and management in previously data-limited
    environments across Africa by integrating EO data and programming techniques.
    5.2. Monitoring for environment and security and Africa (GMES and Africa) project
    Since the early 2000s, the research and innovation partnership between the European
    Union and the African Union has made significant progress in utilizing Earth Observation
    (EO) for monitoring water resources at the continental scale. The application
    of EO data has yielded tangible outcomes in various areas, including agriculture,
    flood modeling, land degradation, wetlands monitoring, and water security across
    Africa (Becker-Reshef et al., 2020; Gxokwe et al., 2020). One noteworthy collaboration
    is the PUMA Project, also known as the Meteorological Transition in Africa Project,
    which has leveraged the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite to facilitate
    EO research in Africa. This ambitious project aimed to transform meteorological
    services across Africa and involved 53 African countries. Through the PUMA Project,
    African countries and regional centers were equipped with satellite data receiving
    stations, infrastructure, technical and thematic training, and application support
    for data acquisition and utilization in various domains. The participating countries
    benefited from initiatives such as PUMA, AMESD, and GMES Africa, which promoted
    the use of EO data for African sustainable development. They gained access to
    essential research equipment to receive continuous direct satellite data, software
    for data processing and product generation (e.g., weather forecasts, rainfall
    estimates, fire observations, sea surface temperature measurements), and training
    to enhance data utilization. The project also fostered collaboration among the
    countries, improving their collective capabilities and providing more effective
    and user-centric services. Additionally, five pilot projects were implemented
    across the African Regional Economic Communities, exploring the operational use
    of MSG data in sustainable development programs. Furthermore, significant financial
    and research support has been provided through the GMES and Africa project to
    harness EO for monitoring natural resources in Africa, resulting in a surge in
    scientific research in this field. However, despite the benefits and advancements
    brought about by EO science and applications in Africa, the continent''s utilization
    and application of EO technology still fall below its potential due to various
    factors (Ifejika et al., 2023). Research surveys indicate that the majority of
    EO initiatives in Africa are driven by external entities, while country-level
    expenditures on EO remain limited. Recent developments, such as the African space
    policy and strategy, along with initiatives to establish an EO community of practice
    in collaboration with African-based organizations, hold promise in addressing
    these identified gaps. 6. Set-backs and limitations Despite the attractiveness
    of EO data in WRM, there are still challenges when utilizing the information.
    The current abundance of EO data (Fig. 5), for example, can frequently make the
    selection process of appropriate data overwhelming and complex. Furthermore, the
    specifics of the use of remotely sensed data have a significant impact on the
    scale and study undertaken. Each sensor, method, region, and parameter investigated
    has its own set of limitations (van Dijk and Renzullo, 2011). Satellite-based
    datasets can be an unappealing alternative due to limitations in return periods,
    spatial resolutions, spectral ranges, cloud cover, instrument failures, and development
    time (Sheffield et al., 2018). Furthermore, EO data are still primarily used to
    supplement ground information, particularly for WRM. Due to institutional costs,
    a lack of skilled technicians, ground-truth data, and data continuity, EO technology
    in Africa is still far from fully operational (Fernandez-Prieto and Palazzo, 2007).
    Furthermore, Africa continues to have one of the lowest numbers of WRM publications
    (Gxokwe et al., 2020). Reviews like those by Mushore et al., (2019) meticulously
    highlight the limitations of remote sensing in contributing to rainfall-runoff
    modeling. Current techniques can only map linked parameters of runoff or validate
    spatial models and hydrologically significant variables, not directly map runoff
    characteristics. Second, due to the high spatiotemporal complexity of runoff,
    there is no obvious set of variables that are universally used to estimate runoff
    from EO techniques (King et al., 2005). Third, advanced remotely sensed data suitable
    for runoff estimation, such as RapidEye, IKONOS, Worldview, and SPOT 7, are prohibitively
    expensive (van der Sande et al., 2003). Finally, there are no comprehensive, well-defined
    validation procedures for assessing surface runoff from remotely sensed data (Mushore
    et al., 2019). When it comes to utilizing EO datasets, several researchers have
    highlighted limitations in their studies. Winkler et al., (2017) identified droughts
    affecting agriculture in Africa using the TRMM-based Standardized Precipitation
    Index (SPI) and the MODIS-derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Despite its
    promise, MODIS data only covered a brief period of time, whereas TRMM data included
    uncertainties in rainfall estimates. Furthermore, because of NDVI''s sensitivity
    to soil moisture, atmospheric interferences, and colour, it was misinterpreted
    over sparsely vegetated areas. Similarly, Vazifedoust et al., (2009) used MODIS
    data to identify LAI and relative ET to improve crop yield forecasts, claiming
    that the products were inaccurate estimators for calculating crop yield. Likewise,
    Sun et al., (2010) emphasized that advanced data products like Jason-1 and -2,
    TOPEX/Poseidon, and Envisat still lack high velocity measurements and only provide
    1-Dimensional spot water level data, leaving large areas between orbits unobserved.
    Overall, significant progress is still required to rely more on EO data and less
    on costly and time-consuming in-situ measurements. Nonetheless, future projects
    appear to be promising. 7. Future research trajectories Modeling capabilities
    are anticipated to advance as new satellites are continuously launched and longer
    periods of remote sensing data are collected. Observing Systems Capability Analysis
    and Review (OSCAR), a resource tool created by the WMO, supports EO applications
    (WMO, 2021). All past, present, and future EO instruments as well as all weather,
    water, and climate-related applications are covered in detail and with the most
    recent information by OSCAR. According to some research, certain suggestions have
    been made regarding particular sensor needs for WRM. An “ideal” inland water quality
    sensor, according to Sagan et al., (2020) should have an imaging spectrometer
    with 3–10 nm spectral resolution, bands from 250 to 1000 nm, a minimum of 3 Shortwave
    InfraRed (SWIR) bands for atmospheric correction, spatial resolution between 5
    and 15 m, and as high a resolution as possible. Similarly, Sheffield et al., (2018)
    reviewed what they considered to be the most important EO missions that are currently
    in operation and that are planned for the future. Below is an explanation of these.
    The Meteosat Third Generation, set to launch in 2022, will cover Europe and Africa,
    with a life expectancy until 2038. The Meteosat Second Generation''s work of providing
    weather forecasts and more accurate monitoring of the atmosphere, land surfaces,
    and oceans will be carried on by this program. The 2023 launch of BIOMASS will
    concentrate on measuring the world''s forest biomass as well as the topography
    of the land and glaciers. An operational global polar orbiting environmental satellite
    system called JPSS-2 is scheduled to launch in 2022. It will provide time series
    multispectral data for use in energy and water balance, vegetation dynamics, and
    LULC changes. By providing more precise images of surface water heights, the SWOT
    mission, scheduled to launch in 2022, will address issues with retrievals of current
    altimeters (Biancamaria et al., 2016). NASA’s HyspIRI, set to launch in 2023,
    will provide enhanced monitoring capabilities for inland water applications at
    30 m spatial resolution, with 214 unique spectral bands in visible and SWIR regions
    (Sagan et al., 2020). These products are also being used in new ways. Fusion techniques,
    which integrate and combine various remotely sensed datasets with one another
    and with in-situ data, show great promise. This has already been demonstrated
    in studies like those by Long et al., (2020), who combined in situ LST measurements
    with MODIS data to increase LST retrievals in all-weather scenarios and deliver
    precise soil moisture and ET estimates for WRM. Similar to this, Abowarda et al.,
    (2021) combined in situ measurements with MODIS and Landsat data to improve the
    accuracy of soil moisture estimates. The processing of EO data is also benefiting
    greatly from ML algorithms like artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector
    machines (SVM), minimum distance classification, maximum likelihood classification
    (MLC), regression tree-based algorithms, ISODATA, and K-means clustering (Rodríguez-Caballero
    et al., 2022). The analysis of EO data for WRM is made possible by these advancements
    in data modelling or analysis. Some African regions have already conducted studies
    using these cutting-edge machine learning techniques. For instance, Gaffoor et
    al., (2022) modelled groundwater levels for the Shire Valley Alluvial Aquifer
    within the Zambezi basin in southern Africa using ensemble and deep learning.
    According to their research, the Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network outperformed
    the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree in terms of highlighting changes in water
    level. The performance of five new hybrid/ensemble machine learning techniques
    was compared by Ijlil et al., (2022) when evaluating the level of groundwater
    pollution in Morocco. DRASTIC-Random Forest (RF), DRASTIC- SVM, DRASTIC-Multilayer
    Perceptron (MLP), DRASTIC-RF-SVM, and DRASTIC-RF-MLP were the methodologies used.
    According to the study, the RASTIC-RF-MLP performed better than the other models.
    Artificial intelligence (AI), petascale image-processing techniques, and cloud
    computing, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), open up new possibilities for the
    fusion and integration of multisource data (Mahdianpari et al., 2019). Using indicators
    of dryness, moisture, greenness, and desertification, Wu et al., (2022) created
    a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model using MODIS data in the GEE platform
    to assess future trends throughout the Sahel region of Africa. Ecological deterioration
    in the Sahel is predicted to occur as precipitation decreases (Monerie et al.,
    2020), and it has been suggested that the “Great Green Wall” Project could change
    the predicted values. Future developments are likely to build on these strategies
    and offer more precise and timely information, which is essential for WRM. 8.
    Conclusion This work examined advancements achieved in remote sensing applications
    for monitoring and managing water resources in Africa. The paper covered a wide
    range of applications, including precipitation estimation, land surface temperature
    analysis, soil moisture assessment, surface water extent measurement, surface
    runoff and streamflow analysis, water quality evaluation, land cover/land use
    mapping, and groundwater analysis. The review further emphasized on the evolution
    of remote sensing methodologies, particularly in rainfall estimation, water quality
    assessment, and groundwater and runoff modeling. Overall, this work underscored
    the importance of sensor availability, analytical models, and observational data
    in facilitating water resource monitoring at various scales. Challenges related
    to in-situ hydrological monitoring networks, limited long-term rainfall and climate
    data, and the lack of high-resolution spatial and temporal data were, however,
    found to have affected the accurate calibration, validation, and monitoring of
    hydrological processes in Africa. Despite the scarcity of in-situ data, the significance
    of earth observation in enhancing our understanding of Africa''s hydrology cannot
    be overstated. To further advance this field, there is a pressing need to increase
    the adoption and application of remote sensing techniques, particularly in the
    accurate estimation of various components of the hydrological cycle at varying
    scales. Future research should prioritize the integration and assimilation of
    data from various sources, while leveraging advanced technologies like big data
    analytics, cloud computing, and machine learning. This comprehensive review serves
    as an indispensable reference for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners
    involved in the sustainable management of water resources in Africa. Declaration

  description: Estimation of root-zone soil moisture (SM) is crucial for effective
    agricultural management and water resource planning. However, current methods
    for soil moisture estimation exhibit several limitations that hinder their practical
    application. This study introduces a novel nowcasting model, which integrates
    in-situ and remote sensing data through a Predictive Error Compensated wavelet
    Neural NETwork (PECNET), addressing the drawbacks of existing approaches.Existing
    SM estimation techniques often suffer from limited accuracy, inadequate contextual
    information, and no real-time monitoring capabilities. Although remote sensing
    technologies offer promising advantages, such as wide spatial coverage and frequent
    data acquisition, they are not immune to limitations. Vegetation coverage and
    density present challenges in accurately estimating root-zone SM using remote
    sensing techniques. These factors can introduce uncertainties and errors in the
    estimation process, thereby impacting the reliability of the results.To overcome
    these limitations and enhance the accuracy of root-zone SM estimation, this study
    proposes the integration of remote sensing data with in-situ measurements. Specifically,
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculations from Landsat 7 and
    Landsat 8 satellites are fused with evapotranspiration and rainfall data obtained
    from agrometeorological stations. Combining these datasets generates an 8-day
    time series for the target parcels, leveraging the contextual information provided
    by NDVI and seasonality to improve the accuracy of root-zone soil moisture estimation.To
    develop a robust and efficient model, we introduce PECNET, which ensures the orthogonality
    of input features and facilitates the learning of non-linear relationships between
    variables. Notably, PECNET addresses the challenge of limited labeled training
    data, minimizing the risk of overfitting and enabling accurate estimation with
    fewer labeled samples. In addition, this study employs discrete wavelet transformation
    coefficients as inputs for the neural networks, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to direct measurements.Validation experiments were conducted to evaluate
    the performance of the proposed PECNET model. Comparative analyses with simple
    regression, Kriging, and feed-forward neural networks reveal the significant advantages
    of the Predictive Error Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork approach in root-zone
    soil moisture estimation.In conclusion, this research introduces an advanced nowcasting
    model for root-zone SM estimation. By integrating in-situ and remote sensing data,
    harnessing contextual information, and utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning
    techniques, our approach overcomes the limitations of existing methods. It offers
    a robust solution for accurate soil moisture estimation, with implications for
    precision agriculture, water management, and decision-making related to agricultural
    practices and land resource utilization. However, the limitations imposed by vegetation
    coverage and density on remote sensing technologies should be considered when
    interpreting the results.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Wuhan, China SECTION I. Introduction Root-zone
    soil moisture (SM) is crucial for agricultural water management, crop yield estimation,
    and drought monitoring [1]. For cereal crops, which primarily have their roots
    distributed at a 0-50 cm depth, soil moisture within these depths is often used
    to monitor and predict agricultural drought [2, 3]. However, measuring root-zone
    SM directly is challenging and costly, especially at large scales. Remote sensing
    data, such as microwave and optical imagery, can provide spatially and temporally
    consistent information on surface soil moisture and vegetation conditions related
    to root-zone SM. Various approaches and algorithms have been developed to estimate
    soil moisture using remote sensing data. Surface SM products of the SMOS (Soil
    Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission by ESA (European Space Agency) and the SMAP
    (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission by NASA are the primary products [4,5].
    Both missions use microwave sensors to measure SM, as microwave radiation is sensitive
    to the dielectric constant of water and can penetrate through clouds and vegetation.
    Another type of sensor that can be used for retrieving surface SM is optical/thermal
    infrared sensors [5]. Optical/thermal infrared sensors cannot measure the SM directly.
    Still, they can estimate it indirectly from other variables, such as land surface
    temperature (LST), vegetation indices, albedo, and net surface shortwave radiation
    (NSSR) [5, 6]. Surface SM data is used for estimating root-zone SM using complex
    physical models or data assimilation techniques [7, 8]. Machine learning techniques
    have been increasingly utilized for estimating root-zone SM, leveraging the relationships
    between near-surface observations and root-zone conditions [9, 10]. However, there
    are limitations due to the nature of soil moisture and machine learning algorithms.
    The surface and root-zone SM relationship can vary spatially and temporally, and
    it may be influenced by factors such as soil type, vegetation cover, and climatic
    conditions [7]. Machine learning models trained on specific environmental conditions
    may not generalize to different situations or regions. Models trained on one type
    of soil or vegetation may not perform as well in areas with different soil types
    or vegetation cover [7]. Also, inaccurate or limited ground truth data can affect
    the performance and reliability of the models [11]. In addition, overfitting is
    a common problem in machine learning, where a model performs well on the training
    data but fails to generalize to new data. In agricultural management, overfitting
    can occur when the model is trained on a small dataset that does not represent
    the entire population or when there are too many features compared to the number
    of observations [12]. The notion of orthogonality plays a pivotal role in the
    design and performance of machine learning models. Essentially, it refers to the
    independence and lack of correlation between various features or variables. We
    have developed an error-compensated neural network where the input parameters
    are discrete wavelet preprocessed as a solution to the ML drawbacks for a limited
    number of samples and an increasing number of input features [13]. In the context
    of PECNET, achieving higher orthogonality among input parameters for the final
    ANN ensures a reduced risk of overfitting. By promoting orthogonality, PECNET
    enhances its capacity to extract meaningful patterns from the data while disregarding
    irrelevant or redundant information. This, in turn, contributes to the model’s
    improved predictive accuracy and robustness when estimating root-zone SM dynamics.

    a continental climate with distinct seasonal variations. Summers are generally
    hot and dry, while winters are cold and moderately snowy. The region receives
    limited rainfall, particularly during the summer months. The average annual precipitation
    in Kirşehir ranges from approximately 350 to 450 mm. However, it is important
    to note that precipitation patterns may vary yearly, and rainfall distribution
    throughout the seasons can influence agricultural practices. The region is known
    for cultivating various agricultural products. Wheat, barley, oats, and legumes
    are among the major cereal crops grown in Kirşehir. Our study focuses on data
    obtained from four selected parcels equipped with agrometeorological stations
    between September 2014 to July 2017, corresponding to three winter wheat cycles
    (Fig. 1). The dataset encompasses root-zone SM at a depth of 15cm (SM15) and 45cm
    (SM45), rainfall (RF) and 2m air temperature ( T a ) at a 10-minute resolution
    and evapotranspiration (ET0) at an hourly resolution. Complementing these in-situ
    measurements, we incorporate the NDVI, a key indicator of vegetation vigor and
    health, derived from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites. The synergy between data
    obtained from both satellites permits the creation of an 8-day dataset. In harmonizing
    the diverse temporal resolutions, we resample the in-situ measurements to match
    the satellite data’s 8-day intervals. This involves aligning the SM45 data with
    the satellite pass time (08:20 AM) and calculating the accumulated RF and ET0
    over the preceding eight days. By adopting the (ET0RF) metric, we holistically
    account for the interplay between water input and output, yielding a comprehensive
    water balance representation. Root-zone SM is quantified using tensiometric measurements,
    expressed in Centibars (cbar) of soil water tension. The root-zone SM values exhibit
    a dynamic range spanning 0 to 200 cbar, wherein 0-10 cbar signifies soil saturation
    and values exceeding 100 cbar indicate drier soil conditions. The interval between
    10 and 60 cbar represents the irrigation range, with variations for distinct soil
    types. We observe SM45 saturation (around 200 cbar) during certain months due
    to specific precipitation patterns. Fig. 1. Study Area and the selected parcels
    with agrometeorological stations Show All Our research acknowledges two prevalent
    scenarios in estimating root-zone SM for agricultural water management. In the
    first scenario, sensors are available at both reference and target stations. While
    training the model, in-situ measurements and satellite-derived NDVI are employed.
    During testing, the established model relationship is applied solely using satellite-derived
    NDVI. The second scenario arises when no sensor is accessible at the target point,
    necessitating a strategy that leans exclusively on satellite data for both training
    and testing. In scenarios where no sensors are accessible at the estimation station,
    the quest for improved accuracy necessitates a diversified dataset, often featuring
    spatial information, notably exemplified by the NDVI. However, moving beyond single-point
    measurements, our approach centers on harnessing the temporal patterns inherent
    in NDVI dynamics. These patterns encapsulate more valuable information than the
    mere cause behind NDVI fluctuations. For instance, an elevated NDVI might follow
    rainfall or emerge due to dew formation. Additionally, NDVI’s direct relevance
    to SM is limited. Instead, in our context, NDVI indirectly imparts data about
    the surface’s textural composition. Another data we used referring to the seasonality
    based on the sample’s corresponding day of the year (DOY) is given as equations
    1 and 2. Sin(D0Y)=Sin( DOY 365 ∗360) (1) View Source Cos(D0Y)=Cos( DOY 365 ∗360)
    (2) View Source B. Conventional Methods (Regression and Kriging) Linear regression
    is a statistical modeling technique where changes in the independent variables
    are associated with proportional changes in the dependent variable. It allows
    to identify and quantify the relationships between root-zone SM and independent
    variables, providing insights into the factors influencing root-zone SM dynamics.
    Our preliminary analysis shows that none of the examined parameters exhibit a
    substantial correlation with the target parameter, SM45 (Fig. 2). Notably, even
    the SM45 values across distinct parcels demonstrate varied correlation magnitudes,
    implying intricate non-linear associations. Also, a negative correlation was observed
    between NDVI and SM45, a phenomenon attributed to the distinctive characteristics
    of tensiometric measurement values. Kriging is a geostatistical interpolation
    technique commonly used in spatial analysis and prediction [13]. Kriging estimates
    values at unmeasured locations by considering the spatial correlation and variability
    of the observed data points. The main advantage of Kriging is its ability to provide
    optimal estimates, taking into account both the nearby measured values and the
    spatial structure of the data. It uses a weighted average of neighboring points,
    with weights determined by the spatial correlation between the points. Kriging
    accounts for the spatial autocorrelation of the data, making it particularly useful
    when the underlying process exhibits spatial trends or patterns. Despite its advantages,
    Kriging also has certain limitations and disadvantages. Kriging assumes stationarity,
    meaning that the statistical properties of soil moisture remain constant over
    the study area. However, SM can exhibit non-stationarity due to topography, soil
    types, and vegetation cover. C. Feed-forwardNeural Network Multi-Layer Perceptron
    (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network, a class of machine learning models
    inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The MLP is a feed-forward
    neural network consisting of multiple layers of interconnected nodes called neurons.
    Each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer,
    and each connection has an associated weight. In this study, we utilized an MLPRegressor
    for the case where the sensor is no longer present at the estimation point [14].
    So the relationship was established when there was a sensor at the point. MLPRegressor
    is a variant of MLP designed for regression tasks to model the relationship between
    multiple features and the target root-zone soil moisture. We preprocessed the
    data by splitting it into training (80%) and test (20%) sets and standardizing
    the features to ensure optimal model performance. The MLPRegressor was configured
    with two hidden layers and a learning rate of 0.01. Fig. 2. The correlation heatmap
    of the input variables and root-zone soil moisture at the selected parcels. Show
    All D. PECNET Model The PECNET model is utilized for cases with no sensor at the
    estimation points [15]. It presents a cascaded ANN architecture designed to enhance
    the prediction accuracy of chaotic and stochastic time series data (Fig. 3). In
    contrast to conventional approaches, PECNET operates on discrete wavelet coefficients
    extracted from input parameters, offering a more robust representation of the
    underlying temporal patterns. Since root-zone SM is an accumulated variable, direct
    measurements are replaced with parameter-specific wavelet coefficients. The initial
    stage of PECNET involves the deployment of ANNs, where discrete wavelet coefficients
    derived from the highest correlated input parameter with the target are inputted
    to the first ANN. The following ANN inputs are selected based on the highest correlation
    with the previous ANNs output. Concurrently, input parameters associated with
    seasonal variations are also fed into the ANNs. This cascaded stage is a vital
    component for pattern extraction and preliminary error estimation. The cascaded
    architecture computes and estimates errors and higher-order errors, progressively
    refining predictions. All the outputs of the cascaded ANNs culminate in a final
    ANN, which serves as the fusion network of the model. The inputs to the final
    ANN exhibit increased orthogonality, a property that safeguards against overfitting
    and enhances generalization capabilities. SECTION III. Results At first, we performed
    Kriging interpolation to examine if root-zone SM can be interpolated like other
    agrometeorological parameters such as air temperature ( T a ) . As the non-linearity
    increases, it gets harder to interpolate, and the spatial relationship weakens
    (Table 1). TABLE I Mean Absolute Error of Kriging Interpolation Fig. 3. PECNET
    training flowchart with an example where 40-12 station is the target. Show All
    Then simple linear regression is performed for the case where the estimation parcel
    has an agrometeorological sensor (Table 2). The results showed that using a linear
    model to estimate root-zone SM is impossible. Adding more variables to the model,
    including root-zone SM, also does not help to have improved results. As we added
    more variables, the p-values of the independent variables got worse by getting
    higher than 0.05 in most cases for the coefficients of independent variables.
    Yet, using only (E T 0− RF) and NDVI as the independent variables made it worse
    based on the R2 and mean absolute error (MAE) values. It is shown that there is
    a need for reference stations to estimate root-zone SM accurately. If the land
    cover, in this situation, the type of cultivation, is known together with adequate
    context information about surrounding points, it is possible to establish the
    relationship. A feed-forward neural network with MLPRegressor is utilized to examine
    the estimation performance where SM45, NDVI, and (E T 0− RF) are used as input
    parameters (Table 3). We employed the R2 Score and MAE for performance evaluation
    to assess the model’s accuracy and generalization ability. It is observed that
    even using SM45 alone as the input parameter, the MLPRegressor overfits. Adding
    new parameters, hence increasing the number of input features, also resulted in
    low training MAE but high test MAE values indicating the overfitting of the model.
    The MLPRegressor was shown to be not adequate for learning the non-linear relationship
    of root-zone SM. Even with a sensor at the estimation point in the training phase,
    the MLPRegressor is overfitted. So when there is a need to increase the number
    of inputs in the case of no sensor at the estimation point, there is a need to
    summarize all the input features and overcome the overfitting problem. Hence the
    PECNET model is utilized for this second case. The results demonstrated that the
    PECNET model effectively captured the underlying patterns in the data and achieved
    high accuracy in predicting the target variable (Table IV). Also, it is shown
    that adding the seasonality context helps to achieve better estimation performance.
    The presented evaluation metric results provide comprehensive insights into the
    model’s performance and ability to generalize to unseen data. SECTION IV. Conclusion
    In this study, we have introduced a pioneering nowcasting model, Predictive Error
    Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork (PECNET), to revolutionize accurate root-zone
    SM estimation. The significance of precise SM estimation in agricultural management
    and water resource planning cannot be understated. By integrating in-situ and
    remote sensing data, incorporating contextual information, and harnessing advanced
    machine learning techniques, our approach addresses the limitations of existing
    methods, marking a significant advancement in this field. Existing methods for
    SM estimation often grapple with inherent inaccuracies, lack of comprehensive
    context, and real-time monitoring limitations. The integration of remote sensing
    data, while promising, faces obstacles such as vegetation coverage complexities.
    Our solution bridges these gaps by combining the power of remote sensing data
    with in-situ measurements. This integration, driven by NDVI data from Landsat
    7 and Landsat 8 satellites, alongside agrometeorological data, results in an 8-day
    time series dataset that captures crucial contextual nuances. PECNET presents
    a comprehensive solution to address the challenges associated with cumulative
    variables and complex temporal patterns by harnessing the power of discrete wavelet
    coefficients and exploiting the advantages of orthogonality. The multi-stage architecture
    and the emphasis on orthogonality underscore PECNET’s potential as an effective
    tool for soil moisture prediction in various environmental contexts. TABLE II

    illustrate the potential of PECNET as a powerful tool for modeling non-linear
    relationships in diverse domains, making it a valuable addition to the repertoire
    of machine learning techniques for various real-world applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Knowledge of irrigation location and extent is essential for irrigation-water
    use estimation and water resource management. However, it remains a great challenge
    to map irrigated areas at large spatial scales due to the great variation in climate,
    geography, and agricultural practices, as well as the lack of sufficient ground
    truth data. This study proposed a novel approach to develop the first 250-m irrigated
    cropland map in mainland China (CIrrMap250) by integrating remote sensing, irrigation
    suitability, and irrigated area statistics. We assessed the performance of CIrrMap250
    and compared it with three irrigation maps (i.e., EVI-map, NDVI-map, GI-map) generated
    using the threshold-based classification method and four other existing maps,
    including GMIA2005 (Siebert et al., 2005), GIAM2000 (Thenkabail et al., 2009),
    Zhu-map (Zhu et al., 2014), and Meier-map (Meier et al., 2018). Results indicate
    that CIrrMap250 and all other maps capture well the intensively irrigated areas
    such as the North China Plain and Northwest China, as well as many large-scale
    irrigation districts. However, all maps except CIrrMap250 tend to underestimate
    irrigated cropland in river valleys while overestimating irrigated cropland in
    the mountainous areas, as illustrated by the field-surveyed irrigation districts,
    due to the neglect of the mixed grid effects. Compared to other irrigation maps,
    CIrrMap250 exhibits a better agreement with the reference points, achieving improvements
    in Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy by 8% up to about 2 times. The irrigated
    area estimates of CIrrMap250 are very close to the statistical data due to their
    usage in generating the training pool. Further analysis indicates CIrrMap250 has
    a greater proportion of irrigated cropland at lower elevations, on smaller slopes,
    and near water bodies than the other maps. There is large uncertainty in irrigation
    ratio estimates due to the varying cropland area from multiple sources. This study
    demonstrates the effectiveness of the new irrigation mapping method and highlights
    the great potential of combining irrigation suitability with remote sensing and
    statistical data to improve the accuracy of large-scale irrigated cropland mapping.

    learningChina 1. Introduction Irrigation greatly enhances agricultural yields
    and plays a critical role in safeguarding food security (Wang et al., 2021). Irrigated
    agriculture contributes to ∼ 40 % of global food production in just 20 % of cropland,
    but accounts for ∼ 70 % global freshwater withdrawals and 90 % of consumptive
    water use (Siebert and Döll, 2010, Wada et al., 2013). Irrigation is expected
    to expand in the future due to climate change, growing food demand, and agricultural
    intensification (Deines et al., 2017). Extensive irrigation has caused dramatic
    changes in water cycles, putting unprecedented pressure on sustainable freshwater
    use (McDermid et al., 2021). Reconciling irrigation benefits with water stress
    and environmental impacts remains a grand challenge for managers and policy makers
    in the twenty-first century (Salmon et al., 2015, Rosa et al., 2020). Irrigation-water
    withdrawal is mostly driven by irrigated area (Puy et al., 2021). Knowledge of
    irrigation distribution is a first step towards irrigation water estimation and
    water resource management (Portmann et al., 2010, Xie and Lark, 2021). However,
    irrigation location and extent are poorly understood, especially at national to
    global scales, due to the hidden nature of irrigation signals and the limited
    ground truth data available for training classification algorithms (Ozdogan and
    Gutman, 2008, Liu et al., 2018, Xie et al., 2021). Insufficient information on
    irrigation distribution is unfavorable for sustainable water use and management
    (Nagaraj et al., 2021) and will introduce large uncertainties and biases in the
    modeling of surface and hydrologic processes, land–atmosphere interactions, and
    crop growth. Satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented opportunities to
    detect and map irrigated areas at multiple spatial scales. Various methods have
    been proposed to identify irrigated areas using remote sensing data, which can
    be classified into two categories, namely optical and near-infrared methods and
    microwave-based methods (Massari et al., 2021). Visual interpretation is perhaps
    the most primitive method that use optical and near-infrared signatures to detect
    irrigated area, but is a cost and time intensive procedure (Karthikeyan et al.,
    2020). Besides the spectral signatures, many vegetation indices such as the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Rouse et al., 1974), normalized difference
    water index (NDWI) (Gao, 1996), and green index (GI) (Gitelson, 2005) have been
    used to map irrigated areas, the rationale behind which is that irrigation reduces
    crop water stresses and increase productivity, resulting in higher greenness and
    water content of irrigated crops than rainfed crops (Nagaraj et al., 2021). These
    vegetation indices are often used with classification algorithms trained with
    ground-truth data, such as decision trees (Ozdogan and Gutman, 2008, Ambika et
    al., 2016b), support vector machine (Sharma et al., 2021), and random forest (Peña-Arancibia
    et al., 2014, Deines et al., 2017), to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed
    croplands. In some exceptions, the vegetation indices are compared to the target
    spectra of ground samples (Lu et al., 2021), adjacent forest pixels (Xiang et
    al., 2019), and time-series precipitation to detect irrigation signals (Chen et
    al., 2018). In recent years, the microwave-based irrigation mapping with satellite
    soil moisture products has also attracted attention (Dari et al., 2021). The rationale
    behind the microwave-based approach is that irrigation increases soil moisture
    and causes changes in soil moisture and radar backscatter signals. Thus, microwave
    information is usually compared with simulations under “natural” conditions to
    detected irrigated areas (Kumar et al., 2015, Zaussinger et al., 2019, Zohaib
    et al., 2019) or used with the classification algorithms trained with ground truth
    data (Gao et al., 2018, Pageot et al., 2020, Bazzi et al., 2021). Remote sensing-based
    irrigated cropland extraction methods have shown high accuracy and reliability
    in small-scale areas (e.g., watersheds and irrigation districts). Nevertheless,
    it is still a great challenge to map irrigated area at large spatial scales (e.g.,
    national and global scales) due to the wide variation in climate, geography and
    agricultural practices (Salmon et al., 2015), as well as the lack of adequate
    ground truth data (Ozdogan et al., 2010, Xie and Lark, 2021). There have been
    several attempts to map the global irrigated area. Siebert et al. (2005) generated
    the global map of irrigated areas (GMIA) by combining national and subnational
    statistics with geospatial information on irrigation location and extent. Thenkabail
    et al. (2009) derived the global irrigated area map (GIAM) from remote sensing
    using the spectral matching technique and decision tree algorithm. Later, Salmon
    et al. (2015) fused remote sensing classification results with agricultural inventory
    data to generate a map of global rainfed, irrigated, and paddy croplands (GRIPC).
    Meier et al. (2018) merged the downscaled GMIA map with the remote sensing-derived
    irrigation map to generate a new global high-resolution irrigation map. In addition,
    several national irrigation maps have been produced in recent years, such as the
    Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Irrigated Agriculture Dataset
    (MIrAD-US) (Pervez and Brown, 2010), Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset across the
    conterminous United States (LANID-US) (Xie et al., 2019, Xie and Lark, 2021),
    and remotely sensed high resolution irrigated area map in India (Ambika et al.,
    2016b). Typically, national irrigation maps are more accurate than global maps
    due to the availability of more ground data, higher spatial resolution, and reliable
    auxiliary information. China is a large agricultural country with the largest
    irrigated area (65.87 million ha) in the world, followed by India (62.00 million
    ha) and the United States (26.71 million ha) (IDCD, 2018). However, to our knowledge,
    few studies have mapped irrigated areas throughout China (Xiang et al., 2020,
    Zhu et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2022), and the spatial resolution of irrigation
    map is far below that of other countries (e.g. the United States and India). This
    limits the accuracy of irrigation-water use estimates in China and significantly
    affects irrigation-related ecological, hydrological, and climatic studies. To
    address the above gaps, this study proposes a novel approach to develop the first
    250-m irrigated cropland map in mainland China (CIrrMap250) for the year 2000
    by integrating remote sensing, irrigation suitability, and irrigated area statistics.
    The major difference between our approach and other existing methods lies in the
    incorporation irrigation suitability into the mapping process. Our objectives
    of are threefold: (1) to test the effectiveness of the new irrigation mapping
    method; (ii) to compare the performance of CIrrMap250 with three irrigation maps
    generated using the traditional threshold-based method and four other existing
    maps (Siebert et al., 2005, Thenkabail et al., 2009, Zhu et al., 2014, Meier et
    al., 2018); and (iii) to reveal the spatial distribution features of irrigated
    cropland in mainland China. 2. Study area China lies between 15°-50°N and 65°-135°E
    and covers an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers. This study
    was carried out in mainland China (Fig. 1), which is characterized by a wide range
    of elevations, from 176 m below sea level at Ayding Lake in the Turpan depression
    of Xinjiang to 8,794 m above sea level on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau. According
    to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Biggs et al., 2006), southeastern
    China has a warm temperate climate; northwestern China has an arid climate; northeastern
    and parts of central China have a cold climate; and the high-altitude Qinghai
    Tibetan Plateau has a polar and cold climate. Cropland is extensively distributed
    across mainland China, with a greater concentration in the eastern, northeastern,
    and central regions than in the arid northwestern region, particularly the North
    China Plain, Northeast China Plain, Guanzhong Plain, Sichuan Basin, and Middle
    and Lower Yangtze River Plain. As shown in Fig. 1b, the study area is divided
    into 3,652 mapping units. There are 686 reference points covering mainland China,
    which are used to evaluate the accuracy of the irrigation maps. Download : Download

    in Fig. 2. We first collected and processed three types of data, including satellite
    data, irrigated area statistics, and auxiliary data. Then, we combined the satellite-derived
    vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI and GI) with irrigated area statistics from 3,625
    administrative units to drive three irrigation maps (i.e., NDVI-map, EVI-map,
    and GI-map) using the threshold-based classification method (Pervez and Brown,
    2010). Afterward, we produced another irrigated cropland map (i.e., CIrrMap250)
    using the newly proposed semiautomatic classification approach. The new approach
    consists of three major steps, including irrigation suitability analysis, training
    pool generation based on suitability-adjusted vegetation indices and irrigated
    area statistics, and machine learning-based classification of irrigated and rainfed
    cropland. Lastly, we evaluated the accuracy of CIrrMap250, NDVI-map, EVI-map,
    GI-map, and four other existing maps (i.e., GMIA2005, GIAM2000 Zhu-map, and Meier-map)
    from three different perspectives, including the distribution of irrigated croplands,
    agreement with reference points, and consistency with irrigated area statistics.

    3.1. Datasets and processing 3.1.1. Satellite data The MODIS vegetation indices
    (MOD13Q1) Version 6 data including two vegetation layers, i.e., NDVI and enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI) (Huete et al., 1997), were used in the study. As shown
    in Table 1, NDVI and EVI are 16-day composite products with a spatial resolution
    of 250 m. Meanwhile, the 500-m and 8-day surface spectral reflectance of band
    04 provided by MOD09A1 was resampled to 250 m through nearest neighbor interpolation
    (Debeurs and Townsend, 2008). It was used to derive another vegetation index (i.e.,
    GI) along with the 250-m and 8-day surface reflectance of band 01 provided by
    MOD09Q1. All MODIS data were quality filtered using quality and usefulness indicators,
    and only those cloud and snow/ice free pixels with decreasing to highest quality
    were considered to be reliable (Hilker et al., 2012). Unreliable pixels were reconstructed
    using a simple nearest neighbor interpolation method. We calculated the maximum,
    minimum, range, median values of vegetation indices for each crop grid. Note that
    the maximum and minimum values were calculated at the 95th and 10th percentile,
    respectively, to exclude the unidentified cloudy and poor-quality values (Xie
    and Lark, 2021). To better account for crop and climate gradients, we further
    derived a set of neighborhood normalized vegetation indices (NNDVI, NEVI, NGI)
    (Deines et al., 2019) by dividing the annual peak vegetation index of a target
    pixel to the median value of its neighborhood pixels within a 25 km radius circular
    kernel. Table 1. Summary of the MODIS-derived vegetation indices used in this

    were compiled through a top-down and bottom-up approach. The county-level and
    city-level irrigated area were first collected from the Provincial Statistical
    Yearbook, the Rural Statistical Yearbook, and the China Statistical Yearbook for
    Regional Economy (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2001b). In China, municipal
    administration (city) consists of districts and counties, and here we referred
    to them all as counties. Counties without any irrigated area were merged into
    their nearest neighbors. We aggregated the irrigated areas at the county level
    to the city level and compared them with the city-level statistics for consistency
    checks. Where inconsistencies existed, we further collected irrigation-water use
    data from the provincial water resource bulletin, and irrigation areas with a
    high correlation to irrigation-water use were considered reliable for subsequent
    analysis. The city-level irrigated areas were finally aggregated to the provincial
    level and compared them with the values reported by the China Water Statistical
    Yearbook (CWSY) (China Ministry of Water Resources, 2001). We put higher confidence
    in the CWSY data because it is published by the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources
    and edited by water practitioners and researchers throughout China. As shown in
    Supplementary Fig. S1, the city-aggregated irrigated areas are very close to the
    CWSY statistics with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99. For provinces
    where inconsistencies exist, we adjusted the county-level irrigated area using
    Eq. (1). (1) where and are the adjusted irrigated area and the original irrigated
    area in county i of province j, respectively; and are the CWSY-reported irrigated
    area and the city-aggregated irrigated area of province j, respectively. County-level
    irrigated area statistics are available for>80 % of provinces in mainland China
    (Supplementary Fig. S2), and we totally have 3,652 mapping units with irrigated
    area statistics (Fig. 1b). Note that Xinjiang, Heilongjiang and Fujian provinces
    have some irrigated croplands managed by the Production and Construction Corps,
    which we merged into the cities where they are located by population size following
    the method of Zhu et al. (2014). 3.1.3. Auxiliary data Various auxiliary data
    were used in this study, including climatic and environmental variables, land
    use and land cover, and administrative boundaries. Climate data, including precipitation,
    temperature, pressure, wind speed and downward solar radiation, were extracted
    from the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (He and Yang, 2016, He et al., 2020).
    These data were used in conjunction with the MCD43A3 albedo product to estimate
    potential evapotranspiration (PET) using the Priestley-Taylor method (Priestley
    and Taylor, 1972), as well as the aridity index defined as the ratio of precipitation
    to PET. Environmental data include elevation, slope, soil type, and distance to
    water bodies. The elevation data was taken from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
    digital elevation model (i.e., SRTM DEM); and the slope map was generated from
    the SRTM DEM data using the slope function in ArcGIS software. Distance to water
    bodies was calculated from the spatial distribution data of water bodies, including
    rivers, lakes, reservoirs, canals, and ponds, using the Euclidean distance tool
    in ArcGIS software. The 2000 land use/cover (LULC) map with a spatial resolution
    of 30 m was sourced from the Land Use Status Remote Sensing Monitoring Database
    of China (Xu et al., 2018). The map includes six major LULC types, namely, cropland,
    forest, grassland, water body, urban land, and unused land. The spatial distribution
    and proportion of each land use/cover type at 250 m resolution was estimated from
    the original 30-m LULC map. All data used in this study were obtained partly from
    the National Tibetan Plateau (https://data.tpdc.ac.cn/zh-hans/) and partly from
    the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center (https://www.resdc.cn/Default.aspx).
    3.2. Threshold-based classification method Threshold-based classification is a
    simple yet robust, easy-to-implement approach for creating irrigation maps that
    assumes the existence of thresholds for certain indices that can differentiate
    between irrigated and rainfed cropland. These indices can be the annual peak vegetation
    index (Pervez and Brown, 2010), the irrigation potential index (Zhu et al., 2014),
    or the LSWI difference index (Xiang et al., 2020); and the thresholds can be calibrated
    based on irrigated area statistics, ground truth data, or experience from previous
    studies (Pervez and Brown, 2010, Shahriar Pervez et al., 2014, Meier et al., 2018).
    Here, following Pervez and Brown (2010), we classified irrigated and rainfed cropland
    using the thresholds of annual peak vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, and GI). Specifically,
    for each mapping unit of mainland China, we first sorted the annual peak vegetation
    indices of all croplands in descending order and estimated the cumulative irrigated
    area sequentially. The accumulated area was then compared with the statistical
    irrigated area; and the value of vegetation index for the grid where the cumulative
    irrigated area was close to the statistical data was determined as the threshold.
    We lastly classify the cropland into “irrigated” and “rainfed” by comparing annual
    peak vegetation index with the determined threshold, as in Eq. (2). (2) where
    PVI are the annual peak vegetation index of the crop grid i in the mapping unit
    j over mainland China. Classification results using NDVI, EVI and GI were referred
    to as NDVI-map, EVI-map, and GI-map, respectively, hereafter. The annual minimum,
    median, and range of NDVI, EVI, and GVI were also tested, but showed obviously
    lower performance than the annual peak values in mapping irrigated cropland. 3.3.
    Semiautomatic classification approach 3.3.1. Irrigation suitability analysis Irrigation
    suitability analysis has been widely used to assess potential land suitable for
    irrigation (Chen et al., 2010, Worqlul et al., 2015, Worqlul et al., 2017, Li
    and Chen, 2020), but has not received much attention in the irrigation mapping.
    In this study, we used the multi-indicator evaluation (MCE) technique to assess
    the irrigation suitability of croplands in mainland China. Our study considered
    elevation, slope, distance to water bodies (DistToWater), and drought index, as
    these natural and geographic conditions have proven to be important factors controlling
    the spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in China (Liu et al., 2022). Based
    on our experience and field work, as well as the findings of previous studies,
    we hypothesize that croplands with smaller DistToWater, lower elevation and slope,
    and higher aridity index have greater irrigation suitability and potential. It
    is easy to understand that the closer to water bodies, the greater the possibility
    of irrigation, since closer proximity to water bodies means easier access to irrigation
    water. Some previous studies have even selected the irrigation reference points
    by choosing croplands close to water bodies (Dong et al., 2009, Zhang et al.,
    2022). The higher the elevation, the more difficult it is to access water resources,
    leading to a lower likelihood of irrigation (Cuo et al., 2013). For example, in
    our field work, we found that in the high-elevation areas of the Loess Plateau,
    residents have access to domestic water only through deep wells, while crop growth
    is completely dependent on rainfall. Meanwhile, agricultural productivity is low
    at high altitudes in China due to lack of irrigation and higher transportation
    and labor costs (Li et al., 2015). In addition, it was found that paddy fields,
    which are usually equipped for irrigation, tend to be clustered in the lowlands
    of China compared to drylands (Liu et al., 2005). Areas with greater slopes have
    poor water holding capacity and are unfavorable for irrigation facilities (Akıncı
    et al., 2013, Worqlul et al., 2017, Mandal et al., 2018). Generally, areas with
    slopes exceeding 8 % are considered infeasible for any surface irrigation system
    (Shahriar Pervez et al., 2014, Ambika et al., 2016a). Therefore, it is widely
    believed that the gentler the slope, the more likely is the existence of irrigated
    cropland (Yin et al., 2020, Ishikawa and Yamazaki, 2021). Croplands with higher
    aridity indices (i.e., less precipitation but higher PET) are also more likely
    to be irrigated due to the greater demand for irrigation water (Xu et al., 2018,
    Yin et al., 2020). Elevation, slope, DistToWater, and aridity index were first
    reclassified into different suitability types, as shown in Supplementary Table
    S1. The elevations of the crop grids were reclassified into four types using the
    dividing points of 100, 300, 500 m above the lowest elevation of the mapping unit.
    There are also four suitability types for both Slope and DistToWater. The dividing
    points for slopes are 2 %, 4 %, and 8 %, while dividing points for DistToWater
    are 1,000, 10,000, and 20,000 m. Using the dividing points, aridity indices were
    reclassified into ten suitability types. Afterwards, the above reclassified factors
    were assigned with different suitability values, with higher values given to areas
    with lower elevation, smaller slope and DistToWater, and higher aridity index.
    Lastly, we estimated the overall irrigation suitability of the croplands by combining
    the suitability values of elevation, slope, DistToWater, and aridity index, as
    in Eq. (3). (3) where Si,j,k is the irrigation suitability for cropland i in mapping
    unit j of province k; w is the weight of the influencing factors; SElev, SSlope,
    SDW, and SArid are the suitability values of elevation, slope, DistToWater, and
    aridity index, respectively. The weight setting is critical for irrigation suability
    analysis. In this study, weights were set in each province using the trial-and-error
    method based on the irrigated cropland distribution in the intermediate maps (See
    next section). According to our field work and experience, appropriate weights
    should be given so that distribution of irrigated cropland have the following
    key characteristics: (i) irrigated croplands are mostly distributed near water
    bodies, at lower elevations, and on smaller slopes; (ii) irrigated croplands in
    plain areas are relatively evenly distributed; (iii) irrigated croplands are generally
    continuously distributed due to the influence of water facilities; and (iv) irrigated
    croplands in non-plain regions are mainly distributed in river valleys. 3.3.2.
    Generating training pool Inspired by the work of Xie et al. (2019), we designed
    a threshold-calibrated method to automatically generate the training pool (i.e.,
    potential training data) for each mapping unit of mainland China. We first proposed
    a new irrigation suitability-adjusted vegetation index (SVI)with the assumption
    that irrigated cropland is not only greener, but also more suitable for irrigation
    than rainfed cropland. The SVI is defined in Eq. (4). (4) where S is the irrigation
    suability; and PVI is the annual peak vegetation index. The suitability-adjusted
    NDVI, EVI and GI were named as SNDVI, SEVI and SGI. Three intermediate irrigation
    maps were then generated based on SNDVI, SEVI, and SGI using the threshold-based
    classification method (Section 3.2). Note that the annual peak NNDVI, NEVI, and
    NGI were used in North China plain, considering that crop gradient is not negligible,
    but the gradients in elevation, slope and aridity index are small and groundwater
    is widely used for irrigation. Furthermore, cropland is discontinuously distributed
    in many parts of mainland China, and many croplands are mixed with other land
    use/cover types within the 250-m grids. The PVI of the cropland-urban/water mixed
    grids would be underestimated compared to the pure cropland pixels, while the
    cropland-forest/grassland mixed grids would be overestimated. We recalculated
    the PVI for the mixed pixels with the cropland proportion less than 90 % from
    the nearest pure cropland pixel. In the case of few pure cropland pixels over
    mountainous areas, the PVI values of mixed pixels were adjusted by the proportion
    of croplands, considering that irrigation is more likely to occur on continuously
    distributed croplands. Lastly, the intermediate irrigation maps were overlaid,
    and pixels that were simultaneously identified as irrigated or rainfed cropland
    by these maps were used as the training pool for further classification. 3.3.3.
    Classification using random forest We used the Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001)
    to classify irrigated and rain-fed cropland using the random samples from the
    training pool. For each mapping unit of mainland China, we randomly sample 200
    rainfed cropland grids and 200 irrigated cropland grids following Xie et al. (2019)
    to balance the need for adequate samples and computational efficiency. The sample
    size was increased to 4,000 (i.e., 2,000 each for irrigated and rainfed cropland)
    for the mapping units only with city-level irrigated area statistics. Sensitive
    analyses indicated the use of different sets of training samples has minimal effect
    on the classification accuracy (Supplementary Fig. S3). We implemented the RF
    algorithm using the MATLAB TreeBagger function, and the hyperparameters (Table
    2) were determined through a trial-and-error procedure (Zhang et al., 2021). The
    selected predictors include vegetation indices (i.e., SEVI, NEVI, SNDVI, NNDVI,
    SGI and NGI), climatic variables (i.e., precipitation, temperature, wind speed,
    solar radiation, and aridity index), and environmental variables (i.e., latitude,
    longitude, crop intensity, elevation, DistToWater, slope, and soil type). The
    RF-based classification of irrigated and rainfed cropland was carried out separately
    in each mapping unit. After classification, we applied a spatial filter (i.e.,
    7 × 7 window) to remove isolated pixels (less than5% of the window area) and detect
    the missed irrigated croplands (>95 % of the window area), resulting in the final
    irrigated cropland map in mainland China with a spatial resolution of 250 m (i.e.,
    CIrrMap250). We also tested two additional commonly used machine learning algorithms
    (i.e., artificial neural network (Gardner and Dorling, 1998) and extreme learning
    machine (Huang et al., 2012)) for classification of irrigated and rainfed croplands,
    but they showed lower accuracy than RF (Supplementary Fig. S4). Table 2. Calibrated

    of variables randomly sampled at each decision split 7 3.4. Accuracy assessment
    The accuracy of CIrrMap250 were assessed from three different aspects. First,
    the spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in CIrrMap250 was compared with
    EVI-map, NDVI-map, and GI-map and four other existing maps including GMIA 2005
    (Siebert et al., 2005), GIAM2000 (Thenkabail et al., 2009), Zhu-map (Zhu et al.,
    2014), and Meier-map (Meier et al., 2018). The performance of these maps was evaluated
    by analyzing their ability in detecting intensively irrigated areas and large-scale
    irrigation districts of mainland China, as well as two field-surveyed irrigation
    districts. Second, we further conducted a point-scale evaluation of CIrrMap250
    and other irrigation maps using 686 reference points (Fig. 1). Most of the reference
    points (∼90 %) were sourced from Zhu et al. (2014), which were partly collected
    from the crop growth and soil moisture dataset provided by the China Meteorological
    Data Sharing Service System (https://data.cma.cn/) and partly obtained using Google
    Earth and irrigation information on large irrigated districts provided by the
    China Irrigation and Drainage Development Center (https://www.jsgg.com.cn/ciddc/Index.asp).
    The remaining 10 % of reference points were derived through our field work and
    visual interpretation of Google satellite maps. As listed in Table 3, the performance
    metrics including Kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, and producer’s accuracy
    were used for quantitative assessments. Finally, we compared the irrigated area
    statistics with the estimates from CIrrMap250, Zhu-map, GMIA2005, and Meier-map
    at different spatial scales. Table 3. Definitions of the performance metrics.

    4.1. Spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in CIrrMap250 Fig. 3 depicts the
    spatial distribution of irrigated and rainfed cropland in CIrrMap250. We can see
    that irrigated croplands are mainly distributed in the North China Plain and Northwest
    China. Meanwhile, many large-scale irrigation districts such as Hetao, Qingtongxia,
    Fenhe, Baojixia, Dujiangyan, Zhanghe, and Pishihang also have intensively irrigated
    croplands. At the provincial level, Shandong holds the largest irrigated area
    (4,940 Kha), followed by Henan (4,834 Kha), Hebei (4,566 Kha), Jiangsu (3,999
    Kha), Anhui (3,236 Kha), and Xinjiang (3,172 Kha). The provinces including Tibet,
    Qinghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hainan have relatively smaller areas
    of irrigated croplands than other provinces in mainland China. At the basin scale,
    the Yangtze River basin has the largest irrigated area (14,939 Kha), followed
    by the Huai River basin (10,622 Kha), Hai River basin (7,400 Kha). The Southwest
    River basin has the lowest irrigated cropland area among the nine river basins
    in mainland China. Download : Download high-res image (638KB) Download : Download

    in panels b and c, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour
    in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
    4.2. Comparison of irrigated cropland distribution Fig. 4 compares the distribution
    of irrigated croplands in different irrigation maps. Intensively irrigated areas
    such as the North China Plain, Northwest China, and large-scale irrigation districts
    are overall well captured by all the maps. The spatial pattern of irrigated croplands
    in EVI-map, NDVI-map, GI-map is similar to CIrrMap250 due to the consistent constraints
    of irrigated area statistics on the mapping results. However, a closer look reveals
    that the distribution of irrigated cropland in the EVI/NDVI/GI-map is more uniform
    and extensive in the southern and central regions of mainland China than in CIrrMap250.
    There are notable differences between CIrrMap250 and the four existing maps at
    both regional and local scales. Compared with other irrigation maps, irrigated
    cropland in Zhu-map is less distributed in central and southeastern Chongqing,
    northeastern Heilongjiang, and the Baojixia irrigation district, but more distributed
    in northern Hebei province. GIAM2000 has more irrigated areas in the North China
    Plain, Northeast China Plain, and Sichuan and Guangxi provinces, but obviously
    less irrigated area in provinces such as Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, and Guangdong.
    GAIM2005 does not provide much details on the distribution of irrigated cropland
    due to the coarse spatial resolution. Irrigated cropland in GAIM2005 appears to
    be more distributed in northeastern China, southern Sichuan Province, and northern
    Shaanxi than the other irrigation maps, but less distributed in Jiangxi, Jiangsu,
    Sichuan, and Hubei. Download : Download high-res image (636KB) Download : Download

    d, GI-map; e, Zhu-map; f, GIAM2000; g, GIMA2005; h, Meier-map. Inserted panels
    show the irrigated cropland distribution in two field-surveyed irrigation districts
    located in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, respectively. The two panels inserted
    in each subplot of Fig. 4 show the distribution of irrigated cropland in two field-surveyed
    irrigation districts, i.e., the Jinghe Irrigation District (upper panel) and the
    Xuhuiqu Irrigation District (lower panel). Both Jinghe and Xuhuiqu irrigation
    districts are located in river valleys where irrigated cropland is concentrated.
    CIrrMap250 captures well the concentration of irrigated cropland in these two
    irrigation districts. However, all other maps tend to underestimate irrigated
    cropland in the Jinghe and Xuhuiqu irrigation districts while overestimating irrigated
    cropland in the surrounding mountainous areas. The similar results can be extensively
    observed if we enlarge EVI-map, NDVI-map, GI-map, Zhu-map, GIAM2000, GMIA2005,
    and Meier-map. 4.3. Point-scale accuracy evaluation Fig. 5 summarizes the point-scale
    accuracy of the different irrigation maps. GAIM2005 is not evaluated here because
    of its coarse spatial resolution. We can see that CIrrMap250 attains a Kappa coefficient
    of 0.58 in mainland China, obviously higher than EVI-map (0.47), NDVI-map (0.44)
    and GI-map (0.46), as well as the other three existing maps (0.20 ∼ 0.28). The
    improvement in Kappa coefficient ranges from 23 % to about 2 times for CIrrMap250
    compared to other irrigation maps. The overall accuracy of CIrrMap250 is 0.79,
    while it ranges from 0.60 to 0.73 for the other maps. The overall accuracy of
    CIrrMap250 improves from 8 % to 32 % compared to other maps. The producer’s accuracy
    of irrigated samples is 0.75 in CIrrMap250, apparently higher than the other maps
    ranging from 0.40 to 0.64. The producer’s accuracy of non-irrigated samples in
    CIrrMap250 is higher than higher than that of Zhu-map and Meier-map, but lower
    than EVI-map, NDVI-map, GI-map, and GIAM2000. The overall accuracy of all maps
    tends to be lower in arid and semi-arid areas than in humid and semi-humid areas.
    This is because non-irrigated cropland is more difficult to identify in arid and
    semi-arid areas, as indicated by the lower producer’s accuracy of non-irrigation,
    although the contrary is the case for irrigated cropland. Regardless, the results
    indicate that CIrrMap250 has a higher accuracy than the other irrigation maps.

    accuracy (c, d) achieved by different irrigation maps. Results are shown for mainland
    China and its two subregions, i.e., the arid and semi-arid region (aridity index
    ≤ 0.5) and humid and semi-humid region (aridity index > 0.5). 4.4. Comparison
    of irrigated area estimates with statistics Fig. 6 compares the irrigated area
    estimates of CIrrMap250, Zhu-map, GMIA2005, and Meier-map with the statistical
    data for the 3,652 mapping units of mainland China. GIAM2000 is not analyzed here
    due to the lack of pixel-level irrigation percentages. The irrigated area of CIrrMap250
    shows a good agreement with the statistics, with the coefficient of determination
    (R2) of 0.99, mainly due to the usage of irrigated area statistics in the generation
    of the training pool. The irrigated area of Zhu-map matches well with the provincial
    statistics, but the agreement is relatively low at the mapping unit level. This
    is because less than 50 % of the provinces in Zhu-map includes county-level irrigated
    area statistics (Zhu et al., 2014). For example, as shown in Fig. 8b, the irrigated
    areas in two mapping units of Heilongjiang Province are clearly overestimated
    because only the total irrigated area statistics in that province were used in
    the mapping process. The estimated irrigated area from GMIA2005 is generally consistent
    with the statistics, as the statistics were also used to generate GMIA2005, although
    not in as much detail as the data in our study. Among the four irrigation maps,
    Meier-map has the lowest agreement between the irrigated area estimates and the
    statistics because it combined statistical irrigated area with other remote sensing-detected
    irrigated area during the mapping process (Meier et al., 2018). Download : Download

    cropland in different geographical feature ranges We further calculated the proportion
    of irrigated cropland for seven irrigation maps at different elevations, slopes,
    and distances from water bodies. The North China Plain was excluded from the analysis
    due to its small elevation and slope gradients and the relatively consistent pattern
    of irrigated cropland in these maps. As shown in Fig. 7, CIrrMap250 has>70 % of
    irrigated cropland that is distributed in areas with elevation less than 500 m,
    slope less than 4°, and distance less than 3,000 m from water bodies. In comparison
    to other maps, more irrigated cropland in CIrrMap250 is located at lower elevations,
    on smaller slopes, and closer to water bodies. This is easy to understand because
    we incorporated irrigation suitability estimates based on elevation, slope, distance
    to water bodies, and aridity index into the irrigation mapping framework. As described
    in Section 3.3.1, areas with low elevation, gentle slope, small distance to water
    bodies are more favorable for irrigation. From this perspective, the spatial distribution
    seems to be more reasonable in CIrrMap250 than in other maps. Nevertheless, China
    has quite specific agriculture (e.g., terraces and smallholder cropping systems)
    that requires reliable reference irrigation maps to robustly assess the above
    results, especially at the regional scale. The fact that the other maps have more
    irrigated cropland at higher elevations, larger slopes, and farther away from
    water bodies than CIrrMap250 can be explained by their neglect of the mixed grid
    effects. China has many scattered, small-scale croplands that are mixed with forests/grasslands
    in mountainous areas. Vegetation in mixed cropland-forest/grassland areas may
    be “greener” than croplands located in river valleys, and they can easily be detected
    as irrigated cropland if the vegetation index is mainly considered for extracting
    irrigated area, as illustrated by the two field-surveyed irrigated districts.

    Irrigation ratio estimates for different provinces based on cropland area from
    different sources. RS, NBAC, and MNRRPC denote remote sensing, National Bureau
    of Statistics of China, and Ministry of Natural Resources of the People''s Republic
    of China, respectively. Panels b and c show scatter plots of the cropland area
    estimated by RS versus the area reported by NBSC and MNRRPC, respectively. 5.2.
    Large uncertainty in irrigation ratio estimates The sources of cropland area in
    China can be divided into four categories, including remote sensing, the National
    Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC), the Ministry of Natural Resources of the
    People''s Republic of China (MNRPRC), and the National Land Survey. The National
    Land Survey of China was conducted three times in 1984–1987, 2007–2009, and 2017–2019;
    while no data was available around 2000. We estimated irrigation ratio, i.e.,
    the ratio of irrigated cropland area to total cropland area, for difference provinces
    in mainland China based on the cropland area from remote sensing (Xu et al., 2018),
    NBSC (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2001a), and MNRPRC (Ministry of
    Land and Resources of the People''s Republic of China, 2001). As shown in Fig.
    8, irrigation ratio varies significantly among the 31 provinces, with higher values
    in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Xinjiang, while lower values in Heilongjiang,
    Yunnan, and Guizhou. Irrigation ratio also exhibits a large difference for the
    same region. For instance, it ranges from 0.54 to 0.93 in Xinjiang using cropland
    area from different sources. Irrigation ratio estimates based on the remote sensing-estimated
    cropland area are lower than the estimates based on the NBSC-reported cropland
    area and MNRPRC-reported cropland area. This is because, as shown in Fig. 8, the
    cropland acreages reported by NBSC and MNRPRC are obviously smaller than those
    estimated by remote sensing, although they exhibit a higher correlation (R2 >
    0.85). In this study, it is challenging to assess which sources of cropland area
    are reliable. Nevertheless, previous study indicates that remote sensing tends
    to overestimate cropland area due to the widespread presence of non-cropland within
    the map grid and the classification accuracy problems (Guo, 2006). On the other
    hand, NBSC tends to underestimate the cropland area due to administrative and
    technical reasons (Xu et al., 2014). Overall, irrigation ratio estimates have
    large uncertainties due to the varying cropland area from multiple sources. 5.3.
    Limitations and prospects We admit that this study has some limitations and uncertainties
    that deserve further investigations in the future. To begin with, the proposed
    irrigation mapping method depends heavily on irrigated area statistics. Although
    the statistical irrigated areas were collected and reconstructed with an unprecedented
    level of detail in our study, they inevitably have some uncertainties and inconsistences
    (Ajaz et al., 2019). Furthermore, the statistics represent the effective irrigated
    area, i.e., the area equipped for irrigation, rather than the actual irrigated
    area, which may lead to biased results. In fact, the China Water Statistical Yearbook
    (CWSY) (China Ministry of Water Resources, 2001) have also reported the actual
    irrigated area at the provincial level, which is closely matched to the effective
    irrigated area with a coefficient of determination of 0.99 (Supplementary Fig.
    S5). However, actual irrigated area at the city/county level is not available,
    which limits its use to constrain the irrigated cropland distribution in spatial
    detail. We further conducted an experiment to assign the actual provincial irrigated
    area to the county level based on the statistical effective irrigated area and
    recreated the irrigated cropland map using the method proposed in this study.
    We found that the spatial pattern of irrigated croplands in the new map was very
    similar to CIrrMap250 (Supplementary Fig. S6), but showed no improvement in accuracy.
    Second, this study incorporates irrigation suitability into the irrigated cropland
    mapping framework, which greatly improves the performance of irrigation map. However,
    the irrigation suitability analysis is somewhat subjective due to the requirement
    of weight setting. If sufficient ground truth data are available in the future,
    they can be divided into two parts, one for automatic weight calibration and one
    for performance evaluation. Meanwhile, due to the large number of mapping units
    (>3500), the irrigation suitability analysis was performed only at the provincial
    level, which may affect the accuracy of the irrigation map, especially in provinces
    with high topographic and climatic gradients, such as Gansu and Heilongjiang provinces.
    In addition, terraces are widely distributed in China, accounting for 26 % of
    the country''s cropland area (Cao et al., 2021), and about 30 % of them are located
    in areas with slopes higher than 8° (Supplementary Fig. S7). There may be many
    irrigable terraces in high-slope areas, thus our assumption that gentle-slope
    cropland is more likely to be irrigated than steep-slope cropland may not hold
    true, adding some uncertainties to our results. Nevertheless, irrigation suitability
    is determined not only by slope but also by three other factors (i.e., elevation,
    DistToWater, and drought index), and meanwhile, for provinces with concentrated
    distribution of terraces, the weight of slope (less than0.16) was significantly
    lower than other factors in the irrigation suitability analysis, suggesting that
    our results may not be significantly influenced. Lastly, this study only mapped
    irrigated cropland in mainland China for a specific year (i.e., 2000) to verify
    the reliability of the newly proposed mapping method, as done in many other studies
    (Ozdogan and Gutman, 2008, Xiang et al., 2019, Xie et al., 2019, Zhu et al., 2021,
    Zhang et al., 2022). The number of reference points is relatively small and some
    of them may not be representative of the actual situation in 2000, which may bring
    uncertainty to our results. The lack of sufficient ground truth data would be
    addressed in the future by conducting more field work and by collaborating with
    more researchers in the field of irrigated cropland mapping and with the Ministry
    of Natural Resources of the People''s Republic of China (https://www.mnr.gov.cn/),
    which has much reliable survey data. In the next step, we will apply our new method
    to generate time-continuous maps of irrigated cropland from 2000 to the present
    and collect more reference points and survey data spanning multiple years to robustly
    evaluate the performance of our new mapping method and the accuracy of irrigation
    maps. 6. Conclusions This study proposed a novel approach to develop the first
    250-m irrigated cropland map in mainland China (CIrrMap250) for the year 2000
    by integrating remote sensing, irrigation suitability, and irrigated area statistics.
    The novelty of the new approach lies in the incorporation of irrigation suitability
    into the irrigation mapping process. The new method consists of three major steps,
    including irrigation suitability analysis, training pool generation based on suitability-adjusted
    vegetation indices and irrigated area statistics, and machine learning-based classification
    of irrigated and rainfed cropland. We evaluated the performance of CIrrMap250
    and compared it with three irrigation maps (i.e., EVI-map, NDVI-map, and GI-map)
    generated using the threshold-based classification method, as well as four other
    existing maps including GMIA2005 (Siebert et al., 2005), GIAM2000 (Thenkabail
    et al., 2009), Zhu-map (Zhu et al., 2014), and Meier-map (Meier et al., 2018).
    The accuracy of the irrigation maps was assessed from three different aspects,
    including the distribution of irrigated croplands, agreement with reference points,
    and consistency with irrigated area statistics. Results indicate that the irrigated
    croplands are mainly distributed in the North China Plain, Northwest China, and
    some large-scale irrigation districts. Shandong province holds the largest irrigated
    area, followed by Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Xinjiang, while at the basin
    scale, the Yangtze River basin has the largest irrigated area, followed by the
    Huai River basin, Hai River basin, and Yellow River basin. Intensively irrigated
    areas are overall well captured by CIrrMap250 and all the other maps. CIrrMap250
    has a similar irrigation distribution pattern to EVI-map, NDVI-map, due to the
    consistent constraints of irrigated area statistics on the mapping results. However,
    there are notable differences between CIrrMap250 and the four existing maps at
    both regional and local scales. All maps except CIrrMap250 tend to underestimate
    irrigated cropland in river valleys and overestimate irrigated cropland in the
    mountainous areas, as evidenced by the field-surveyed irrigation districts, mainly
    because of their neglect of the mixed grid effects. CIrrMap250 has a higher point-scale
    accuracy than the other maps. CIrrMap250 achieves an improvement in Kappa coefficient
    by 23 % to about 2 times and an improvement in overall accuracy by 8 % to 32 %,
    in comparison to other irrigation maps. Additionally, the irrigated area of CIrrMap250
    shows a good agreement with the statistics, mainly due to the utilization of irrigated
    area statistics in the generation of the training pool. The irrigation mapping
    method can be easily applied to other regions of the world, and the new irrigated
    cropland map has great potential to support agriculture, climate, and environment
    research as well as water resource management in mainland China. Nevertheless,
    we admit that this study has some limitations and uncertainties, such as the heavy
    dependence on irrigated area statistics and the subjectivity of irrigation suitability
    analysis, which deserve further investigations in the future. In the next step,
    we will attempt to generate time-continuous maps of irrigated cropland from 2000
    to the present and collect more reference points and survey data to robustly evaluate
    the performance of our new mapping method and the accuracy of irrigation maps.

    1 INTRODUCTION Water quality refers to physical, chemical, and biological characteristics
    of water bodies. Water quality is an important aspect of our ability to use rivers
    and streams for drinking water, healthy aquatic ecosystems, farmland irrigation,
    and other beneficial purposes. River water quality has been declining globally
    over the past century due to population growth and increasing urbanization, industrialization,
    and agriculture (Abbott et al., 2019). These stressors have led to salinization
    and alkalinization of rivers (Kaushal et al., 2013, 2021), nutrient runoff causing
    algal blooms and eutrophication (Hartmann et al., 2014; McDowell et al., 2020),
    and river contamination from persistent organic compounds, pesticides, and toxic
    metals (Schwarzenbach et al., 2010). Climate change and extreme events such as
    floods, droughts, and wildfires are projected to exacerbate problems of water
    quality by decreasing flows, changing biogeochemical cycles, and increasing contaminant
    concentrations (Lyubimova et al., 2016; Murdoch et al., 2000; Nilsson & Renofalt,
    2008; Whitehead et al., 2009). The deterioration of river water quality has direct
    consequences for aquatic and human health. The costs of watershed management to
    comply with water quality regulatory criteria are significant, even when the benefits
    are uncertain (Keiser et al., 2019). Thus, water resource managers rely on monitoring
    and simulations of hydrological processes to make optimal decisions, and are helped
    by models that account for complex biogeochemical processes and their climactic,
    hydrological and human drivers. Different classes of water quality models can
    be used for predictions depending on the relevant water quality variables, spatial
    scales (e.g., reach, watershed, regional), and complexity (Rode et al., 2010),
    some of which are described in recent reviews (Burigato Costa et al., 2019; Fu
    et al., 2020). High-fidelity mechanistic models can incorporate the tight coupling
    of physical and biogeochemical processes such as climatic variations, hydrologic
    fluxes, weathering, and biological interactions on solute transport and mixing
    at pore to sub-catchment scales. For example, integrated surface-subsurface hydrologic
    models (e.g., Amanzi/ATS) coupled with reactive transport models (RTMs) can attain
    spatially explicit representations of critical zone components, and provide accurate
    estimates of geochemical exports to rivers at reach to hillslope scales (Arora,
    Spycher, et al., 2016; Dwivedi et al., 2018; Steefel et al., 2015; Xu et al.,
    2021). Despite the demonstrated success of these models, they face important challenges
    at larger spatial domains in part due to the computational expense from having
    highly resolved spatial grids and complex biogeochemical processes needed to represent
    heterogeneous watershed characteristics influencing water quality (Steefel, 2019).
    Capabilities for upscaling current RTMs and representation of geochemistry in
    larger scales are in their early stages of development (Arora et al., 2015; Jan
    et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021). At watershed- to basin-scales, models such as
    the semi-empirical soil and water assessment tool (SWAT; Arnold et al., 1998)
    and hydrologic simulation program Fortran (e.g., HSPF; Bicknell et al., 1996)
    have been widely used for surface water quality modelling (Fu et al., 2019). The
    models contain elements called hydrologic response units (HRUs) that are non-continuous
    areas within a sub-basin grouped by similar properties such as land use, soil,
    or topography based on user-defined thresholds (Chen, Xu, et al., 2019; Her et
    al., 2015). This discretization approach makes the models computationally efficient
    but introduces limitations such as the lack of hydrologic connectivity between
    the HRUs and sensitivity of the models to the HRU definitions, although some of
    these limitations are addressed in newer versions of the code (e.g., SWAT+; Bieger
    et al., 2017; Her et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2019). The models also require watershed-specific
    calibration and validation, and the parameters can have substantial uncertainties
    due to equifinal solutions (Van Liew et al., 2003; White & Chaubey, 2007; Xie
    & Lian, 2013). Most regional- to continental- scale process-based models that
    do capture geochemistry (e.g., WITCH; Roelandt et al., 2010) are zero-dimensional
    box-models, which are not adequate for representing complex flow and chemical
    transport dynamics (Li et al., 2017). Process-based models have been used to predict
    physical variables such as stream temperature (e.g., MOSART-heat, PRMS-SNTemp,
    VIC-RBM; Li et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2017; van Vliet et al., 2012) at these
    spatial scales by incorporating thermodynamics and energy balance into terrestrial
    hydrology models. Alternatively, statistical models are also used for regional-
    to continental-scale predictions of water quality, although these have other significant
    limitations. For example, the SPARROW model (Schwarz et al., 2006) has been widely
    used for spatial water quality predictions at regional scales in the United States
    (U.S.) but assumes long-term steady-state behaviour, and efforts to incorporate
    temporal dynamics are nascent (Chanat & Yang, 2018). Multi-linear regression and
    auto-regressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) are commonly used methods for
    temporal predictions of water quality variables but have limited applicability
    in complex systems with non-linear and non-stationary processes (Chen et al.,
    2020). Apart from predictions, numerous studies have used statistical regression
    to analyse water quality trends and attribute drivers at local to continental
    scales (e.g., Guo et al., 2019; Kaushal et al., 2018; Monteith et al., 2007; Murphy,
    2020; Murphy & Sprague, 2019). Generalized additive models that extend linear
    models are another statistical approach used to determine water quality trends
    (e.g., Morton & Henderson, 2008; Yang & Moyer, 2020) and can be adapted to large
    datasets (Wood et al., 2015). Another common statistical technique is correlation
    analysis between riverine chemical concentrations and discharge (typically referred
    to as C-Q relationships), which has been used for a variety of purposes such as
    examining constituent dynamics at short and long time-scales (e.g., Arora et al.,
    2020; Evans & Davies, 1998; Godsey et al., 2009; Moatar et al., 2017; Musolff
    et al., 2021), identifying sources and pathways of different solutes (see Musolff
    et al., 2021 and references therein), and analysing water quality monitoring data
    for watershed management (Bieroza et al., 2018; Pohle et al., 2021; Westphal et
    al., 2020). However, complex C-Q patterns, such as those resulting from variable
    lags between the hydrograph and chemograph, are difficult to interpret and attempts
    to link insights gained from C-Q analysis to models have been limited (Liu, Birgand,
    et al., 2021). Other statistical approaches such as Bayesian hierarchical models
    (Guo et al., 2019; Rode et al., 2010), wavelets (Arora, Dwivedi, et al., 2016;
    Parmar & Bhardwaj, 2013), and principal component analysis and non-negative matrix
    factorization (Liu, Zhang, et al., 2021; Shaughnessy et al., 2021) are used to
    identify key catchment attributes, sources, and ecosystem control points (Bernhardt
    et al., 2017) that influence stream water chemistry. Despite the variety of statistical
    and modelling approaches available, it is still challenging to make accurate and
    timely water quality predictions, particularly at large spatial scales, due to
    the variability of water quality with space, time, and disturbance (natural or
    human), and the effect of local characteristics and complex processes on solute
    transport. There is consensus that water quality modelling has plateaued, with
    recent studies focusing on incremental improvements to existing models and case
    study demonstrations for individual basins rather than transformational advances
    that address the challenges involved (Fu et al., 2020). The field is fragmented,
    with the choice of model varying substantially depending on the spatial scale
    and parameters being modelled, as well as access to computation and modelling
    expertise (Fu et al., 2020), limiting our ability to make decision-relevant predictions.
    Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) spurred
    by the increasing availability of public datasets, development of software frameworks,
    and cloud computing resources have the potential to stimulate a new class of water
    quality models that can be run at decision-relevant scales, resolutions, and lead
    times. Artificial intelligence encompasses technologies that can understand inputs
    from the environment, reason and take actions to meet a performance objective,
    while ML (the focus of this paper) is a subset of AI that focuses on learning
    patterns from complex data (Russell & Norvig, 2020). Thus ML is useful for problems
    that require predictions, deriving insights from data, and decision making (Jordan
    & Mitchell, 2015). ML applications for geosciences broadly span modelling, automation
    tasks and data-driven discovery, and include approaches such as classification,
    spatial or temporal regression, and anomaly detection (Bergen et al., 2019; Reichstein
    et al., 2019). ML methods include supervised learning, wherein known observations
    are used to train a model to learn patterns or make predictions on a target variable;
    unsupervised learning, wherein the algorithm learns patterns or structures in
    the data heuristically without apriori knowledge of the target; and reinforcement
    learning, wherein the model learns to make decisions under uncertainty through
    trial and error interactions with its environment to maximize a reward (see Shen,
    2018; Bergen et al., 2019; Xu & Liang, 2021 and references therein for an overview
    of ML in hydrology and geosciences). Traditional ML methods (also referred to
    as classical or conventional ML) include support vector machines (SVM), decision
    trees such as random forests (RF) and gradient boosted trees, and simple artificial
    neural networks (ANN; e.g., feed forward ANN, extreme learning machines, multi-layer
    perceptron). Deep learning (DL) models are neural networks (NN) with multiple
    processing layers that make it possible to learn complex patterns from large datasets
    and have high predictive skill. Common DL architectures include the convolutional
    neural network (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN) of which the long short
    term memory (LSTM) network is a popular choice, deep belief networks (DBN) that
    are composed of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), and sparse autoencoders (LeCun
    et al., 2015; Shen, 2018; Shrestha & Mahmood, 2019). In this paper, we use the
    term “machine learning” to refer to both traditional ML and DL models. Over the
    past decade, there has been a large increase in the use of ML for hydrological
    predictions (Xu & Liang, 2021) to the point where its adoption in future physical
    hydrology models seems inevitable (Nearing, Kratzert, et al., 2021). A wide variety
    of ML approaches have been explored for water quality modelling in rivers across
    the world, and collectively indicate their potential to extract scientific knowledge
    and enable optimal management of water quality (Section 2). Yet the rapidly increasing
    use of ML raises several questions. First, given the diversity of modelling approaches,
    what are the situations where ML can add value and what are its limitations? What
    are the primary considerations for model and feature selection? How do we compare
    performance and evaluate whether models have been constructed and parameterized
    appropriately? How can ML approaches complement process-based models to improve
    our prediction capabilities? And most importantly, how can we trust and use models
    that make predictions based on machine-derived information that is beyond human
    comprehension? In this paper, we discuss the potential for using ML in water quality
    modelling for decision-relevant predictions. We first provide a brief review of
    ML methods used for several water quality applications that demonstrate its value
    for modelling and knowledge discovery (Section 2). We then present opportunities
    for advancement of ML model architectures, transferability, and interpretability,
    which includes the integration of process knowledge into model design (Section
    3). We finally present considerations for the choice of model based on the scale
    and complexity of the problem being addressed, and availability of data and computational
    power (Section 12). We posit that the time is ripe for judiciously incorporating
    ML into riverine water quality models for the purposes of improving predictive
    capabilities and deciphering the complex, diverse human-natural processes that
    affect water quality. Throughout, we use the term “models” to refer to codes that
    both generate predictions and analyse data to extract information. 2 STATE-OF-THE-ART
    MACHINE LEARNING IN RIVER WATER QUALITY MODELS Machine learning models have been
    used for predictions of many water quality variables using various approaches
    from simple models to hybrid methods combining ML with process-based models (Table
    1). Stream temperature is a widely measured physical water quality variable and
    has been successfully predicted using different ML methods. For example, classical
    ML methods have been used for monthly to daily predictions of stream temperatures
    in catchments with different characteristics, and include support vector regression
    (SVR; Rehana, 2019; Weierbach et al., 2022); decision tree-based regression models
    such as RF, XGBoost, and their variations (Feigl et al., 2021; Lu & Ma, 2020;
    Weierbach et al., 2022); and simple ANNs (Feigl et al., 2021; Zhu & Piotrowski,
    2020). Among DL models, the LSTM deep neural network has become an increasingly
    popular choice for regional-scale hydrological predictions due to its ability
    to encode prior system states in the cell memory (e.g., Kratzert et al., 2018).
    For example, Rahmani, Lawson, et al. (2021) originally used an LSTM network to
    predict daily stream temperatures for 118 pristine catchments in the continental
    U.S. and in a subsequent study extended the LSTM approach to make predictions
    in data-sparse, unmonitored and dammed catchments (Rahmani, Shen, et al., 2021).
    Approaches that combine process-based models with DL have also been used for basin-scale
    stream temperature predictions, particularly in regions with sparse data (e.g.,
    Jia, Zwart et al., 2021, Section 4). In all cases, the ML approaches were able
    to improve prediction accuracies compared to base statistical and process-based
    models. TABLE 1. Examples of water quality applications where machine learning

    models (Forio et al., 2015; Mount & Stott, 2008; Phan et al., 2019) Note: See
    references for further details on techniques used for specific water quality variables.
    ML models have also been used for predictions of other water quality variables
    and indices such as dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity, total dissolved
    solids (TDS), pH, nutrients, suspended sediments and turbidity, cations, anions,
    biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and chlorophyll.
    Recent reviews identify popular classical ML methods for time-series predictions
    including ANN, decision trees, SVM, genetic programming (GP), fuzzy logic, and
    hybrid approaches such as genetic algorithm-NN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
    systems, and wavelet-NN (Chen et al., 2020; Khullar & Singh, 2020; Rajaee et al.,
    2020). Hybrid models with ensembles of standalone ML models using methods such
    as bagging and random subspace (Melesse et al., 2020) or combining ML with process-based
    models (Hunter et al., 2018) have been used to predict salinity at river basin-
    to reach-scales in Iran and Australia. Examples of recent efforts to incorporate
    DL approaches for these predictions include the use of an LSTM to predict DO concentrations
    in 506 pristine U.S. catchments achieving moderate accuracy (Zhi et al., 2021),
    and an LSTM paired with a CNN (that generated streamflow estimates) to predict
    total nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon in a major Korean river basin (Baek
    et al., 2020). LSTM, RF, and hybrid ML models have also been used for short-term
    predictions of a suite of water quality variables (e.g., DO, pH, conductivity,
    turbidity, nutrients, water quality indices) with high-frequency monitoring; in
    some cases classical ML surrogate models are used as soft sensors to make predictions
    of variables that are difficult or laborious to measure directly such as those
    that require laboratory sample analysis (Bui et al., 2020; Green et al., 2021;
    Harrison et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019; Lu & Ma, 2020; Paepae et al., 2021).
    In addition to predictions, ML approaches are used to discover understanding about
    the dynamics of water quality and underlying sources, drivers, and mechanisms.
    A common use of ML is to detect events of interest from high-frequency data obtained
    from sensor networks. For example, insights into episodic sediment dynamics from
    hundreds of storm events were derived using RBMs and CNNs to automate analysis
    of C-Q plots (Hamshaw et al., 2018, 2019). Classification and clustering pattern
    recognition techniques have been used to identify similarities between monitoring
    stations (Lee et al., 2020), hydrological events (Javed et al., 2021), and contaminant
    sources (Vesselinov et al., 2018). Classical ML methods such as decision tress,
    NN, and self-organizing maps have been used to identify landscape attributes and
    human factors that affect stream water quality (Álvarez-Cabria et al., 2016; Mirzaei
    et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), and characterize relevant processes such as
    cation weathering rates (Povak et al., 2014). Another application area is the
    use of ML for analysis and estimation of inland water quality parameters obtained
    from remote sensing imagery. The estimates are most commonly derived using classical
    ML approaches, but are limited to larger rivers and a few variables due to the
    spatial resolution of land surface sensors (~10–30 m), and broad spectral bands
    (Hassan & Woo, 2021; Hestir et al., 2015; Topp et al., 2020). Peterson et al.
    (2020) demonstrated that a progressively deep NN model outperformed SVR, extreme
    learning machine, and multi-linear regression in estimating water quality parameters
    such as blue-green algae, chlorophyll-a, fluorescent dissolved organic matter
    (FDOM), DO, conductance, and turbidity in the Upper Mississippi River using data
    from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. A harmful algal bloom (HAB) detection system HABNet
    (Hill et al., 2020) for coastal waters used a CNN combined with an LSTM, SVM,
    or RF applied on data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    data. Remote sensing datasets relevant to river water quality are likely to grow
    in the future with newer high-resolution satellites, instruments with hyperspectral
    bands, and increasing use of unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV) to acquire water
    quality data (Sibanda et al., 2021; Topp et al., 2020), and can potentially address
    data gaps for water quality ML (Section 15). Finally, probabilistic graph models
    such as Bayesian networks have been used extensively for decision support in water
    management (Phan et al., 2019). Bayesian networks can integrate both quantitative
    data (e.g., time-series of measured concentrations and discharge), and qualitative
    data (e.g., expert knowledge and stakeholder beliefs), and can generate probabilistic
    predictions for different management and climate scenarios. For example, Bayesian
    networks were used to design rules for trading transferable pollutant discharge
    permits in rivers (Mesbah et al., 2009), for real-time monitoring and contaminant
    warning systems (Murray et al., 2012), and to predict water quality in different
    types of catchments (Forio et al., 2015; Mount & Stott, 2008). These examples
    illustrate the value of using ML for a variety of global river water quality modelling
    and monitoring applications. The use of DL and hybrid models combining ML and
    process-based codes is still nascent and is expected to grow in the near future.
    In the next two sections, we describe how the appropriate use of ML for different
    water quality applications can best incorporate recent computational and mathematical
    developments due to the large number of variables of interest, heterogeneity of
    human and natural processes that influence water quality, and scarcity of available
    data. 3 OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT OF WATER QUALITY ML ML methods have advanced
    rapidly over the past decade, and diverse approaches can be used to improve model
    performance, efficiency, and robustness. Here we highlight particularly promising
    techniques, many of which have been used in hydrological applications, to address
    questions raised in Section 1 related to the use of ML for water quality modelling
    (also see Varadharajan et al., 2021). 3.1 How do we select and design optimal
    model architectures? ML model selection and architectures (e.g., number of layers,
    batch size, nodes for neural networks) can affect model performance and computational
    costs. The choice of the best performing model (ML, statistical, or process-based)
    will depend on the metrics considered including model accuracy, variance, robustness,
    bias, and computational speed (Belitz & Stackelberg, 2021; Kratzert, Klotz, Shalev,
    et al., 2019). A common approach for model selection in many of the studies cited
    above (Section 2) is to train different model types, and choose the model with
    the greatest predictive skill. Another approach to model selection is to not choose,
    i.e., to create model ensembles that exploit the diversity of predictive skill
    from different models. Model ensemble approaches are common in hydrology (Fleming
    et al., 2021). Specifically, ML ensembles have shown promise in improving predictions
    (e.g., flood forecasting), quantifying uncertainty (Fleming et al., 2015; Jiang
    et al., 2014; Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2021), and are now being incorporated into
    operational models (Fleming et al., 2015, 2021). Ensembles can be formulated in
    many ways, from traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, dagging, model
    averaging, and stacking to more sophisticated combinations such as running simulations
    on different classes of models or pre-training ML models on different process
    models (e.g., Section 13). Ensemble combinations of multiple models can be even
    more beneficial when the errors of individuals models are not correlated (Hsieh,
    2009). Besides model selection, other important choices in the application of
    ML are selection of optimal input features, model training, and architecture design.
    In regression and classification, a best practice is to use k-fold cross-validation
    that partitions available data into k-sets and iteratively trains the model using
    data from each set for testing, which leads to better model generalizability (Bergmeir
    & Benítez, 2012). Common pitfalls in model design are including excess irrelevant
    or redundant variables as inputs, variable selection bias (i.e., using the same
    data for training and inputs), resubstitution validation (i.e., testing the model
    with training data), use of inconsistent cross-validation and resampling procedures
    across model architectures being implemented, and data leakage (e.g., using testing
    data for model training or hyperparameter optimization, or pre-processing the
    entire dataset prior to splitting the data into cross-validation folds), which
    can lead to overfitting (Gharib & Davies, 2021; Zhang, 2007). These pitfalls can
    be avoided by understanding the details and limitations of the models being implemented,
    following best practices, and using robust ML workflows (Gharib & Davies, 2021;
    Zhang, 2007). Different hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods have been developed
    to find the best-performing ML model architectures (Yu & Zhu, 2020). In many applications
    such as those cited above, the hyperparameters are either not chosen (i.e., default
    hyperparameters selected), hand-tuned (trial and error of different architectures),
    or selected using a grid or random search approach (Bergstra et al., 2011). In
    a few models (e.g., RF), default hyperparameters can work well (Probst et al.,
    2019); however, in general HPO is expected to improve model performance. Although
    random search has been shown to outperform grid search (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012),
    both approaches require a time-consuming approach of training each architecture,
    which can be computationally expensive, result in inferior performance, and limit
    the number of architectures that can realistically be explored. Instead, efficient
    solution methods using Bayesian optimization methods such as the Tree-of-Parzen-Estimators
    in the Python package Hyperopt can be applied (Bergstra et al., 2013). Müller
    et al. (2020) demonstrate another derivative-free Bayesian optimization method
    using surrogate models, such as Gaussian process or radial basis functions, to
    map the architecture search space to its performance and allows efficient exploration
    of the space by adaptive sampling approaches. Near-optimal hyperparameters for
    different NN including DL architectures can be found with relatively few evaluations
    using this approach (e.g., Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Bayesian optimization approaches using surrogate models such as Gaussian process
    and radial basis functions enable faster convergence to the optimal set of hyperparameters
    for deep learning models used to predict groundwater levels (figure modified from
    Müller et al., 2020) Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks that use concepts
    of ensembles and automatic HPO are emerging as a promising approach for reducing
    the barrier to adoption of ML, and have shown improvements in the efficiency and
    robustness of ML algorithms (Feurer et al., 2015; Hutter et al., 2019). A forward-looking
    automated ML approach for model design is “neural architecture search” (Ren et
    al., 2021) where algorithms automatically design model architecture. This approach
    has been successfully applied to algal classification using CNNs (Park et al.,
    2019) and spatiotemporal predictions (Li et al., 2020), and is even being considered
    for physics-based learning models (Ba et al., 2019). 3.2 How do we incorporate
    scientific knowledge into ML models? Traditional ML models can produce physically
    inconsistent results (Karpatne et al., 2017; Kashinath et al., 2021) as they only
    look for statistical relationships in the training data and are unable to extrapolate
    outside of the training dataset used for building the ML model. The sparseness
    of water quality and related environmental datasets, and projected changes in
    climate and land use make it challenging to use ML models per se for predictions
    in unmonitored regions or for long-term projections because they can only be trained,
    validated, and evaluated on past data (Duan et al., 2020; Kratzert, Klotz, Brandstetter,
    et al., 2019; Xu & Liang, 2021). The scientific community has been converging
    on the use of knowledge-guided ML (KGML; see Figure 2 as an example) to make physically
    consistent and generalizable predictions (including out-of-bounds estimates) and
    decrease training times (Kashinath et al., 2021). KGML approaches have been used
    to incorporate scientific knowledge into ML model training and predictions in
    several ways (Willard et al., 2022) that include (i) modification of loss functions
    to penalize the model when violating known physical laws and relationships (Jia
    et al., 2019; Karpatne et al., 2018), (ii) training or pre-training ML models
    on process-based model output (Konapala et al., 2020; Read et al., 2017), (iii)
    incorporating differential equations in ML models (Chen, Rubanova, et al., 2019;
    He et al., 2020; Rackauckas et al., 2020), (iv) multi-task learning for multi-objective
    optimization (Sadler et al., 2022), (v) modifying ML model architecture to impose
    symmetry or better represent the system being modelled (Daw et al., 2020; Khandelwal
    et al., 2020; Kunin et al., 2021; Ling et al., 2016), and (vi) most commonly surrogate
    (or reduced-order) models that emulate process model behaviour with considerably
    less computational expense (Xu & Liang, 2021). Hybrid KGML methods have also been
    used for hypothesis generation and establishing causal relationships between system
    drivers and responses (Tsai et al., 2020). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Overview of knowledge-guided machine learning (ML) approaches incorporating physical
    constraints into the loss function of a long-short term memory (LSTM) network
    used to model stream temperatures. The loss function penalizes the ML model for
    errors in predicting stream temperature (yPRED = model-predicted stream temperature;
    yTRUE = observed stream temperature) and stream thermal energy (U), the latter
    of which cannot be created or destroyed from one time step to the next according
    to thermodynamics. Energy fluxes can be transformed or transported into (fin)
    or out of (Fout) the stream system according to equations in the process-based
    model. R(W) represents a standard complexity regularization on the model parameters
    weighted by λ, and LossPHY aims to ensure consistency with physics by balancing
    the energy fluxes and is weighted by γ. Figure modified from Willard et al. (2022)
    and https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/diagram-channel-cross-section-subsections
    Numerous combinations of LSTM models and their variants with different process
    models have been shown to improve predictive performance for streamflow and river
    and lake water quality including out-of-bounds predictions in comparison to base
    process or LSTM models (Frame et al., 2021; Hanson et al., 2020; Jia, Zwart, et
    al., 2021; Konapala et al., 2020; Read et al., 2017). For example, Jia et al.
    (2021) used a modified graph-based LSTM that included representations of the river
    network hydrography, pre-trained with output from a process-based model PRMS-SNTemp
    (Sanders et al., 2017) to predict daily stream temperatures across the Delaware
    River Basin. This study demonstrated that the hybrid model was able to outperform
    base LSTM models in terms of prediction accuracies and the ability to extrapolate
    when data were sparse (Figure 3). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a)
    Comparison of pure machine learning (ML) approaches using artificial neural networks
    (ANN) to various process inclusions (time and space awareness, pre-training with
    a process model) for predicting stream temperature in the Delaware River basin
    (data from Jia et al., 2021). The error bars in panel a represent the standard
    deviation of test root mean squared error (RMSE) across five model runs. Panel
    (b) shows model performance comparison between a neural network with time awareness
    (i.e., long short-term memory network; long short term memory (LSTM); left) and
    a hybrid graph neural network (recurrent graph convolutional network; RGCN; right)
    with time and space awareness in addition to being pre-trained with a process
    model. Models shown in panel (b) were trained using 0.1% of available data during
    the training period and only segments with more than five observations during
    the test period are shown (data from Jia et al., 2021) Other KGML approaches include
    variations of GP, a supervised ML technique that mimics biological evolution.
    The advantages of GP include its ability to produce explicit mathematical relationships
    between input and output variables, add constraints based on physical realistic
    possibilities, and generate interpretable results. Genetic programming has been
    used extensively in hydrology to build interpretable rainfall-runoff, groundwater,
    and water quality models; estimate evapotranspiration; and extract information
    about reservoir operations (Danandeh Mehr et al., 2018; Fallah-Mehdipour & Haddad,
    2015; Herath et al., 2021). KGML versions of GP models include a tree-adjoining
    grammer (TAG) formalism for representing dynamic processes that has been demonstrated
    for predictions of phytoplankton biomass in rivers (Park et al., 2021). 3.3 How
    can ML be used to make generalizable predictions with sparse data? Water quality
    data tend to be sparse (Section 15), and there is a need to transfer models from
    data-rich, small-scale monitored sites to other regions in a manner that accounts
    for the spatial heterogeneity of watershed characteristics. Recent studies have
    demonstrated the use of LSTM and ensemble XGBoost models for predictions of streamflow
    and stream temperature in unmonitored basins (Kratzert, Klotz, Herrnegger, et
    al., 2019; Rahmani, Shen, et al., 2021). Another ML approach to generalize models
    is Transfer Learning (Weiss et al., 2016), which translates models built on highly
    observed locations to other sites that are data-sparse or unmonitored, although
    the challenge lies in choosing which models to transfer to a given site. Recently,
    meta transfer learning (MTL) has been proposed as a means to address this problem,
    wherein multiple base models (ML or site-specific process model) can be trained
    or calibrated for different tasks such as prediction at a given location, and
    then a meta-learning model (de Oliviera, 2019; Vanschoren, 2019) predicts which
    base model to transfer based on past performance metrics and location-specific
    attributes (Willard, Read, et al., 2020). For example, Willard, Read et al. (2020)
    used MTL for predictions of lake temperature in 305 artificially defined “unmonitored”
    lakes (targets) by transferring process-based and hybrid KGML models calibrated
    for 145 data-rich lakes (sources) using past performance metrics of the source
    models along with features such as lake attributes (e.g., surface area, maximum
    depth), meteorological statistics, and source lake temperature statistics. MTL
    flexibly allows the use of any type of model built on well-observed locations
    making it a noteworthy candidate for increased regional scaling. 3.4 Can ML methods
    be adapted to predict extreme values? Typical ML methods have inbuilt assumptions
    (e.g., the random variables follow a Gaussian distribution), which can lead to
    poor estimates when they do not apply for some datasets. In particular, the choice
    of a loss functions can directly affect the results (Bishop, 2006). For example,
    a squared loss (L2 norm) is more sensitive to outliers than absolute value loss
    (L1 norm; Breiman & Friedman, 1985; Hastie et al., 2009; Zhang, 2007). When outliers
    are equally important as in the case of extreme events, it is not uncommon to
    utilize the probability distribution within the loss function (Cawley et al.,
    2007; Hsieh, 2009) or choose alternate loss functions such as the relative entropy
    loss that computes the distance between two distributions (Qi & Majda, 2020).
    Many studies in hydrology have attempted to improve predictions of extremes such
    as floods (Mosavi et al., 2018) using multiple techniques that include using different
    criteria for model selection (Coulibaly et al., 2001), conditional density estimation
    networks (Cannon, 2012), training exclusively on extreme events such as historical
    high-flow data (Fleming et al., 2015), adjustment of ML prediction bias to improve
    performance on the tails of the distribution (Belitz & Stackelberg, 2021), and
    using KGML models, for example by training an ML model on simulation data containing
    extremes that might not exist in the observation data (Read et al., 2017; Xie
    et al., 2021). However, in some cases KGML models may perform worse than traditional
    DL models; for example, Frame et al. (2021) found that an LSTM constrained to
    conserve mass was not able to predict peak flows as well as the base LSTM, although
    both models had lower errors than the process-based model used for comparison.
    Although these examples show the potential for using ML for predictions of extreme
    values, data scarcity for rare events warrants consideration in model choice and
    design, and alternate ML methods may need to be used (or modified) to handle extreme
    values (Cannon, 2010). 3.5 How do we represent complex, hierarchical data in ML
    models? The heterogeneity and multi-scale nature of water quality processes and
    their drivers requires representation of high-dimensional complex data in ML models,
    but this can be challenging to do in a computationally tractable manner. One approach
    that has been used is to modify ML models to embed complex spatial information
    for time-series predictions. For example, Kratzert et al., (2019) developed an
    entity aware-LSTM to include information on static catchment attributes into the
    input gate of an LSTM to improve streamflow predictions across 531 pristine basins.
    Jia et al. (2021) used a recurrent graph convolution network to include spatial
    information on river segments into the predictions, and in a subsequent study
    developed a real-time active learning approach that used spatial and temporal
    information to select representative samples for optimizing model training (Jia,
    Lin, et al., 2021). Creating advanced multi-scale graph-based data representations
    that represent river network structure and carry a diverse set of node and edge
    attributes can enable embedding multimodal, multi-scale, and multi-temporal information,
    and correlate structures across different scales and time-steps. Probabilistic
    graph models (PGMs), which are data structures for encoding probability distributions,
    can also be used to include such structural information (Koller & Friedman, 2009).
    In a PGM, the nodes of the graph represent random variables, and the edges represent
    dependencies between variables. An optimization process using a PGM involves defining
    an energy function, which can embed contextual information about the data, i.e.,
    relationships among data points at different resolutions, scales, or time steps
    (prior knowledge). PGMs can be optimized by targeting the maximization of the
    joint probability (or the minimization of the energy function) of the graph (Laude
    et al., 2018), which would result in specific river network predictions. Although
    classes of PGMs (e.g., Bayesian network models) have been used for water quality
    applications (Section 2), newer models that integrate PGM with DL such as DBN
    have been used for water quality predictions (Solanki et al., 2015; Yan et al.,
    2020). 3.6 How do we build trustworthy and interpretable ML models? Domain experts
    often are hesitant to replace process-based models with ML on the grounds that
    the explainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness of ML frameworks are
    questionable even if predictions are more accurate (Rudin, 2019). Model transparency
    and interpretability is especially important for water management decisions that
    have important societal implications and that have to consider future unknown
    scenarios. Recent advances in explainable AI such as local interpretable model-agnostic
    explanation (LIME; Ribeiro et al., 2016) or Shapley additive explanations based
    on occlusion analysis (SHAP; Lundberg & Lee, 2017) can explain individual predictions
    by many ML models (Samek et al., 2021). Both methods have been successfully implemented
    for explaining predictions in rainfall-runoff modelling (Althoff et al., 2021;
    Yang & Chui, 2021), and are applicable for water quality applications as well
    (Wang et al., 2021). Also in the rainfall-runoff domain, Kratzert et al. (2019)
    used integrated gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017) to confirm a theory-consistent
    influence of precipitation and air temperature on a NN state that correlated with
    snow water equivalent, building trust in the ability of such models to capture
    known physical processes. More recent work on the same subject used probes (e.g.,
    linear regression models or stacked multi-layer perceptrons) to connect LSTM cell
    states to the output for tracking the evolution of the LSTM during the training
    process and verifying whether the LSTM learned physically realistic mappings from
    inputs to outputs (Lees et al., 2021). Causal inference is another approach to
    extract information on complex water quality processes and infer the effect of
    one variable on other system responses (Pearl, 2009; Sugihara et al., 2012). Causal
    inference methods can be grouped into three categories: (1) algorithms based on
    conditional independence constraints such as Granger causality (Granger, 1969),
    transfer entropy (Schreiber, 2000), PC algorithm (Spirtes & Glymour, 1991), fast
    causal inference (FCI; Spirtes et al., 2001), PC mutual condition information
    (PCMCI; Runge et al., 2019), (2) methods based on time-delay embedding and chaos
    theories such as convergent cross mapping (CCM) (Hannart et al., 2016; Sugihara
    et al., 2012), and (3) approaches based on counterfactual causal theory and structural
    causal models (Hoyer et al., 2009; Pearl, 2009; Peters et al., 2017). These methods
    have been adopted in climate and hydrologic sciences (Arora et al., 2019; Hannart
    et al., 2016; Ombadi et al., 2020; Runge et al., 2019) to extract relationships
    among system variables and disentangle governing parameters to inform process-based
    or ML models (e.g., Figure 4). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Graphical
    illustration of the use of causal inference methods (highlighted in boxes) for
    hydrological applications: (a) conceptual understanding of a physical system (i.e.,
    rainfall-runoff process; hydrologic bucket model), (b) observational time series
    of the four system variables in panel a, (c) a broad class of causal inference
    algorithms are based on conditional independence constraints such as Granger (Granger,
    1969), transfer entropy (Schreiber, 2000), PC algorithm (Spirtes & Glymour, 1991),
    fast causal inference; FCI (Spirtes & Glymour, 2000), and PCMCI (Runge et al.,
    2019). Conditional independence is performed using a statistical inference engine
    (e.g., partial correlation or information theory), (d) an alternative paradigm
    of causal inference are methods based on time-delay embedding whereby pairwise-bivariate
    timeseries (e.g., R and S) are used to construct attractors from which causal
    relations can be assessed (Sugihara et al., 2012), (e) the causal network obtained
    from causal inference algorithms where nodes represent variables and edges represent
    causal relations. The obtained causal inference network can be compared and contrasted
    to the conceptual a priori understanding of the system shown in panel a 3.7 How
    do we quantify the uncertainties in model predictions? An important aspect of
    modelling is uncertainty quantification (UQ), which in ML models includes uncertainties
    in the data, selection of input features, and model design (Abdar et al., 2021).
    A common approach to test the robustness of models to inputs is to perform variable
    feature selection and calculate model errors resulting from choosing different
    combinations of inputs. Other UQ approaches include Bayesian methods such as Markov
    chain Monte Carlo, Bayesian active learning, and variational auto encoders and
    ensemble methods, which can be computationally expensive (Abdar et al., 2021).
    Additional UQ challenges to be addressed are the variability of model performance
    from tuning hyperparameters due to stochastic optimizers used for training (model
    uncertainty) and use of noisy measurement data (measurement uncertainty). An approach
    to address model uncertainty is to use Monte Carlo dropout in model training,
    wherein each node has a certain probability of being dropped out (dropout rate)
    and not contributing to the model (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016). Measurement noise
    should ideally be propagated through the model, but computing required probability
    densities analytically is possible only for specific types of activation functions
    (Gast & Roth, 2018; Loquercio et al., 2020). Uncertainty quantification methods
    that exploit and extend such approaches to obtain confidence intervals for predictions
    are needed (Dumont et al., 2021). 3.8 How do we integrate and assimilate relevant
    datasets into ML models? Water quality models rely on having access to high-quality,
    publicly accessible data, and on software tools that enable data integration and
    assimilation. Many ML studies use readily available off-the-shelf products such
    as the catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies (CAMELS;
    Addor et al., 2017), which may impair their extensibility to practical, realistic
    applications where such data may not be available. Assimilation of new data into
    models using methods such as ensemble Kalman filters and autoregression (Brajard
    et al., 2020; Nearing, Klotz, et al., 2021; Zwart et al., 2021), and the use of
    integrated datasets tailored for the problem can improve prediction outcomes.
    Software that synthesize data for on-demand queries such as brokering-based tools
    (Horsburgh et al., 2016; Varadharajan et al., 2022), and methods to streamline
    quality control and outlier detection, gap-fill, downscale observations, and determine
    parameters for process models (Bennett & Nijssen, 2021; Campbell et al., 2013;
    Hill & Minsker, 2010; Leigh et al., 2019; Mital et al., 2020; Russo et al., 2020)
    would ideally be integrated into ML workflows in parallel with advances in modelling
    approaches. 4 CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE USE OF ML IN WATER QUALITY MODELS Water quality
    modelling poses several challenges regardless of whether the approach involves
    ML, statistical, or process-based codes. While each approach has its strengths
    and limitations, the ultimate model choice, structure, inputs, and parameters
    would need to take into account the following considerations. 4.1 Process complexity
    River water quality involves a wide range of physical (e.g., temperature, turbidity,
    conductance), chemical (inorganic and organic), and biological (e.g., bacteria,
    phytoplankton) parameters. Each parameter can be affected by many natural and
    anthropogenic factors including solute transport through runoff, groundwater exchange,
    instream biogeochemical processes, and land use (Lintern, Webb, Ryu, Liu, Bende-Michl,
    et al., 2018). For example, water temperature is strongly driven by climate but
    can also be influenced by snowmelt, groundwater influx, and reservoir and power
    plant operations (Caissie, 2006). Biogeochemical transformations such as redox
    reactions, uptake of nitrogen, or respiration of dissolved organic carbon add
    process complexity for non-conservative constituents. Even relatively conserved
    species such as salts can be affected by processes such as road salt runoff, surface-groundwater
    interactions, and tidal influence in coastal zones (Kaushal et al., 2018). Disturbances
    can modify the extent to which different drivers control water quality – e.g.,
    drought increases groundwater influences on salinity and in-stream biotic influences
    on nutrient transformation rates (Mosley, 2015). The need for explicit representation
    of different processes and their feedbacks in mechanistic models has resulted
    in increasingly complex model structures, and larger parameter spaces that are
    more difficult to constrain (Rode et al., 2010). ML approaches present an alternative
    to process models for complex systems where the dynamics are not fully understood,
    if sufficient data are available through direct or proxy measurements. However,
    ML and especially DL models with large sets of hyperparameters can also be complex
    depending on many factors such as model design, optimization process, and data
    dimensionality (Hu et al., 2021). An important aspect of choosing a model is determining
    the right level of model complexity required for the decisions to be made. Adding
    model complexity does not necessarily improve performance, and will increase computational
    and data requirements (Orth et al., 2015; Rode et al., 2010). Ideally, the choice
    of a more complex model (e.g., a DL-based architecture) is justified by comparing
    performance against some baseline lower-complexity ML, statistical, or process
    models (e.g., multi-linear regression or persistence models). 4.2 Scale, heterogeneity,
    and generalizability The factors influencing riverine water quality can differ
    in space and time ranging from local-scale surface groundwater fluxes and hyporheic
    exchange (Sear et al., 1999), reach-scale habitat and riparian vegetation (Newcomer
    et al., 2021), watershed-scale geomorphology and geology (Burns et al., 2020;
    Varanka et al., 2015), to regional-scale climate and land use patterns (Guo et
    al., 2019; Lintern, Webb, Ryu, Liu, Waters, et al., 2018). Building models that
    translate across spatiotemporal scales and incorporate process understanding of
    heterogeneous drivers is a significant challenge. Typically models have tried
    to capture catchment heterogeneity using characterizations of representative field
    sites from intense, multidisciplinary field investigations (Brantley et al., 2017)
    or other (e.g., remote sensing) datasets. However, upscaling mechanistic understanding
    from data-rich small-scale testbeds to other regions has been challenging, in
    part due to the spatial heterogeneity of watershed characteristics and the need
    to have computationally tractable models (Tang et al., 2019). Although parameter
    regionalization and classification of process-based models by catchment have attempted
    regional scaling with mixed results (Archfield et al., 2015), new approaches to
    bridge scales for key water quality variables using ML are needed. Although ML
    models are typically scale-invariant, their implementation for predictions of
    a particular spatial and temporal scale may require different model architectures
    and inputs depending on the processes involved at each scale. Recent hydrological
    studies explored the use of ML across spatial scales (Gauch et al., 2021; Kratzert,
    Klotz, Herrnegger, et al., 2019), and approaches such as transfer learning (Section
    5) can also be used to address this challenge. Finally, the effects of human activity
    or natural disturbances can persist over long time-scales (sometimes decades)
    requiring some models to include the lagged effects of drivers. For systems where
    memory effects are significant, ML models that use lagged variables or architectures
    that support prior states (e.g., LSTM or other sequence models) are warranted.
    4.3 Desired accuracy and computational complexity A key consideration for model
    choice is the extent of accuracy and robustness needed to meet the stakeholder
    objectives (Section 16). For example, daily reservoir operations have a much lower
    tolerance for errors in streamflow and temperature predictions in comparison to
    longer-term planning for climate change (Culhane et al., 1987). There are tradeoffs
    to be made between model accuracy, complexity, and computational costs. For example,
    classical ML models can be trained with substantially lower computational expense
    and smaller datasets (Hu et al., 2021), and are more interpretable (Rudin, 2019).
    Deep NN can have lower prediction errors, but have many more parameters than classical
    ML models thus requiring larger datasets and more computational resources to train,
    and are more difficult to interpret (Hu et al., 2021; Reichstein et al., 2019).
    4.4 Data availability, integration, processing and representation in models Riverine
    water quality modelling typically requires the use of highly diverse multi-scale,
    multimodal data (e.g., time-series data of flow and solute concentrations, geospatial
    data such as soil layers and hydrography, remote sensing data, or products of
    land cover and land use) for parameterization and validation. Model data requirements
    depend on the complexity, desired scale and resolution, and can be specific to
    the management question at hand. The amount of data available needs to be considered
    in choosing the ML model, with classical ML approaches needing less data than
    DL models. Hybrid KGML models (Section 4) and MTL (Section 5) can also be better
    suited for situations with sparse data. A challenge for water quality modelling
    is that data are typically sparse because many relevant parameters are measured
    infrequently using laboratory characterization of manually collected samples,
    and can be biased due to sampling network design, flow conditions, and time of
    day when the samples were collected (Smith et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2019).
    In-situ sensor technologies that collect high-resolution data only span a limited
    range of physical and chemical variables (Kruse, 2018), although soft sensor surrogate
    modelling approaches can be used to generate estimates of variables that are not
    measured (Section 2). While spatially dense remote sensing observations can be
    difficult to obtain at sufficiently fine resolutions, there are opportunities
    to bridge spatial scales by integrating limited point measurements from monitoring
    networks with remote sensing estimates of water quality (Ross et al., 2019; Topp
    et al., 2020). Autonomous observations from instruments such as aquatic drones
    guided by ML (Castellini et al., 2019, 2020) is a future direction that could
    enable data collection at larger scales. Discovering, integrating, and processing
    data for models is also challenging. Typically data of interest are spread across
    a myriad of sources in different formats, and do not have sufficient metadata,
    quality, or provenance information to support integration (Larsen et al., 2016).
    Often co-located datasets on water quality and its drivers are either not available
    or not easily discoverable. Data also may need to be gap-filled and quality checked
    prior to use in a model. In particular, water bodies with strong human influence
    are extremely difficult to model and upscale because predictor datasets on activities
    such as point source discharge, water withdrawals, and reservoir releases are
    limited or not easily reusable. Thus many observations are underutilized for ML
    despite large-scale consolidation efforts such as the Water Quality Portal and
    GLORICH databases (Hartmann et al., 2014; Read et al., 2017), because it is labor-intensive
    to harmonize and process data (Shaughnessy et al., 2019; Sprague et al., 2017).
    Recent efforts to make water data more broadly available and usable such as the
    U.S. Open Water Data Initiative and the California open water data system are
    essential for effective management and decision making (Blodgett et al., 2015;
    Cantor et al., 2021; Larsen et al., 2016). Because data preparation is one of
    the most time-consuming aspects of model development, the development of benchmark
    datasets following FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Reusable, Interoperable) principles
    (Wilkinson et al., 2016), and the use of automated tools that make it easier to
    discover, synthesize, and assimilate data (e.g., Section 10) can accelerate adoption
    of ML approaches. 4.5 Data-driven decisions considering stakeholder objectives
    Data-driven decision making refers to the concept of making decisions based on
    data analysis or modelling, and the use of ML for making optimal decisions has
    been proposed for numerous applications such as business intelligence, healthcare,
    network optimization, and precision agriculture (Chen, Liu, & Peng, 2019; Liakos
    et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2020; Provost & Fawcett, 2013). Water management is a
    complex endeavour, and managers are tasked with making decisions at local (e.g.,
    temperature and salinity control in a reach) to regional (e.g., integrated river
    basin management) spatial scales. The lead times needed for different decisions
    can be very different (DeFlorio et al., 2021; Sene, 2016) ranging from months
    to years for long-term planning (e.g., capital investments, climate adaptation),
    weeks to months for seasonal water supply management (e.g., drought and snowmelt
    forecasting), and hours to weeks for tactical operations and emergency response
    (e.g., daily reservoir operations, spill mitigation). Water quality management
    can be especially challenging given the range of variables that are typically
    regulated (e.g., temperature, salts, oxygen, nutrients, metals, organics) and
    the diffuse nature of their sources and sinks. Models used for water quality management
    serve exploratory, planning, or regulatory purposes, which have different requirements
    for acceptable accuracies, uncertainties, and biases (Harmel et al., 2014). Ultimately,
    it is important to consider stakeholder needs and available resources in deciding
    the appropriate complexity, scale, and resolution of the models. For example,
    many ML models have been developed for operational decisions that have short lead
    times (e.g., near-term forecasting), and are typically focused on predictions
    of a single variable although multitask learning approaches are being explored
    (e.g., Sadler et al., 2022; Zhu & Piotrowski, 2020; Zwart et al., 2021). ML models
    can also be run with substantially less computational expense than process models,
    and thus can be used to explore different scenarios for decision-making. Early
    stakeholder engagement can help determine desired objectives, accuracies, and
    lead times (Castilla-Rho, 2017; White, 2017), which could be enabled through collaborations
    between hydrological/water quality experts and data scientists with stakeholders
    such as watershed managers, regulators, and the public (Sun & Scanlon, 2019).
    Additionally, incorporating explainable AI approaches into decision frameworks
    will be important to increase transparency and build stakeholder trust in model
    projections. Finally, there are ethical considerations regarding the use of ML
    for decision-making, which include examining algorithmic assumptions, data bias
    and quality, and human-derived decision rules (Lo Piano, 2020). In summary, ML
    paired with other emerging technologies such as cloud and exascale computing,
    5G networks, and big data tools has the potential to significantly advance data-driven
    decisions and knowledge discovery for watershed and water quality management (Hubbard
    et al., 2020; Sun & Scanlon, 2019). The field of ML, and more broadly AI, has
    had a long history of developing other relevant technologies that are not discussed
    here including intelligent agents, decision theory, and reinforcement learning,
    which warrant further consideration in data-driven decision support systems for
    watershed management (Russell & Norvig, 2020). The potential for improving water
    quality models using ML can be realized by making deliberate choices for model
    selection, design, and evaluation based on the above considerations and incorporating
    the latest computational and mathematical advances. 5 CONCLUSIONS Improving water
    quality models for timely, decision-relevant predictions would be beneficial in
    the face of climate and land use change, growing populations, and a greater likelihood
    of extreme events. Water quality modelling poses many challenges due to the diversity
    of parameters and processes involved, the need for scaling, and data availability.
    The rapid growth in use of the state-of-the-art ML and DL models in hydrology,
    and recent computational and mathematical advances have demonstrated the potential
    for using ML for water quality modelling. Models can be improved using new approaches
    for model selection, hyperparameter optimization, knowledge-guided ML, transfer
    learning, new representations for complex data, explicit treatment for extremes,
    UQ, and explainable AI methods. At the same time, development of tools to integrate
    and process observational datasets, and methods for data assimilation would enhance
    the use of ML for water quality modelling. For decision-relevant predictions,
    consideration of stakeholder needs in model selection and evaluation of trade-offs
    between desired accuracy, complexity, timeliness, and available data and computational
    resources are important. With thoughtful implementation, ML models have the potential
    to accelerate decision-relevant predictions and process understanding of river
    water quality. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper is supported by the iNAIADS DOE Early

    blooms (ABs) within inland freshwater rivers, streams, lakes, and lagoons (Andres
    et al., 2019) are estimated to cost the United States upwards of $2.4 billion
    annually (Wurtsbaugh et al., 2019). An increase in the frequency, duration, and
    magnitude of bloom events, particularly harmful ABs, has driven research efforts
    towards improving our ability to understand and predict their occurrence (e.g.
    Ho and Michalak, 2015; Otten et al., 2015, Otten et al., 2016; Pace et al., 2017).
    Research efforts have largely focused on surface processes, particularly nutrient
    sources (Carpenter et al., 1998) and availability (Paerl et al., 2016; Schindler
    et al., 2016), and watershed transport (Abbott et al., 2018; Moatar et al., 2017).
    The importance of groundwater contributions has been discussed in the literature,
    although rather scarcely, and typically only from a limited perspective focused
    on nutrient budgets. Paerl (1997) suggested that groundwater inputs and atmospheric
    deposition from urban, industrial, and agricultural sources may have resulted
    in the expansion of harmful algal blooms in coastal and offshore waters. There
    has also been an understanding that submarine groundwater discharge can cause
    eutrophication in near coastal waters (Smith and Swarzenski, 2012) and lakes (Meinikmann
    et al., 2015) from groundwater-derived nutrient and solute loadings such as nitrogen
    (N) and phosphorus (P) (Sawyer et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the role of groundwater
    beyond simplistic nutrient delivery mechanisms has not received much attention.
    Few studies have investigated the role of groundwater and groundwater/surface
    water interactions (GWSWI) in the development of ABs in terrestrial waters. Our
    goal is to reassess the current state of research on groudnwater''s role in algal
    bloom development, to reinvigorate and direct research in this area. We highlight
    that recent research suggests that the role of groundwater is not limited to the
    delivery of N and P, and in fact that groundwater may play multiple important
    roles in controlling AB production in terrestrial aquatic ecosystems. Our hope
    is to prompt intrigue across scientific fields as to the diverse roles groundwater
    can have in governing AB dynamics. Different causes for ABs have been reported
    for different systems. Algal abundance may be high if nutrient availability within
    a water body is also high, such as high N and P concentrations in agricultural
    runoff. In contrast, if other primary producers such as macrophytes or phytoplankton
    are present to compete for nutrients and light, the same abundance of nutrients
    in this alternate steady state may not be able to support a bloom (Scheffer et
    al., 1993). In addition to nutrient and light availability, bloom emergence also
    depends on watershed hydrodynamics, geomorphological, biogeochemical, food-web,
    and climate dynamics which shape critical in-stream pathways (Lobera et al., 2017;
    Nogaro et al., 2013; Power et al., 2015; Walsh et al., 2016). All of these mechanisms
    have been considered at some level of scientific inquiry yet no models exist that
    include all of these possible mechanisms. Process-based models that consider multiple,
    interacting processes are needed. The development of such a model would help better
    understand the role of integrated hydrologic inputs from shallow soils and deeper
    aquifers in regulating AB formation (Andres et al., 2019). A major research gap
    in predicting terrestrial-aquatic controls on AB probability is understanding
    the role of groundwater inputs in modulating microbial biomass production and
    food-web dynamics through controlling nutrient dynamics. In this paper, we consider
    the mechanisms through which GWSWI may regulate ABs considering what has been
    explored to date as well as identifying critical gaps in knowledge where future
    research is needed. 1.1. Evidence of groundwater''s role in algal growth Several
    lines of evidence indicate that groundwater can play a key role in the regulation
    of ABs. These lines of evidence, and the subsequent hypotheses that we present
    in the following sections, are related to differences in physical and geochemical
    properties of groundwater and surface water. These do not reflect all of the possible
    mechanisms through which groundwater may regulate algal growth, but highlight
    the potentially more prevalent mechanisms. The differences in physical and geochemical
    properties of groundwater and surface water are predominantly driven by the differences
    in residence time, where residence times for surface water systems are often measured
    in hours or days (e.g., Jones et al., 2017) and groundwater flow systems of the
    same spatial scale are often measured in years or decades (e.g., Gleeson et al.,
    2016). Stemming from the contributing and subsequent differences in geochemical
    and physical properties, evidence that relates to groundwater''s role in algal
    growth can be summarized by highlighting the importance of groundwater''s role
    in the hyporheic zone dynamics, GWSWI, nutrient budgets and ratios, and food-web
    habitats. 1.1.1. Hyporheic zone dynamics and groundwater-surface water interactions
    The hyporheic zone is the area of mixing between groundwater and stream water
    (Figure 1). Groundwater inputs to this zone help determine what redox processes
    occur there and nutrient, microorganism (microbes, bacteria, and invertebrates),
    and element delivery to streams (Marmonier et al., 2012). Research has only recently
    identified the role of subsurface flow paths through the hyporheic zone as a major
    contributor to benthic and in-stream algal stability, and the controls of these
    flow paths over water biogeochemistry is rarely recognized in models predicting
    ABs (Krause et al., 2017; Larsen and Woelfle-Erskine, 2018). GWSWI provides pathways
    for both nutrient consumption as well as nutrient supply to surface waters (Fox
    et al., 2016; Malzone et al., 2016), which can decrease and increase ABs, respectively.
    Most importantly, the seasonal variability of stream flow conditions and the timing
    of when streams shift from dominantly gaining to losing can dictate when and where
    Fe, N, and Si in-stream stoichiometry are in excess or limiting through hyporheic
    bacterial conditions that feedback on flow and nutrients (Newcomer et al., 2016),
    and could be a primary factor in determining algal taxonomic dominance (Myllynen
    et al., 1997). Download : Download high-res image (219KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. a) Proportion of gaining to losing conditions can support
    different stable steady states of ABs through delivery of chemistry, microbes,
    and invertebrate assemblages important for food-web stability; b) potential effects
    of groundwater pumping on stream conditions. Groundwater pumping can shift streams
    to dominantly losing. During both dry periods and wet periods, distinct microbiological
    and nutrient conditions enter the surface water or enter the groundwater. Delivery
    of these unique microbiomes to surface waters can change the fundamental biological,
    physical, and chemical conditions modulating bloom dynamics. The mechanisms by
    which GWSWI can impact surface water concentrations of nutrients, in-stream periphyton,
    and phytoplankton dynamics is directly related to the magnitude, residence time,
    and degree of vertical hydrological exchange (Doering et al., 2013). Vertical
    exchanges between shallow subsurface and deeper groundwater can amplify the delivery
    of nutrients, microbial matter, and solutes, impacting the chemistry of downstream
    river segments (Gomez-Velez et al., 2017; Grant et al., 2018; Krause et al., 2017;
    L Li et al., 2020; Newcomer et al., 2018). In particular, vertical exchanges mediate
    the interactions and feedbacks between nutrient and algal communities by maintaining
    or removing Fe, Si, N, C, P, Se, and Hg, which are essential micronutrients/metals
    that support growth and maintenance of various algal taxa and community assemblages
    (Gobler et al., 2013; Larsen and Woelfle-Erskine, 2018; Mangal et al., 2019).
    For example, microbial uptake and methylation of Hg in the hyporheic zone has
    also been associated with certain types of benthic algal organic matter (Mangal
    et al., 2019). Vertical hydrologic exchanges also support nutrient recycling (such
    as N), maintain clean bed sediments, and support diverse microbial assemblages
    (Marmonier et al., 2012; Nogaro et al., 2013), which play an important role in
    mediating water quality and biogeochemical cycles down watershed gradients (Harvey
    and Gooseff, 2015; Kim et al., 2017; Kolbe et al., 2019; Musolff et al., 2015)
    towards downstream land-water interfaces (e.g., Great Lakes). What we recognize
    from the multitude of studies exploring factors contributing to AB is that the
    first step towards prediction of ABs is to appropriately represent chemical and
    hydrological mechanisms in models, including the ability to represent vertical
    hydrological exchanges across terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, thus representing
    both the shallow and deep subsurface. 1.1.2. Nutrient budgets and ratios Watersheds
    can control the nutrient ratios through several mechanisms, including surface
    runoff, as well as hyporheic denitrification, oxyhydroxide transport by groundwater
    to surface water, and weathering of minerals containing Se, Fe, Si, and Mn (Dekov
    et al., 2014; Gobler et al., 2013; Lewitus et al., 2012; Wall et al., 1998). For
    example, diatoms require a molar Si:N:P ratio of 16:16:1. When Si becomes scarce,
    diatom size is altered and a regime shift towards nonsilicious dinoflagellates
    may occur (Officer and Ryther, 1980). It has been hypothesized that Si limited
    conditions (Turner and Rabalais, 1991) have led to increased blooms of toxic dinoflagellates
    compared to conditions of higher N and P loads (Dortch and Whitledge, 1992). Iron
    and Copper concentrations (Fe, Cu) also directly modulate the Si:N ratios within
    diatoms which regulate the toxicity of the bloom (Rue and Bruland, 2001). Similarly,
    biomass and toxin production by cyanobacteria such as Microcystis spp. are thought
    to be controlled by the form and stoichiometry of N and P (e.g., Andersen et al.,
    2020; Paerl et al., 2016). Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in groundwater
    and surface water often differ significantly so that groundwater contributions
    may promote algal growth by increasing nutrient supply, suppress algal growth
    by diluting nutrient concentrations, or may promote specific algal taxa by altering
    nutrient stoichiometry (Anderson et al., 2002). The differences in water chemistry
    between surface water and groundwater arise from the differing biogeochemical
    mechanisms and anthropogenic inputs. Nitrate is often the most abundant form of
    ionic nitrogen in both surface water and groundwater (e.g., Howarth et al., 1996;
    Lewandowski et al., 2015). Nitrate is highly soluble and available for microbial
    transformation to gaseous forms in the presence of an electron donor such as organic
    carbon (Rivett et al., 2008). Because of this, nitrate often enters aquatic systems
    with watershed runoff and advects into both surface water and groundwater pools.
    If conditions support denitrification along the flow path, nitrate concentrations
    decrease before groundwater recharge occurs. If not, high concentrations of nitrate
    can persist in groundwater for long periods of time in systems with low electron
    donor supply (Rivett et al., 2008). Groundwater P concentration is dependent on
    geology and long-term patterns in watershed land use (Powers et al., 2016; Sharpley
    et al., 2013). Along the coasts of the Great Lakes for example, approximately
    ⅓ of the coastlines are vulnerable to groundwater inputs of P and N (Knights et
    al., 2017). Many soils are naturally deficient in P and the primary source of
    P is often anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer and manure application.
    Long term anthropogenic activities in urban and agricultural watersheds have led
    to a gradual accumulation of legacy P in soils that would otherwise be low in
    P (Sharpley et al., 2013). In many of these regions, legacy P has exceeded soil
    sorption capacity and under the right conditions is released in a dissolved form
    (Haygarth et al., 2014; Powers et al., 2016). Dissolved P can be transported into
    groundwater where it persists, resulting in groundwater being substantial sources
    of legacy phosphorus to surface water bodies (Holman et al., 2008; Schilling et
    al., 2020). 1.1.3. Food-web habitats Hydrodynamic conditions, such as groundwater
    flow and GWSWI, can have an important co-evolutionary role in the stability, re-assembly,
    and number of trophic levels (Diffenbaugh et al., 2015; Gray et al., 2015; Marks
    et al., 2000; Waliser and Guan, 2017). Disturbances such as atmospheric rivers,
    fires, droughts, hurricanes, and floods can influence the physical hydrodynamic
    conditions (such as runoff, groundwater flow, and GWSWI), potentially shifting
    the steady state of a watershed and the food-web habitats dependent upon it and
    ability for food-webs to establish. Food-web habitats also include the communities
    and assemblages of macro and micro fauna/organisms such as instream and groundwater
    microbes, bacteria, and invertebrates. Microorganisms play a pivotal role in the
    functioning of ecosystems through their impacts on biogeochemistry as well as
    their novel recognition as critical keystone taxa in environments (Banerjee et
    al., 2018). Even more complexity is introduced when considering algal-bacterial
    interactions (Sison-Mangus et al., 2016). Microbial community composition has
    been shown to be a key interacting factor influencing AB conditions (Klindworth
    et al., 2014; Needham and Fuhrman, 2016). Interactions include the recycling of
    N, C, and P from decaying algal organic matter, or provisioning important micronutrients
    to algae which can promote or inhibit certain AB growth (Kazamia et al., 2012).
    Macroorganisms impact biogeochemistry and can also serve as sources of diversity
    and as transport vectors for microbial populations (Smith et al., 2016). Macroorganisms,
    including groundwater and surface water invertebrates (e.g. stygofauna and benthic
    invertebrates) are important as players in food-webs. Stygofauna are a potential
    source of organic matter from groundwater to surface water, and their activities
    are thought to mediate the transfer of organic matter through the aquifer system
    (Smith et al., 2016). Biodiversity of groundwater invertebrates and their function
    is understudied (Danielopol et al., 2003), but is hypothesized to positively contribute
    to important ecosystem services such as maintaining functional assemblages important
    for pollutant degradation. This includes the provision of important services to
    surface waters supporting algal diversity and stability such as mayflies and nymphs
    which are grazers of algae (Boulton et al., 2008). Groundwater contributions of
    these invertebrate assemblages may play important roles in suppressing harmful
    or nuisance algal dominance conditions because they are consumers of algae. These
    collective influences of climatic, hydrological, biogeochemical and micro-macro
    organisms are demonstrated in the two riverbed examples provided below: 1) As
    a major control on food-web reassembly and trophic interactions, hydrological
    perturbations within watersheds have been shown to initiate equilibrium or dis-equilibrium
    conditions at the start of the growing season by changing channel morphology and
    grazing by invertebrates (Lobera et al., 2017). Riverbed scour, which can be driven
    by GWSWI, is a well-recognized mechanism supporting this watershed state shift,
    and has been shown to provide the biogeochemical and geomorphological equilibria
    to support a shift towards re-establishment of non-toxic food-webs (Junk et al.,
    1989; Lobera et al., 2017; Power, 2001). Stability and cohesion of riverbeds and
    riverbanks, which work to prevent scour and erosion, is controlled by the pore
    water pressure and normal stress of the sediments and streambank materials, which
    is controlled by groundwater conditions and GWSWI (Simon et al., 2000). Changes
    in the streambed conditions, potentially driven by changes in both the surface
    water and groundwater, control the amount and extent of scour and erosion. 2)
    Wet-winter conditions provide a multitude of services, including the recharge
    of aquifers which supports baseflow to streams during dry seasons. This baseflow
    plays an important role in stabilizing benthic assemblages (Lavers et al., 2015).
    Baseflow can also maintain benthic algal productivity and diversity across run-riffle
    sequences (Peterson and Grimm, 1992), maintain clean bed sediments for diverse
    microbial assemblages (Nogaro et al., 2013), and initialize benthic periphyton
    (green-algae, attached primary producers) that support a multi-level food chain
    and a stable steady state during the growing season (Power et al., 2008). Wet-winter
    conditions supporting annual benthic riverbed resets are acknowledged to play
    an important role in stabilizing invertebrate communities through sediment scour
    and top-predator removal which is a critical top-down food-web control on algae
    proliferation (Jones et al., 2015). Conversely, lack of winter precipitation events
    or the occurrence of more extreme precipitation events may provide the hydrological
    foundation for shifting the balance of these sensitive trophic webs towards cyanobacteria
    (Power et al., 2015). Dry conditions lower water tables that decrease or eliminate
    baseflow, produce downward chemical gradients (Dahm et al., 2003), and limit ecosystem
    services facilitated within hyporheic zones (Newcomer et al., 2018). 2. Possible
    mechanisms for groundwater control of ABs A significant difference between surface
    water and groundwater flow systems is their residence time, where groundwater
    typically has much longer residence times compared to surface water bodies (Gleeson
    et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2017). Our umbrella hypothesis is that: long residence
    times cause groundwater to be geochemically and biologically distinct from surface
    water, such that changes in groundwater inputs can alter in-stream environments,
    including the ability to support or prevent ABs (Figure 1). Mechanisms that create
    geochemically and/or biologically distinct groundwater include: a) More reduced
    environment and possible denitrification: Groundwater, particularly in deeper
    subsurface systems, has limited interaction with the atmosphere and therefore
    typically has more reduced conditions compared to surface water (see Hypothesis
    1). Where supplies of electron donors are present, the more reduced condition
    of the subsurface can drive denitrification reactions that are often inhibited
    under oxic conditions in shallow soils. b) More geochemical and microbial reactions:
    Slower groundwater flow increases the contact time with surrounding porous media,
    allowing more water-rock-microbial interactions (see Hypotheses 2). c) Stability
    and relative contributions of groundwater: Variability in the quantity and quality
    of groundwater fluxes tend to be dampened compared to those at the surface because
    the long residence time integrates input signals. This makes groundwater more
    consistent and stable compared to surface waters that are directly impacted by
    short term and seasonal climatic conditions (see Hypothesis 3). Hypothesis 1 Reduced
    state of the subsurface can cause groundwater discharge to control algal growth
    Groundwater discharge has the potential to supply aquatic habitats with nutrients
    and microorganisms that promote development of ABs. The concentration and form
    of those nutrients depends on the microbial reactions occurring along the groundwater
    flow paths, which is driven in part by groundwater redox state. Many microbial
    reactions occur in aquifers (Dahm et al., 1998; Kolbe et al., 2019), however,
    microbial nitrogen and metal cycling may be of particular relevance to ABs (e.g.,
    Orihel et al., 2016; Paerl et al., 2016). Subsurface microorganisms can alter
    nitrogen inputs to aquatic habitats through nitrogen cycling (Figure 2a). Denitrification
    consumes nitrate in anoxic environments and can produce dinitrogen and a variety
    of nitrogen species with intermediate oxidation states (e.g., N2O, NO, NO2-).
    Nitrate reduction can also occur via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium
    (DNRA), which produces ammonium. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) can occur
    where ammonium and nitrite are available. Where groundwater flow transports ammonium
    to zones that contain oxygen, nitrification can produce nitrate. Thus, the form
    of nitrogen delivered to surface waters by groundwater discharge depends on which
    portions of the nitrogen cycle, if any, are occurring within the subsurface. Download

    Microbial (a) nitrogen and (b) iron cycles. The nitrogen cycle diagram (a) is
    based on Jetten (2008). The iron cycle diagram (b) includes mineral sources of
    ferric iron, consistent with near-neutral pH environments. The diagram also depicts
    some potential fates of ferrous iron, including sorption (Fe(II)(ads)), precipitation
    of mackinawite (FeS), siderite (FeCO3), and vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O), and formation
    of mixed-valence phases such as green rust. Where nitrate is transported into
    streams through anoxic layers within riparian zones, often due to current or historic
    agricultural use of fertilizers, denitrification can reduce nitrate stream pollution.
    Tesoriero et al. (2015) asserts that the geologic setting, including the thicknesses
    of surficial oxygenated aquifers, associated shallow versus deep flow paths, clay
    content, and organic content, control the extent of denitrification and stream
    nitrate. These subsurface structures also determine how much groundwater discharges
    to streams. For example, in rivers draining to the Chesapeake Bay, almost half
    the water and N are annually derived from groundwater with median residence times
    of 10 y (Lindsey et al., 2003). ABs therefore rely on application rates of N-containing
    fertilizer in nearby fields but also on the presence of flow pathways of oxygenated
    groundwater from deep oxic aquifers where denitrification does not occur (Tesoriero
    et al., 2013). Similarly, metal cycling (Figure 2b) has the potential to affect
    groundwater inputs of several nutrients to aquatic habitats, including P, Fe(II),
    Si, Mo, and Cu. Iron plays a key role in moderating the growth and dominance of
    some algal taxa (i.e., cyanobacteria) (Orihel et al., 2016). Iron, Mo, and Cu
    also play important roles in regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism within
    cyanobacteria (Rueter and Petersen, 1987). High carbon dioxide levels combined
    with silica limitation in surface waters can synergistically increase the toxicity
    of some blooms dominated by diatoms (Tatters et al., 2012). Each of these nutrients
    can be immobilized on (oxyhydr)oxides and other solid-phases through adsorption-desorption
    reactions (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). Reduction of manganese(IV) and iron(III)
    in anoxic environments produces Mn(II) and Fe(II), respectively, and causes (oxyhydr)oxide
    minerals to dissolve. Thus, microbial metal reduction can mobilize those nutrients
    by consuming (oxyhydr)oxide minerals and decreasing the availability of sorption
    sites. Consistent with this mechanism, studies observed correlations between phosphate
    and iron(II) concentrations in groundwater beneath agricultural landscapes (Carlyle
    and Hill, 2001; Schilling et al., 2018; Tomer et al., 2010). These examples illustrate
    how the redox state of the subsurface can affect the microbial environment, which
    in turn affects the nutrient content of the groundwater discharging to surface
    water bodies. The nutrient content of groundwater can be spatially and temporally
    heterogeneous, depending on which reactions occur (Dahm et al., 1998), increasing
    the importance of understanding the subsurface environment and groundwater flow
    paths in predicting AB development. Hypothesis 2 Extent of water-rock interactions
    impacts the control of groundwater discharge on algal growth Chemical weathering,
    in addition to microbial reactions, influences the nutrient delivery of groundwater
    discharge to aquatic habitats. Chemical weathering in the subsurface is driven
    primarily by reaction of minerals with meteoric water and acids, including carbonic
    and organic acids (Brantley et al., 2011). Those acids are produced primarily
    by degradation of organic matter and plant respiration (Silverman, 1979). Acid
    migrating into the subsurface and along groundwater flow paths reacts with minerals
    and produces solutes (Kump et al., 2000), including alkali Earth metals and silica,
    as shown in the following example reaction in which albite (NaAlSi3O8) reacts
    with carbon dioxide and produces kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4): Because those reactions
    consume acid, pH and the alkalinity content of groundwater generally increases
    as chemical weathering occurs (Carrillo-Rivera and Cardona, 2012). Microbial respiration
    occurring alongside these chemical weathering reactions can also increase pH because
    many microbial respiration reactions consume protons (Park et al., 2006, Park
    et al., 2009). Solutes liberated by chemical weathering can serve directly as
    nutrients for algae, including silica and numerous trace elements. Moreover, by
    affecting the pH and ionic strength of groundwater, chemical weathering would
    also affect the sorption of nutrients onto aquifer and hyporheic zone minerals
    (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). For example, phosphorus sorption onto (oxyhydr)oxide
    is at its maximum at low pH and decreases gradually as pH rises (Cornell and Schwertmann,
    2003). This relationship suggests that the ability of phosphorus to sorb may tend
    to decrease as acid is consumed by weathering reactions. Factors that determine
    the extent to which those reactions occur include the residence time of the water
    in the subsurface and the reaction kinetics of the minerals along the flow paths.
    Groundwater that has had a longer residence time in the subsurface has had more
    contact time with minerals, allowing more weathering to occur. Some minerals react
    relatively quickly with acid and are often found to be in equilibrium with groundwater
    (e.g., calcite) whereas other minerals react more slowly but still have a significant
    influence on groundwater chemistry (e.g., plagioclase, biotite, and other primary
    silicates) (Glynn and Plummer, 2005). Therefore, local geology has a strong influence
    on the weathering reactions that occur along groundwater flow paths and thus the
    concentration and form of nutrients that could be delivered to the surface. Hypothesis
    3 Systems with greater proportion of groundwater discharge have greater stability
    and thus increased probability of supporting ABs The proportion of groundwater
    discharge influences the environmental stability of conditions of an aquatic habitat.
    Groundwater chemistry, temperature, and the direction and magnitude of exchange
    with surface water significantly affects conditions in those surface water bodies
    (Winter, 1999). Surface water bodies that receive little groundwater are heavily
    influenced by climatic conditions and variability. Groundwater discharge can help
    buffer surface water variability, especially between precipitation events, by
    providing a relatively steady source of water with a relatively stable composition
    and temperature. Therefore, systems receiving a relatively higher proportion of
    water from groundwater discharge have the potential for greater stability (Figure
    1) which may promote stable food-webs and singular AB development (i.e one taxa
    becomes dominant). Hypothesis 3-1 The influence of groundwater on surface water
    composition and AB development is greater during dry seasons than wet seasons.
    Stream water consists of water from different sources and with different histories.
    Stream water sources include surface runoff, shallow soil water (e.g., perched
    water table), and relatively deep groundwater. The dominance of shallow versus
    deep water varies under wet and dry conditions. Disproportionally high DOC and
    nutrient exports during storms suggest that shallow soil water is a major source
    and key driver of variable stream concentrations of these constituents (Boyer
    et al., 1997; Pacific et al., 2010; Seibert et al., 2009; Zhi et al., 2019). For
    example, under wet conditions when stream water is predominantly derived from
    shallow soil water, nitrate concentration is often high reflecting the legacy
    store of fertilizers in soils (Van Meter et al., 2018). Conversely, under dry
    conditions when streams are often groundwater fed, nitrate concentrations may
    reflect the extent of nitrate removal and denitrification in the subsurface (Benettin
    et al., 2020; Kolbe et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2016). Although, also under dry
    conditions, stream water may reflect the high concentrations of geogenic species
    derived from deep groundwater sources (Kim et al., 2014) or reflect the high concentration
    of wastewater derived nutrients and contaminants if wastewater supplies low-flow
    conditions (Bowes et al., 2005). The chemistries of deep and shallow groundwater
    typically differ, with the extent of difference usually defined by the variance
    of subsurface physical and biogeochemical conditions with depth (Herndon et al.,
    2018; Sullivan et al., 2016). Hypothesis 3-2 Groundwater discharge influences
    the stability of AB conditions in aquatic habitats through maintenance of greater
    biodiversity. A growing body of research supports the idea that maintenance of
    biodiversity is an important tool for habitat stability (Hooper et al., 2005)
    and control of AB (Glibert, 2017). Natural disturbances (rainstorms, changing
    flow conditions, fires, etc.) are a few of the ways that biodiversity in stream
    habitats is maintained through development of heterogeneity within the stream
    and for opportunities for new species to colonize (Arnon et al., 2015; Stegen
    et al., 2016). When a greater number of species can take advantage of niche opportunities
    to control nutrients in streams and groundwater, many potential outcomes exist
    in terms of species dominance within the stream, often preventing one single dominant
    species (Cardinale, 2011). An example of this is the greater occurrence of salmon
    redds in locations with upwelling hyporheic groundwater (Larsen and Woelfle-Erskine,
    2018; Neumann and Curtis, 2016), where salmon populations are known to have suppression
    effects on key AB consumers such as invertebrates (Harding and Reynolds, 2014).
    While the interplay of the chemical composition of GWSWI and groundwater discharge
    and other factors controlling biodiversity is complex (Lepori and Hjerdt, 2006)
    the potential for research delineating key feedbacks and interactions between
    groundwater discharge and species biodiversity highlights several lines of inquiry:
    (i) How does groundwater discharge from agricultural areas impact stream biodiversity
    and AB? (ii) Given algal and microbial species with varying degrees of functional
    diversity can participate in significant nutrient uptake, can maintenance of algal
    and microbial biodiversity help control nutrient exports downstream? (iii) Is
    there a feedback mechanism such that greater groundwater discharge can promote
    some AB taxa to dominate and potentially limit biodiversity? 3. Looking to the
    future: potential implications of environmental change on groundwater control
    of ABs Many changes to our environment have occurred and are predicted to occur
    in the future. These environmental changes will affect processes and mechanisms
    that cause ABs, including the role of groundwater. Most environmental changes
    are driven by anthropogenic activities, including changes in land use, water management
    and climate. Here we discuss some implications of the potential changes to groundwater''s
    role in AB development with respect to these changing environmental conditions.
    3.1. Land use Since the 1600s, the dominant change in land use continues to be
    the conversion of natural watersheds (e.g., forests, shrublands, wetlands) to
    agriculture (croplands and grazing). Recent studies have demonstrated that agricultural
    watersheds with the fewest wetlands tend to contribute the highest nutrient loads
    (Hansen et al., 2018). In addition, the adaption of agricultural management systems,
    such as the installation of subsurface drain tiles, have increased the rate of
    water delivery dynamics within the watersheds (Foufoula-Georgiou et al., 2015;
    Schottler et al., 2014; Zhang and Schilling, 2006). Agricultural lands today are
    intensively managed landscapes where human energy inputs (farm machinery and chemical
    use) and human modifications of the landscape (tile drains, ditching, and channel
    straightening) have greatly amplified nutrient loading and accelerated their delivery
    to downstream waterbodies (Kumar et al., 2018). Long term stores of high nitrate
    concentrations (Wang et al., 2012) have been mapped globally (Ascott et al., 2017)
    and suggest that high nutrient load futures will be a likely long term input to
    surface water systems. Phosphorus is also projected to represent a likely legacy
    nutrient source on future algal blooms. Recent studies have shown just how reactive
    different forms of phosphate are and how they can have multiple sources along
    with complex retention and remobilization mechanisms (Bingham et al., 2020) and
    also represent likely legacy effect on future algal blooms. Despite worldwide
    efforts to reduce watershed inputs of nitrate and quantify legacy nutrient stores,
    agricultural lands are predicted to expand in the future to try to meet the food
    demands of an increasing population. An implication of the legacy nutrients and
    the expansion of agriculture is the promotion of conditions favorable for ABs
    development for decades to come. 3.2. Water management The hydrologic conditions
    and distribution of water throughout most river basins are controlled by reservoirs,
    and are further modified by surface water diversion and groundwater pumping for
    irrigation (Barlow and Leake, 2012; Graf, 1999). With changing climate conditions,
    these management strategies will be optimized to best maintain or augment current
    water resource availability due to economic, social, and ecologic dependence on
    consistent and accessible water resources (e.g., Brookfield and Gnau, 2016; Smilovic
    et al., 2019). As such, water management practices can dominate the hydrologic
    conditions of managed river basins, and can have implications on AB development.
    Reservoirs and surface water contributions/diversions affect the hydrologic conditions
    of a stream through altered flow rates and surface water levels. This can also
    affect water exchange with the subsurface and hyporheic flow (Winter, 1999). As
    a result of these manmade controls over stream levels, hydrologic conditions in
    the stream do not necessarily reflect climate variability, and algal growth and
    transport within the system may not be predicted by climate conditions alone (Drenovsky
    et al., 2010). Drenovsky et al. (2010) found that water availability was a main
    factor driving microbial composition and biomass, and that biomass was lowest
    in ecosystems with either the wettest or the driest soils. Additionally, they
    found that soil water availability was a better indicator of microbial community
    composition than precipitation, particularly in agricultural regions where water
    management is integrated into soil moisture measurements (Drenovsky et al., 2010).
    In many of Europe''s largest rivers, low flow conditions during dry periods are
    mostly supported by wastewater inputs rather than groundwater baseflow (Bowes
    et al., 2005) representing a potentially large source of non-groundwater derived
    nutrients. Therefore, changes to reservoir management and surface contributions/diversions
    may have significant effects on the prevalence of downstream ABs. Surface water
    is not the only system impacted by anthropogenic water management and use. Over
    the past century, groundwater use in irrigated agriculture caused overexploitation
    of major aquifer systems around the globe (Scanlon et al., 2012; Siebert et al.,
    2010). This has also affected surface water as groundwater is primarily discharged
    to streams and rivers and is often the main component of streamflow (Barlow and
    Leake, 2012). Groundwater extraction can reduce baseflow to streams, reducing
    water levels and altering GWSWI and hyporheic flow. Non-stationary effects of
    climate change, including warmer temperatures and longer droughts, have further
    exacerbated the problem (Diffenbaugh et al., 2015; Luce and Holden, 2009; Milly
    et al., 2008; Rood et al., 2005; Seager et al., 2007). During droughts, groundwater
    is relied upon to compensate for the lack of precipitation and streamflow, and
    during wet conditions groundwater use is reduced because water is available through
    precipitation or streamflow diversions. This variability in groundwater pumping
    causes changes to flux through a streambed, and can convert a gaining stream to
    a losing stream (Figure 1b; Barlow and Leake, 2012) further depleting streamflow,
    and increasing the likelihood of low flow conditions. In addition, changes to
    groundwater pumping can cause variability in hyporheic flowrates and patterns
    (Boano et al., 2014). As described previously, groundwater discharge to streams
    and hyporheic flow are important sources of nutrients and thermal energy to streambed
    and in-stream environments and support the stability and richness of in-stream
    microbial communities (Barlow and Leake, 2012; Boano et al., 2014). An implication
    of increased groundwater extraction is a reduction in the delivery of these nutrients
    and thermal inputs, decreasing the frequency and intensity of ABs (Cho et al.,
    2016). 3.3. Changing climate Climate shifts, including the type (e.g., snow/rain
    dominance), frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation events as well
    as melt dynamics, are altering GWSWI by changing the ratio of inputs from direct
    surface runoff, shallow groundwater inputs, and deep groundwater inputs (e.g.,
    Foster and Allen, 2015; Sulis et al., 2012). For example, many of the mid-continent
    and western mountain ranges in the US have been experiencing a decline in snow
    pack and/or early melt or rain-on-snow events. This shift toward more rapid melt
    dynamics and a greater degree of rain-on-snow events is often linked to increases
    in overland and shallow subsurface flow, compared to slower melt dynamics which
    support a greater degree of infiltration and deeper subsurface water flow (Meixner
    et al., 2016; Surfleet and Tullos, 2013; Tague and Grant, 2009). As flow paths
    become shallower across these systems, a larger proportion of water interacts
    with decomposing near-surface organic matter and its associated nutrients and
    can bypass transformation in the subsurface, delivering more nutrients to surface
    water bodies. Like changes in snow dominate recharge of groundwater systems, shifts
    in rainfall patterns and associated changes in groundwater extraction alter both
    the quantity and quality of water delivered to surface water bodies (Gleeson and
    Richter, 2018; Kendy and Bredehoeft, 2006). Specifically, increased depth to the
    water table due to decreased recharge and increased groundwater extraction can
    change both hydraulic gradients between groundwater and surface water and the
    depth to which oxygen and acids penetrate the subsurface. This can control the
    release of geogenic derived nutrients and or stored anthropogenic inputs (NO3;
    Kløve et al., 2014; Puckett et al., 2008). Overall, the trend in many environments
    is that the variance in GWSWI is shifting due to changing climate conditions which
    has both an impact on nutrients that are delivered to surface waters and the oxic/anoxic
    state by which both the interacting flow paths and surface water bodies experience.
    4. Tools for quantifying groundwater''s control over ABs While we have seen significant
    advancement in tools capable of improving our understanding of groundwater''s
    control over ABs, these tools often remain siloed in the communities/disciplines
    where they were generated. Below we present a robust, but not exhaustive, exploration
    of both new and well-established tools for measuring and modeling groundwater''s
    contribution to in-stream conditions. If used in concert, these can reveal key
    mechanisms by which groundwater can control AB dynamics and help us to advance
    aquatic and terrestrial numerical models. 4.1. Measurement methods Recent advances
    in environmental sensors make them more affordable, robust, and capable of resolving
    water sources, flow paths, and biogeochemical transformations. Advancements in
    environmental sensor technology have greatly accelerated the frequency of measurements,
    increasing temporal and spatial resolution. The current generation of environmental
    sensors improves upon: 1) detection of traditional tracers of groundwater such
    as temperature, conductivity, and discharge (Kalbus et al., 2006; Moeck et al.,
    2017; Schmidt et al., 2006); 2) environmental signatures of water chemistry that
    may be distinct between groundwater and surface water or effect critical biogeochemical
    transformations, such as nitrate concentration, dissolved oxygen, algal pigments
    (Abbott et al., 2016; Pellerin et al., 2016); 3) stable isotopes including water
    and nutrient isotopes (e.g., 18O, 2H, 15N; Sebestyen et al., 2014; Sprenger et
    al., 2019; Sullivan et al., 2016); and 4) our ability to assess aquifer microbiology
    (Chapelle et al., 1995; McMahon and Chapelle, 2008). Together, the information
    gained from the new generation of environmental sensors can be used to define
    the role that groundwater is playing in harmful AB formation. 4.1.1. Traditional
    tracers Newer methods of detecting traditional tracers of groundwater, such as
    conductivity and temperature, include the use of fiber-optic cables and thermal
    cameras, and advances in existing technologies such as pressure transducers (Kalbus
    et al., 2006) and conductivity probes, all allow high resolution monitoring of
    groundwater-surface interaction. For example, fiber-optic cables strung along
    or across a streambed are used to measure thermal profiles and allow for spatially
    and temporally resolved groundwater inputs to surface water bodies when groundwater
    temperatures are distinct from the surface water temperature (Schmidt et al.,
    2006). Advancements in pressure transducer technology to increase measurement
    frequency and decrease cost allow researchers to easily and affordably measure
    hydraulic head allowing for estimates of groundwater discharge to the surface
    (Kalbus et al., 2006). Hydrograph separation can also be used to estimate groundwater
    discharge to streams with high-frequency measurements of stream stage (e.g., Barlow
    and Leake, 2012). Similar to temperature sensors, the ease at which we can deploy
    multiple conductivity sensors and the rate at which they can collect data also
    allow for the determination of groundwater-surface water interaction when conservative
    tracers (e.g., Br) are injected into the system (Kuntz et al., 2011). 4.1.2. Environmental
    signatures The environmental signature of water chemistries, which can now be
    collected with high frequency due to advancements in optical sensor technology,
    can be used to track material sources and flow paths allowing us to discern distinct
    groundwater contributions to surface water using, for example, algal pigments,
    nitrate, orthophosphate, dissolved oxygen, and suspended sediment (Abbott et al.,
    2016; Burns et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2016; Pellerin et al., 2016). Although
    sizeable advancements have been made in sensing dissolved materials, current sensor
    technology is unable to determine particulate nutrient concentrations (Pellerin
    et al., 2016). High frequency water quality data can be used in conjunction with
    discharge data to identify and quantify groundwater contributions of key resources
    controlling ABs. Environmental sensors that are collocated at gage stations are
    especially useful as they may be used together to identify groundwater source
    and relative contributions of key resources which contribute to ABs. For example,
    concentration-discharge relationships based on high-frequency sensor data have
    shown chemostatic nitrate behavior in many agricultural and urban watersheds and
    suggest that legacy storage of nitrogen in groundwater can be sufficiently large
    enough that conservation practices will take a long time to see results (Bieroza
    et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2011). Simultaneous comparison of dynamics of environmental
    tracers such as nitrate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity,
    with respect to the hydrograph can be used to quantify groundwater contributions
    of water quality and quantity and track algal density response. 4.1.3. Stable
    isotopes Advances in our ability to measure stable isotopes (e.g., laser spectroscopy)
    are now enabling source tracking of water and identification of processes controlling
    biogeochemical conditions. For example, water isotopes can be used to differentiate
    source waters using techniques such as end-member mixing analysis (Carroll et
    al., 2018; Klaus and McDonnell, 2013), while the collection of high frequency
    stream water isotope data are now able to reveal travel time distribution of water.
    Recent developments have led to time-variant travel time distribution theory,
    recognizing the non-stationary nature of precipitation events and water storage
    (Botter, 2012; Harman, 2015; Rinaldo et al., 2015; van der Velde et al., 2012).
    This allows for the quantification of young water fractions to characterize catchment
    travel time as a way of bypassing the bias from spatial heterogeneity and temporal
    non-stationary (Jasechko et al., 2016; Kirchner, 2016). Specifically, linking
    transit time distributions (McGuire et al., 2005; McGuire and McDonnell, 2006)
    and storage ages (Botter, 2012; Harman, 2015; Rinaldo et al., 2015; van der Velde
    et al., 2012) with biogeochemical models (e.g., Bio-RT-FluxPIHM; Bao et al., 2017)
    are the leaps that need to be made to test the hypotheses presented here, such
    as the influence of aquifer redox conditions (H1) and rock-water interactions
    (H2) on AB dynamics. Like water isotopes, the ease at which nitrogen isotopes
    (15N) can be measured has also dramatically increased, advancing its use as a
    tracer of water and nutrient sources and biogeochemical processes that affect
    nitrogen species (Sebestyen et al., 2014). When paired with techniques of examining
    elemental stoichiometry (e.g., N, P, OC; Stutter et al., 2018) and elemental concentrations,
    it is possible to deduce both the controls on aquatic biogeochemical condition
    that can influence AB dynamics and the sources of water, especially groundwater
    contributions to surface water. For example, databases such as US Geological Survey
    (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS; https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
    contains groundwater chemistry from sites across the US, which when paired with
    estimates of groundwater discharge to streams can be used to evaluate fluxes of
    solutes from aquifers to streams. 4.1.4. Aquifer micro-and-macro biology Knowledge
    of aquifer biology will be necessary to develop a mechanistic understanding of
    the relationship between groundwater discharge and algal growth because of the
    significant geochemical-microbial couplings that impact groundwater chemistry.
    Such an understanding is essential to predicting feedbacks between algal, microbial,
    and geochemical conditions. Aquifer microbiology can be assessed indirectly using
    groundwater geochemistry. For example, dissolved hydrogen concentration can be
    used as an indicator of microbial processes in aquifers (Chapelle et al., 1995;
    Lovley and Goodwin, 1988). Different groups of microorganisms have different affinities
    for the hydrogen produced during organic matter degradation thus the steady state
    concentration of hydrogen in groundwater may depend on which microbial groups
    are dominant. Groundwater microbial processes can also be evaluated using the
    framework approach described by McMahon and Chapelle (2008), which uses concentrations
    of routinely monitored water quality parameters together with a model of thermodynamic
    hierarchy to predict preferential electron acceptor consumption. Alternatively,
    microbial populations can be directly analyzed using cultivation and molecular
    analyses to assess presence/absence as well as biodiversity metrics, however,
    many of the microorganisms in environmental samples are difficult to cultivate.
    Thus, molecular analyses have greater potential for quantitatively evaluating
    microbial community composition. Quantitative analysis of the presence, abundance,
    biodiversity and functional role of macro-and-micro fauna in aquifers is a relatively
    unexplored research direction (Zeglin, 2015). The use of invertebrates as biomonitors
    of groundwater biogeochemical conditions is an approach with great potential as
    indicators of the susceptibility for algal blooms (Malard et al., 1996). This
    analysis is currently challenging because methods to sample these systems (Dole-Olivier
    et al., 2014), and methods to analyze these systems with metagenomics and metabolomics
    remain costly. However, powerful new molecular tools are now available to evaluate
    micro and macro community composition and identify functional genes and gene expression.
    Those techniques can be used to shed light on the vast metabolic and phylogenetic
    diversity that can exist in aquifer microbiomes (Anantharaman et al., 2016; Castelle
    et al., 2013) as well as identify keystone taxa that may eventually be used to
    predict impacts of groundwater discharge, as well as groundwater microbial community
    composition on algal growth. 4.2. Modeling methods Model development in hydrologic
    flow and reactive transport relevant to ABs has advanced along separate lines.
    Hydrologic flow models focus on solving for storage and fluxes of water in various
    components of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle, ranging from separate groundwater
    and surface water models, to fully-integrated surface/subsurface/atmospheric models
    (e.g., Fatichi et al., 2016). Reactive transport models (RTMs) have centered on
    transport and multi-component biogeochemical reactions typically in “closed” groundwater
    systems without much interaction with “open” watersheds directly receiving precipitation
    and sunlight (Li Li et al., 2017; Steefel et al., 2015). Given the feedbacks between
    physical flow, transport and reaction processes that can all shape the conditions
    for ABs, there is a need to integrate these separate lines of development to not
    only forecast, assess, and manage AB conditions, but to gain fundamental understanding
    of reactive transport in both the surface and subsurface systems. 4.2.1. Hydrologic
    flow models The hydrology community has developed and utilized models for more
    than five decades (e.g., Abbott et al., 1986; Bergström, 1976; Beven, 1989; Brunner
    and Simmons, 2011; Fatichi et al., 2016; Freeze and Harlan, 1969; James, 1972;
    Jarboe and Haan, 1974; Kumar et al., 2009; McDonnell et al., 2007; Qu and Duffy,
    2007; Quinn et al., 1991; Simmons et al., 2020; VanderKwaak and Loague, 2001).
    Recent advances in computational ability has allowed for these models to develop
    towards a simultaneous solution of the governing equations for surface and subsurface
    flow to directly quantify GWSWI. With the integration of surface energy balance,
    the recent introduction of land surface processes into hydrological models marks
    a new advance toward more accurate representation of evapotranspiration (Davison
    et al., 2018; Maxwell and Miller, 2005; Shi et al., 2013). The Soil and Water
    Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, with its coupling with the groundwater model MODFLOW
    (Bailey et al., 2017; Ochoa et al., 2020), can simulate groundwater recharge and
    the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater. While many of these
    models can simulate surface and groundwater interactions, they do not explicitly
    solve the multi-component reactive transport equations that prescribe solute transport
    and biogeochemical reactions that transform nutrients in water. 4.2.2. Reactive
    Transport Models (RTMs) Multi-component RTMs originated in the 1980s and have
    been extensively used in the subsurface geochemistry community (Chapman et al.,
    1982; Chapman, 1982). RTMs explicitly solve flow, transport, and multi-component
    reaction equations within a biogeochemical thermodynamic and kinetic framework
    (Steefel et al., 2015), therefore enabling explicit tracing of spatial and temporal
    evolution of geochemical species in water and solid phases. Built upon the theoretical
    framework for reaction thermodynamics and kinetics (Lichtner, 1985, Lichtner,
    1988), RTMs have since been used as an integration and interpretation tool across
    diverse environments for many processes, including tracer transport, mineral dissolution
    and precipitation, ion exchange, and microbial kinetics (e.g., Jin et al., 2013;
    Meile and Scheibe, 2019; Seigneur et al., 2019). These RTMs have been used in
    “closed” groundwater systems without integration into the surface hydrology dynamics.
    Only recently have RTMs been introduced to integrate the transient hydrological
    conditions in open watersheds (Bao et al., 2017; Singh and Frevert, 2010). In
    particular, the recently developed BioRT-Flux-PIHM (hereafter BioRT) integrates
    processes of land surface interactions, surface hydrology, and multi-component
    reactive transport (Wen et al., 2020; Zhi et al., 2019, Zhi et al., 2020). The
    model enables the shallow soil lateral flow and deep-water exchange with streams,
    transport of solutes (including nutrients, carbon, cations and anions), and biogeochemical
    reactions that leach solutes. The model can quantify groundwater''s contribution
    to surface water bodies, and its role in ABs. As an example, BioRT has been used
    to simulate processes relevant to nitrate, including the leaching of nitrate in
    soils and biogeochemical processes such as denitrification (Zhi and Li, 2020).
    The integration of nitrate data from more than 200 sites in US and the BioRT model
    has led to the Shallow and Deep Hypothesis, which states that the nitrate concentration
    contrasts in shallow soil water and groundwater shape the export patterns (specifically
    concentration-discharge relationship) of nitrate. Models have also been developed
    specifically for coastal regions. For example, the model MOHID, a process-based
    hydrodynamics model for coastal regions (de Pablo et al., 2019), has been coupled
    with ecological models to assess the influence of light and nutrients on phytoplankton
    production in the Tagus estuary (Lisbon, Portugal) (Mateus and Neves, 2008). More
    recently, MOHID has also been augmented with capabilities of simulating sediment
    transport processes and nutrient and ecological processes (Franz et al., 2014;
    Franz et al., 2017). 5. Directions for improving the quantification of groundwater''s
    control over ABs The recent advances made in measurement and modeling of environmental
    systems, as described above, provides opportunities for other advances towards
    improving our understanding and quantifying groundwater''s control over ABs. Here
    we briefly discuss opportunities in measurement and analysis, and modeling that
    can readily achieve significant advances towards these goals. These include the
    development of coupled algal/food-web/nutrient/flow models, the use and integration
    of machine learning analyses methods with these models, and the use and integration
    of DNA and remotely-sensed data in analyses and model application. 5.1. Coupled
    algal/food-web/nutrient/flow models Poorly resolved mechanistic understanding
    and process representation of the coupled food-web and hydrobiogeochemical conditions
    in watersheds currently limits a predictive understanding of food-web structures
    and re-establishment after climate and hydrological perturbations (Bajracharya
    et al., 2014). Although recent modeling developments can simulate GWSWI and reactive
    transport, the microbe-mediated reactions captured by these models are based on
    dynamics relevant to bacteria. Work is needed to advance a coupled algal/food-web/nutrient/flow
    model that can simulate responses to and feedbacks on nutrient-algal conditions
    in a watershed and where watersheds meet the ocean-terrestrial interface. Limiting
    development of this numerical capability is poor conceptual representation and
    limits on our understanding of drivers and controls on ABs. Advancing conceptual
    models of our systems that include and acknowledge the complexity of hydrological
    and food-web conditions as important linked systems that control ABs will be the
    first step towards advancing numerical representation. 5.2. Machine learning Machine
    learning approaches have been used extensively in recent years in earth and environmental
    sciences (Reichstein et al., 2019; Shen, 2018). They have proven to be an effective
    method of gaining insight into complex environmental systems, and is complementary
    to mechanistic modeling (Tahmasebi et al., 2020). Often based on statistical and/or
    analytical methods, they are often less computationally demanding, enabling pattern
    recognitions and identification of influential factors. Machine learning approaches
    can be used to offer insights on controls of groundwater over ABs, which can be
    further used to decide key processes to be included in the mechanism-based modeling
    approaches, enabling efficient model development. New machine learning models
    can also help to reveal important interactions between microbial populations,
    nutrients and AB growth and decline, and provide great potential in places where
    biological-chemical-physical data are all available (Newcomer et al., 2019). Indicators
    of groundwater''s role in ABs could also be detected, providing insight into whether
    groundwater''s contributions need to be considered at all. Overall, machine learning
    techniques can improve our ability to efficiently and effectively quantify groundwater''s
    contribution to ABs. 5.3. DNA data Sampling methods continue to evolve, and new
    methods have recently emerged allowing for use of novel genomic datasets such
    as environmental DNA (eDNA). eDNA is a technique used to indicate total biodiversity
    of a landscape by cataloging microbes to mammals and plants using abundance, genetic,
    and functional biodiversity (Meyer et al., 2019). Community science initiatives,
    such as the California eDNA program (https://ucedna.com/), enables scalable baseline
    biodiversity data collection for freshwater systems in public platforms to build
    biodiversity inventories at state-wide scales. Methods such as eDNA provide promising
    solutions to two difficult problems in freshwater science: 1) measuring the presence
    and abundance of taxa in streams, and 2) measuring the true absence of taxa in
    streams. Building an inventory for a specific stream allows for the detection
    of taxa and the construction of the local food-web and organism community even
    if not directly visible. By creating inventories and quantifying the biodiversity
    and function of aquatic and aquifer taxa, this method can help to reveal the role
    of total biodiversity across aquatic-aquifer systems on controls of ABs. 5.4.
    Remotely sensed data Advances in satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology
    provide unprecedented accessibility to environmental data across large spatial
    areas (Chen and Wang, 2018). Over a dozen satellites currently in orbit are collecting
    data directly relevant to hydrologic conditions, and can therefore be relevant
    to the development of ABs, and several other satellite missions are scheduled
    for launch in the near future (Chen and Wang, 2018; McCabe et al., 2017). UAV
    applications also collect parameters of interest to the development of ABs, including
    surface temperature, geomorphology, and vegetation types (e.g., Cook, 2017; DeBell
    et al., 2015; Lottes et al., 2017). These datasets can help detect the presence
    of ABs, and recent research has begun integrating remotely sensed data into calibration
    of mechanistic models (Chen and Wang, 2018). Further advances in the integration
    of remotely sensed data into model development will improve the representativeness
    and predictions of these models, and thus improve our ability to evaluate groundwater''s
    control over ABs. 6. Conclusions Watersheds sustain life on Earth by supplying
    water, nutrients, and supporting biodiversity. These essential resources are increasingly
    impacted by growth of ABs, harmful and otherwise, driving research into factors
    that affect the frequency, duration, and magnitude of blooms. Although much has
    been learned so far, our review sheds light on the often overlooked role of groundwater
    as a significant knowledge gap in understanding controls of AB development in
    inland aquatic habitats. Nutrient availability and stoichiometry, together with
    environmental stability, are key factors in bloom development and taxonomic dominance.
    But inputs of water and solutes from the surface alone do not decide these factors
    for many inland watersheds as well as coastal waters. Under many circumstances,
    groundwater discharge makes significant contributions. Groundwater generally has
    a significantly longer residence time than surface water, leading to differences
    in the physical and geochemical properties and processes. The long residence time
    of groundwater in the subsurface provides more opportunities for mineral weathering
    and microbial reactions to impact nutrient availability. Groundwater discharge
    can supply nutrients and affect nutrient ratios in surface waters, including nutrients
    that affect algal growth rates and taxonomic dominance such as P, N, Fe, and Si.
    Groundwater can also promote algal growth in surface waters by helping stabilize
    biogeochemical conditions. The impact of groundwater discharge is likely spatially
    and temporally heterogeneous, reflecting the complexity of subsurface environments
    and groundwater-surface water interactions. We hypothesize that factors that decide
    groundwater''s contribution to AB development include the types of microbial reactions
    that occur along the groundwater flow paths, the extent of water-rock interaction,
    and the proportion of groundwater discharge in streamflow. Numerous tools are
    available to help test these hypotheses, including tools that assess groundwater
    composition and microbiology, tools that quantify contributions to streamflow
    from groundwater discharge, and tools that simulate fluid fluxes and biogeochemical
    reactions. Testing these hypotheses will advance our understanding of the roles
    of groundwater discharge on algal growth and will improve our ability to predict
    how changing climate and water resource management will influence bloom frequency
    and toxicity. Therefore, we can use this understanding to refine management practices
    and better prepare for future uncertainties. Groundwater contributions to surface
    water is not the only control on AB development in inland aquatic habitats, but
    our review indicates that it is an underappreciated factor that deserves more
    attention. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have

    we measure we gather data, wherever we have data we have information, and wherever
    we have information we have potential knowledge. However, we cannot assume that
    this knowledge is useful just by ensuring that we measure. The continual growth
    of data volume, velocity and variety has necessitated the development of tools
    that can assure its veracity to meet the criteria defined by its ultimate use.
    Where these tools provide computational functionality that are outside the abilities
    of a human operator, are non-routine and handle data large or complex in characteristics,
    we can define them as ‘smart’. This and analogous terminology, such as ‘intelligent’
    or ‘cyber physical’, has become ubiquitous within the data science community and
    has been embraced by manufacturing and processing industries as the 4th Industrial
    Revolution (Industry 4.0). The water industry is no exception to this and perspectives
    for Smart Water were neatly presented in two recent IWA whitepapers on Digital
    Water (IWA 2019; van Thienen & Savic 2020), as part of their ongoing Digital Water
    Programme. This very much looks at the present and the future of smart technology
    and intelligent management and use of data across the water sector. For over thirty
    years, pockets of academics and practitioners have attempted to ‘smarten’ water
    processes, building on modelling and control foundations, most notably within
    the Industrial Control and Automation (ICA) community. While some traction has
    been made (Olsson 2006), general acceptance and integration of methods by industry
    has been sporadic and limited due to an array of reasons. Nevertheless, we believe
    that the ideas and approaches for smartening water systems are being embraced
    wholesale and data analysis and utilisation is being elevated from the mundane
    to the critical, sitting alongside process and control engineering in the armoury
    of skills required by practitioners in the water industry to meet present and
    future challenges facing the sector with preparedness and resilience. In this
    special issue of Water Science and Technology, 11 papers were selected that contribute
    to a broad discussion and demonstration of state-of-the-art for integration of
    digitalisation and water management processes. Therrien et al. (2020) provide
    an excellent introduction to the concepts embraced in this issue, highlighting
    the necessary steps required to extract applicable intelligence from raw data
    in water resource recovery systems. Sit et al. (2020) undertake a more focused
    review of contemporary deep learning techniques, which considers not only the
    process and challenges but governance and ethical management of data as a resource.
    Icke et al. (2020) developed and tested an Artificial Intelligence approach at
    the Integrated Validation Plant of Singapore''s National Water Agency. With a
    self-learning feedforward algorithm that uses load prediction and machine learning
    for nutrient removal control, they achieved up to 15% reduction of aeration compared
    with conventional feedback control. They also applied quantile regression neural
    network modelling for anomaly detection to deliver data-driven operational support
    for process operators. Eerikäinen et al. (2020) present results from a series
    of interviews with stakeholders working in ICA of wastewater systems. The findings
    of the study echo some of the historical reasons identified as barriers for the
    uptake of machine learning and, more broadly, data analytics and data-driven models
    in the sector. However, given advances in technology and the quantifiable measure
    of their performance, the general feedback from practitioners is one of optimism.
    Antzoulatos et al. (2020) propose a unified framework called SMART-WATER for the
    efficient management of the water supply network. This urban water management
    platform is based on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for remote telemetry and
    control of water consumption in combination with machine learning techniques.
    Consumers and water utilities obtained feedback on water usage, providing an enhanced
    awareness of water consumption. The dimension reduction technique Principal Component
    Analysis (PCA) is slightly older than the activated sludge process, being developed
    by the eminent statistician Karl Pearson in 1901. The adoption of multivariate
    statistics, which includes PCA, by industry in the 1970s was a significant milestone
    towards the use of data-driven approaches, and eventually machine learning, for
    application in monitoring water processing facilities, especially wastewater treatment.
    Kazemi et al. (2020) present a novel, adaptive monitoring approach called Incremental
    PCA that is able to track and detect true process faults (as opposed to disturbances),
    even when those faults are small in comparison to the signal. Using long-term
    datasets, Jones et al. (2020) identify benefits of using real-time sensors in
    small community water systems, where limited compliance monitoring can miss elevated
    nitrate concentrations, and large community water systems that need decision-support
    tools to initiate nitrate management strategies. Carriço et al. (2020) provide
    an overview of the information systems used by Portuguese water utilities to collect,
    store and manage data and propose a possible solution for data integration from
    different information systems to facilitate assessment. An initial platform has
    been presented; however, the authors provide the caveat that scalability problems
    are a risk, depending on the chosen technology. Cardenes et al. (2020) demonstrate
    how a hybrid linear and multi-objective optimisation approach can be used to identify
    key energy consumption elements in a water supply system, and evaluate the amount
    of investment needed to achieve significant operational gains at those points
    in the supply network. As an illustration, an application to the water supply
    system for the city of London show that up to 18% savings in daily energy consumption
    are achievable but the optimal results are sensitive to the financial value placed
    on greenhouse gas emissions. An data-driven model for prediction of biomethane
    shortfall and optimisation of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) requirements from
    anaerobic digestion is presented by Laing et al. (2020). Using one year of historical
    plant data, operational performance was significantly improved resulting in an
    11% increase in financial return. The authors highlight that replacing the retrospective
    optimisation approach used here by a forecasting method would give scope for employing
    the model for short- to mid-term operational planning. Finally, Offiong et al.
    (2020) demonstrate the use of a recurrent artificial neural network approach to
    predict solar powered water taps in sub-Saharan Africa. The use of such a technique
    not only delivers prediction and classification of tap failures, but has an immeasurable
    public health benefit for remote communities relying on the taps as a source of
    clean water. This final paper highlights where we should value the use of Smart
    Water technologies most. They do not reside solely in the domain of data analysts
    or process engineers, for the purpose of reducing operating costs and maximising
    performance, but can be utilised to deliver transformative and simple solutions
    for those that need it most. Smart Water will contribute to delivering global
    solutions that address the greatest water challenges. REFERENCES Antzoulatos G.

    systemsAED2Eutrophication 1. Introduction Estuaries exist at the interface between
    the land and the ocean and host diverse and dynamic habitats across the freshwater-ocean
    continuum (Kurup et al., 1998; Eyre, 2000; Cloern et al., 2017). Estuaries are
    also some of the most degraded coastal ecosystems, with nutrient loading over
    the past decades often causing widespread eutrophication (Howarth and Marino,
    2006). Whilst some estuarine ecosystems are recovering, others continue to experience
    nutrient enrichment that remains a persistent management challenge, with detrimental
    effects on biodiversity, amenity and the health of coastal waters (e.g., Paerl
    et al., 1998; Howarth and Marino, 2006; Roberts et al., 2012). Additionally, estuaries
    are also exposed to an increasingly complex suite of climatic and anthropogenic
    perturbations that alter their hydrology, chemistry and ecological integrity (Wetz
    and Yoskowitz, 2013; Newton et al., 2014). Scientists and estuarine managers are
    seeking improved understanding of ecological responses to these environmental
    perturbations, and are increasingly looking to numerical models for prediction
    and forecasting of the impact of these perturbations in order to guide appropriate
    management actions (Hipsey et al., 2015; Ganju et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017).
    The need to effectively balance ecological objectives with development opportunities
    to support economic and societal growth often confronts managers as a ‘wicked
    problem’ (Patterson et al., 2013; Barnard and Elliott, 2015). Estuarine management
    strategies need to mitigate impacts from natural and human disturbances, and apply
    catchment and water use planning to develop economic initiatives safely and sustainably.
    Good management requires knowledge of the present state of the estuarine condition
    and an understanding of how it will change under future development and altered
    conditions. Accurate observations and future predictions of events and impacts
    that span short- and long-term changes are required for sustainable coastal management
    (Kourafalou et al., 2015b; Testa et al., 2017). Integrated observation and modelling
    systems can be particularly useful when dealing with (extreme) short-term events
    (e.g. flooding or pollution spills), and also when seeking a holistic approach
    to support long-term and complex planning decisions, climate change scenarios,
    and restoration measures (Hipsey et al., 2015; Janssen et al., 2015; Honti et
    al., 2017). There has been an emergence of diverse forecasting systems for managing
    coastal environments in the past decade, supported by improved understanding of
    coastal science and numerical modelling capability (Tonani et al., 2015; Kourafalou
    et al., 2015b; Testa et al., 2017). These modelling systems have been developed
    with varying methods and complexities, including data-driven methods (Kashefipour
    et al., 2005; Chan et al., 2013; Park et al., 2015), deterministic models (Bedri
    et al., 2014) or a combination of both (Brown et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016b).
    Several have been developed specifically for predicting the estuary water quality,
    such as the Huon Estuary and D''Entrecasteaux Channel modelling system (Wild-Allen
    et al., 2010), and the Chesapeake Bay ecological forecasting system (Testa et
    al., 2017). However, to our knowledge, integrated modelling systems that specifically
    focus on real-time forecasting of water quality are not yet common. There are
    two major challenges in building an integrated system for estuarine water quality
    prediction and forecasting. Firstly, the internal physical and biogeochemical
    processes are highly dynamic and complex; the interactions of freshwater pulses
    with ocean water intrusion create sharp horizontal and vertical gradients that
    can challenge model accuracy and demand high spatial resolution. Successful model
    applications require a comprehensive understanding of the estuary system from
    long-term monitoring datasets, before a real-time system can be progressed. Secondly,
    integrated systems require a large amount of forcing data from meteorological
    stations, the coastal ocean, and the surrounding catchment. The external forcing
    data are usually insufficient (e.g. ungauged stormwater inputs) or time-lagged
    (due to laboratory delays in processing nutrient and biological samples), making
    it difficult to accurately specify the model boundary conditions at the landward
    edge; this latter aspect makes a ‘real-time’ system (where model outputs of current
    conditions can guide real-time management responses) less accurate with a heavy
    reliance on assumed conditions in the inflowing water. Innovative approaches are
    required to address this challenge. This paper describes the development and implementation
    of an integrated prediction system for supporting water quality management of
    the Swan Canning Estuary (SCE) in Western Australia, and sets out to explicitly
    document evolution of our understanding of requirements of the model and affiliated
    monitoring programs. We describe multiple workflows (hindcast, forecast, and scenarios)
    that use a diverse set of model-data integration methods to provide useful information
    for managing water quality. The paper concludes by discussing work still required
    to support advanced model calibration and uncertainty assessment. It is hoped
    that this approach to water quality prediction can be used in other contexts,
    where integration of data and models is essential for improved ecosystem management.
    2. The swan-canning estuary system and context for integrated prediction 2.1.
    The study site The SCE is a salt-wedge urban estuary (40 km2), flowing through
    Perth, Western Australia (Fig. 1) and exiting to the Indian Ocean. It is micro-tidal
    (<1 m) with water depth ranging from <1 m in the upper reaches to >20 m at the
    river mouth. The estuary receives water from the Avon and Swan River catchments,
    draining approximately 126,000 km2 (Viney and Sivapalan, 2001; Hennig and Kelsey,
    2015). The Mediterranean climate drives a pronounced seasonality in hydrology,
    including estuarine stratification and salt-wedge dynamics (Stephens and Imberger,
    1996; Kurup et al., 1998), and ecology (Hodgkin, 1987; Hamilton et al., 2006).

    model (WRF); the second top-left picture show the sites of oxygenation plants
    in the upstream. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Water quality
    problems in the SCE date back to the 1940s, when shoreline garbage tips, industrial
    effluents and sewage discharge into the river brought recognition of the need
    for management of this urban waterway. The estuary management has since been inextricably
    linked to water quality issues and evolved with time. Point source pollutants
    were largely addressed during the early period, however, agricultural and urban
    non-point source pollutants continue to drain to the estuary, and can trigger
    algal blooms, especially during warmer months. Management of these non-point source
    pollutants has been the focus for estuarine managers over the last couple of decades
    (Swan River Trust, 1999; Swan River Trust, 2008) and these programs have contributed
    to an improved understanding of the estuary health. A systematic approach to water
    quality monitoring of the SCE system was established in 1995; currently 29 fixed
    sites in the river are monitored weekly (Fig. 1) and 33 sites in the catchment
    are monitored fortnightly, when flowing. Major stream inflows and tides are gauged
    (the latter at Fremantle since 1897 and more recently at the Narrows Bridge) (Fig.
    1). 2.2. Anthropogenic and natural stressors on the SCE system As with other eutrophic
    estuaries and coastal embayments around the world, the SCE exhibits signs of environmental
    stress, such as fish kills, cyanobacterial and dinoflagellate blooms (Hamilton
    et al., 1999; Hamilton, 2000), and the accumulation of organic matter and the
    existence of highly sulfidic conditions in the bottom sediments (Douglas et al.,
    1997; Smith et al., 2007). Nitrogen (N) limits annual productivity with N up to
    20 times more limiting than P in midsummer (Thompson and Hosja, 1996). Denitrification
    has been identified as a significant N sink, though this likely varies with flow
    conditions and extent of hypoxia (Robson et al., 2008). Groundwater inputs are
    also a potential source of nutrients (Linderfelt and Turner, 2001). Historically,
    the estuary has been dominated by high concentrations of less labile humic organic
    matter (e.g., DOC >25 mg L−1) (Fellman et al., 2011), which contributes to marked
    gradients in the light climate (Kostoglidis et al., 2005). However, urbanisation
    in SCE catchments dominated by sandy soils has led to more labile organic matter
    entering the SCE via surface streams and groundwater (Petrone et al., 2009; Petrone
    et al., 2010) and can lead to higher water and sediment oxygen demand (Smith et
    al., 2010). Drainage nutrient intervention initiatives such as constructed wetlands,
    have resulted in nutrient load reductions from priority catchments (Adyel et al.,
    2016), however, the SCE continues to exhibit periods of hypoxia (<2 mg L−1) and
    anoxia (0 mg L−1) with potentially detrimental effects on estuarine biodiversity
    and health (Cottingham et al., 2014). Blooms of the nuisance dinoflagellate Karlodinium
    veneficum (Mooney et al., 2010) regularly occur in the upper reaches during the
    warmer months, when stratified conditions drive remobilization of sediment nutrients
    (Gedaria et al., 2013). Artificial oxygenation has been implemented in the upper
    reaches since 2010, resulting in improved oxygen conditions in those locations
    (Huang et al., 2018). Stream flows in the catchments have declined by >50% since
    the 1970s (Petrone et al., 2010; Silberstein et al., 2012) and the SCE is expected
    to continue to experience a drying climate (Smith and Power, 2014). The past hydrological
    changes have led to the upward movement of the salt-wedge reach, enhancing the
    salinity stratification in the upstream (Huang et al., 2018) and have coincided
    with increased hypoxia frequency (Fig. 2). Whilst general trends are evident,
    of interest is the role of changing flow regimes on water quality. There is a
    notable de-coupling of annual flow, dissolved oxygen (DO) and total chlorophyll-a
    (TCHLA), when the data is explored using a wavelet coherence analysis. Before
    2010, changes in DO closely followed inflows, whilst a half-year lag between the
    inflow and TCHLA peaks existed. However, these relationships became less clear
    after 2010. Understanding the relative impacts of declining inflows, oxygenation,
    increasing urbanisation and continued nutrient discharge on estuarine health has
    remained a key challenge for estuarine managers. Download : Download high-res

    2.3. The needs of water quality modelling system and real-time forecasts The ongoing
    challenges of managing nutrients in a drying climate, alongside other management
    objectives, led to the development of a collaborative approach to estuarine management
    to (i) improve water quality and manage environmental flows; (ii) ensure management
    decisions are based on appropriate knowledge; and (iii) protect, manage and enhance
    SCE biodiversity (Department Parks and Wildlife, 2015). This approach has highlighted
    that improved integration of data collection efforts and modelling tools are critical
    to transcend the current gap between understanding and management of the estuary
    (Hipsey et al., 2015; Lynch et al., 2015). The challenge, however, has been to
    develop a strategy for model integration that allows interrogation of the past,
    provides short-term predictions for response management, and facilitates assessment
    of long-term planning scenarios (Thomson et al., 2017). The development and application
    of integrated models can support decision making by identifying nutrient reduction
    targets (Kim et al., 2014; Waltham et al., 2014), controls on harmful algal blooms
    (Chung et al., 2014; Robson and Hamilton, 2004), public health risks (Hipsey et
    al., 2008), and the quality of aquatic habitat (Brown et al., 2013). Previous
    efforts to develop hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models for the SCE demonstrated
    their potential to improve our understanding of drivers of harmful algal blooms
    and hypoxia (Chan et al., 2002; Robson and Hamilton, 2004; Vilhena, 2013), though
    they were not used for identifying nutrient load targets. These models have had
    a short-term focus or a low level of predictability in terms of current priority
    management areas. Integrated systems modelling aims to synthesize bio-physical
    data and process understanding to directly support decision-making, and requires
    a coupled approach linking ocean, land, and atmosphere sub-domains with the estuary.
    An initial real-time management system was applied to the Perth coastal area and
    the SCE system (Marti and Imberger, 2015), demonstrating the benefit of automated
    modelling workflows and the utility of models for displaying near real-time conditions.
    This implementation focused more on the coastal margin area with less refinement
    for processes occurring in the upper estuary, where many priority management issues
    are focused, but demonstrated a useful “now-cast” system. The challenge posed
    by end-users, however, was to supply a diversity of model outputs spanning past,
    present and future conditions that were relevant to a range of stakeholders, including
    estuary managers, high-level policy makers, and the community (e.g., citizen scientists,
    recreational fishers etc.). The strategic developments of the next-generation
    Swan-Canning Estuarine Response Model (SCERM) and Swan Canning Estuary Virtual
    Observatory (SCEVO) were therefore undertaken to support decision making related
    to the management challenges, and to contribute toward the goal of building a
    holistic and practical framework. By integrating findings from various field investigations
    and the extensive long-term monitoring data, the model offers the potential to
    synthesize our knowledge of estuarine function across a broad range of disciplines
    and spatio-temporal scales. 3. The SCEVO structure and components The SCEVO system
    consists of three major components (Fig. 3): (1) the water quality model SCERM,
    which contains the coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical numerical models that are
    used to obtain 3D evolving states of the estuary; (2) the Aquatic Real-Time Management
    System (ARMS, Zephyr Systems Pty Ltd.), which is responsible for automatically
    downloading and processing the data required for model inputs, executing the estuary
    and supporting models, and managing the preparation of outputs for visualization;
    and (3) a web portal displaying temporal and spatial information against an array
    of biophysical characteristics, and acting as a waterway information window for
    public use. Download : Download high-res image (815KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. The work flows of the hind-cast mode and fore-cast mode in the water
    quality prediction. The system involved the curation of several parallel workflows,
    operating at different frequency, each with different setup data requirements,
    and with specific end-uses. These include: (1) a hindcast mode that runs when
    all the necessary forcing data are available and simulations can be archived,
    (2) a forecast mode that runs daily and serves for predicting short-term response
    (5-day forecast) and identifying ecological risks (e.g. the likelihood of harmful
    algal bloom or hypoxia), and (3) a scenario mode where estuary response functions
    are generated over a range of boundary values of interest (e.g. nutrient loading,
    inflow magnitude, sea level rise). The following sections describe the major functional
    features in the SCEVO system. 3.1. The water quality response model SCERM SCERM
    consists of a 3D flexible-mesh (finite volume) hydrodynamic model using the TUFLOW-FV
    platform (BMTWBM, 2013), which is dynamically coupled with the AED2 water quality
    model. TUFLOW-FV accounts for variations in water level, horizontal salinity distribution
    and vertical density stratification in response to tides, inflows, salt-wedge
    dynamics and surface thermodynamics. The mesh consists of triangular and quadrilateral
    elements of different size that are suited to simulating areas of complex estuarine
    morphometry. The finite volume numerical scheme solves the conservative integral
    form of the nonlinear shallow water equations in addition to the advection and
    transport of scalar constituents such as salinity and temperature as well as the
    state variables from the coupled biogeochemical model. The equations are solved
    in 3D with baroclinic coupling from both salinity and temperature using the UNESCO
    equation of state (Fofonoff and Millard, 1983). The temporal integration scheme
    is explicit and uses both mode splitting and dynamically varying time-steps to
    maximize computational efficiency subject to Courant and Peclet stability constraints.
    Turbulent mixing of momentum and scalars has been calculated using the Smagorinsky
    scheme in the horizontal plane and through coupling with the General Ocean Turbulence
    Model (GOTM) for vertical mixing. The second-order k-ε turbulence closure scheme
    was adopted in GOTM with the generic length scale model for dissipative length
    scale (Umlauf and Burchard, 2003). The SCERM configuration of the AED2 water quality
    modules (Fig. 4) simulates the C, N, P, and DO budgets, including resolving the
    inorganic nutrients and organic matter fractions (see Appendix 1). The development
    of the model configuration over time has been based on management needs and our
    evolving understanding of the SCE system. Initially, the model was configured
    to focus on the behavior of dissolved oxygen in the upper reaches as the primary
    management target was to address hypoxia issues (Hipsey et al., 2016b). The priority
    was therefore to capture salt-wedge formation, the sediment oxygen demand, and
    the basic organic matter biogeochemistry. Parameters were adjusted based on values
    from in-situ investigations, literature review and manual calibration to fit the
    available monitoring data from 2008 to 2010 (see Appendix 2). The simulation was
    run for a further two years as a validation, giving a total simulation period
    from 2008 to 2012, and allowing the model performance to be assessed in both wet
    and dry years. In the second revision, the organic matter was extended to better
    resolve labile and refractory components, to include photolysis and also the demarcation
    of representative sediment zones (Huang et al., 2017). The simulation period was
    extended from 2015 to 2016. Several priority areas were identified for improving
    model accuracy and capability, including sediment resuspension, dinoflagellate
    vertical migration, and seagrass habitat suitability. Download : Download high-res
    image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Swan-Canning Estuarine
    Response Model diagram. With that in mind, the SCERM was further developed to
    include processes representing sediment resuspension, phytoplankton motility,
    atmospheric deposition, and the seagrass-sediment resuspension feedback (Adams
    et al., 2018) tailored for Halophila ovalis. At this stage of model application,
    five phytoplankton groups (cyanobacteria, green algae, dinoflagellate, cryptophyte,
    and diatom) were included, in order to improve the prediction of key risks associated
    with low oxygen and harmful algal bloom formation. Each phytoplankton group was
    simulated with common mathematical approaches in growth, decay, and sedimentation.
    The distinction between groups was made by adoption of group''s specific parameters
    for environmental dependencies, and/or enabling options such as vertical migration
    or N fixation. Readers interested in the mathematical parameterisations in the
    AED modules and other details of the water quality model are also referred to
    Hipsey et al. (2016a) and Hipsey et al. (2019). 3.2. Water quality hindcast The
    hindcast operation mode of SCEVO is designed to update the model validation, and
    archive model outputs as a reference simulation that can be accessed by end-users
    (Fig. 3). These simulations use observational data as much as possible for boundary
    forcing to limit error in boundary condition assumptions. For all simulations,
    the model requires forcing by boundary conditions representing oceanic, meteorological
    and catchment inflow conditions at the locations indicated in Fig. 1. Tidal elevations
    at the ocean boundary are set using the Fremantle tide gauge (Department of Transport,
    Station Number: 62230). Surface meteorological data (solar radiation, wind, air
    temperature, humidity, and rain) with hourly resolution was taken from the Department
    of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) South Perth Station and
    applied uniformly across the domain. Flow data at the eight inflows, depicted
    in Fig. 1, were obtained from the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation
    (http://wir.water.wa.gov.au, Station IDs: 616011, 616027, 616082, 616084, 616086,
    616088, 616178, 616189). Water quality attributes must also be provided at the
    inflows and oceanic boundary; these are created by interpolating data from the
    nearest station to a daily time-step, or, where possible, using a data-driven
    (machine-learning) model for nutrient concentration predictions. In recent years,
    a large number of machine learning approaches have been widely used for prediction
    of different hydrological properties such as water temperature (St-Hilaire et
    al., 2012; Yaseen et al., 2018), rainfall (Kuok et al., 2018; Sulaiman and Wahab,
    2018), and streamflow (Humphrey et al., 2016; Isik et al., 2013; Noori and Kalin,
    2016). Machine-learning methods simulate relationships purely from the data structure
    (Maier et al., 2014) and have the ability to incorporate both numerical or categorized
    variables, which provide a flexible way to simulate varied hydrological properties
    and make up missing boundary condition data. In our system the gradient boosting
    machines (GBM) model was used to forecast flow and nutrients (Fig. 5). GBM is
    an ensemble model that combines multiple decision tree models to improve prediction
    performance (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2010; Singh et al., 2014), and has been found
    to achieve higher accuracy in water quality prediction when compared to other
    machine learning methods (Wang et al., 2016a). A single decision tree mode is
    built to split the dataset into different sub-groups (Breiman et al., 1984). GBM
    iteratively generates a sequence of decision tree models to reduce the prediction
    error of the last iteration. More detailed descriptions of the mathematical formulation
    and resampling method of GBM model can be found in Friedman, 2001, Friedman, 2002.
    The generated base flow, quick flow, total flow and precipitation were applied
    to build intermediate GBM models to generate data for missing nutrient species.
    In this study, TP, TN, DOC, NH4, NOx and DON were selected as the simulated variables
    (Wang et al., in review). Download : Download high-res image (177KB) Download

    method to predict catchment inflows and their nutrient concentrations. Additional
    internal boundary conditions are also implemented for the oxygenation plant inputs,
    one each at Guildford and Caversham (Fig. 1). Inflow oxygen loads were input at
    the bottom of the column of cells at each location, based on operation logs provided
    by the plant operators. The delivery of the hindcast mode is delayed by approximately
    one month due to the time-lag in the collecting and processing of the water quality
    monitoring data required for inflow boundary specification, and model validation
    updates. Therefore, this mode operates at the end of each month, after all required
    datasets are added to the database, and processed into the required format to
    force the model. The raw model output files are archived after the runs finish
    and ready to be revisited as they are required for water quality management purposes
    or future uses. Beyond validation, post-processing of the model is possible at
    individual sites, or for estuary regions of specific interest to management using
    user-definable shape-files that are able to summarize statistical properties of
    model outputs in all cells within the region. This is used for defining estuary
    water quality responses to driving factors, as required for development of regional
    specific nutrient budgets and estuary response functions as described in more
    detail in Section 3.4. 3.3. Water quality forecast The main target of the forecast
    is delivering regular (daily) updates of recent and likely future estuary water
    quality conditions, enabling stakeholders to track the effects of storms, floods
    or other events driven by climate and catchment inputs, and to be prepared for
    the changes in water quality. The simulation window is 10 days and configured
    to reproduce the estuary water quality conditions for the past 5 days and to forecast
    conditions for the next 5 days. The key technical challenge in running the daily
    forecast mode is how to best assign the required model inputs in both near real-time
    and future conditions. To tackle this issue, multiple environmental models and
    methods across weather, ocean, and catchment were integrated to generate accurate
    boundary forcing time-series. Firstly, for short-term predictions of estuary conditions
    it is important to resolve the variability in weather conditions across the extent
    of the domain. Therefore, the Global Forecast System (GFS) model output (http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/data/gfs4/)
    is downloaded at 6-h intervals and pre-processed into a downscaled Weather Research
    and Forecasting (WRF) simulation each night. The WRF model runs in forecast mode,
    providing a weather forecast for the next five days. Two nested domains covering
    the SCERM domain with two-way nesting are configured for WRF, with horizontal
    resolutions of 10 and 2 km, respectively. Each of the two domains employs 29 stretched
    vertical layers, with the top of the model extending to atmosphere pressure and
    with higher resolution at the first kilometre to the surface to capture boundary
    layer processes. Model time steps are 250 s and 50 s, respectively. The 30-s resolution
    USGS geographical land-use data that comes with WRF is used. Lateral boundary
    conditions (meteorological conditions) for the interior domains (see Fig. 1 inset)
    are derived from the surrounding domain. The relevant surface meteorological conditions
    output from WRF are then internally interpolated onto the hydrodynamic model''s
    mesh within TUFLOW-FV. Secondly, accurate oceanic data at the ocean-side boundary
    is necessary to capture changes in ocean forcing, including changing tidal conditions,
    continental shelf waves and marine heat waves. The estuary model is therefore
    nested within a Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) simulation for the Perth
    region. The ROMS model covers the western region of Australia at ~1.5–2.5 km horizontal
    resolution for the big model domain, with additional downscaling to 500 m resolution
    for the Perth region. Lateral boundary conditions for the outer ROMS model are
    updated daily from the global HYCOM model forecasts. The ROMS coastal model is
    also forced with a regional WRF model and provides forecast boundary conditions
    for water level, temperature and salinity at the ocean side. More information
    of the ROMS introduction and outputs can be viewed via the link: http://coastaloceanography.org/.
    Thirdly, the inflow rates from the catchments inputs, and the associated water
    quality must be provided for the 10-day simulation, updated each day. Whilst near
    real-time flow data is available for most of the catchment inflows, rapid changes
    in weather and rainfall mean that flow conditions can change rapidly, and the
    ability to anticipate the effects of these changes are essential to this mode
    of SCEVO. Furthermore, prediction of water quality properties in the freshwater
    discharges is the key challenge in setting up the boundary conditions of the forecast
    model due to the complication of catchment land-use and water quality responses
    to precipitation. Implementation of a catchment model could be used to predict
    inflow rates and TN/TP concentrations (e.g. Hennig and Kelsey, 2015), but generally
    such models are not able to provide more detailed resolution of the nutrient pools
    such as organic and inorganic nutrient concentrations, which are critical to force
    the SCERM model. Therefore, we extended the machine learning method that has been
    described in the hindcast workflow to predict the nutrient concentrations (Fig.
    5). In the real-time forecasting system, 10 days of precipitation (outputs from
    WRF) and 5 days of flow data from the field were collected for the flow and nutrient
    simulation. For the flow and nutrient forecasting, a daily flow forecasting GBM
    model was first built which used previous 5 days flow data, temporal data, and
    precipitation as inputs to generate flow for next 5 days. The base flow and quick
    flow were then calculated according to the generated flow and precipitation. The
    generated discharge and WRF rainfall data were then used to drive the same data-driven
    method as described in the hindcast to predict the nutrient concentrations in
    the inflows for the next 5 days. 3.4. Estuary response functions The above two
    modes of model operation and integration with monitoring data seek to test the
    model and provide short-term predictions, but this does not satisfy the needs
    of stakeholders seeking to make improved decisions about land development strategy
    and investment in catchment and estuary restoration initiatives. This is particularly
    the case in urban estuaries where regulators may be trying to, for example, encourage
    improved land-use planning and implementation of water-sensitive urban design.
    In this case, long-term scenario simulations are carried out with models forced
    with hypothetical future climate and catchment inflow conditions, though these
    are less well defined and the large number of potential permutations make automating
    long-term predictions difficult. Therefore, we prepare a range of estuary response
    functions (ERFs) that link critical water variables in estuary sub-domains with
    changes in boundary forcing associated with inflow amount and nutrient loads.
    This allows users to quickly identify the potential scale of impact of a changing
    water or nutrient inputs in a specific estuary region. 4. Results 4.1. Catchment
    inflow and nutrient predictions The accuracy of the machine-learning approach
    in predicting discharge, daily TN, and daily TP concentrations in the upper Swan
    River was assessed using pre-2015 data for training, and 2015–2017 data for evaluating
    model performance. The overall trends of flow and nutrients were captured well
    (Fig. 6), although some extremely high values in the testing data were under-estimated,
    most likely due to limited data ranges in the training data. The prediction of
    TN/TP loadings using 5-day lagged rainfall and flow data was also compared against
    monitored nutrient data, where the model performance is generally well within
    certain range (Fig. 7), but the method failed to predict some extreme values,
    possibly due to, again, the limited data range in the training datasets. However,
    the performance of the machine learning method will improve with the amount of
    available data from the ongoing monitoring programs. Download : Download high-res

    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) 4.2. SCERM performance The performance of SCERM
    in reproducing the estuary states had been extensively assessed with a total of
    53 monitoring sites (regular monitoring sites and also event-based monitoring
    sites), for 14 measured water quality attributes, and where possible surface and
    bottom values were individually assessed. Full validation against monitoring data
    has been conducted for 2008–2012 (Hipsey et al., 2016a) and 2015–2016 (Huang et
    al., 2017). Overall, the model was able to accurately reproduce salinity and temperature
    in the estuary, and captured well the variations in dissolved oxygen and some
    of the nutrient pools such as TP, PO4, and reactive silica (RSi), suggesting that
    in its present form, the model is suitable for assessing management scenarios
    associated with different oxygenation regimes, nutrient load management or climate
    change. We present below results relevant to hypoxia and phytoplankton biomass,
    but direct readers to the above reports for the detailed results. A comparison
    of modelling results from the moderately wet 2008 and the particularly dry 2010,
    with measurements of salinity (Fig. 8), demonstrates that the model well captured
    the spatio-temporal distribution of salinity stratification and hypoxia in the
    salt wedge. In 2008 the estuary was stratified from April to July (end of the
    dry season), after which the salt wedge was forced downstream to the lower part
    of the modelling domain (0–20 km from the Narrows Bridge) due to the strong catchment
    inflows. In contrast, in 2010, low flows led to the salt wedge extending further
    upstream with a strong stratification maintained until September. Furthermore,
    the stratification modelling performed well in the regions of hypoxia/low oxygen,
    indicating that the model was fit for purpose for simulating the estuary response
    to management measures targeting hypoxia. Download : Download high-res image (535KB)

    with weekly interval while the model output was with 2-h interval. The model performance
    was additionally validated over the period from January 2015 to June 2016 with
    identical parameterization (Huang et al., 2017). For this period, the average
    discrepancy between the model and the observed data (mean absolute error, MAE)
    was mostly under 2.2 °C for water temperature, 5.0 psu for salinity, 1.8 mg L−1
    for DO, and 8.2 μg L−1 for TCHLA (Fig. 9), all of which are relatively small compared
    to their seasonal ranges. Model performance was generally better in the main basins
    of the estuary compared to its tributaries, where high variability and traditional
    model error metrics are challenged by small errors in timing. Download : Download

    to predict water quality variables in estuary sub-domains in response to changes
    in boundary forcing, and therefore provide a simple and quick assessment of the
    occurrence of some target events. The first application example of ERF presented
    here for management is the response curves of benefit of improving the oxygen
    levels in the water from the oxygenation plant inputs (Fig. 10a). As introduced
    earlier, oxygenation plants had been built to tackle the hypoxia often observed
    in the upstream of the Swan River. Regular monitoring of water quality and intensive
    operational trials around the plants showed obvious improvements in oxygen status
    due to artificial oxygenation, but that was not sufficient to provide a quantitative
    assessment of the effectiveness of artificial oxygenation. The modelling system
    was therefore applied to assess the oxygen load with various operational regimes
    to reach the management goals with optimum oxygen load and cost (Huang et al.,
    2018). The assessment result shows that the ‘benefit area’ (benthic area in the
    upper region of Swan River saved from hypoxia conditions compared to a ‘no oxygenation’
    scenario) increased with the oxygen input from the plants. It also shows the increase
    of average areal benefit had diminishing returns with the increase in the total
    oxygen input. This result can act as an informative tool for guiding oxygenation
    plant operation. Download : Download high-res image (739KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. (a) predicted benthic areas saved from hypoxia with hypothetical
    oxygen inputs from the oxygenation plants; (b) predicted bottom DO concentrations
    at the upper Swan River as a response to the daily inflow rates; (c) predicted
    TCHLA concentrations (weekly average in the upper Swan region) in response to
    DIN loading from catchment and water temperature. The surface plot shows the quadratic
    polynomial regression of modelled TCHLA to DIN loading and water temperature (r = 0.2840,
    p = 0.0479). The second example is the response of DO concentrations in the bottom
    water of the upper Swan River to the daily inflow rates (Fig. 10b), summarized
    from the modelling simulations in the period 2015–2016. The results indicate that
    the inflow rate was a dominant factor affecting the oxygen levels above the river
    bed, as the dry weather pushed the salt-wedge upstream (Fig. 8) and enhanced stratification
    in this region. This ERF can work as a simple hypoxia warning tool based on inflow
    rates alone. The last example is the change in TCHLA in response to a range of
    water temperatures and DIN loading from the 2008–2012 and 2015–2016 simulations
    (Fig. 10c). The results indicate that the phytoplankton growth favored conditions
    with higher DIN loading and high water temperature. There was a decrease of TCHLA
    with DIN loading when the water temperature was <12 degrees (winter time), thought
    to be a result of the flushing effect of higher inflows and the slow growth of
    phytoplankton at this time. Note that this is a preliminary assessment for demonstration
    of the model outputs for decision support, and further focused validation, for
    example, to include summer flooding events, are needed to improve the prediction
    ranges and accuracy. If combined with other environmental conditions such as salinity
    and phosphorus concentrations, a more accurate ERF set can be built with data-driven
    methods to provide quick and more accurate empirical prediction for occurrence
    of TCHLA and various phytoplankton species (e.g. Brown et al., 2013). 4.4. The
    SCEVO web portal The real-time spatio-temporal distribution of key water quality
    parameters (e.g. water temperature, salinity, DO, TCHLA, turbidity, NO3, PO4)
    are presented on a web portal (https://swan.science.uwa.edu.au) through animations,
    sheet and curtain views, and time series plots (Fig. 11). End-users can access
    the water quality display through the “current condition” on the “model dashboard”
    tab then choose the target domain or specific site to display. The website places
    this in context with useful material for understanding the estuary history, science,
    and links to other data resources related to the water quality management in the

    quality forecasting system for an estuarine environment to meet a range of specific
    end-uses of model outputs. Our example shows that integrated prediction for estuary
    water quality is highly context dependent, with managers seeking predictions from
    daily (e.g. harmful algal bloom risk warning) to seasonal (e.g. hypoxia forecasting)
    to decadal scales (e.g. climate change). These varied spatio-temporal scales of
    interest and the multiple roles of the estuary to meet ecological, economic, and
    social needs have meant that it has been hard to adopt one single approach to
    model-data integration. Therefore, a synthetic framework to integrate the monitoring
    data and forecasting systems was needed (Fig. 12). This framework has been designed
    to demonstrate potential pathways for integration of monitoring and modelling
    systems, guided by the end-uses. The framework assimilates monitoring data into
    the multiple prediction workflows (hindcast, forecast, scenarios) for the various
    end-uses of model outputs, while applying a common platform and unique approach
    to harmonizing diverse sets of data. In this section, we expand on key aspects
    of the framework and the recent advances in monitoring and modelling technologies,
    to explore how the model-data integration can be improved and better serve water
    quality management. Download : Download high-res image (831KB) Download : Download

    models, prediction modes and ultimate end-uses. 5.1. Improvements of the hindcast
    Near term efforts in the development of SCEVO will continue to focus on the hindcast
    of target variables. An ongoing challenge is the continued development and validation
    of the 3D model with a view toward increasing its performance. The development
    and improvement of the forecasting system closely followed the understanding of
    the estuarine ecosystem and its internal biogeochemical processes. For example,
    a fine-scale survey on the sediment types and benthic vegetation can help to improve
    the zonal settings in the model and improve the water-sediment flux estimation.
    Other efforts could be facilitated by direct incorporation of data streams from
    existing monitoring systems in the SCE, or by employment of new observation technologies
    to improve the understanding of SCE at finer scales. Monitoring data, including
    boundary data for driving the models and estuary data for physical and biogeochemical
    properties, is essential to understand the estuarine system response to external
    forcing and to set up and assess the models. Regular monitoring programs of estuarine
    water quality variables featuring weekly or longer time intervals allows for tracking
    long term trends in water quality and brings about an understanding of the system
    evolution over extended periods of time. It has also been used extensively for
    re-analysis and management planning. However, these programs are inadequate to
    capture variation in finer-scale hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes (e.g.
    mixing, diel metabolism) (Tait et al., 2017). Recent advances of sensors measuring
    hydrological and water quality properties has made automatic high-frequency measurements
    of key water quality parameters (e.g. DO, chlorophyll-a, turbidity) possible (Marcé
    et al., 2016). Such a high-frequency (10-min interval) sensor for DO measurement
    has been recently installed in the SCE at a shallow littoral site (~2 m deep)
    with benthic vegetation to investigate diurnal DO variation (Fig. 13). The high-frequency
    measurement has shown strong DO diurnal variations, indicating intense metabolism
    from benthic productivity and/or vertical phytoplankton migration. However, this
    intense variation was not evident when looking at the regular monitoring data
    (weekly) or the model output (hourly) at a nearby monitoring site located at the
    estuary center. This comparison highlights the importance of knowledge at finer
    scales to resolve the drivers and controls on the local biogeochemical recycling.
    It also highlights the challenge of validating model performance with sparse weekly
    field data while strong temporal variations are being modelled. Download : Download

    measurements (10 min interval). (c) The box plot compares the DO saturation from
    the various sources. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Another aspect
    of the integration development focused on the integration of high-frequency sensor
    data to the model to better quantify metabolic processes such as primary productivity
    and respiration. Since many process-based models tend to be over-parameterized
    (Arhonditsis et al., 2008), more diverse and high-resolution observations create
    advantages for testing the rigor of models at scales relevant to the dominant
    underlying processes (e.g., Kara et al., 2012; Bruesewitz et al., 2015). To achieve
    this aim, an in situ sensor platform is being deployed in the SCE that will report
    high-frequency changes in key water quality parameters including chlorophyll-a,
    salinity, oxygen, temperature, PAR, fDOM, and pCO2. New workflows to use the high-frequency
    data streams to estimate productivity and respiration are being developed, which
    will support further connections between data-driven and process-based model approaches
    and ultimately lead to more “process-inspired” calibration and validation of the
    SCERM model. 5.2. Improvements of the forecast Recent advances in remote monitoring
    technology have also greatly improved real-time capabilities for monitoring water
    quality parameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll, and temperature (Glasgow et
    al., 2004; Kourafalou et al., 2015a; Palmer et al., 2015; Lim and Choi, 2015).
    Such data also offers great potential to inform aspects of estuarine aquatic models
    due to the limiting characteristics of spatial sparsity, patchiness, and time
    dependence of regular monitoring data. With sufficient data density, next steps
    include efforts to constrain the model using data assimilation schemes. For example,
    the problem of cumulative error in the modelling forecast cascading through the
    nested model systems could be managed with an Ensemble Kalman Filter approach
    for state updating (Fujita et al., 2007), although this would be computationally
    difficult with our current run-times. Methods to develop empirical environmental-faunal
    functions based on current conditions and forecasted projections of estuary state
    to allow near real-time visualizations of metrics relevant to estuary health are
    also under development. This can serve as an early warning for deleterious conditions
    and encourage community engagement with the estuary. Hybrid empirical-mechanistic
    approaches can be adopted to generate forecasts for ecological events that cannot
    be mechanistically modelled at the moment (e.g. fish kills, jellyfish blooms)
    due to our limited understanding of the many factors regulating their presence
    and abundance. Although the exact sequence of events leading to a species presence
    and abundance are still not fully understood, statistically significant empirical
    relationships have been established between organism occurrences and relevant
    environmental variables. For example, Decker et al. (2007) used estuary temperature
    and salinity to estimate the probability of sea nettle (C. quinquecirrha) and
    overall 86.7% of the estimates were correctly predicted. Brown et al. (2013) reported
    successful empirical forecasts of a range of plankton species based on water temperature,
    salinity, or nutrient data. These base environmental factors can be easily extracted
    from the SCERM outputs and, once a satisfying empirical model is built, can be
    used for early-warning management of the estuary. By applying these early-warning
    functions, it is hoped the system can ultimately provide more useful information
    to the citizens who are interested in recreational fishing and swimming, therefore
    encouraging more community engagement with how this environment is working. 5.3.
    Improvements of the environmental response functions Lastly, the longer term challenges
    faced by the estuary system, including the changing hydrology (sea level rise
    and reduced runoff) and changes to catchment management can still benefit from
    information embodied in the high-resolution simulations reported above, however,
    they require facility to use synthetic boundary conditions and demand a longer-term
    view. This has traditionally been a challenge due to computational demands, but
    through the development of ERFs the model-data system can be applied as a “reduced”
    model for integration with high level decision-making, and impact assessment of
    long term catchment model scenarios. For SCEVO this is still in its infancy but
    has been useful to inform our understanding of hypoxia. Future efforts include
    multiple scenario simulations with predicted sea level rise using the long-term
    Fremantle tide record (Kuhn et al., 2011) and projected climate change, in order
    to forecast the phytoplankton dynamics, and development of hypoxia and internal
    nutrient dynamics in response to the changes in catchment nutrient loading and
    composition (Zhu et al., 2017). 5.4. Application to other estuarine systems The
    system presented herein is evolving but nonetheless can serve as a template for
    helping managers and model developers plan for investing in integrated model software
    and data collection hardware. When designing the system, it was with the vision
    that the system could be feasibly applied to not only the Swan-Canning estuary
    but also other estuarine systems that have suffered from similar water quality
    degradation. For example, the models included in the SCEVO system are common models
    in their fields; the water quality modules for biogeochemical processes are generic
    mechanistic balance equations; and the water quality problems (hypoxia and eutrophication)
    to tackle are common management targets. Challenges encountered during the SCEVO
    development include the complex estuarine ecosystem, issues associated with ungauged
    inputs and delayed water quality data, and diverse stakeholder demands on the
    system. These challenges are common in many urban estuary systems, and the example
    provided in this study has made steps toward solving these challenges: intensive
    monitoring and research activities to understand the estuary science; data-driven
    methods to fill-in information gaps at the catchment inputs; and separating modelling
    predictions and workflows for short- and long-term management needs. 6. Conclusions
    This paper explains the development of a new water quality forecasting system
    for the Swan-Canning Estuary, an urban eutrophic estuary located in Western Australia.
    We showed that with the improvements in the monitoring technology and data streams,
    the understanding of water science, and the fast development in environmental
    models, integrated modelling systems aiming at water quality forecasting are now
    feasible measures for estuary management. The approach of linking data with three
    parallel workflows has advanced to support decision making and restoration measures
    by providing hindcast, forecast, and environmental response functions to fit the
    diverse set of short- and long-term management needs. We identified that the major
    issues when building such an estuary real-time systems are: (1) the capability
    to simulate the internal physical and biogeochemical processes with complicated
    bathymetry and highly productive systems, this is to be solved by sufficient monitoring
    data, scientific investigations, and modelling practice; (2) insufficiency and
    time lagging of boundary monitoring system, this is to be solved by integration
    of environmental models and methods across multiple disciplines of meteorology,
    coastal ocean, and catchment input. The modelling methods described in this study
    can also be applied to other estuarine systems to assist water quality management.

    Lake Nicaragua, located at the border line between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, is
    ranked the largest freshwater lake in Central America. The water quality condition
    in this lake has been deteriorating over the past decades, mainly due to farming
    activities, deforestation, and uncontrolled/unregulated disposal of municipal
    wastewater into the lake. Moreover, the Tipitapa River connects Lake Nicaragua
    to the highly-polluted Lake Managua upstream, exposing it to the constant discharge
    of pollutant plumes driven by the natural landscape (World Bank, 2013). In addition
    to some small towns in the Lake Nicaragua watershed, big urbanized regions, such
    as Granada, Rivas, and Juigalpa, discharge their domestic sewage and industrial
    wastewater into Lake Nicaragua directly or through channels (World Bank, 2013).
    Moreover, fertile soil conditions in the lake watershed have been fostering the
    agricultural industry since the precolonial age, providing another long-term source
    of water quality contamination for the lake. For instance, areas dedicated to
    agricultural cropping, plantation, and cattle farming near the Chontales, Boaco,
    and Rivas may deliver an enormous amount of fertilizer directly into the lake,
    thus significantly increasing the eutrophication problem in the lake (World Bank,
    2013). Water quality deterioration has been observed recently around the southern
    part of the lake, partially caused by the unlimited use of fertilizers on plantations.
    Another contamination source of the lake water could be due to fish farming of
    tilapia, which generates large amounts of waste and thus increases the eutrophication
    potential. The continuous deterioration of water quality in Lake Nicaragua is
    a crucial issue in water quality management that could affect the safe drinking
    water supply. Frequent monitoring of the water quality status to characterize
    eutrophication conditions in this lake on a near real-time basis is crucial in
    such an expansive lake and may be a costly and tedious mission without using satellite
    remote sensing. Remote sensing for earth observation is challenging due to many
    dynamic environmental factors such as aerosols, sun glint, clouds, and others
    (Gordon and Wang, 1994, Moore et al., 2000, Wang and Bailey, 2001). It is thus
    noticeable that obtaining a spatial complete, clear image over the study area
    with one single sensor observation is by no means an easy task. This is especially
    true in the tropical and subtropical regions where heavy cloud cover emerges frequently
    in all seasons, making it difficult to collect comprehensive information on a
    target based on a single instrument''s observations. This is exactly the case
    with the cloud coverage at Lake Nicaragua in Central America, which became an
    issue for consecutive water quality monitoring with high temporal resolution (Fig.
    1). Since the 2000s, the remote sensing community has been experiencing a regime
    shift to create scientific quality remote sensing data encompassing measurements
    from multiple satellite missions via data fusion or merging on one hand (Fargion
    and McClain, 2002), and to conduct intelligent feature extraction with the aid
    of machine learning or data mining algorithms on the other hand (Chang et al.,
    2009, Chang et al., 2012, Chang et al., 2013). Download : Download high-res image

    and (b) August 18, 2013 (wet season). Note that cloud (white area) impacts were
    severe over the lake in the wet season. (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) Although data fusion with multiple satellite imagery can synergistically
    advance the understanding of a dynamic environment by improving either spatial,
    temporal or spectral resolution of image data, possible data gaps may still exist
    due to either internal (e.g., instrument mechanical failure) or external (e.g.,
    cloud contamination) factors hindering the remote sensing for earth surface observation.
    The process of blending information from multiple sources into a new dataset is
    thus commonly referred to as data fusion for better spatial, temporal, and/or
    spectral resolution. The concept of image or data fusion was initialized in the
    1990s (Shen, 1990, Pohl and van Genderen, 1998). In the early 2000s, Waltz (2001)
    and Luo et al. (2002) formalized the principles and practices of image and spatial
    data fusion. Data merging research formally began from the data merger activities
    undertaken by the Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for Biological and Interdisciplinary
    Studies (SIMBIOS) project in 2002 (NASA, 2002). Later, the normalized water-leaving
    radiance from Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was merged to support a semi-analytical bio-optical
    ocean color model for mapping the ocean chlorophyll concentrations (Maritorena
    and Siegel, 2005, Maritorena et al., 2010). Very recently, to cope with these
    gaps caused by cloud coverage, data merging has been used to improve the spatial
    and temporal coverage, providing effective methods such as the Spectral Information
    Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) (Bai et al., 2016a). In the first endeavor
    of implementing the SIASS algorithm, three cross-mission sensors, including the
    Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP and MODIS
    onboard Terra and Aqua, provide a synergistic opportunity to enhance temporal
    and spatial coverage by merging their complementary observations (Bai et al.,
    2016a, Bai et al., 2016b). In addition, algorithms like SMart Information Reconstruction
    (SMIR) can also be used to help image reconstruction via the time–space–spectrum
    continuum for cloudy pixels that cannot be recovered by data merging (Chang et
    al., 2015a). Not only merged images but also fused images may be connected to
    a wealth of machine learning or data mining algorithms for monitoring challenging
    water quality constituents of concern such as total organic carbon (TOC), total
    phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and microcystin in fresh water lakes or
    coastal bays with respect to fused multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing
    images (Chang et al., 2012, Chang et al., 2014a, Chang et al., 2014b, Chang et
    al., 2015a, Chang et al., 2015b). For example, with the aid of genetic programing
    (GP) methods, Chang et al. (2014a) successfully mapped the distribution of toxic
    microcystin in Lake Erie by using fused remotely sensed imagery between MODIS
    and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The results suggest that GP
    models perform better than traditional two-band models in quantifying the concentrations
    of microcystin in water bodies due to the inclusion of additional spectral reflectance
    data embedded in hyperspectral images. The unique hyperspectral band helps produce
    a noticeable increase in the prediction accuracy, especially in the range of low
    microcystin concentrations. Similarly, Imen et al., 2015, Imen et al., 2016 developed
    a decision support system integrating data fusion and machine learning tool for
    monitoring the total suspended sediment concentrations in Lake Mead. These state-of-the-art
    machine learning techniques applied for processing either fused or merged remote
    sensing imageries can significantly advance the surveillance of the earth environment
    (Chang et al., 2014a, Chang et al., 2014b, Chang et al., 2015a, Chang et al.,
    2015b). Such a regime shift from ‘traditional image processing’ to ‘data/image
    merging/fusion,’ to ‘machine learning/data mining’ has resulted in significant
    advancements in certain environmental applications. This study aims to: 1) present
    a new satellite-based remote sensing platform that may reflect such a regime shift
    to automate water quality monitoring, which is termed “cross-mission data merging
    with image reconstruction and machine learning” (CDMIM), 2) decipher water quality
    conditions, and 3) aid in watershed management through a holistic approach. The
    CDMIM lies at the intersection of data merging, cloud removal, and intelligent
    feature extraction, which possesses the primary capability of removing cross-mission
    biases among sensors and reconstructing data gaps in support of intelligent feature
    extraction through machine learning for better water quality monitoring. Within
    the framework of CDMIM, common observations between successive generations of
    a suite of satellite sensors during the overlapped time period via SIASS provide
    a synergistic opportunity for sensor inter-comparisons and data merging to increase
    the spatial coverage. Then, a long-term memory of the baseline satellite images
    helps reconstruct the missing pixel values due to cloud via SMIR based on the
    merged dataset. All of these processing endeavors support the subsequent intelligent
    feature extraction with different fast, regular, and deep learning algorithms
    toward high quality content-based water quality mapping. Here the CDMIM was applied
    to predict the water quality conditions in terms of TN, TP, chlorophyll-a, and
    water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, enabling the automatic multi-temporal change
    detection. The following questions will be answered: 1) Can the CDMIM be reliable
    enough to accommodate various needs and automate data merging, image reconstruction,
    and intelligent feature extraction for water quality monitoring? 2) Can the CDMIM
    aid in the watershed management of Lake Nicaragua in terms of nutrient control
    by providing linkages between spatial/temporal hot spots in the water body and
    source locations in the terrestrial system? 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Multiscale
    modeling system- CDMIM The CDMIM is a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling
    system in a common software platform coded by MATLAB programming language that
    incorporates a variety of image processing and spatial analysis techniques to
    better monitor and understand the earth environment. The software package enables
    users to manipulate remote sensing images with the aid of techniques related to
    data merging/fusion, image reconstruction, and machine learning/data mining. The
    flowchart in Fig. 2 shows the basic modules and workflow of CDMIM, which routinely
    follows five main operational steps: Download : Download high-res image (596KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The interactive workflow modules in
    CDMIM. Step 1: The first is to preprocess ocean color reflectance images in preparation
    for further synthetic manipulation. After acquiring satellite-based ocean color
    reflectance data, several preprocessing procedures were applied to the obtained
    raw imagery sequentially to obtain quality unified data sets, including (1) filter
    out pixels flagged with poor quality, (2) re-project to UTM zone 16 North with
    a spatial resolution of 1000-meter, (3) extract data over study area by clipping
    with the corresponding boundary vector file, (4) remove duplicated images on the
    same date and keep the one with the largest spatial coverage ratio, and (5) remove
    images with partial coverage of the study region. To ease the workloads, the SeaWiFS
    Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software provided by the NASA''s OceanColor science
    team as well as ArcMAP from ESRI were employed to aid in the preprocessing of
    Level-2 MODIS and VIIRS ocean color images. In addition, Windows batch scripts
    were created to execute the re-project module embedded in the SeaDAS package to
    process the input raw images sequentially due to large amount of data files. Step
    2: The second step is to perform data merging on preprocessed images from the
    previous step by using SIASS. Cross-mission ocean color reflectance products are
    merged at this stage to increase the spatial coverage. With the use of SIASS,
    biases across missions can be identified, quantified, and removed with integrated
    signal processing, statistical inference, and machine learning techniques for
    cross-mission sensor observations. This goal can be completed by the proper integration
    of singular value decomposition (Businger and Golub, 1969, Nash, 1990), quantile-quantile
    adjustment (Wilk and Gnanadesikan, 1968), empirical mode decomposition (Drazin,
    1992), and extreme learning machine (Huang et al., 2006). Following this logical
    flow, both systematic bias and associated location-dependent bias can be removed
    for each cross-mission sensor observation. More detailed descriptions of SIASS
    algorithm can be found in Bai et al. (2016a). Step 3: Step 3 is the key step to
    apply image reconstruction methods (i.e., SMIR) to create spatially complete images.
    Although SIASS can be of help in improving the spatial coverage by merging cross-mission
    sensors'' observations to some extent, data gaps may still exist due to the lack
    of sufficient observations, and hence, a missing pixel in this regard can never
    be reconstructed by using SIASS alone. SMIR was proposed to reconstruct spectral
    information (e.g., radiometric values) of value-missing pixels to fill in data
    gaps in remotely sensed imagery caused by a variety of deficits such as cloud
    obstructions. SMIR therefore takes advantage of a fast machine learning tool to
    characterize and quantify the complex relationships between cloud-free and cloudy
    pixels for predicting values for those value-missing pixels. For more details
    of SMIR, please refer to Chang et al. (2015a). Step 4: Step 4 is to carry out
    an intelligent feature extraction based on the merged as well as reconstructed
    images and sampled ground truth data in an inverse modeling procedure. To better
    understand the changing environment, certain informative parameters should be
    derived, and techniques like machine learning or data mining can help retrieve
    essential features. For example, to monitor the water quality condition and eutrophication
    status in Lake Nicaragua, aquatic parameters including chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk
    depth (SDD), TP, and TN will be derived here by using machine learning algorithms
    based on ocean color reflectance at different wavelengths. For demonstration,
    one single hidden layer artificial neural network (ANN) with back-propagation
    learning algorithms was used to retrieve the features and establish the relation
    between the sampled parameters and the input ocean color reflectance. In the modeling
    process, 70% of the data pairs were randomly assigned for training and the remaining
    30% for validation. Once a robust ANN model is attained (i.e., correlation coefficient
    larger than 0.8 in the validation process), it can be then applied to all pixels
    to generate concentration maps of the relevant water quality parameters for environment
    monitoring purposes. To reduce randomness in trained models, multiple trials (i.e.,
    20 in this study) were conducted in the model training step. In other words, 20
    different networks were trained, calibrated and validated for further data prediction
    purposes. Step 5: By Step 5, we are finally ready to generate water quality maps
    based on featured ocean color reflectance data. The ensemble mean of multiple
    trials was used to assess the overall performance of machine learning procedures.
    In this study, the mean value of 20 independent results predicted by the calibrated
    ANN model at each grid was calculated as the final output to complete the overall
    mapping. 2.2. Statistical analysis In image processing, the information entropy
    (H), a statistical measure of randomness to characterize the texture of the target
    image, which can be also referred to as image entropy, is used here to assess
    the performance of data merging as the entropy enables to depict information enrichment
    step-wise in these data merging processes (Tsai et al., 2008). Mathematically,
    entropy H of an image can be defined as (Gonzalez et al., 2003) (1) where is the
    probability mass function which contains the histogram counts of valid grid data
    values. Theoretically, an image that is perfectly flat (e.g., with same data values)
    will have an entropy of zero whereas images with more dynamic values should have
    large entropy values. Consequently, it is a good indicator to evaluate the increase
    of information content in each image during data merging and reconstruction processes
    by comparing entropy values derived at each stage. In addition to the entropy,
    coverage ratio (CR), one statistical indicator to represent the portion of valid
    pixels covered in the study area, was also used to assess the efficacy of data
    merging and data reconstruction algorithms in recovering the information of value-missing
    pixels. The CR can be calculated as (2) where and denote the number of valid pixels
    (having data value) and the count of value-missing pixels, respectively. The summation
    of these two variables equals the total number of pixels covered in the study
    area; hence, the CR value should equal to 1 for a spatially complete imagery (i.e.,
    the value of should be zero). To evaluate the quality of machine learning/data
    mining based on the merged and reconstructed images, statistics including root
    mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated
    based on the following formulae. • Root mean square error (RMSE) (3) • Correlation
    coefficient (R-value) (4) • Coefficient of determination (R2) (5) where and represent
    the simulated and the observed data values, respectively, and denotes the total
    number of data pairs between and . (or ) is the th simulated (or observed) data
    value. or denotes the mathematic mean of all simulated (or observed) data values.
    Ideally, the RMSE should be zero with an R2 of 1 if the simulated data set are
    totally identical with the observed one. An algorithm performs better with lower
    RMSE value and larger R2 value. 3. Case study 3.1. Study region Lake Nicaragua
    covers an area of 8, 264 km2 and is considered an important source of future drinking
    water by not only the Nicaragua government but also several other countries in
    Central America (Fig. 3). The lake is situated between Lake Managua and the San
    Juan River, through which it drains to the Caribbean Sea. The lake is a relatively
    shallow tropical lake with depths ranging from 13 m to 40 m, allowing a constant
    mixing of water along the depth, dependent on the intensity of wind velocity (World
    Bank, 2013). The satellite image of Lake Nicaragua in Fig. 3 shows the water clarity
    information produced by CDMIM based on the in-situ measurements of SDD on March
    16, 2015. It reveals the pollution impact along the shoreline. Download : Download

    location of Lake Nicaragua. Note that the small channels around the lake have
    been cropped out as shown here. The most promising approach for monitoring the
    Lake is to use the state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies for viewing the
    distribution of physical, chemical, and even biological parameters in connection
    to the lake water quality. Nevertheless, the retrieval of certain remote sensing
    parameters from satellite observations can be adversely affected or even fail
    due to a variety of factors such as instrumental anomaly, cloud contamination,
    aerosols, sun glint, and many others. Data gaps may arise and in turn prevent
    further exploitation of the associated remote sensing images in real-world applications.
    In other words, obtaining a spatially complete remote sensing imagery based on
    a single scene of one individual satellite sensor observation is always challenging,
    particularly for products derived from optical wavelengths because frequent clouds
    are a big obstacle (Chang et al., 2016). On the other hand, it presents an opportunity
    to show how CDMIM may be used via a supervised feature extraction for water quality
    monitoring. 3.2. Field data collection for ground truthing To conduct supervised
    feature extraction, a series of field sampling campaigns were carried out jointly
    or separately by National Central University, National Autonomous University of
    Nicaragua, Centro para la Investigación en Recursos Acuáticos de Nicaragua, and
    the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to monitor water quality at various

    for any eutrophic lake water quality is its nutrient content, or TN and TP content,
    and chlorophyll-a (Chang et al., 2013). Disposal of municipal and agricultural
    wastes in this lake leads to an influx of nutrients into surface waters, which
    in turn stimulates the growth of harmful algal blooms throughout the lake. In
    addition, stormwater runoff surrounding the lake area contributes to TOC and total
    suspend solid (TSS) in surface waters. SDD may be considered equivalent to TSS
    and is much easier to measure. TOC in natural surface water is recognized as a
    known precursor of disinfection byproducts produced from regular drinking water
    treatment processes (Chang et al., 2014b). Microcystin is a potent hepatotoxin
    produced by Microcyctis bacteria during intensive algal blooms in eutrophic lakes.
    Most of the microcystin is contained within healthy Microcystic cells, and the
    toxin remains inside the cell until death or induced rupture of the cell wall.
    To accurately estimate the microcystin concentration, a relationship between microcystin
    and other substance must be found to serve as an indicator; chlorophyll-a or phycocyanian
    is such an indicator for microcystin (Chang et al., 2014a). The phycocyanian level
    in Microcystic blooms is closely related to the amount of microcystin present
    and is therefore an indicator of phytoplankton biomass, which is directly related
    to the primary production of a lake (Chang et al., 2014a). Considering the current
    pollution characteristics around Lake Nicaragua and taking the above considerations
    into account, the most suitable water quality parameters are chlorophyll-a, SDD,
    TN, and TP. 3.3. Satellite-based ocean color reflectance data Conventional manual
    sampling for water quality monitoring is labor-intensive, costly, and unable to
    capture spatial variability simultaneously over vast regions. To provide an all-inclusive
    insight with a large spatial coverage in a timely manner, satellite ocean color
    observations should be used on a daily basis although these observations can only
    reflect the surface water quality. In this study, three satellite sensors orbiting
    Earth with the ability to monitor ocean color and inland waters were selected
    and they include: 1) MODIS aboard the Terra (1999–present, MODIS-Terra hereafter),
    2) the Aqua (2002–present, MODIS-Aqua hereafter), and 3) VIIRS aboard the Suomi-NPP
    (2011–present, VIIRS-NPP hereafter) (Table 2). Table 2. Characteristics of MODIS
    and VIIRS ocean color remote sensing reflectance products. The Level-2 ocean color

    three sensors orbiting Earth can collect remote sensing imageries on a daily basis
    at a moderate resolution. Evaluation of the literature of the ocean color products
    collected from MODIS-Aqua, MODIS-Terra, and VIIRS-NPP indicate comparable accuracies
    among these three sensors at most wavelengths. These radiometric products have
    been well atmospherically and radiometrically corrected to remove effects of atmospheric
    attenuation and solar orientation caused by aerosols and scattering. To avoid
    the propagation of large biases in the following data merging, cloudy pixel reconstruction,
    and machine learning steps, quality control was initialized by excluding all problematic
    pixels with negative reflectance at any wavelength and any of the Level-2 processing
    flags in this study (Table 3). Note that they are the same flags selected by NASA''s
    Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) in order to remove any questionable data
    for the generation of the global Level-3 data products. During re-projection processes,
    VIIRS-NPP ocean color remote sensing reflectance observations were resampled to
    the MODIS resolution (i.e., 1000 m) to unify the spatial resolution. Finally,
    both MODIS and VIIRS ocean color remote sensing reflectance observations were
    mapped onto the UTM-16N projected coordinate system based on a WGS-84 geographic
    coordinate system. Table 3. Level-2 processing flags applied to ocean color data.

    4.1. Data merging and reconstruction Due to severe cloud impacts, a large portion
    of the originally observed MODIS-Aqua ocean color remote sensing reflectance was
    missed (i.e., white area in Fig. 1 over Lake Nicaragua), which hinders the broad
    exploitation of this data product in various environmental monitoring applications.
    To better monitor and understand the dynamics of water quality in Lake Nicaragua,
    data merging methods should first be applied aiming to improve the data spatial
    coverage. Here we used the SIASS method to merge cross-mission ocean color remote
    sensing reflectance observations from MODIS-Aqua with VIIRS-NPP and MODIS-Terra
    sequentially. Considering the temporally-related discrepancy arising from the
    local overpassing time differences and error propagations, ocean color remote
    sensing reflectance data from VIIRS-NPP were first merged to MODIS-Aqua because
    both sensors have a similar local overpassing time (i.e., 1:30 p.m.) (Fig. 5).
    With the aid of SIASS, the spatial coverage ratio (i.e., abbreviated as CR in
    this context) of the merged dataset (i.e., A+V in Fig. 5b) was improved significantly
    (from 18.6% to 24.64%). To further improve spatial coverage, ocean color remote
    sensing reflectance data from MODIS-Terra were also merged with the fused image
    from the previous step (i.e., A+V) to finally generate a fully merged dataset
    (A+V+T in Fig. 5c). With the aid of the SIASS, the CR increased from the original
    18.6% to a final 24.92%. Download : Download high-res image (1004KB) Download

    sensing reflectance image before and after fusing at 678 nm with (b) VIIRS-NPP
    and (c) MODIS-Terra toward (d) reconstructed image on June 14, 2014. (For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) Although the data merging method enables to improve
    spatial coverage, it may still be insufficient to attain a spatially complete
    image because of significant data gaps in the original data sources caused by
    clouds. Therefore, data reconstruction methods should be then applied to reconstruct
    values for value-missing pixels in the merged images. Toward such a goal, the
    SMIR method was used here to fill in data gaps presenting in the merged image.
    Because the SMIR method works mainly relying on the historical memory to build
    relationships between pixels in the scalable time-space-spectrum domain, the larger
    the amount of valid data, the higher the final expected accuracy of reconstructed
    data points. Therefore, data reconstruction should be performed on the final merged
    data file with the largest spatial coverage (e.g., A+V+T) rather than the one
    with lower spatial coverage (e.g., A+V). If none of the merged image is available,
    the image of MODIS-Aqua may be directly used once an adequate number of valid
    pixels is guaranteed. The essence hidden behind is that the observed value should
    be more accurate than the predicted (i.e., reconstructed). Compared to those images
    prior to reconstruction, the reconstructed image increases the information content
    of the observed scene dramatically (Fig. 5d), which in turn advances the environmental
    monitoring capacity and improves understanding of aquatic environment dynamics,
    allowing us to retrieve some specified environmental parameters in the next step
    by applying intelligent feature extraction methods. Statistics shown in Table
    4 indicate that the data gaps associated with the original data products were
    particularly severe, and the CR value of these products were all lower than 60%.
    This effect strongly suggests the need of data merging to increase spatial coverage
    in order to advance our understanding of the environmental dynamics. With the
    aid of data merging algorithms, the spatial coverage of merged images increases
    gradually. Finally, the CR improves notably after applying the data reconstruction
    method (i.e., SMIR) to those merged images, with the largest improvement by 74%
    (i.e., from 24.92% to 98.12% on 2014163). Ideally, the reconstructed image should
    be spatially complete, with a CR value of 100%; however, in this study, no value
    was predicted for pixels with too few inputs in order to avoid the generation
    of large outliers arising from poorly characterized relationships. Thus, the final
    CR value of reconstructed images is slightly lower than 100%. Table 4. Calculated

    / / / / In addition to CR, the information entropy of every available image in
    the data merging and reconstruction processes was calculated as well (Table 5).
    As the information entropy is a statistical measure of randomness characterizing
    the texture of an image, the larger the value of H, the more inhomogeneity of
    the image is expected. In this regard, the reconstructed images should have larger
    H values than that of merged images. In practice, images with limited spatial
    coverage may have larger H values than that of the reconstructed images (e.g.,
    2014163). This effect is mainly caused by the fact that data values in images
    with limited spatial coverage may have larger standard deviation than that of
    the reconstructed images, i.e., more heterogeneous. In addition, it is clear that
    the H value of the merged image depends highly on the image having larger CR value.

    / / 4.2. Machine learning for intelligent feature extraction In contrast to those
    spectral bands used for land mapping, ocean color bands have narrower bandwidth
    and thus may be more sensitive to aquatic environmental dynamics. Given that the
    eutrophication level of Lake Nicaragua is significant, water quality parameters
    such as chlorophyll-a, TN, TP, and SDD should be derived to monitor water pollution
    issues based on these ocean color bands. Because no remote sensing products are
    currently available for TN, TP, and SDD, machine learning approaches can be thus
    applied to derive those parameters by establishing relationships between the sampled
    value of those parameters and the relevant ocean color reflectance at different
    wavelengths of remote sensing images. By making use of ANN tools, relationships
    between the sampled chlorophyll-a concentration and ocean color reflectance at
    10 different bands were established. 20 independent models were established to
    avoid randomly generated relationships. For each training process, 70% of the
    data pairs were assigned for training and the remaining 30% were used for independent
    validation. The training process continued until a correlation coefficient of
    0.8 was attained between the observed dataset and the predicted dataset for validation.
    Once a model is well-trained, it can be saved for further prediction purposes.
    The results show that the ensemble means of predicted results from the 20 trials
    corresponded well with the sampled chlorophyll-a concentration, with an R2 of
    0.93 and an RMSE of 2.43 μg/L (Fig. 6a). The predicted values not only capture
    the spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a concentrations at those sampled points, but
    also the extreme values, for example the local minimum value at the 12th grid
    cell and the local maximum value at the 30th grid cell. The results strongly demonstrate
    the effectiveness and reliability of the established ANN models. Similarly, 20
    independent models were established for SDD, TN, and TP, respectively. The established
    model can accurately characterize the relationships between the sampled parameters
    and ocean color reflectance at 10 different bands, with R2 ranging from 0.7 to
    0.88 (Fig. 6b–d). These machine learning-based models can outperform simple two-band
    or three-band bio-optical relationships, as shown in the literature (Chang et
    al., 2014b). Download : Download high-res image (948KB) Download : Download full-size

    this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
    4.3. Water quality mapping Based on the ANN models established via machine learning
    tools, concentrations of chlorophyll-a, SDD, TN, and TP in Lake Nicaragua can
    be easily derived by using the relevant ocean color reflectance at each grid cell
    to facilitate water quality mapping. Because Lake Nicaragua is located in an area
    with two main seasons (wet season: May–October; dry season: November–April) (Chang
    et al., 2015a), concentrations of those parameters can be derived on two different
    days, one in the dry season and the other in the wet season, for demonstration
    purposes. Here we use the reconstructed ocean color reflectance images on June
    17, 2014 (DOY: 2014168, wet season) and March 16, 2015 (DOY: 2015075, dry season)
    individually to derive concentration maps of chlorophyll-a, SDD, TN, and TP, based
    on the established models for each parameter, respectively. The volcano island
    (i.e., Ometepe island in the middle of the lake) in the central part of the lake
    creates a unique hydrodynamic pattern that affects the water quality conditions
    in the lake. The concentration maps of the four parameters derived on June 17,
    2014 (DOY: 2014168), respectively (Fig. 7), and the four parameters derived on
    March 16, 2015 (DOY: 2015075), respectively (Fig. 8), indicate that the chlorophyll-a
    and SDD were relatively higher in the wet season than those in the dry season.
    When comparing Fig. 7, Fig. 8b, it is indicative that higher SDD were always lower
    throughout the lake shore area due to stormwater runoff carrying a lot of sediments
    into the lake. This evidence is a strong support of the prediction accuracy produced
    by CDMIM. By contrast, the TN and TP concentrations are relatively higher in the
    dry season than in the wet season partially due to insufficient sun light to trigger
    more growth of algal bloom cells to consume those available nutrients. This effect
    strongly depicts the seasonal behavior, that is, the concentrations of chlorophyll-a
    are higher in the wet season due to abundant sun light in the summer, whereas
    the TN and TP concentrations are higher in the dry season due to the cumulative
    effect of farming and municipal wastewater discharge. In general, the lower the
    TN, TP, and chlorophyll-a, the larger the SDD in both seasons. There is a water
    quality hot spot of nutrients in the northwest and south tip of the lake driven
    by the natural gradient from Lake Managua to Lake Nicaragua through the Tipitapa
    River as well as from west to east within Lake Nicaragua and the narrow entrance
    of the San Juan River. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    are mainly related to inadequate land use, such as the farming of hillside areas,
    unregulated lake fishing, agricultural and livestock development, the construction
    of poorly designed roads, deforestation of tropical forest species, and the destruction
    of wetlands and plant cover in ecologically sensitive areas. These human activities
    have resulted in multiple sources of pollution and caused erosion and land degradation
    (Fig. 9). As the result of storms and hurricanes, the fragility of many volcanic
    soils, and human perturbations, sediments that originate in the upper and middle
    parts of the lake watersheds have made Lake Nicaragua the depository for sediments
    carried by its tributaries (World Bank, 2013). The lake also receives stormwater
    runoff and groundwater drainage from subsurfaces which carry dissolved pesticides
    and fertilizers commonly applied in the border area of both Nicaragua and Costa
    Rica (World Bank, 2013). There is in an acute need to know about the volume of
    sediment arriving at Lake Nicaragua (World Bank, 2013). Download : Download high-res

    in the Lake Nicaragua watershed (Courtesy of Cortesía T. Salvatierra, the Nicaraguan
    Research Center for Water Resources of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua
    (CIRA/UNAN). The monitoring information of SDD derived from satellite images is
    essential if we are to quantify the TSS impact and to implement the conservation
    practices in the lake watershed. Nutrient control issues, however, deserve even
    more attention (Table 6). Remote sensing for chlorophyll-a, TN and TP would reveal
    the demand for lake watershed management strategies for nutrient control seeking
    balance between economic development and environmental protection. Such balance
    relies on management strategies to control the eutrophication issues and allow
    for the regulation of agricultural farming, fertilizer applications, municipal
    wastewater treatment, and stockbreeding. The Nicaraguan Research Center for Water
    Resources of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (CIRA/UNAN) has summarized
    the major pollution sources in the lake watershed (Fig. 9). These pollution sources
    in Fig. 9 echo the water quality patterns in Fig. 7, Fig. 8 where the hot spots
    of chlorophyll-a, TN, and TP are present in the northeast, northwest, and southeast
    shorelines of the lake in both wet and dry seasons. After all, in the recent bold
    agenda of the construction of a super Nicaragua Canal, human activities have exerted
    unprecedented pressures on the environment and resulted in social conflicts among
    the various groups involved. The route of Nicaragua''s giant new canal (Fig. 10)
    could have a negative impact on the lake water quality, which will probably worsen
    the current ecosystem status and spread current hot spots of water quality of
    the lake, let alone destroy the very prestigious San Miguelito wetlands. Table

    CDMIM software platform to generate various water quality concentration maps of
    chlorophyll-a, TN, TP, and SDD in Lake Nicaragua to aid in the lake watershed
    management. The CDMIM incorporates a multi-scale modeling system over a scalable
    time-space-spectrum continuum to advance environmental monitoring and better understand
    the Earth''s dynamic environment. This well-structured software package with a
    suite of well-connected algorithms, models, and tools lays down the application
    foundations and enables end-users to pre-process interdisciplinary knowledge,
    manipulate remote sensing images, explore possible selection capacity, and mine
    the spatiotemporal water quality patterns via image merging, image reconstruction,
    and data mining/machine learning. The advancement is significant in remote sensing
    science in the nexus of environmental modeling and software development, elevating
    the exploitation level of the current remote sensing products with the most recent
    machine learning algorithms. The real-world applications in Lake Nicaragua indicate
    that the CDMIM works effectively and reliably in deriving water quality concentration
    maps in Lake Nicaragua assessment. In addition, the idea of machine learning/data
    mining works well in characterizing complex relationships between real-world samples
    and ocean color reflectance products or in mining some relationships embedded
    in the historical pixel values over the time-space-spectrum domain. Nevertheless,
    the current CDMIM platform does not incorporate data fusion methods which can
    be of help in improving spatial resolution of the merged images to better monitor
    the aquatic environmental dynamics by providing more details. Since the CDMIM
    platform is an open system, the data fusion modules can be of course integrated
    immediately once the users have such requirements. Acknowledgements This work

  description: In information technology, Big Data is a collection of data sets so
    large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database
    management tools or traditional data-processing applications [74]. The trend to
    larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis
    of a single large set of related data, as compared with separate smaller sets
    with the same total amount of data [26,51,68]. Scientists regularly encounter
    limitations due to large data sets in many areas, including meteorology, genetics,
    complex physics simulations, and environmental research [9,35]. Wireless technology-based
    automated data gathering from the large environmental sensor networks have increased
    the quantity of sensor data available for analysis and sensor informatics. Next-generation
    environmental monitoring, natural resource management, and agricultural decision
    support systems are becoming heavily dependent on very large scale multiple sensor
    network deployments, massive-scale accumulation, harmonization, web-based Big
    Data integration and interpretation of Big Data. With large amount of the data
    availability, the complexity of data has also increased hence regular maintenance
    of large-scale sensor are becoming a difficult challenge. Uncertainty factors
    in the environmental monitoring processes are more evident than before due to
    current technological transparency achieved by most recent advanced communication
    technologies [47-49]. The other challenges include capture, storage, search, sharing,
    analysis, and visualization. Data availability from a particular environmental
    sensor web is often very limited and data quality is subsequently very poor. This
    practical limitation could be due to difficult geographical location of the sensor
    node or sensor station, extreme environmental conditions, communication network
    failure, and lastly technical failure of the sensor node. Data uncertainty from
    a sensor network makes the network unreliable and inefficient. This inefficiency
    leads to failure of natural resource management systems such as agricultural water
    resource management, weather forecast, crop management including irrigation scheduling
    and natural resource-based crop business model systems. The ultimate challenge
    in environmental forecasting and decision support systems, is to overcome the
    data uncertainty and make the derived output more accurate. It is evident that
    there is a need to capture and integrate environmental knowledge from various
    independent sources including sensor networks, individual sensory system, large-scale
    environmental simulation models, and historical environmental data [13,33,36,41,56,58]
    for each of the independent sources). It is not good enough to produce efficient
    decision support system using a single data source. So there is an urgent requirement
    for on demand complementary knowledge integration where different sources of environmental
    sensor data could be used to complement each other automatically [1,17,37,38].

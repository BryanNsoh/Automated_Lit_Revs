  description: In the face of increasing water scarcity and uncertainties of climate
    change, improving crop water use efficiency and productivity, while minimizing
    negative environmental impacts, is becoming crucial to meet the surging global
    food demand. Smart irrigation has a potential of improving water use efficiency
    in precision agriculture especially when efficient irrigation control strategies
    are adopted. Conventionally, irrigation systems rely on heuristic methods to schedule
    irrigation which either leads to over-irrigation or under-irrigation. This influences
    the crop physiological characteristics as well as the water use efficiency. To
    tackle this menace, model-based irrigation management has been overemphasized.
    A closed-loop irrigation control strategy relies on a mathematical model of the
    system for irrigation scheduling decisions. In this study, a data-driven approach
    was used to learn soil moisture dynamics from a drip irrigated tomato in an open
    field agricultural system. A total number of 9674 data samples were collected
    using an ATMOS41 weather station, TERROS 12 soil moisture sensor and a YFS-201
    flow sensor for crop evapotranspiration and precipitation, soil moisture and irrigation
    volumes respectively. Data driven modelling was then performed using the system
    identification toolbox in a MATLAB environment. The model formulation was a multi-input
    single-output (MISO) system with reference evapotranspiration, irrigation and
    rainfall as inputs and soil moisture as the output. Different model structures
    including transfer functions, state space models, polynomial models and ARX models
    were evaluated. Model performance was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE),
    final prediction error (FPE) and estimated fit of the model approaches. Simulation
    results indicate that the soil moisture dynamics model provides a satisfactory
    approximation of the process dynamics with a state space model giving an estimated
    fit of 97.04 %, MSE and FPE of 1.74×10−7 and 1.75×10−7 respectively. This model
    will be used to design a model predictive controller for smart irrigation scheduling
    in open field environmental conditions.

    scarcity at a global scale is increasing, making it perplexing to achieve sustainable
    agricultural production [1], [2], [3]. Agricultural water scarcity is projected
    to increase in more than 80 % of the world''s countries by the year 2050 [4].
    This coupled with the increasing population, climate change impacts and competition
    from other sectors, puts food security at stake [5]. Irrigated agriculture is
    one of the major water users accounting for about 70 % of freshwater withdraws
    [6],[7]. Irrigation accounts for 40 % of the world''s food and fibre production
    and will therefore play a crucial role in feeding the 9.7 billion people by 2050
    [8],[9]. Water withdrawal for irrigation is projected to hit 29000 km3 by 2050
    with most of the high demand in developing countries translating into 20 million
    hectares under irrigation [10]. The need to enhance water use efficiency has never
    been over emphasized throughout the research community and industry as it is presently.
    Enhancing water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture necessitates effective
    use of available water resources to respond to real-time crop irrigation requirements.
    This requires monitoring water use and controlling how the irrigation water is
    applied. The goal of monitoring the crop environment in real-time is to control
    the root zone soil moisture between specific thresholds; field capacity and permanent
    wilting point [11]. On the other hand, irrigation control deals with applying
    what will keep the soil moisture between that threshold at the set time with precision.
    Emerging technologies, such as wireless communications, remote sensing, machine
    learning, crop physiology and soil environment monitoring systems, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and big data, have expounded the scope of irrigation monitoring
    and control [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. These technologies facilitate the generation
    of large amounts of data which when processed and analyzed can be utilized for
    predictions. This has given rise to the paradigm shift from open loop irrigation
    control to model-based irrigation management [17,18]. In model-based irrigation
    management, data from soil, weather and plant makes an integral part of the predictive
    control strategy to improve crop water use efficiency while minimizing negative
    environmental consequences [19], [20], [21], [22]. Over the years, the soil agro-hydrological
    model has been utilized to depict the soil moisture dynamics in the rootzone [23]
    as a basis for model based irrigation scheduling. The model characterizes the
    hydrological cycle between the soil, the atmosphere, and the crop [24]. Modelling
    soil moisture dynamics is very critical in irrigation automation. Unlike conventional
    irrigation systems that rely on open-loop irrigation strategies, closed-loop irrigation
    control for smart irrigation uses a plant model and the system''s current state
    to predict future irrigation amounts [25], [26], [27]. Nonetheless, these models
    have been developed for controlled environment agricultural systems especially
    in developed countries like USA, China and Australia. About, 95 % of food consumed
    in developing countries is from open field agricultural systems where most of
    the water losses occur. Therefore, developing models on which irrigation scheduling
    decisions can be based in open field agriculture is of significant importance.
    Several researchers have modelled soil moisture dynamics in an attempt to improve
    irrigation scheduling. For example, Saleem et al. [28] and Lozoya et al. [29]
    developed a soil moisture dynamics model for closed-loop irrigation The authors
    assumed negligible precipitation and ignored the crop coefficient in the evapotranspiration
    model. The drawback then becomes its suitability in different agroclimatic zones
    where supplementary irrigation is necessary. Additionally, crops need different
    volumes of water per growth stage. Similarly, Mao et al. [30] used the agro-hydrological
    model to predict the future states of an agricultural system. The authors, however,
    rely on historical data for irrigation scheduling. This means real-time plant
    water needs are dependent on past data instead of real-time soil, weather, and
    plant system parameters. Recently, Abioye et al. [31] developed an Internet of
    Things (IoT) and data-driven modelling to model soil moisture dynamics in a controlled
    environment agricultural system. The authors developed a multi-input single-output
    (MISO) system with evapotranspiration and irrigation volumes as inputs and soil
    moisture as the output. Open field agricultural systems, however, depict a more
    dynamic nature of soil moisture with many factors contributing to changes in soil
    moisture compared to controlled environment agricultural systems. There is considerably
    a small body of studies that modelled soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems using data-driven approaches. This is partly attributed to the costly
    monitoring equipment required to provide the data for all the parameters in the
    water balance equation. The major objective of this study is to therefore develop
    a soil moisture dynamics model in an open field agricultural system to aid model-based
    irrigation management for enhancement of water use efficiency in arid and semi-arid
    regions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The experiment was conducted
    at the University for Development Studies, Nyankpala campus at WACWISA experimental
    site located at 90 24’ 37” N and 00 58’53” E of the Equator as shown in Fig. 1.
    A drip irrigation experiment was designed on a 20*18m plot under tomato production
    spaced at 0.5m. The drip irrigation system consisted of 20mm HDPE laterals with
    online emitters with a flow rate of 2.1litres per hour. The experimental data
    was collected from September 21st to November 26, 2022, resulting in 9674 data
    sets for developing the soil moisture dynamics model collected in 10-mibute time-steps.

    experiment with monitoring sensors. 2.2. Agro-hydrological balance model This
    model describes the soil moisture dynamics in an open field agricultural system.
    The agro-hydrologic balance model states that changes in rootzone soil moisture
    at a particular point in time is due to water inflows including rainfall, capillary
    rise, irrigation less the water outflows, deep percolation, water runoff and evapotranspiration
    as depicted in Fig. 3 [27]. The agro-hydrological model can be mathematically
    expressed as in Eq. (1) [28,32]. (1) Download : Download high-res image (151KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Agro-hydrological system. Where; ,
    , , , , , and In most agricultural fields the lateral water inflow is negligible,
    or the total effect is always zero. Likewise, the capillary rise contribution
    in soils with a deep-water table is zero. The runoff in a well-designed smart
    irrigation system is taken as zero, and thus the change in rootzone soil moisture
    becomes as shown in Eq. (2). (2) 2.2.1. Evapotranspiration The crop evapotranspiration
    then is a product of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient as
    depicted in Eq. (3) [33]. Allen et al. [33] defines the crop evapotranspiration
    under standard conditions, denoted as ETC, as the evapotranspiration from disease-free,
    well-fertilized crops, grown in large fields, under optimum soil water conditions,
    and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions. The FAO Penman
    Monteith model for reference evapotranspiration was adopted for this study. (3)
    Where; ETc is the crop evapotranspiration(mmday−1), ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration(mmday−1)
    and Kc is the crop factor which depends on the growth stage of the plant. (4)
    Where; is Reference evapotranspiration (mmday−1), is the slope vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), is net radiation at the crop surface (MJm−2day−1), is Soil heat
    flux density (MJm−2day−1), is Psychometric constant (kPa °C−1), is Air temperature
    (°C), is Wind speed (ms−1), is Saturation vapour pressure (kpa), is Actual vapour
    pressure (kpa) An ATMOS 41 weather station was used to monitor the plant environment
    in real-time and the data was sent to a wireless Zentrac data logger and stored
    in the cloud. The automated weather station gives solar radiation, air temperature,
    vapour pressure, vapour pressure deficit, precipitation, and wind speed among
    other parameters. Net radiation at the crop surface Rn, Soil heat flux density
    G, slope vapour pressure curve and psychometric constant were derived from measured
    parameters using procedures described in Allen et al. [33]. Weather data used
    in the calculation of reference evapotranspiration was collected at 10-minute
    intervals and stored on the Zetracloud. Using the FAO Penman Monteith Equation,
    a 10-minute reference evapotranspiration was determined for the 9674 samples.
    2.2.2. Soil Moisture Soil moisture measurements were conducted by using a Terros
    12 volumetric water content sensor from meter group. The sensor was located at
    a depth of 30 cm in order to measure the soil moisture at the effective rootzone
    depth of tomato crop. The crop grows over a sandy loam type of soil with a field
    capacity and permanent wilting point of 24.5 and 12.6, respectively and an infiltration
    rate of 12 l/h. 2.2.3. Irrigation Similarly, in order to estimate the irrigation
    volume, the IoT based flowmeter produces a digital output pulse which has been
    counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the water flow rate during irrigation.
    The water flowrate is calibrated in Eq. (5) and flow volume in Eq. (6). (5) (6)
    2.3. Model Structure 2.3.1. Transfer functions For a dynamical system that does
    not change over time, the transfer function provides a useful representation.
    [34]. Inspection or basic algebraic manipulations of the differential equations
    that characterize the systems can yield the transfer function. Even infinite-dimensional
    systems driven by partial differential equations may be understood with the help
    of transfer functions. Experiments on a system can be used to establish its transfer
    function. Eq. 7 depicts the mathematical formulation of a transfer function [35].
    (7) Where are matrices 2.3.2. The Box Jenkins Model The Box Jenkins model uses
    a rational polynomial function to give totally separate parameterization for the
    dynamics and noise. Eqs. 8a and b represent the Box Jenkins model [36]. (8a) Where
    (8b) Water content in volume at time t is denoted by y(t), input variables are
    denoted by u(t), and estimate error is denoted by e(t). A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x),
    and F(x) are the polynomials that determine the model''s output, inputs, and estimate
    errors, respectively. 2.3.3. The State Space Model In statistics, a state-space
    model is a kind of probabilistic graphical model that graphically expresses the
    probabilistic dependency between a latent state variable and an observed measurement.
    [37]. It represents the dynamics of an Nth order system as a first-order differential
    equation in an N-vector, which is called the state [38]. The important attribute
    of the state vector x(t) in the state space formulation is that it entirely specifies
    the system at a time t [39]. Future states are determined solely by the current
    state, x(t), and any inputs, u(t), at time t and beyond. The current state x(t)
    summarizes all previous states and the full input history; it thus encompasses
    all of the system''s memory. Eqs. 9a and 9b can be used to represent state space
    models. (9a) (9b) Where, is the state vector at time n, u is a vector of inputs,
    A is an state transition matrix, B is an input coeffient matrix, is a column vector
    of the output variables , is an matrix of the constant-coefficient that weight
    of state variables and is an m x n matrix of the constant-coefficient weight of
    the system inputs. 2.3.4. The Output Error Model When only white measurement noise
    is affecting the process output, the Output Error model structure is used as represented
    in Eqs. 10a and b [40]. (10a) This model can be expressed as (10b) 2.3.5. The
    Autoregressive with External Input Model (ARX) Model The ARX model is derived
    from Eq. 11 [41]. (11) Where and . These are polynomial matrices; d is the delay
    of the system. The ARX model is therefore simplified using equation 12 as shown.
    (12) 2.3.6. The Autoregressive Moving Average with Extra Input Model This autoregressive
    moving average with external input model (ARMAX) is in broader structure compared
    to the ARX as shown in Eq. 13. (13) Where . This is a polynomial where the noise
    term is explicitly modelled and expressed as shown in Eq. 14. (14) 2.4. System
    Identification in MATLAB Environment System identification toolbox in MATLAB was
    used to model the soil moisture dynamics starting with a lower order, increasing
    and decreasing the order of the polynomial and the variable delay. Fig. 4 shows
    the interface of the system identification toolbox where various model structures
    were used. A total of 9674 samples collected at 600s time steps were used in the
    modelling with 70 % of the data as estimation and 30 % as validation data. Additionally,
    pre-processing of the experimental data was performed to get rid of the trends,
    outliers, and means. as suggested by [42]. Download : Download high-res image

    toolbox. 2.5. Model Evaluation With the help of the lowest order of the system''s
    dynamics, the models constructed inside the MATLAB system identification toolbox
    are able to predict the behaviour of the system''s output and graphically represent
    the relationship between the system''s input and output variables [31]. Best fit,
    final prediction error (FPE), and mean square error (MSE) are three statistical
    measures that may be used to evaluate the efficacy of the developed models [31].
    2.5.1. Final Prediction Error Model quality is quantified by the absolute value
    of the prediction error obtained during validation on an independent data set.
    According to Abdul-Rahim et al. [43] the accuracy of the derived model is dependent
    on how small the FPE is. This is expressed in Eq. 15. (15) Where; Estimation data
    is denoted by N, and the associated prediction errors are represented by e(t),
    a vector of dimensions (n, -1). The estimated parameters are denoted by , while
    the total number of parameters is denoted by d 2.5.2. Mean Square Error The mean
    square error (MSE) is a statistical metric used to evaluate prediction quality
    in the same unit of the variable. The MSE score is near to zero, indicating that
    the model prediction is correct. The MSE is defined by Eq. 16: (16) Where; are
    observed and predicted values at time (i = 1,2,3,…n) and n is the data point.
    2.5.3. Estimated Fit The estimated fit (%) is a measure of the correlation between
    the measured output and the predicted output . This is computed as shown in Eq.
    17. (17) 3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Daily and Solar Radiation Fig. 5 presents
    the relationship between reference evapotranspiration , and Solar Radiation Rs,
    during the experimental data collection. It is observed that peak solar radiation
    received in the afternoon which translates into peak values of . The maximum recorded
    during the study period is 4.8 mmday−1 while the maximum solar radiation was 1357.9
    Wm−2. Reference evapotranspiration and solar radiation are crucial for effective
    irrigation management. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download

    period. 3.2. Reference evapotranspiration, water content and precipitation The
    soil moisture content at the start of the experiment was 0.34 m3/m3 as depicted
    in Fig. 6. During this time precipitation values were high given that the rainy
    season was coming to an end. As the precipitation reduced, the soil moisture content
    reduced to field capacity where it was being maintained through irrigation. The
    dynamics may be seen altering because of plant water absorption and environmental
    (weather) effects that induce water loss from the soil, resulting in a changing
    variation in the volumetric water content. As evapotranspiration causes water
    loss, the volumetric water content of the soil changes, indicating that more or
    less water is required to be provided for irrigation. As a result, these variables
    have a direct influence on the amount of water applied to the plant. Download

    simulation results in MATLAB presented in Table 1, it is evident that state space
    model performed better than other model structures (Transfer Functions, ARMAX,
    Box Jenkins, ARX and Output Error model). The state space mode yielded an estimated
    fit of 97.04 % being the highest amongst all the model structures evaluated. Additionally,
    in terms of the mean square error and final prediction error, the state space
    model performed better with the least values of the statistical criterion. The
    Output Error model on the other hand performed poorly amongst all the model structures.
    It could not mimic the soil moisture dynamics in the field and hence was not chosen
    for a model predictive controller design. The step ahead prediction results presented
    in Table 2 also support the state space model''s ability to represent the dynamic
    nature of the soil-water agricultural system. With a 5-steo ahead prediction it
    gives an estimated fit of 98.92 % making it the best choice for MPC design. The
    chosen model estimated the parameters as shown in Eqs. 15 and 17 in discrete-time
    state space model. Fig. 7 shows the 5-step ahead prediction of the system. Table

    the step response of the model structures evaluated in the MATLAB environment.
    The model structures are graded using the lowest order of the dynamic response.
    The first-order models'' output was found to be steady, with no overshoot or undershoot
    but a sluggish response time. There is no lag and a faster rising time compared
    to other models, even the Box Jenkins model with an offset. The frequency response
    curve, shown in Fig. 9, reveals that the dynamics of all model structures are
    identical over a wide range of frequencies. The purpose of this data-driven modelling
    was to create the forecasting models integral to creating a model-based controller
    for the physical system. The results show that despite the nonlinearity of the
    inputs, the output is quite steady. Despite experimental validation, the prediction
    model created in this study has some margin of error. Download : Download high-res

    Curve. The step and frequency response of the models can provide valuable information
    for practical agricultural purposes. For example, the step response can help to
    understand how quickly the system responds to changes in input (e.g., irrigation)
    and to identify any delays or oscillations in the response. The frequency response
    can help to identify the natural frequencies of the system and to design controllers
    that can regulate the system at different frequencies. 4. Conclusion Improving
    water use efficiency in precision agriculture is of paramount importance. Model-based
    irrigation management is one of the approaches through which irrigation scheduling
    can be responsive in real time especially for open field agricultural systems.
    This study demonstrates a data-driven approach where data from monitoring sensors
    in a drip irrigated tomato experiment is used to develop a soil moisture dynamics
    model using system identification. The resulting model is a state space model
    for great performance in terms of statistical evaluation criteria. In comparison
    to other model structures, it gives an estimation of fit of 97.04%, mean square
    error of 1.74 × 10−7 and final prediction error of 1.75 × 10−7. Future research
    will involve utilizing the state space model to develop a model predictive controller
    which will later be deployed on a micro-controller in an open field agricultural
    system. Funding Information The Institute de Recherché pour le Development (IRD),

  description: Traditional irrigation control systems is characterized with inefficient
    management of water and often results in low water productivity index and reduced
    cultivation yield. In addition, insufficient water supply and high rate of water
    loss due to evapotranspiration increases plant stress which often affects its
    growth and development. Therefore, to address this issues, this paper is aimed
    at developing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for water saving drip
    irrigation experiment that will regulate the soil moisture content within the
    desired field capacity and above the wilting point, while scheduling irrigation
    to replace the loss of water from soil and plant due to evapotranspiration in
    the greenhouse environment. The controller design involves a data driven predictive
    model identified and integrated with the MPC designer in MATLAB and thereafter
    exported in Simulink for simulation. The generate controller code was modified
    and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 controller to generate a pulse width modulated
    signal to drive the pump for the control water mixed with fertilizer. To achieve
    enhancement of controller an Internet of Things (IoT) integration was used for
    easy soil, weather, and plant monitoring which are used to update the MPC model
    for the irrigation control. The performance of the proposed MPC controller deployed
    drip irrigated Greenhouse(GH1) is benchmarked against an existing automatic evapotranspiration
    (ETo) model based controller in Greenhouse(GH2), with each greenhouse containing
    80 poly bags of Cantaloupe plant with similar growth stage. The results obtained
    shows that, the proposed MPC-based irrigation system has higher water productivity
    index of 36.8 g/liters, good quality of fruit with average sweetness level of
    13.5 Brix compared to automatic ETo-based irrigation system with 25.6 g/liters
    and 10.5 Brix, respectively. However, the total mass of harvested fruit for ETo-based
    irrigation system is higher than MPC-based irrigation system by 21.7%. The performance
    of the proposed MPC controller was achieved through the integration of event based
    scheduling with IoT monitoring as well as inclusion of evapotranspiration effect
    in the plant dynamics.

    of the most precious resources on the earth, it is therefore imperative to measure,
    control and preserve for sustainable agricultural production and healthy living.
    The severe global competition for food and water is due to the effect of increase
    in world''s population and climate change. This has increased the interest on
    how to achieve optimal use of scarce resources such as water using precision irrigation
    aimed at increasing food production and water saving [1]. The rate of water loss
    known as reference evapotranspiration (ETo) from plant and soil is dependant on
    the nonlinear dynamic change of soil, plant, and weather interaction. The regular
    change in evapotranspiration has effect in the available water in the soil for
    plant use, as a very high rate of ETo could lead to plant wilting. This remains
    a significant issue affecting the control strategies for crop irrigation, as there
    is a need for irrigation controller to adaptively adjust to the dynamic variations
    of soil, plant and weather parameters to ensure effective irrigation management
    [2]. Commonly, most farmers do not consider these dynamic varying factors when
    making irrigation scheduling decisions, which may lead to many draw backs such
    as low water use efficiency, reduced yield and more energy usage in driving pumps
    to supply of water for irrigation [3]. Consequently, the real time monitoring
    of weather, soil, and plant parameters within a cultivation environment using
    Internet of things (IoT) as well as wireless sensor networks (WSN) can enable
    the realization of smart management of different methods irrigation systems [4],
    [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. There are various control strategies that can be
    used for irrigation management. The irrigation control strategies are basically
    categorized in open loop and close loop control methods. Irrigation decisions
    using open-loop control approach are managed based on the farmer intuition and
    using either on or off irrigation timers to control opening and closing of valves.
    The irrigation timing and volume is often specified and applied based on the farmers
    experience without considering sensors feedback on the changing parameters that
    has effect on plant such as soil moisture contents, and other weather parameters
    [11], [12], [13] The issues affecting with open-loop control of irrigation system
    affected by various environmental disturbances such as evapotranspiration, effect
    of different growth stage requirement of plants (Kc), and requires regular adjustment
    to ensure better performance [14]. The close loop control approach has been reported
    to be able to address the issue associated with open loop through the use of sensor
    based signal as feedback to keep the measured output condition close to the desired
    trajectory while deciding the duration of water supply to plants [14,15]. Research
    work on close loop control of irrigation have been implemented through simulation
    using the linear control approach such as proportional integral differential (PID)
    [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and also linear quadratic regulator (LQR) [21], [22],
    [23], [24], [25], [26]. The works reported a good control performance through
    simulation, but their real time deployment on hardware was not thoroughly explored.
    Similarly, several works on intelligent control such as fuzzy logic and expert
    system approach where rules and formulated based on expert knowledge of the dynamics
    of the system was used to decide the timing and volume irrigation were carried
    out [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. This method has
    proven to be effective, but the drawback of this method is that no matter how
    well formulated the rules are, there will always be situations that don''t exist
    in the rules. In most cases fuzzy based irrigation controllers are not often adaptive
    to the varying dynamics of plant, weather, and soil parameters. Also, reported
    in literatures is the use of artificial neural networks for soil moisture prediction
    [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]] as well
    as metaheuristic algorithm for irrigation optimization [49], [50], [51], [52],
    [53], [54], [55]. The works were carried out as a good proof of concept through
    simulation, but the need for training of the ANN models on embedded hardware makes
    their real time implementation for irrigation of plant cultivation challenging,
    hence difficult to access their performance and suitability for farmers use. Also,
    the use of predictive models for irrigation scheduling has been reported in Refs.
    [56], [57], [58], [59]. The predictive models were used to predict the future
    trajectory of the control variable, while optimizing the cost function according
    to the reference trajectory. However, the work was only conducted through simulation
    only without experimental validation. In addition, the use of generalized predictive
    control (GPC) method for scheduling irrigation for tomato plant was reported to
    have achieved 20% water saving. However, the controller was not designed to handle
    constraint management on the control variables as well as the changing dynamics
    of the crop coefficient effect on ETo [60,61]. MPC is a model based algorithm
    that utilizes the model of a process to predict the future trajectory of the system
    controlled, by solving an online optimization at every time stamp to compute the
    future control action [62]. One of the issue reported in literature is on the
    applicability of MPC for process control application will provide a burden on
    producing high computational complexity associated with solving online optimization
    repeatedly on hardware [63]. Since the application of the MPC controller is in
    the area of precision irrigation agriculture has a slow process response, the
    integration of the concept of hourly event based triggering has been considered
    in this paper to decide the sampling instant at which the controller will solve
    online optimization to compute the optimal control action needed to minimize the
    error between the predicted moisture content of the soil and the set point trajectory
    can be used to address this issue. The summary of the comparison of the various
    related literatures to the proposed technique is illustrated in Table 1, where
    the proposed technique has more features considered in terms of monitored parameters,
    performance evaluation as well as implementation in both simulation and hardware.

    the volumetric water content of the soil within a desirable limit known as field
    capacity and wilting point towards water saving drip irrigation. These is achieved
    through the scheduling irrigation to replace the water loss due to high ETo in
    the greenhouse environment. The performance on the proposed MPC controller deployed
    in greenhouse 1 (GH1) was benchmarked with an existing automatic ETo based controller
    deployed in greenhouse 2 (GH2). The significant contribution of this paper as
    illustrated in Table 1 which includes the consideration of soil, plant and weather
    dynamic change using a predictive model and image processing to estimate the value
    of Kc in a greenhouse. The simulation and real time experimental implementation
    of the predictive control algorithm for greenhouse cultivation experiment leveraging
    on the developed IoT frame work towards effective monitoring of the various sensed
    variables to update the model of the controller. 2. Methodology MPC requires a
    good model that captures the dynamics of a process, to formulate an optimal control
    action that can drive the process through it reference trajectories. The process
    of model formulation for a drip irrigation system is based on the hydrological
    balance model as illustrated in Fig. 1, which has established that the change
    in soil moisture content during a period of time is as result of water inflow
    actions such as rainfall, irrigation as well as water outflows such as evapotranspiration,
    capillary rise, deep percolation and surface run off effect. The reference evapotranspiration
    also known as water loss from the process, is an important parameter of the model
    that depend on the weather variable, namely speed of wind, solar radiation, air
    temperature, air humidity, and the plant characteristic such as crop coefficient
    (Kc). Some measurable and estimated parameters of the hydrological process dynamics
    can be formulated into input and output data and use to fit an existing model
    structure through data driven modelling. The model that best fit to the data was
    further use for the MPC controller design needed for optimal water saving in a
    drip irrigation system. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download :

    An IoT based model predictive control framework. However, an improvement has been
    made as shown in Fig. 3 where an integration of model predictive controller has
    been designed in Raspberry Pi to control the pulse width modulated signal to drive
    the pump for supply of water through the drip irrigation network. Through the
    aid of a real-time IoT based weather station that senses weather parameters, an
    hourly computation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) inferring the loss of
    water from soil surface and plant leafs is estimated based on Modified FAO-56
    Penman–Monteith equation as shown in Eq. (1). The equation was developed in a
    customized IoT controller interfaced with the Davis weather station. Similarly,
    the real time computation of the crop coefficient (Kc) using image processing
    method which has effect on the rate of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) shown
    in Eq. (2) is also known as water loss which acts as disturbance to the process.
    (1) where, denotes the reference evapotranspiration (mm/hour); Rn represents the
    reference crop canopy net radiation (W/m2); Δ represents the slope of saturation
    vapour pressure (kPa °C-1); λ represent the latent heat of vaporization (kPa °C
    − 1); T represents the mean air temperature in Celsius; is the Mean daily or hourly
    wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1) and represent the stream pressure of saturation
    vapour (kPa) [71]. The estimated ETo is used to derive the actual evapotranspiration
    ( ), which is the loss of water from a specific crop, from where the estimated
    amount of water to replace the water loss is computed for further application
    to the plant, based on the crop coefficient ( ) which is of different value from
    one crop to another. (2) Based on the framework shown in Fig. 3, the real time
    sensing of soil moisture in terms of volumetric water content was carried out
    using a VH400 sensor connected to the IoT Expresso board. The VH400 sensor probe
    is a resistance based soil moisture content sensor which measures the dielectric
    constant of the soil when inserted vertically into the ground close to the root
    area of the plant [72]. The VH400 soil moisture sensor was calibrated using the
    piecewise linear equations as described in Eqs. (3)–(5). (3) (4) (5) where, is
    the slope of the line. The VH400’s voltage (v) to the curve can be approximated
    with 4 segments of the form in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively [73]. Similarly,
    and are the voltages recorded at the respective levels of and . The sensor has
    an inbuilt voltage regulator that operates with a DC input voltage of 3.5 to 20
    Volts, which requires an input current of less than 7 mA. It produces a DC output
    voltage in the range of 0 to 3 which infers different level of the soil water
    content [74]. Similarly, the irrigation volume and reference evapotranspiration
    was computed using an IoT based flow metre and weather station. Similarly, the
    irrigation volume of the IoT based flowmeter produces an output digital pulse
    and then further counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the amount of
    water flow per each irrigation event. The water flowrate is calibrated using Eqs.
    (6) and (7). (6) where, the number of pulses generated per litre of water flowing
    through the sensor can be found in the water flow sensors specification datasheet,
    while is the number of pulse count generated by the flow sensor. The water flow
    volume can be calculated by summing up the product of flowrate and the time interval.
    (7) Water loss also known as disturbance of the process plant which requires an
    estimation of real time crop coefficient ( ) to guide an efficient water management
    [75]. To accurately estimate the water loss actual evapotranspiration (ETc) termed
    water loss requires real time monitoring of Kc at different growth stage as well
    as measurement of real time of reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Determining
    the height of the plant as well as the leaf area index using image processing
    to compute the can guide the accurate determination for the actual water loss
    and enable the model predictive controller to be able to compensate for the loss
    [75]. The computation of the was carried out using the ratio of LAI and plant
    height estimated based on Eq. (8) using and computed on Raspberry pi with camera.
    (8) 2.1. Data driven system identification of the system The data driven system
    identification of the process was carried out offline in MATLAB using the input
    and output data collected from a previous open loop experiment on similar plant.
    The experimental data collected was pre-processed and split into two, one for
    estimation and the other for validation. The data driven model is obtained using
    a system identification method, in which 3700 data point of input and output experimental
    dataset with sampling time of 10 min was used for the identification. Different
    time series model structures were selected to get a good model of the best fit,
    but the discrete-time state space model was chosen due to it suitability for controller
    design. The identified state space model is represented by Eqs. (9) and (10) with
    , , and matrices was used to represent the dynamics of the real system. Also,
    is the state variable at time instant , is the manipulated variable (irrigation
    flow), is the measured output (volumetric water content of the soil). (9) (10)
    where, 2.2. Model predictive control for drip irrigation system Model predictive
    control (MPC) is a process control algorithm that uses a model of a system to
    predict the future evolution of the system to optimize the control signal according
    to the cost function, while bringing the predictive output of the system to track
    the desired reference trajectory [76]. MPC requires a model that fully capture
    the varying dynamics of the plant to allow a good estimation of the future process
    while the controller takes decision based on the forecasting of the system''s
    behaviour through optimization. The prediction horizon is the future number of
    samples to which the controller can predict the output of the plant, while the
    control horizon is the number of samples within the prediction horizon to which
    the controller have effect on the control signal. The MPC irrigation controller
    block diagram illustrated by Fig. 4 shows the irrigation system (plant) which
    is the cultivation environment with crop whose major monitoring and control parameter
    is the soil moisture, and often disturbed by high ETc, hence that requires the
    control action in terms of irrigation volume to compensate for the water loss
    in order to maintain the desired reference trajectory of the soil moisture content
    implied as the control variable. The MPC controller needs to predict the volume
    of irrigation in order to optimize some desired characteristics of the plant required
    at each sampling instance. Download : Download high-res image (482KB) Download

    that is denoted as the state variable SM(t) is , i.e. , ,…, , where , is the state
    variable predicted at the sampling instant . The prediction horizon , denotes
    the number of future predicted samples. The objective of the MPC is to optimize
    the future control effort trajectory where is the control input or applied irrigation,
    is the control horizon that denotes the number of parameters that determines the
    future control trajectory. Note that , while denote the reference evapotranspiration
    which act as disturbance on the plant state variable. According to Ref. [77],
    in order to calculate the set of predicted state and output variables as a function
    of the future control variable using a state space model ( ) over a prediction
    horizon of as follows: (11) (12) (13) Similarly, the predicted output variables
    can be derived using the set of future control variables as follows (14) (15)
    (16) Therefore the future control moves and the future state variable are calculated
    from the augmented matrix and based on this the predicted output variable derived
    from Eqs. (9) to (16) and is given by Eq. (17). (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) and (22)
    (23) The cost function of the optimization is formulated in Eq. (24) as follows:
    (24) is the reference trajectory of the target soil moisture value, is the future
    value of the soil moisture content, is the function of the state and input variable.
    Where the vector of the references over is , is the current reference. is the

    of the MPC irrigation controller. The goal of the controller cost function to
    satisfy the dynamics of the system. That is to make the future output as close
    to the set point or reduce the error between the future output and the set point
    , ie reduce by generating the sequence of the appropriate control input action
    (k) in steady state where the change in control signal is eliminated. The formulation
    optimization problem for the MPC irrigation system design is to find the sequence
    of input that will minimize the cost function in Eq. (25). (25) Subject to the
    constraints that the initial state are measured at any time is known and measured
    and maintained between the field capacity of the soil ( ) and wilting point (
    . The minimization also need to satisfy the system dynamics as well as the irrigation
    volume so as not to over irrigate the greenhouse to prevent over flooding with
    water and also maintain the soil moisture between the field capacity and wilting
    point. where, is the allowable optimal effective irrigation effort, are the wilting
    point and field capacity of the plant root zone deficit which serves as constraints
    to the irrigation system. The optimal control signal is obtained as follows in
    Eq. (26). (26) 2.4. Real time implementation of data driven MPC design in Simulink
    This section describe the application of MPC for designing a real time irrigation
    controller simulation via Simulink. The MPC controller block was designed with
    the state space model identified using the data driven modelling through system
    identification, and imported into the MPC designer app for configuration and tuning
    as described by algorithm 1 in Table 3, while flowchart guiding the controller
    is also illustrated using Fig. 8. The performance of the MPC also depends on the
    choice of the control and prediction horizon, and constraints on the control variable.
    The parameters used to design the predictive controller are, the prediction horizon
    of 5 and control horizon of 10 was chosen as seen in Table 2. One of the main
    strength is the ability to handle constraint on the plant. The constraint on the
    control variable (soil moisture) is set within the lower limit and upper limit
    called wilting point and field capacity respectively. Table 2. Parameters of the

    the weights on the control and manipulated variable (MV) was use to adjust the
    controller performance. The weight on the MV was used to penalise the control
    action, meaning that because the system is strongly nonlinear, with rapid variations
    of some variable with time, if the sampling interval is set too long, the process
    will be out of control for a long time simulation [59,78]. The input weights were
    chosen as close to zero (0.01), to provide more good control response. After the
    design, the controller is exported to the MATLAB workspace and saved as mat file.
    The MPC controller was exported and integrated with the event generator function
    in Simulink as shown in Fig. 5. In order to ensure optimal computational and controller
    performance and event based generator was integrated to update the controller
    based on a triggering event at one hour interval and when ETo is more than 1 mm/day

    The close loop simulation of the MPC controller design implemented in Simulink
    was deployed through of it support package for Raspberry Pi the hardware implementation
    realization as illustrated in Fig. 6. The model predictive irrigation algorithm
    generates the control action in form of pulse width modulated (PWM) signal a with
    a varying duty cycle to drive the manipulated variable while compensating for
    the loss and disturbance on the plant. The motor driver receives PWM control action
    signal from the GPIO pin 12 and 13 of the Raspberry Pi and provides the necessary
    driving current to the direct current (DC) water pump from the power supply. Raspberry-Pi
    4 micro-computer was used to implement the model-based irrigation control system
    in real-time. The Raspberry pi uses a 1.5 GHz quad-core Broadcom processor, 64
    bit SoC with 4 GB DDR4 of RAM, GPU 500 MHz video core vi. With this SoC specification,
    the model predictive control algorithm was able to run efficiently. The deployed
    MPC controller illustrated using the flowchart in Fig. 7 was used to adaptively
    control irrigation volume based on the rate of water loss for Cantaloupe plant
    cultivation in greenhouse 1 (GH1) from 10th September, 2020 and 29th October,
    2020. Similarly, the automatic ET-based controller deployed in greenhouse 2 (GH2)
    was used to bench mark the performance of the proposed MPC controller. Download

    in Simulink. The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Simulink
    is shown in Fig. 9. The graphs show the interaction plot of the soil moisture
    content, actual evapotranspiration, and irrigation flow against several sampling
    instant. The simulation results shows that the control variable, also the volumetric
    water content of the soil was brought to the set point of 0.35 m3/m3 even when
    the disturbance (water loss) in terms of actual evapotranspiration ETc is high,
    there is also corresponding control action to replace the water loss from the
    soil. The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Fig. 8 has similar
    trend with the bench marked works of [66,79], in terms of the control action denoted
    as irrigation volume, used to compensated for the water loss while regulating
    the soil moisture content within field capacity and wilting point. Similarly,
    the Fig. 10(a)–(c) further shows the relationship between the measured daily ETo,
    daily soil moisture content, and the daily hourly irrigation volume in (Liters)
    measured in MPC controlled GH1 respectively. The proposed controller was able
    to regulate the soil moisture content within the field capacity and wilting point,
    even when the rate of water loss in terms of ETo is high, while the pumped irrigation
    water was able to adaptively compensate the water loss (ETo). Download : Download

    4. Discussion Based on the comparison of the yield performance from the two greenhouses
    controlled by the MPC controller (GH1) and ETo based controller (GH2), the total
    mass of the harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of the GH1 as seen in Fig.
    11. This could be as a result of the fact that a lot of water was consumed during
    the irrigation process in GH2, when compared to that of GH1. However the quality
    of fruits harvested in terms of sweetness was recorded in GH1 is observed to be
    better that the harvested fruits in GH2 as illustrated in Fig. 12. Therefore,
    the GH1 irrigated using the MPC has better fruit quality in terms of sweetness
    and improved water use efficiency. This could be due to the gradual increase of
    water supply to the plant root area based on the plant, soil and weather demand.
    Furthermore, the computation of the daily cumulative water use was carried out
    to be able to track the water saving capability of both controllers. From the
    graph of cumulative irrigation water use (Liters) shown in Fig. 13, it can be
    seen that irrigation water consumed by the automatic ETo controller is higher
    than that of the MPC controller. Similarly, about 2022 liters of water was saved
    in GH1 controlled by MPC. It can also be deduced from Fig. 13, the MPC controller
    in GH1 was able to achieve a 30.4% water saving when compared to automatic ETo
    based controller in GH2. This is due to the fact that MPC in GH1 was able to adaptive
    to the changing dynamics of the process as compared with the GH2 controller. (27)
    In addition, the performance of both controllers in GH2 and GH1, in terms of the
    water productivity index which relates the total mass on Cantaloupe produced with
    the total irrigation water use was further estimated using Eq. (27). According
    to Fig. 13, the total cumulative irrigation volume for GH2 and GH1 is 4467 and
    2445 liters respectively, while total mass of equal samples of yield in GH2 and
    GH1 is 115.3 kg and 90 kg. Therefore, the water productivity index of GH1 is 36.8
    kg/litres as against 25.6 kg/litres in GH2. It can be further deduced that the
    MPC controller in GH1 gives water productivity of 30.4% higher than the automatic
    ETo based controller in GH2, hence, highly suitable for water saving agriculture.

    This paper presents the design and experimental implementation of data driven
    MPC for precision irrigation. The MPC controller was designed using a data driven
    identified state space model that captures the changing dynamics of the process,
    with the ability to adaptive control the irrigation volume required to compensate
    for the water loss within the greenhouse environment and also minimise the error
    between the measured soil moisture and the reference trajectory of the volumetric
    water content of the soil. The performance of the MPC controller deployed on Raspberry
    Pi 4 was put to test on the experimental cultivation of Cantaloupe plant using
    drip irrigation in GH1. The MPC irrigated greenhouse (GH1) recorded a good quality
    of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix and higher water productivity
    index of 36.8 g/liters compared to automatic ETo based controller irrigated greenhouse
    (GH2) with 10.5 Brix and 25.6 g/liters respectively. However, the total mass of
    harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of GH1. From the performance comparison,
    both irrigation methods have their strength and weakness on Cantaloupe plant cultivation.
    Therefore, it is expected that this research effort will guide farmers to adopt
    an effective irrigation controller which comply with their cultivation objectives
    such as water saving, improve yield, and quality. Data availability Data will
    be made available on request. References [1] N. Sigrimis, P. Antsaklis, P.P. Groumpos

  description: Agriculture is a major consumer of freshwater, in particular in countries
    like India. From the perspectives of crop yield and water conservation, the development
    of advanced model-based irrigation scheduling methods is desirable. Most of the
    farming in India is done by small-scale farmers and to serve their needs, we are
    developing a simple model-based system that can be applied semi-manually and does
    not need expensive sensors and costly data. In this article, an optimal irrigation
    system, based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses a physics-based model
    to compute an optimal amount of irrigation for the next day, is developed. The
    robustness of the developed system is tested by comparing the effect of errors
    in a key model parameter as well as in the weather forecast.

    Get rights and content Abstract Agriculture is a major consumer of freshwater,
    in particular in countries like India. From the perspectives of crop yield and
    water conservation, the development of advanced model-based irrigation scheduling
    methods is desirable. Most of the farming in India is done by small-scale farmers
    and to serve their needs, we are developing a simple model-based system that can
    be applied semi-manually and does not need expensive sensors and costly data.
    In this article, an optimal irrigation system, based on Model Predictive Control
    (MPC), which uses a physics-based model to compute an optimal amount of irrigation
    for the next day, is developed. The robustness of the developed system is tested
    by comparing the effect of errors in a key model parameter as well as in the weather
    forecast. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords modeling and

    irrigation water-use efficiency through closed-loop control is essential. The
    complex agro-hydrological system dynamics, however, often pose challenges in closed-loop
    control applications. In this work, we propose a two-layer neural network (NN)

    The model is employed by a model predictive controller with zone tracking (ZMPC),
    which aims to keep the root zone soil moisture in the target zone while minimizing
    the total amount of irrigation. The performance of the proposed approximation
    model framework is shown to be better compared to a benchmark long-short-term-memory

    the tracking offset caused by the plant-model-mismatch of the proposed NN framework,
    a shrinking target zone is proposed for the ZMPC. Different hyper-parameters of
    the shrinking zone in the presence of noise and weather disturbances are investigated,
    of which the control performance is compared to a ZMPC with a time-invariant target
    zone. 1 INTRODUCTION Water scarcity is a rapidly escalating global issue due to
    various factors such as population growth and climate change. Approximately 70%
    of the freshwater is consumed by agriculture activities.1, 2 Thus, improving the
    water-use efficiency in the agriculture industry is essential. Currently, practical
    irrigation policies are mostly open-loop, which are determined based on heuristic
    or empirical knowledge. Real-time feedback from the field is often not considered.
    This approach typically has low irrigation efficiency, as the applied irrigation
    amount can be imprecise, leading to over or insufficient irrigation. Increasing
    attentions have been drawn to closed-loop irrigation over the past decade.3, 4
    Among various approaches, advanced control strategies are popular due to their
    ability of handling constraints and multiple objectives simultaneously.5-10 In
    References 5-7, conventional model predictive control (MPC) is employed to optimize
    the soil-moisture dynamics in real-time in the presence of weather disturbances.
    Instead of tracking set-point, Mao et al. proposed an MPC controller that tracks
    a target zone (ZMPC), which provides more degrees of freedom in control actions.8
    Long-term irrigation scheduling that aims to optimize crop production over a longer
    time duration is investigated in References 9 and 10. To be more specific, Nahar
    et al. proposed a hierarchical framework including a scheduler and a controller.9
    The scheduler has a larger sampling time and optimizes over the entire crop growth
    season. Some soil moisture reference is provided by the scheduler and is tracked
    by the controller over shorter horizons. Sahoo et al. proposed a knowledge-based
    scheduler that optimizes the irrigation amount and time explicitly and is shown
    to be effective under different scenarios.10 One of the major challenges in applying
    advanced control to the agro-hydrological system is the high computational cost.
    The water dynamics are often described by the Richards equation, which is a nonlinear
    PDE developed based on first principles.11 Spatial discretization is often required
    to simplify the Richards equation in applications,11 however, the resulting nonlinear
    ODE system is still difficult to solve and leads to states with higher dimensions.
    Model reduction or approximation techniques are commonly used to reduce the computational
    complexity of high-dimensional nonlinear models. Model reduction is carried out
    based on existing models and aims to simplify them. One of the widely used approaches
    is to project the high dimension original state space onto a lower dimension subspace,12,
    13 of which a representative method is the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).14
    However, the physical meanings of the original states are often not preserved
    by the projection approach, making it difficult to handle state constraints. Data-based
    model identification methods are often used to approximate complex nonlinear models8,
    15-17 with no first-principle knowledge regarding the system required. However,
    it may be challenging to determine an appropriate model structure, which has a
    significant impact on the final modeling performance. Furthermore, the computational
    cost of the identified model might still be significant depending on its structure.
    For example, in Reference 8 a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model was identified
    for agro-hydrological dynamics approximation, where computational cost reduction
    was observed but still not sufficient for real-time online optimizations. Model
    approximation based on neural networks (NN) is a more generalized approach compared
    to traditional model identification. In particular, the long short term memory
    (LSTM) NNs have received rising research interest in dynamic modeling due to their
    ability to capture the dynamics of a system.18-21 Motivated by the accuracy and
    computational efficiency of the NN model reduction observed in our previous work22
    and inspired by the structure of the LPV model developed in Reference 8, we propose
    a two-layer NN framework to approximate the agro-hydrological dynamics in this
    work. The proposed framework is shown to have better open-loop prediction performance
    compared to a benchmark single LSTM NN. The developed two-layer NN model is employed
    in a ZMPC controller in the presence of noise and weather disturbances. The control
    objective is to minimize the amount of irrigation required while keeping the soil
    moisture content inside the target zone. In order to address the plant-model-mismatch,
    open-loop bias correction is added to the model, while a shrinking target zone
    is employed for ZMPC. Two bias correction models are investigated with different
    updating frequencies and the one with better open-loop prediction performance
    is used in ZMPC. The shrinking ZMPC target zone is designed such that the shape
    of the zone can be tuned by modifying the hyper-parameters, of which the effects
    on the control performance are investigated. The article is organized as follows.
    The agro-hydrological system of interest is introduced in Section 2. Details of
    the proposed two-layer NN framework are discussed in Section 6, of which the open-loop
    validation is provided in Section 10 with two plant-model-mismatch compensation
    strategies investigated in Section 13. The ZMPC controller employed is introduced
    in Section 16. The closed-loop simulation results are presented in Section 17.
    Finally, concluding remarks are provided in Section 23. 2 PRELIMINARIES A schematic
    of the agro-hydrological system of interest is shown in Figure 1 with grass being
    the crop of interest. The soil properties are assumed to be homogeneous horizontally
    and only the soil water dynamics on the vertical axis are considered. Irrigation
    is applied with a sprinkler and is assumed to reach the soil surface evenly. Precipitation
    and evapotranspiration are considered as known disturbances based on weather forecasting
    data with uncertainties. It is assumed that precipitation reaches the soil surface
    in identical ways as irrigation. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A schematic
    diagram of the considered agro-hydrological system. 2.1 Soil water dynamics Based
    on first principles, the soil water dynamics can be modeled using the 1-dimensional
    Richards equation with the crop and weather information taken into account:11
    (1) where (m) is the capillary potential, (m ) denotes the soil capillary capacity,
    and (m/s) is the soil hydraulic conductivity. The term captures the effect of
    the soil type, weather, and crop. To be more specific, represents the dimensionless
    water stress factor and depends on the soil type, is the dimensionless crop coefficient
    and is determined by the type of crop considered. (m) denotes the reference evapotranspiration
    and is assumed to be a known weather-dependent disturbance. m represents the rooting
    depth of the crop and is assumed to be time-invariant in this work. Note that
    (m) represents the vertical axis of the soil with upwards as the positive direction.
    and are modeled by the van Genuchten–Mualem soil hydraulic model:23 (2) (3) where
    (m/s) denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity, (m /m ) and (m /m ) represent
    the saturated and the residual soil moisture, respectively. (m ) and are the van
    Genuchten–Mualem parameters related to the soil properties. Sandy loam soil is
    considered in this work and the corresponding parameters are adopted from Reference
    24 and are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1. Soil parameters of sandy loamy soil.

    2.2 Boundary conditions The boundary conditions employed in this work are presented
    in (4) and (5). The Neumann boundary condition is used at the soil surface as
    shown in (4), while free drainage is assumed for the bottom boundary as described
    in (5). (4) (5) where (m/s) and (m/s) denote the rate of irrigation and precipitation
    at time . Note that interception caused by grass leaves is ignored in this work,
    only evapotranspiration, precipitation, and irrigation are considered. 2.3 Model
    discretization The system of Equation (1) is discretized over the vertical spatial
    axis following the approach proposed in Reference 11, which leads to an ODE system:
    (6) where , , and are the state, input, and disturbance vectors, respectively,
    while defines the nonlinear system dynamics. The total depth of soil considered
    is 0.5 m and is evenly discretized into 26 nodes. The water dynamics at the center
    of each node are used to represent the dynamics of the entire node. In this work,
    irrigation rate (m/s) is the system input, and (m) at the discretized nodes represents
    the system states. The disturbance are the precipitation rate and the reference
    evapotranspiration, which are available to the system with bounded uncertainties.
    The system output is the volumetric water content (m /m ) at the rooting depth
    , which is an algebraic function of the state vector defined by the soil-water
    retention equation of van Genuchten (7). Equations (6) and (7) are used to generate
    all training datasets. (7) 3 PROPOSED TWO-LAYER NEURAL NETWORK To reduce the computational
    complexity of the first-principle model, a two-layer NN framework is proposed
    to approximate its nonlinear dynamics. In this section, details regarding the
    proposed framework will be discussed. Section 6 introduces the motivation and
    provides an overview of the proposed framework. Sections 7 and 8 discuss the data
    generation procedure for the individual layers of the framework respectively.
    3.1 Overview In this work, LSTM NNs will be used to approximate the original nonlinear
    system dynamics due to their ability of efficiently handle sequential data.25,
    26 Through parameter tuning and various training dataset generation, it was found
    that a single LSTM that can capture the complex nonlinear dynamics of the agro-hydrological
    system over the entire operating range of interest is very challenging to obtain.
    It was noticed, however, within a smaller operating region, a single LSTM provides
    satisfying modeling performance with significantly reduced tuning difficulty.
    Detailed simulation results will be presented in Section 10. A schematic diagram
    of the proposed framework is presented in Figure 2. The first layer contains sub-models,
    namely Model 1– Model , which will be referred to as in the following text. The
    second layer consists of a single model (Model A, referred to as ). Each sub-model
    in the first layer is responsible for a sub-operating region. The union set of
    the sub-operating regions forms the entire operating region of interest. are LSTMs
    while is a fully connected NN. At the current time step , take the system input
    and output obtained from previous time steps as NN inputs: and returns one-step-ahead
    predictions regarding the system output: Recall that each sub-model is only reliable
    in a sub-operating region. Inspired by Mao et al.,8 the proposed framework adopts
    the idea of the LPV models. The model performance can be improved by combining
    predictions made by multiple sub-models. The one-step-ahead predictions made by
    are fed to , where the final prediction of the system output at the next time
    step ( ) is obtained. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A schematic diagram
    of the proposed two-layer NN framework. Overall, at any time step , the proposed
    framework takes as input and returns the one-step-ahead prediction of the system
    output , which can be expressed as a nonlinear function: (8) Remark 1.The motivation
    for introducing the second layer NN is to smooth the transition between the sub-models
    and provide a continuous prediction trajectory of the agro-hydrological system.
    Continuity of the prediction trajectory is essential for advanced control applications,
    as most nonlinear optimization solvers use gradient-based algorithms. 3.2 Design
    and training of first-layer NNs As discussed in the previous section, the first
    layer of the proposed framework consists of LSTMs. Simulations show that an LSTM
    can predict the agro-hydrological dynamics well if the difference between the
    upper and lower bound of the system output to be predicted by the LSTM is less
    than or equal to 0.15. The overall operating range determined based on the system
    output is . With the consideration of reserving some overlapping buffer zones
    between different sub-models, the overall operating region is split into three
    sub-operating regions, which are presented in Table 2. Three LSTMs are trained
    individually for the sub-operating regions (i.e., ). The number of LSTM layers
    employed in the models is also included. Each model consists of 1 or 2 LSTM layers,
    followed by a fully connected layer. Activation functions “sigmoid” and “tanh”
    are used. Both activation functions have smooth dynamics, where “tanh” function
    provides steeper responses compare to “sigmoid” function. Each sub-model is equivalent
    to a nonlinear function: where the model input is a matrix with 20 rows and 2
    columns, and the output is a scalar. 20 is the number of the past input–output
    data points ( ), while 2 is the number of system input ( ) plus the number of
    system output ( ). All models have a sampling time of 2 h. TABLE 2. Operating
    ranges of the sub-models. Operating range # of LSTM layers 1 1 2 Three training
    datasets that vary in the corresponding operating region are generated for the
    sub-models respectively. Each dataset contains 30,000 data points. Multi-level
    pseudorandom input signals are employed to generate all three datasets, which
    are fed into the discrete ODE system (6) and the Algebraic equation (7) for open-loop
    simulations. A multi-level pseudorandom signal is similar to a pseudorandom binary
    signal, except that it has multiple levels, which helps to stimulate the nonlinear
    dynamics of the agro-hydrological system. More details regarding the design of
    multi-level pseudorandom inputs can be found in our previous work.22 Figure 3
    presents a segment of the training input signal and the corresponding system output
    for . Note that a random noise signal is added to the output trajectory to mimic
    real process operations, which is shown in Figure 3B in red. The max magnitude
    of is defined as follows: where and are the maximum and minimum value of the system
    output in the dataset. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A segment of
    the training dataset of . All datasets need to be reorganized to match the input–output
    structure of the NNs. Scaling is also required such that the magnitudes of the
    scaled data are less than 1. All simulations are carried out in Python. TensorFlow27
    is used to train the NN models. Readers may refer to our previous work22 for more
    details regarding data pre-processing and NN training. 3.3 Design and training
    of second-layer NN The second layer of the proposed framework consists of a fully
    connected NN equivalent to the following nonlinear function: The inputs to model
    are the one-step-ahead predictions of the system output made by , , and , while
    the output is the actual system output prediction. Two fully connected layers
    with the activation function “sigmoid” are used in . Under the objective of predicting
    the system output over the entire operating range of interest, the training dataset
    of covers the entire operating range. A section of the training dataset including
    100,000 points is presented in Figure 4, where the input signal and the corresponding
    output trajectories without and with white noise added are presented. Note that
    the training dataset of spans all the sub-operating regions with more aggressive
    dynamics. Instead of continuous irrigation with lower magnitudes, an impulse irrigation
    signal is used to provide a more aggressive output response that varies in a larger
    operating range, which is desired for training. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint A segment of the training dataset of . Similar to that discussed in
    the previous section, reconstruction and scaling are necessary for this dataset.
    Note that the inputs to are not the system input and output. The dataset is passed
    through the pre-identified sub-models after the data preprocessing. The predictions
    made by the sub-models are collected, which are the designed inputs for and are
    used to train . Remark 2.The proposed framework is developed based on the agro-hydrological
    dynamics specifically and is control-application oriented. The sub-operating regions
    are determined based on simulations and available knowledge regarding the system
    of interest. However, the proposed framework provides an approach to capture complex
    nonlinear dynamics with a combination of aggressive and smooth dynamics simultaneously.
    It also provides an approach to reduce the computational complexity of advanced
    control based on LPV models. 4 MODEL VALIDATION The prediction performance of
    the proposed framework is validated in this section. The maximum number of prediction
    steps is for this work, which is also the control horizon of interest for following
    ZMPC applications. Section 10 presents the validation results of the sub-models.
    The proposed framework is then compared with a single LSTM in Section 11. 4.1
    Validation of the first-layer sub-models The multi-step-ahead prediction performances
    of are presented in this section. Validation datasets are obtained in similar
    manners as the training datasets with 20% white noise added to the system output.
    This helps to better test the prediction performance of the models. At any given
    time step, noise-treated validation data are fed to the model for one-step-ahead
    prediction. Starting from the second time instant, the prediction made by the
    model at the previous time instant will be used as the initial condition of the
    current time instant. This procedure is repeated 20 times, providing twenty-steps-ahead
    predictions. TABLE 3. NRMSE of multi-step-ahead-predictions of the sub-models.

    0.111 The prediction performance is measured by the normalized root mean square
    error (NRMSE) of the multi-step-ahead predictions in the desired operating range
    of each model and is summarized in Table 3. The NRMSE is defined as follows: (9)
    where is the total number of validation data points, and are the true and predicted
    system outputs, respectively. Figures 5-7 present the multi-step-ahead open-loop
    prediction performance of , , and respectively. The same line styles are used
    in Figures 5-7 for consistency. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint One-step-ahead

    in the presence of noise. When the magnitude of the system output is low, small
    prediction offsets can be observed for in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows only some minor
    offsets exist at the local extremes for . For both and , the effect of noise seems
    to be minor. For , Figure 7 indicates that the noise has a stronger impact on
    the single-step-ahead prediction, which deviates and becomes insignificant as
    the number of prediction steps increases. It is also noticed that when the output
    converges to steady-states, the impact of the noise is the most significant. Similar
    to and , also has some minor offsets at the local extremes. For different operating
    ranges, different system output dynamics are observed. When the soil moisture
    content and the irrigation rate are low, no obvious steady-state is observed (Figure
    5). As the operating range shifts to the higher magnitude side, the soil moisture
    content tends to saturate to steady-states under continuous irrigation (Figure
    7). 4.2 Validation of the proposed two-layer framework The multi-step-ahead prediction
    performance of the proposed framework is investigated in this section. A single
    LSTM that aims to predict the agro-hydrological dynamics over the entire operating
    region is used as the benchmark approximation model. The benchmark LSTM has the
    same input ( ) and output ( ) structures as the proposed two-layer NN framework,
    which are discussed in Section 6. The single LSTM has 2 LSTM layers followed by
    a fully connected output layer. Both the LSTM layers use the activation function
    “sigmoid” while the output layer uses the activation function “tanh.” Note that
    the dataset employed for training the benchmark LSTM is the same as that used
    to train the two-layer NN model. The same validation dataset is used to compare
    the performance of the two approximation approaches, which spans the entire operating
    range of interest. The open-loop prediction trajectories of the system output
    based on the benchmark LSTM and the proposed framework are presented in Figures
    8 and 9 respectively. The single-step-ahead, ten-step-ahead, and twenty-step-ahead
    predictions are presented in each figure with the same line styles as those employed
    in the previous section. The NRMSE values under the two cases and the percentage
    difference between them are summarized in Table 4. The percentage difference is
    calculated with respect to the NRMSE of the benchmark LSTM: As presented in Figure
    8, the LSTM can respond to aggressive dynamics efficiently without delays. However,
    significant offsets are observed at the local extremes with larger magnitudes.
    A section of the trajectories is amplified, which can be seen on the top-right
    corner of Figure 8. At both the local maximum and the minimum, significant offsets
    can be observed in the zoomed-in plot, of which the predicted local minimums are
    at the level of the true local maximum. Better prediction performance is observed
    in Figure 9. To be specific, the dynamics at the local minimums can be captured
    by the proposed two-layer framework much better compared to the LSTM. From the
    zoomed-in window on the top right, it can be observed that the predictions of
    the local minimum and maximum are more accurate compared to the LSTM. Table 4
    indicates comparison results, showing that the NRMSE values of the proposed framework
    are significantly lower than those obtained with the LSTM for all different prediction
    steps. The improvement of the proposed framework is the most significant with
    one-step-ahead predictions and slowly reduces as the prediction steps increase.

    cannot accurately approximate the local maximums with larger magnitudes. These
    prediction errors are challenging to eliminate through tuning the hyper-parameters
    of the NN framework or through modifying the training dataset. To account for
    the relatively significant plant-model mismatch at local maximums and the effect
    of disturbance at a lower cost, we introduce a simple bias-and-scale-updated model,
    of which the details are provided in the following section. 5 PLANT-MODEL-MISMATCH
    CORRECTION To capture the plant-model-mismatch, two correction approaches are
    investigated based on the proposed two-layer NN framework. The first approach
    is to add a simple bias term based on the prediction error: (10) where and represent
    the actual output measurement and the prediction made by the two-layer NN framework
    respectively. The second approach is to fit a first order linear model that maps
    the predicted output to the actual measurement: (11) where and are parameters
    to be identified. For both approaches, an updating frequency of the parameters
    needs to be determined first. In this work, we are interested in accurately predicting
    the system dynamics 20 steps into the future, thus the updating frequency should
    be a divisor of 20. To test the performance of the two approaches, the validation
    dataset used in the previous section is employed. The updating policies of the
    two approaches are presented in Algorithms 1 and 2, respectively. In both algorithms,
    represents the current time step, denotes the step of predictions made ahead of
    time , and represents the prediction error at step . At any given time instant
    , the parameters are first initialized with some initial guess. The initial condition
    is provided to the proposed framework for multi-step ahead predictions. In the
    next steps, predictions will be made with the correction model considered, which
    will be updated every time steps for times. The updating policy of the first approach
    is to take the average of the accumulated prediction errors over the last prediction
    steps. For the second approach, a constrained optimization problem that finds
    the best-fit parameters for the linear model is solved. Note that the parameters
    are held in bounded compact sets, which help to limit the parameters in a reasonable
    range. To be more specific, and are used. If a simple linear-regression function
    is employed, the resulting parameters might be impractical. The toolbox CasADi28
    is employed to solve optimization problems in Python. Algorithm 1. Parameter updating
    algorithm for the first correction approach Algorithm 2. Parameter updating algorithm
    for the second correction approach Recall the prediction horizon of interest .
    Thus updating frequencies are tested and compared. The correction performance
    is measured by the average absolute prediction error : where the same definitions
    are kept for all variables. The absolute prediction errors of the two correction
    approaches are summarized in Table 5. The absolute prediction error of just the
    proposed NN framework is as well included in Table 5 and is used as the comparison
    benchmark. TABLE 5. Performance of the mismatch correction approach in terms of

    approach leads to more significant errors, which is not applicable. The linear
    model correction shows very minor performance improvements. When , similar improvements
    in the prediction performance are observed in both approaches. The single bias
    correction performs similarly for and . For the linear model correction, is not
    applicable. Considering the computational complexity of the two approaches, the
    single-bias correction with is selected. 6 CONTROLLER DESIGN A ZMPC controller
    with a shrinking target zone is employed in this work and is presented in this
    section. The major target here is to provide sufficient irrigation such that the
    crop can live and grow healthily, which implies the soil moisture content at the
    crop root zone needs to be kept in a bounded range instead of one particular point.
    Compared to a conventional tracking MPC, ZMPC provides more degrees of freedom
    to the system and can handle economic objectives better, which fits the objective
    of this work. In the basic design of a ZMPC controller, the target zone is kept
    time-invariant over the control horizon. In this work, we propose a ZMPC design
    with a time-variant target zone that shrinks over the control horizon to handle
    plant-model-mismatch. The proposed ZMPC formulation is presented as follows: (12a)
    (12b) (12c) (12d) (12e) (12f) where , are the system input and output vector,
    is the zone tracking slack variable. represents the current time step, and denote
    the system input and output at future time predicted at the current time . Equation
    (12a) is the objective function, where and are diagonal weighting matrices for
    the zone tracking objective and the irrigation amount respectively. The control
    objective is to drive the system into a particular operating zone while minimizing
    the irrigation amount at the same time. Equation (12b) represents the two-layer
    NN framework discussed in the previous section, which is used to predict the system
    dynamics under the selected input trajectory over the control horizon . Equation
    (12c) defines the initial state at time . Equations (12d)–(12f) are the state,
    output, and the zone tracking constraints, where , , and are compact sets. The
    time-variant target zone is a subset of and is defined as follow: (13a) (13b)
    (13c) where and represent the lower and upper bound of the target zone at time
    step . The boundaries of the target zone vary over time exponentially from their
    initial value and until they are converged to the final value and , where . is
    a non-negative scalar that determines the shrinking speed of the boundaries. Larger
    leads to more aggressive shrinkage and vice versa. When , the target zone becomes
    time-invariant (i.e., , ). In this work, and are used. Note that the magnitude
    of the system input is on the scale of to , which poses numerical issues for solving
    optimizations problems. Thus is scaled before feeding to the optimization solver.
    The scaled input takes values between 0 and 1. Unless specified otherwise, , are
    employed. is used in this work. The sample time of the optimization is 2 h (i.e.,  s),
    meaning that at a given time instant , the agro-hydrological dynamics in the next
    40 h will be optimized ( ). Following the receding horizon control strategy, only
    the optimal input at the first step will be applied to the system. The optimization
    problem is solved repeatedly over the horizon of interest , which optimizes the
    system dynamics over a 5 days duration. Remark 3.The indexes used in the controller
    (12) and (13) are different from those used in the previous sections. Instead
    of using index , we introduced and instead. The idea is that the ZMPC is solved
    at each time instant over the entire simulating horizon of interest, with the
    dynamics over the next steps being considered in the optimization, of which the
    steps into the future from time is represented by index . While in previous sections,
    the time is used for modeling, which represents each time step in the training
    dataset or the validation dataset. Remark 4.In this work, we enhance the robustness
    of the closed-loop system by adding the linear plant-model-mismatch correction
    term in the data-driven modeling and employing zone control in the controller
    design. Another way to enhance the robustness of control could be to consider
    modeling and control simultaneously using reinforcement learning approaches. Interested
    readers can refer to References 29-31. 7 ZMPC SIMULATION RESULTS ZMPC simulation
    results under various operating conditions are presented in this section. The
    same initial condition is employed for all simulations for fair comparisons. To
    be more specific,  (m) is the initial state at the rooting depth and is employed
    for the discretized Richards equation, while the corresponding system output (m
    /m ) is used for the NN models. To initialize the ZMPC simulations based on the
    proposed framework and the single LSTM, the initial soil moisture content is available
    and it is assumed that there is no irrigation at the initial step (i.e., ). A
    matrix with the matching dimension of the designed NN framework input is generated
    as the initial condition for the NN-based approximation models, with each role
    of the matrix equal to (i.e., we assume that ahead of the simulation, the system
    is at a steady state). First, in Section 17, the control performance of the proposed
    framework is compared with the discretized Richards equation and the single LSTM
    discussed in previous sections. Simulations are performed under the controller
    defined by (12) with a time-invariant target zone ( ) in the presence of process
    and/or measurement noises. Then the performance of the two-layer-NN-based ZMPC
    with a shrinking target zone in the presence of significant noise and weather
    disturbance is presented in Section 19. The effects of tuning parameters , , and
    in ZMPC performance are investigated. The basic ZMPC with a time-invariant target
    zone is employed as the benchmark controller for performance comparison. 7.1 Optimization
    performance validation In this section, the performance of the proposed framework
    in ZMPC applications is validated by comparing the simulation results with those
    obtained based on the discretized Richards equation and the single LSTM. Table
    6 summarizes the average computational time for solving the optimization problem,
    the economic performance of ZMPC simulations, and the percentage difference in
    economic performance based on different models. The economic performance is measured
    by the accumulated irrigation amount in millimeters, which is calculated as follows:
    where is the irrigation rate at time with the unit m/s. The percentage difference
    in the accumulated irrigation is calculated with respect to the result obtained
    based on the Richards equation. The optimal control strategy and the corresponding
    output trajectories obtained based on different models are presented in Figure
    10. The results shown in Table 6 and Figure 10 are obtained in the presence of
    2% process noise. Figure 11 presents the optimal system input and output trajectories
    obtained with 5% process and 5% measurement noise based on the single LSTM and
    the proposed framework. The colors and markers employed in Figure 11 are the same
    as those in Figure 10. Table 7 summarizes more ZMPC simulation results based on
    the single LSTM and the proposed framework in the presence of process and measurement
    noise. TABLE 6. ZMPC simulation results in the presence of 2% process noise. Model

    LSTM 12.1 Two-layer NN 11.2 As presented in Table 6, both the single LSTM and
    the proposed framework help to reduce the computational cost significantly. The
    computational cost reduction achieved by the single LSTM is more significant compared
    to the two-layer NN due to the simplicity of its structure. With only 8.66% deviation,
    the economic performance of the controller using the two-layer NN is similar to
    that using the Richards equation, which is significantly better compared to that
    obtained with the single LSTM. The trajectories in Figure 10 indicate the same,
    as the optimal control law and the system response of the two-layer NN and the
    Richards equations are highly overlapped. Based on the Richards equation, no irrigation
    is applied for the first a few steps and starts to increase slowly over time.
    The two-layer NN leads to similar control strategy with minor differences caused
    by the plant-model-mismatch. As for the single LSTM, the irrigation policy is
    less efficient, which is nonzero over the entire horizon. The output trajectories
    converge to the lower bound of the target zone for simulations based on the Richards
    equation and the proposed framework. The responses are reasonable as the economic
    objective is to reduce the amount of irrigation required. On the other hand, for
    the single-LSTM-based ZMPC, slower convergence and offsets with respect to the
    lower bound of the target zone are observed in the optimal output trajectory.
    From Tables 6 and 7, it is observed that compared to process noise, measurement
    noise has stronger impacts on the simulation results. As shown in Table 7, except
    for the case that considered 5% process noise and 5% measurement noise, control
    with the two-layer NN has significantly better economic performances compared
    to that using the single LSTM. Compared to Figure 10, the effect of measurement
    and process noise is more significant in Figure 11, which poses more challenges
    in control. In Figure 11, the difference between the output trajectory obtained
    based on the proposed framework and the single LSTM seems insignificant. However,
    if we compare the corresponding irrigation policies obtained based on the proposed
    framework and the single LSTM in Figure 11 along with the results in Table 7,
    it is noticed that the proposed framework tends to have a more sparse control
    policy (i.e., more time steps with 0 irrigation) and consumes less water overall.
    On the other hand, the single LSTM poses a non-zero irrigation policy at every
    time step, which is less efficient. This indicates that the proposed framework
    performs better in control applications. To summarize, the proposed framework
    is shown to have better performances compared to the single LSTM in ZMPC applications.
    However, some minor violations of the target zone are observed at the end of the
    horizon of interest (Figure 11) due to the effect of noise, which is not ideal
    as low soil moisture may cause severe consequences in crop growing. Furthermore,
    precipitation is an essential disturbance in real-world applications and should
    be considered. In the following section, we investigate the performance of a shrinking
    target zone in capturing the effect of significant noise and weather disturbances.
    7.2 Conventional tracking MPC versus ZMPC We validate the effectiveness of ZMPC
    for the agro-hydrological system in comparison to conventional tracking MPC in
    this section. The prediction model employed is the proposed 2-layer NN framework.
    Precipitation is considered with the assumption that weather forecasting data
    is available with bounded uncertainties. 5% process noise plus 5% measurement
    noise are added to the simulations. The conventional tracking MPC is equivalent
    to a ZMPC with the upper and lower bound of the target zone equal to each other.
    The tracking target is selected to be the center of the target zone for the proposed
    ZMPC: Table 8 presents the amount of total irrigation required over the entire
    horizon of interest based on the ZMPC and tracking MPC. The precipitation data,
    the optimal control policy obtained based on the two controllers, and the corresponding
    output trajectories are presented in Figure 12. The results obtained based on
    the ZMPC are presented in red solid trajectories, while the results obtained based
    on the MPC are presented in lime dashed trajectories. TABLE 8. Control performance
    of the proposed ZMPC versus conventional tracking MPC. Controller (mm) % Diff.

    PowerPoint The precipitation data (top), optimal control strategies (middle),
    and corresponding output response (bottom) of the ZMPC and tracking MPC. It can
    be observed from Figure 12 that the irrigation policy obtained based on the tracking
    MPC takes much higher irrigation rates and requires irrigation more frequently
    as the MPC tries to drive the system output to a constant value in the presence
    of disturbance and noise. This matches with that presented in Table 8, where tracking
    MPC requires more than 3 times the amount of irrigation compared to that obtained
    by the ZMPC. Furthermore, it is in general not necessary to maintain the soil
    moisture content at a precise level to ensure the healthiness of the crops. Thus,
    compared to conventional tracking MPC, ZMPC is more cost-efficient and fits the
    control objective for the agro-hydrological system better. 7.3 Shrinking zone
    versus time-invariant zone In this section, the performance of the proposed shrinking-zone
    ZMPC and the ZMPC with a time-invariant zone (referred to as the basic ZMPC in
    the following text) is compared in the presence of 5% measurement noise and weather
    disturbance. The controller is assumed to have information regarding the weather
    through weather forecasting with some uncertainties. In this work, we consider
    a 20% error in weather forecasting. Various parameter combinations are investigated.
    In Section 19, is kept constant and the effect of and discussed. The opposite
    is done in Section 20, where and are kept constant with varying . 7.3.1 Tuning
    and Figure 13 presents two sets of shrinking zones defined with different and
    . The darker zone bounded by dashed boundaries has , meaning that the target zone
    shrinks to the center point of the original zone. The lighter zone bounded by
    dashed-dotted boundaries terminates to a zone with , . For both controllers, is
    used. The ZMPC results are shown in Figure 14. The results obtained based on the
    basic ZMPC (i.e., , ) is employed as the performance benchmark. The results obtained
    based on the two shrinking zone design are presented with the same line style
    as those used in Figure 13. The economic and zone tracking performance of the
    ZMPC controllers are summarized in Table 9. The percentage difference of the total
    amount of irrigation and zone tracking performances is calculated based on the
    basic ZMPC controller. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Shrinking zones

    14, it is observed that with a time-invariant zone, the controller is able to
    capture the effect of the weather disturbance in general. When precipitation is
    foreseen, the irrigation amount is reduced. However, minor violation of the target
    zone at the lower bound is still observed due to the presence of noise. As presented
    in the figure, the usage of a shrinking zone helps to avoid the violation. Instead
    of oscillating around the lower bound of the target zone, the output trajectories
    converge toward the center of the zone. This provides more robustness in the controller
    in the presence of significant noise. It is also noticed however, the employment
    of shrinking zones has significantly affect the total amount of irrigation. As
    summarized in Table 9, the two shrinking zones considered increased the accumulated
    irrigation amount by 61.0% and 54.9% respectively. Figure 14 and Table 10 indicate
    that the output responses based on the two shrinking zone designs are very similar,
    while the design that terminates to a zone performs better economically. Thus,
    in the following section, we investigate the effect of with , . TABLE 10. ZMPC

    the largest zone with solid boundaries has . The shrinking process becomes less
    aggressive as decrease. Figure 16 shows the optimal control strategies and the
    corresponding output responses of the three ZMPC controllers. The same line styles
    as those used in Figure 15 are used in Figure 16. The total irrigation consumption
    of the three controllers is summarized in Table 10, where the result obtained
    with the basic ZMPC is again presented as the performance benchmark for consistency.

    16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The optimal control strategies (top), and
    corresponding output response (bottom) of ZMPC with different . From Figure 16,
    it is observed that as the magnitude of decreases, the output response shifts
    towards the lower bound of the original target zone. The target zone violation
    thus becomes more significant, which is consistent with the results presented
    in Table 10. It is also noticed that with reducing value, the total irrigation
    consumption reduces. In summary, in the presence of noise and disturbances, a
    trade off exists between the amount of irrigation applied and the zone-tracking
    performance. Depending on the priority of the control objectives, parameters can
    be tuned accordingly. If some slight zone violation is allowed, a time-invariant
    target zone or a shrinking zone with smaller and greater difference between and
    can be employed for better economic performance. Vice versa, a shrinking zone
    that shrinks more significantly over the control horizon (i.e., larger and narrower
    terminating zone) can be used if the zone-tracking objective is superior compared
    to the economic performance. 8 CONCLUSIONS A two-layer NN framework is proposed
    in this work to approximate the agro-hydrological system of interest, which is
    shown to be superior to a single LSTM for both open-loop prediction and closed-loop
    control applications. Based on the two-layer NN model, a ZMPC strategy is proposed
    to maintain the soil moisture content at the root zone within a certain zone.
    To handle the effect of noise and weather disturbance, a target zone that shrinks
    along the control horizon is employed in the controller. The effect of different
    shrinking rates and widths of the terminal zone are discussed. Through simulations,
    it is noticed that steeper shrinking zones help to reduce the zone violation while
    significantly increasing the amount of irrigation required. Mild shrinkage in
    the target zone leads to lower economic costs but also minor zone violations.
    Depending on the priority of the control objective, the hyper-parameters can be
    tuned accordingly. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Financial support from Natural Sciences and

    controlPrecision irrigationSystem identification 1. Introduction The current and
    future generations face significant challenges in ensuring that nutritious food
    is sustainably produced from limited land and water resources. The FAO''s food
    and agriculture report of 2020 posits that 40% of the world population are inhabitants
    of water-scarce agricultural areas; of these, 37% inhabit agricultural zones with
    severe water scarcity [27,51]. Coupled with the rising population indices, meeting
    the food demand by 2050 will need a 70% increase in food production [28]. In addition
    to developing quick maturing and high-yielding plant varieties, scientists need
    to ensure that less water is used to produce more food. It is estimated that about
    70% of the water abstracted for irrigation is lost through conveyance losses and
    poor water allocation methods [76]. This means that a lot of water is presently
    used to produce a unit of food. Improving water use efficiency in irrigation systems
    requires intelligent irrigation monitoring and control systems to ensure that
    no water is wasted and precise water application is achieved [15]. Sustainable
    precision irrigation presents a timely solution to water wastage in irrigated
    agriculture by ensuring that intended irrigation amounts are applied at the right
    time and place. Precision irrigation scheduling is striving to achieve efficient
    water use per plant, in space and time, in the right quantities to compensate
    for losses. This is possible through effective monitoring and optimal control
    strategies, reducing pumping costs. Over the years, there has been a paradigm
    shift from traditional irrigation methods to smart irrigation systems. This has
    somewhat improved the water use efficiency by reducing conveyance losses. However,
    irrigation control is still a challenge due to the complex nature of agricultural
    systems. For example, most irrigation systems are designed based on historical
    climatic data, and irrigation schedules are developed based on this data. Precision
    agriculture has been facilitated by the tremendous advancement in the agricultural
    Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) through remote sensing
    [32,69]. The controlled monitoring of agricultural systems has enhanced the sapience
    of the changing dynamics of the water, plant and soil environment throughout the
    cropping season [5]. With advances in Big data analytics, more agricultural systems
    are becoming data-driven for decision-making purposes rather than relying on heuristic
    physics-based models [68]. Sustainable irrigation necessitates the adoption of
    irrigation control strategies that precisely direct irrigation water to the plant''s
    root zone. Boman et al. [11] observed improved water, energy, and fertilizer use
    efficiency when precision irrigation control strategies are implemented. Precision
    irrigation control strategies are divided into two, namely, closed-loop systems
    and open-loop systems. Whereas open-loop systems apply a preset action like in
    simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive feedback from sensors, make
    decisions and implement the resulting findings in the irrigation system [15].
    Several authors have reviewed and classified closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    into three, namely, linear control, intelligent control and optimal control [4,15,23].
    Model predictive control has evolved over the past four decades with advances
    in real-time data measurements and an increase in computational power. Model Predictive
    Control (MPC) refers to a category of advanced computer-controlled algorithms
    that use an explicit process model to predict a plant''s future response [23].
    Developed in the 1960s, Model Predictive Control emanates from optimal control.
    The basic principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to predict system behavior
    and optimize the prediction to decide the control move at the current time [71].
    In addition to its flexibility, Model predictive control repeatedly solves constrained
    optimal control problems online ([57]b). The ability to handle multivariate processes
    and address state and input constraints has made MPC indispensable in modern manufacturing
    industries [23,56,55,70]. In a control problem, the model predictive controller''s
    goal is to compute the plant input to follow the desired reference [60]. MPC uses
    a plant model to predict future plant output behavior and an optimizer that ensures
    that the predicted plant output tracks the desired reference [15,60] MPC has been
    widely studied and applied in processing industries ([4,23,33]; F. [38,52]; L.
    [78]). However, in the agricultural sector, not much has been reported on the
    application of model predictive control in modelling dynamic agricultural systems.
    The most recent review by Ding et al. [23] focused on model predictive control
    applications in agriculture in general. [23] assert that the application of MPC
    to agriculture can yield significant productivity and efficiency benefits despite
    its limited use in the past years. However, no review of data-driven model predictive
    control in precision irrigation applications has been reported. MPC has been applied
    to agriculture, but it has not been applied in all respects. This work builds
    upon existing reviews in the field of agriculture with a particular focus on precision
    irrigation. This review presents an overview of model predictive control in section
    2; data-driven MPC can be done through system identification, machine learning,
    and iterative learning control, as discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents
    the specific application domains of data-driven MPC in irrigation systems. The
    challenges and future perspectives of data-driven MPC are discussed in section
    5. Finally, the conclusion and future research are presented. 2. Overview of model
    predictive control 2.1. Historical perspective of model predictive control The
    concept of model predictive control dates way back in the 1960s to 1970s [66].
    However, MPC found its way into process industries until the 1980s [23]. Since
    then, model predictive control has undergone several stages of development. The
    first stage involves classical model predictive control between 1980 and 1990
    and mainly solves multivariable constraint control problems [52]. As a result
    of the failure to handle nonlinear systems in process industries, improved MPCs
    evolved towards the end of the 20th century giving more computational power with
    an extraordinary ability to handle constraints. This phase saw the continued penetration
    of the commercial MPC algorithms into various industries and a sound theoretical
    foundation for it. In the 1st decade of the 21st century, latest MPC evolved as
    many industries adopted model predictive control [52]. The latest MPC methods
    reduced computation time by decentralizing large-scale problems, reducing computation
    time directly, or simplifying computational processes [23]. The fourth phase has
    seen the evolution of data-driven model predictive control techniques aided by
    machine learning and data science advancements. Table 1 summarizes the different
    types of MPC since 1980. Fig. 1 presents the evolution of model predictive control.

    control. There has been a progression from the past decades in the category of
    systems where model predictive control is applied. Literature has reported a significant
    rise in MPC application in mechanical and electrical systems [52]. Some of the
    application domains include suspension [34], vehicle traction control [12], direct
    injection stratified charge engines [35], Grain drying processes [82], traffic
    management [48], automatic boats for aquaculture [81], modelling temperatures
    in buildings [25], amongst others. This is facilitated by the precedent developments,
    which enable MPC implementation on hardware, making it faster than traditional
    processes. 2.2. Main components of model predictive control The key to effective
    implementation of a control strategy is understanding how model predictive control
    works. Model predictive control has seven essential components (Fig. 2): prediction,
    receding horizon, modelling, performance index, degrees of freedom, constraint
    handling, and multivariable [73]. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Components of Model Predictive Control. Prediction:
    Model predictive control considers the future implication of current control actions
    by computing the predicted behavior over a horizon. Predictions must capture all
    the system''s transient and steady-state behavior [73]. Therefore, the prediction
    horizon dictates how far the future state will be predicted. Receding horizon:
    This is the horizon over which system dynamics are predicted. After defining the
    optimal trajectory of the future state, the actual control input to the plant
    only takes the first sample of the control signal, neglecting the rest of the
    trajectory [78]. Modelling: Prediction of a system''s future state requires a
    plant model. A good dynamic model will give a consistent and accurate prediction
    of the future. A mode of the system shows the dependence of the output on the
    current measured variable and the present/future inputs. Performance index: Performance
    index measures the numerical definition of the best input trajectory. Performance
    indices of a model change with time as the system''s internal model gets better
    over time. Performance indices must therefore be realistic and matched with model
    accuracy. Degree of freedom: Degrees of freedom describe the complexity of input
    trajectories. Brownlee [13] defined degree of freedom as the sum of parameters
    in the model that are determined from data. This is inclusive of the coefficients
    of the model and the data used to calculate the error of the model. Constraint
    handling: Model predictive control embeds constraints into the strategy development.
    The proposed input trajectory is optimal while satisfying constraints. The systematic
    embedding of constraint information is critical to effective and robust closed-loop
    behavior. Multivariable: Almost all dynamic systems have numerous inputs and outputs.
    Model predictive control can handle multi-input-multi-output systems (MIMO) systematically.
    In traditional control like Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), it is complex
    to design MIMO systems because limited data about the plant is used in the model
    design, and interaction becomes cumbersome. On the other hand, model predictive
    control algorithms require a model and thus utilize more data, making it easier
    to handle MIMO systems. 2.3. Theoretical formulation of model predictive control
    A model predictive controller is designed based on the state space equation of
    the process dynamics model as described by Rawlings et al. [71]. A state-space
    model is a probabilistic graphical model that describes probabilistic dependence
    between the latent state variable and the observed measurement [16,20]. Model
    predictive control solves an optimal control problem over a receding horizon,
    subject to system constraints, to determine the next control action ([43], 2018).
    The optimization is iterated at each time step, and the control law is updated
    Fig. 3a . Kaiser et al. [44] formulates a receding horizon control problem as
    an open-loop optimization for every time step with an optimal sequence of control
    inputs u (Fig. 3b ) (1) ≔ Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download

    a moving horizon window. Adapted from [14]. Over the control horizon given the
    current measurement that minimizes a cost over the prediction horizon , where
    is the timestep of the model. The control horizon is less than or equal to the
    prediction horizon such that then the input u is assumed constant after that.
    The first control value is then applied and the optimization is reinitialized
    and repeated at each subsequent timestep to solve for the unknown sequence . This
    results in an implicit feedback control law. (2) The cost optimization at each
    timestep is described as minimizing a performance index with up to three terms;
    an output penalty, an input penalty, and an input rate penalty; (3) The minimized
    cost function J is subject to constraints on the inputs and outputs; (4) 2.4.
    Data-driven model predictive control Data-driven control systems are broadly classified
    under control systems. The identification of the process model and the design
    of the controller are based entirely on experimental data collected from the plant
    [9]. Learning dynamical systems models from data is a vital challenge in mathematical
    physics, with a rich history dating back as far as the time of Kepler and Newton
    and the discovery of the laws of planetary motion. Initially, modelling of dynamic
    systems relied on a combination of high-quality measurements and expert intuition.
    With vast data and increasing computational power, the automated discovery of
    governing equations and dynamical systems is a new and exciting scientific paradigm.
    Data-driven models require automatic data collection, as they can react in real-time
    to changes in the input variables [31]. The data-driven models’ response can create
    a feedback loop into a larger online system. However, automatic data collection
    is associated with some challenges, and thus, characteristics of big data, namely,
    volume, velocity, variety, value and veracity (5Vs), need to be considered (Fig.
    4). Download : Download high-res image (285KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. The 5Vs of data-driven modelling. 3. System identification System identification
    is a form of machine learning, where an input-output map of a system is learned
    from training data in a representation that generalizes the data that was not
    in the training set [14]. Ljung [53] defined it as the art and science of building
    mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. System
    identification is essential where first principles or physics-based modelling
    of the system is not possible. Here, nothing is known about the system dynamics,
    also known as the black-box approach. Data is used to learn a mathematic model
    that mimics the input-output relationship using a model structure that represents
    the system behavior and parameter selection for fitting the data. A better understanding
    of the model is achieved with system identification, and future prediction becomes
    easy. Fig. 5 represents a flowchart for a system identification process Download

    System identification process. System identification can be done for linear systems,
    nonlinear systems and online and recursive systems. 3.1. Nonlinear system identification
    for control Powerful model-based control techniques like linear optimal control
    and model predictive control are aided by data-driven techniques that characterize
    the input-output dynamics from observed measurements without relying on first
    principles modelling. Nonlinear systems identification is made possible due to
    high computing power and powerful data-driven techniques. Once a low order model
    of the input-output dynamics from actuation u to measurements y and a full state
    x of the system is measured, then identification of dynamics f is made possible
    that satisfy (5) This then is discretized since data is collected in time steps
    and control laws are digitally implemented. This state dynamics then becomes.
    (6) 3.2. Online and recursive system identification Online systems identification
    means that the algorithm is running during the operation of the physical system.
    Online system identification algorithms estimate the parameters and states of
    a system model as data is obtained in real-time or near real-time from measuring
    devices [24]. Referring to the agro-hydrologic balance equation, the process dynamics
    of the system can be described as one with three inputs, rainfall, irrigation,
    and crop evapotranspiration and one output, soil moisture, as shown in Fig. 6.
    The process dynamics model assumes that deep percolation in an irrigated agricultural
    system is proportional to soil moisture. Download : Download high-res image (144KB)

    Where; Euler approximation theory is used on the soil moisture variations to create
    a discrete model for the soil moisture. (8) Where is the sampling interval The
    discrete-time dynamics then can be written as, (9) Where; is the crop coefficient
    and varies according to the crop growth stage. A soil model can be developed over
    time by updating the model parameters each time step. For example, the algorithm
    could measure irrigation and compare it with the predicted irrigation amount to
    produce a prediction error. An online algorithm adjusts the model parameters to
    reduce the error. In the next step, a new set of measurements is recorded and
    compared with the model prediction. An error is again obtained and added to the
    old measurements and the process repeats itself. Online system identification
    is crucial where the model parameters are time-variant, especially as is the case
    for the weather parameters in the crop evapotranspiration model. 4. Machine learning
    control Machine learning is a rapidly developing field transforming our ability
    to learn and characterize dynamic systems [14]. Machine learning makes the control
    of complex, nonlinear systems possible because of its high dimensional, nonlinear
    and optimization techniques [26]. For example, given a schematic in Fig. 7 with
    high dimensional dynamics with external disturbances to achieve a high-level objective
    function. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Schematic of machine learning control. The objective is to design
    a controller based on sensor measurements of the system that can then drive the
    system through actuation. Examples of machine learning methods include genetic
    algorithms, genetic programming, reinforcement learning and adaptive neural networks
    (Fig. 8). These machine learning algorithms use biological principles like neural
    networks, evolutional algorithms, and reinforcement learning. Detailed information

    of machine learning control. 5. Iterative learning control Iterative learning
    control (ILC) is an efficient technique used to improve the performance of transient
    systems that operate repetitively [79]. The aim of ILC is to improve the transient
    response through input adjustment based on observed errors. A standard iterative
    learning control scheme assumes stable dynamics, and the system returns to the
    same initial conditions at the start of each trial of the same length. A schematic
    of data-driven iterative learning control is presented in Fig. 9 [65]. Download

    Iterative learning control process. An Iterative Learning Control takes the form
    (10) Where;  = input to the system during the kth repetition,  = tracking error
    during the kth repetition and  = design parameter representing operations on  .
    There has to be a convergence of the input signals as k becomes large. This will
    ensure perfect tracking through the iteration process. The rate of convergence
    represents the desirable need for a rapid iterative learning process. Despite
    the uncertainty about the process dynamics, good algorithm performance is desirable.
    The operation   ranges from simple scalar gains to sophisticated optimization
    computations and is necessary to achieve design objectives. 5.1. Applications
    of data-driven model predictive control in precision irrigation management Owing
    to the similarity of agricultural processes to industrial processes, model predictive
    control has been applied in product processing, agricultural production, greenhouses
    and irrigation systems [23]. For example, model predictive control has been applied
    in canal flow control and regulation, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential
    regulation, soil moisture regulation and precipitation and evapotranspiration
    prediction. 5.2. Irrigation canal flow control and regulation Model predictive
    control has found applicability to canal flow control and gate operation. The
    management objective of MPC for irrigation canals is to keep the water levels
    as close to the setpoints as possible [45]. Therefore, a suitable model representing
    the canal water level dynamic is needed. Furthermore, the models need to be set
    up in such a way that they contain the appropriate dynamics of the water system
    for water level regulation. In this regard, MPC has been applied to model the
    behavior of the water movement in the open channel, maintaining certain water
    levels at various locations and the water flows that influence these water levels
    [29,30,63,79,80,84]. Control structures are used to manipulate the water flows,
    through which the controller can achieve the management objective [45]. However,
    achieving this objective is not straightforward, as some varying inflows and outflows
    disturb the water system. To predict the future water levels and flows as a result
    of disturbances and control actions, the water system (canal reaches, structures,
    disturbances, controller) needs to be modelled. Fig. 10 depicts a typical irrigation
    canal with water flowing by gravity and different offtakes along the canal reach.

    equations Eqs. (11) and (12) accurately describe the water flow dynamics in the
    irrigation canal. (11) (12) Where; y is the depth of water in m, T the top width
    of the canal at the water surface in m, Q is the water flow rate in the canal
    m3/s, x is the longitudinal distance on the flow direction in m, q the lateral
    outflow per unit length of the channel in m2/s, v the velocity in m/s, A is the
    wetted cross-sectional area, g the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2), so
    the channel bottom slope and sf is the friction slip of the irrigation canal.
    Several scholars have used model predictive control in controlling irrigation
    canal flows. Puig et al. [70] used model predictive control to generate flow control
    strategies from the water source to the consumer and irrigation areas in the Guadiana
    River. The results showed effectiveness in the use of model predictive control.
    Zhang et al. [83] designed a non-cooperative distributed model predictive control
    algorithm based on Nash optimality for water level regulation in irrigation canals.
    The system simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
    To effectively deliver canal flow without fluctuations, Han & Qiao [39]; Hashemy
    et al. [41,40]combined model predictive control with online water storage to compensate
    for an existing time delay and avoid wave disturbances. The results showed significant
    improvement for canal operations employing automation. Recently, Kong et al. [50]
    used model predictive control toolbox to control gate interval and water level.
    The authors tested it on a simulation model of an irrigation canal in Beijing
    consisting of 13 cascaded canal pools. The authors affirmed that model predictive
    control is a useful control strategy for gate opening at different intervals [49].
    6. Irrigation scheduling Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the
    frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water to apply to meet the crop
    water requirements [59]. In conventional irrigation systems, irrigation scheduling
    is determined through experience, observation, and heuristic methods. On the other
    hand, precision irrigation systems rely on feedback from sensing devices. Irrigation
    scheduling can be achieved through weather-based, soil-based, or plant-based approaches.
    Precision irrigation systems aim at spatio-temporal irrigation scheduling depending
    on weather, soil, and plant physiological characteristics [3]. Model predictive
    control is used to perform irrigation scheduling using real-time field data to
    calibrate a crop and soil model and then using the calibrated model to determine
    optimum irrigation schedules [61]. Plant and soil real-time measurements are crucial
    to calibrate the model during the growing stages of the crop as irrigation advances.
    Considering the soil moisture balance model, the plant input is the irrigation
    amount, whereas the plant output is the soil moisture deficit. The crop evapotranspiration
    and precipitation values are considered disturbances as they cannot be controlled.
    Delgoda et al. [22], Lozoya et al. [56], and Saleem et al. [74] used model predictive
    control to predict the frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water using
    a soil moisture dynamics model. The authors used a combined mechanistic and data-driven
    modelling approach to describe the dynamics of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    using sensing devices for real-time feedback to the control algorithm. However,
    the authors neglected the effect of precipitation and crop water use on the system
    dynamics. Delgoda et al. [21] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above model
    predictive control framework. The authors employed a disturbance affine feedback
    control approach and uncertainty modelling techniques to account for the dynamic
    nature of rainfall and crop water use. Moreover, the study reported optimal system
    performance in a humid region where considerable uncertainties in climate variables
    existed. Recently, Abioye, Abidin, Aman, et al. [2] and Abioye, Abidin, Mahmud,
    et al. [2] used a data-driven model predictive control to schedule irrigation
    in a greenhouse irrigation experiment. The authors used Laguerre functions in
    order to reduce the computation complexity brought about by input constraints.
    6.1. Stem water potential regulation Another important aspect in precision irrigation
    management is the soil water potential. It determines the ease with which plants
    can extract water from the soil. Soil water potential is a measure of the energy
    status of the soil water relative to that of water at a standard reference [59].
    On the other hand, stem water potential (SWP) is the direct measure of water tension
    within the plant [75]. Suter et al. suggested that plant moisture status needs
    to be determined through SWP measurements rather than the soil moisture content.
    Chen et al. [18] developed a stem water potential model using data-driven model
    predictive control to help reduce uncertainty in weather forecast errors. The
    authors formulated a state-space model that captures water dynamics in a plant-root-soil
    system. The water status of the system was modelled by monitoring water flow in
    the soil, root and plant system. Precipitation in the system was the water inflow,
    and evapotranspiration was the driving force in the system. The state-space model
    was linearized to reduce the computation burden caused by robust nonlinear optimization.
    The authors used the formulation of a robust optimal control problem that maintained
    stem water potential within certain limits. The authors reported a 7.9% reduction
    in the water consumption in almond trees using data-driven robust model predictive
    control. 6.2. Soil moisture regulation Irrigation aims to maintain the root zone
    soil moisture between field capacity and the permanent wilting point (Fig. 10).
    When the soil moisture goes above the field capacity, the soil becomes saturated,
    and below the wilting point, the plant experiences water stress and eventually
    dies. Management allowable depletion of 50% is adopted for most irrigation designs
    to ensure that the available moisture does not get depleted before irrigation
    occurs. This available moisture in the root zone depends on the plant''s effective
    root zone. Model predictive control has been used to minimize root zone soil moisture
    and irrigation amounts within a specific threshold or at specific set points [22,55,62].
    However, recent studies argue that a zone needs to be considered rather than a
    reference set point to ensure maximum water extraction from the root zone. The
    aim should be to regulate the soil moisture within the readily available moisture
    zone. Mao et al. [57c] proposed a methodical approach to system identification
    and root zone model predictive control design for soil moisture control of agro-hydrological
    systems. First, the authors simulated the soil water dynamics of the field from
    a mechanistic soil-water balance model. The model consisted of a nonlinear partial
    differential equation with source and sink terms characterizing the root water
    extraction, evaporation and transpiration, precipitation, and irrigation. A linear
    parameter varying model was identified based on the input and output data of the
    soil-water balance model, which was then used for zone model predictive control
    design. The authors report a satisfactory approximation of the soil moisture dynamics
    and the designed zone model predictive control suitability. 6.3. Precipitation
    and evapotranspiration prediction One of the challenges in precision irrigation
    management is the scarcity of climate data. Precision irrigation requires real-time
    data to aid in irrigation decisions. In developed countries, prediction systems
    are used to predict future weather events, and this data is availed to farmers
    for irrigation management decisions. In the absence of such, there is a need to
    bridge the gap using model predictive control to quantity the sources of uncertainty
    in the soil moisture dynamics model. To address this, Guo and You [37] used a
    novel data-driven local precipitation and evapotranspiration prediction by implementing
    an artificial neuro-network (ANN). It was embedded in the model predictive control
    toolbox and updated in real-time to formulate the dynamic uncertainty set to account
    for weather prediction errors in the irrigation control system. The authors reported
    effective control of the root zone soil moisture. A summary of studies conducted
    in the different application domains is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary
    of applications of MPC in irrigation. Application Domain Author Irrigation Canal

    2021; [75]) Prediction of Precipitation and Evapotranspiration [37] 6.4. Challenges
    and future perspectives of data-driven modelling in smart irrigation Data collection
    that is representative of the real dynamic system is challenging. When more data
    is provided, machine learning can be used in data-driven modelling to fit data
    and make predictions when more data is required. Some of the challenges encountered
    in data collection are discussed in this section. One of the major challenges
    affecting precision irrigation is the high cost of obtaining data in irrigation
    systems. To develop a data-driven model for smart irrigation, data about the soil,
    plant, and environment need to be monitored. Plant sensors need to monitor the
    physiological processes in plant-like crop water use. The different growth stages
    and their effect on the crop factors need to be established. The climatic factors
    that affect the rate of evapotranspiration need to be monitored in real-time,
    otherwise relying on historical data that is not representative of the real system.
    The data collection strategies and control methods are discussed in [4,15]. The
    challenges relating to data availability range from sampling frequency, incomplete
    data, sensor malfunction, working conditions, communication exceptions or database
    shutdown. This can affect the integrity of the experimental dataset collected,
    thereby resulting in poor model development. In addition, developing models from
    data requires capturing a large volume of data to represent the real systems and
    capture any variations. For example, in irrigation, the components of the agro-hydrological
    model vary from time to time. This variation must be captured, which makes the
    data collection process time-consuming. This may involve monitoring the dynamics
    for the entire season or year to get a representative model for the dynamics.
    Predictions are a key feature of data-driven models for irrigation optimization
    and intelligent decision-making. System boundaries define the capability of data-driven
    models. If the data is only a subsection of the field, the model may fail to make
    accurate predictions for an entire irrigation field. Therefore, it is pertinent
    to define the system boundaries and ensure model data development extends to the
    boundaries ensuring that only predictions made from the model boundaries are acted
    upon. The application of model predictive control in irrigation is still limited
    compared to processing industries. Large water and irrigation systems must reduce
    computation times and now incorporate data-driven model predictive control. In
    the future, there''s a need to model soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems as past studies stopped at simulation or implemented in a controlled environment
    agricultural system where disturbances to the model are minimized. Model predictive
    control can be applied to diverse aspects of precision agriculture to enhance
    agricultural productivity in the future. These application domains include aquaponics,
    hydroponics, viticulture, controlled environment agriculture, aquaculture, disease
    and pest control, and mechanization systems. 7. Conclusion Data-driven modelling
    in agriculture is on the rise due to the advancement of Internet of Things technologies
    and improved computational power. This article presents an overview of model predictive
    control over the past four decades, and data-driven model predictive control is
    discussed. From the review, model predictive control has been used in precision
    irrigation management, ranging from irrigation canal control, irrigation scheduling,
    stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation, and precipitation prediction
    and evapotranspiration. It is noted that for data-driven MPC to solve complex
    dynamic systems in irrigation, the availability of data, variability, boundary
    conditions and model evaluation must be harmonized for one to come up with a good
    representative model of the system. There is more research opportunity to explore
    on the application of data-driven modelling and controller development for predictive
    irrigation management. 8. Author contributions Conceptualization, EB; methodology,

    Italy SECTION I. Introduction Precision agriculture represents a set of strategies
    that allow to optimize and increase the quality and productivity of the soil by
    responding to the specific needs of individual crops and individual land areas,
    with a high level of precision (e.g. see [1]–[3]). State-of-the-art technologies
    are leveraged to collect data and information which are used to make decisions
    on how to improve production and implement the necessary corrections to produce
    more with fewer resources and maintain high-quality standards. As a result, farmers''
    work becomes more profitable in term of hourly costs and the use of fertilizers
    and herbicides are reduced, in turn limiting harmful gas emissions. Thus, having
    a more sustainable agricultural paradigm results in environmental and economic
    improvement. As underlined in [4], precision agriculture is of growing importance
    due to increasing global food needs. It therefore becomes a priority to increase
    the production of food without however leading to a greater exploitation of fundamental
    resources such as water. In this regard, the irrigation systems represent, among
    others, one of the critical aspects of management. In recent decades, the importance
    of efficient irrigation policies to minimize water consumption has prompted agronomists
    to improve and perfect these systems in order to provide valuable support for
    improving the performance and results of the crops ([5], [6]). Monitoring the
    health of crops requires a great deal of effort, especially when they extend over
    very large areas. In the fields, production is almost never homogeneous, some
    areas are more productive and others less depending on the soil composition, the
    presence of parasites and fungi, or irrigation problems: it is important to be
    able to identify these causes promptly, in order to be able to remedy all those
    situations that reduce productivity (e.g. see [7]–[11]). A very common approach
    to checking irrigation systems is to pay attention to soil moisture levels [12],
    [13]. In simple terms, the main idea is to estimate the water requirement of the
    soil through the use of soil moisture probes. The collected data is typically
    exploited to define a corresponding dynamic model which in turn allows the application
    of control strategies such as switching controllers (e.g. see [14], [15]) and
    Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques (e.g. see [16]–[19]). However, recent
    agronomic literature has shown that the use of soil moisture-based techniques
    can have some limitations in terms of treatment accuracy. In fact, as shown in
    [20], the response of the crop to the same soil moisture level depends on several
    aspects including soil composition and environmental conditions. Furthermore,
    soil moisture probes have a very narrow range of communication compared to the
    size of the crop fields and their position and quantity should be changed at each
    crop cycle to better suit the purpose. Alternatively, the use of remote sensing
    (i.e. based on the use of UAVs equipped with interchangeable sensors that fly
    over crops) has recently been explored to maintain information over multiple distances
    such as water needs in large plantations ([21]–[23]). This way of measuring guarantees
    greater flexibility both in spatial and temporal terms and increases the maintainability
    and reliability of the adopted sensors compared to those applied directly to the
    ground. Although remote sensing provides a very rich amount of information about
    the plantation, that information is only available when the specific UAV is over
    a specific area. Therefore, whenever the number of UAV s is not enough to cover
    the whole area at the same time, a continuous flow of data related to the entire
    area is not available. In this article, we introduce a data-driven method for
    estimating soil moisture and propensity to retain/release water in large-scale
    plantations, based on soil moisture modeling from [24] and [25]. The proposed
    methodology, which is similar in principle to the approaches presented in [26],
    [27], is based on intermittent soil moisture measurements provided by a certain
    number of UAVs flying over a specific area. The environmental conditions that
    influence crops can be accurately described by linear systems. Fig. 1. The centroid
    of each parcel is marked by a dot while a nearby area around a dark blue parcel
    is depicted by light blue parcels. Show All The rest of the work is organized
    as follows: Section II briefly describes the model from [24] and [25]. Section
    III introduces the proposed intermittent observer. Section IV presents numerical
    simulations. Finally, Section V contains the conclusions and future work indications.
    SECTION II. Model Description This section briefly reviews the equation model
    proposed in [24] and [25] to describe the dynamics of water in an orchard by exploiting
    the finite element method (FEM) approximation of the orchard soil. Notably, by
    combining various artificial intelligence techniques with the use of innovative
    cameras capable of providing high-resolution multispectral images, in situ sensors
    have been successfully replaced by remote sensing (see eg. [28]–[30]). Therefore,
    in this work contrary to what is assumed in [24], no sensor on the ground nor
    weather station is deployed in the considered area, the moisture measurements
    are instead assumed to be obtained only with UAVs equipped with thermal and multi-spectral
    cameras that change their position in order to see a different subset of crops
    at each time interval k∈ N >0 . In particular, inspired by [24] and [25], the
    entire area is ideally divided into n∈ N ≥2 rectangular parcels, that are identified
    by their centroid, which directly interacts only with their neighbors (see Fig.
    1). Based on the hydrological balance principle, the proposed model represents
    each parcel in terms of its water storage variation by simultaneously taking into
    account the soil water inflows (eg. irrigation, precipitation) and the soil water
    outflows (eg. evapotranspiration). For the sake of clarity, let us now provide
    a brief overview of the relevant concepts and definitions that will be used in
    this paper. Let M be a matrix with more rows than columns, then M † is the left
    pseudo-inverse of the matrix M . The identity matrix of size h is denoted by I
    h , and 0 represents a matrix of zeros whose size is determined by the context.
    We use [a] to denote the largest integer less than or equal to a , and mod (a,
    b) returns the remainder of a divided by b . The set of odd and even natural numbers
    are denoted by O and E, respectively. Assume that the moisture measurements are
    obtained by r∈ N ≤n UAVs equipped with a single measuring device that fly over
    r distinct parcels. Denote the water storage of the n parcels, the irrigation
    supplies, and the meteorological perturbations with x∈ R n ,u∈ R m and w∈ R q
    , respectively, then the behavior of the overall system can be described by the
    following equations (see [24] for details) x[k+1] w[k+1] y[k+1] =Ax[k]+Bu[k]+Pw[k],
    =Sw[k], =C[k]x[k], (1a) (1b) (1c) View Source where C[k]∈ R r×n is a time-varying
    fat matrix (the number of raw is less or equal than the number of columns) introduced
    herein to properly select the system output y∈ R r , i.e. the moisture level of
    the r parcels at time instant h=⌊ k α ⌋ with α∈ N >0 . The time instants h are
    distinguished in odds (mod (h, 2)=1) and evens (mod (h, 2)=0) depending on the
    counting, and they are assumed sufficiently spaced in time to allow the repositioning
    of the UAVs on the next crop. It should be noticed that such matrix C[k] differs
    from the one proposed in [24] and [25] due to a different choice in terms of sensor
    availability. The following assumptions are now in order for the model introduced
    above. Assumption 1 The matrices characterizing the system introduced in (1) are
    unknown and also the disturbance measure w[k] is assumed not to be provided. ■
    Remark 1 The dynamical system proposed in (1) describes the intrinsic property
    of any cultivated field to absorb or release water, therefore it is reasonable
    to assume that the system is passive and consequently the eigenvalues of the dynamic
    matrix A are strictly in the disk of the unit. Furthermore, since hydrological
    interactions occur only between neighboring plots, without lacking in generality,
    by adopting a north-western enumeration of the parcels'' centroid (see Fig. 2),
    then A= A T .Δ Fig. 2. Northwest Parcel Enumeration visualization with numbered
    centroids and colored background indicating UAV distribution. Orange background
    for parcels visited in odd time intervals and white for even time intervals. Show
    All Remark 2 As multiple fields can be watered simultane ously without the need
    for the physical presence of UAVs, the irrigation matrix B can be represented
    by an identity matrix I n , enabling efficient and individual watering of each
    field based on factors like soil moisture and crop type. Δ SECTION III. Data-Driven
    Intermittent Observer Due to the limited available information, a data-driven
    intermittent observer is introduced in order to identify the moisture of the overall
    culture field. Assume the entire area is ideally divided into n∈E rectangular
    parcels and, for the sake of notation and mathematical presentation, consider
    r= n 2 UAVs able to patrol r distinct crops (see Fig. 2). Therefore, taking into
    account Remark 1 and Remark 2, the matrices that characterize the discrete linear
    system proposed in (1) are assumed unknown but decomposed as follows A C[k] =[
    A 11 A T 12 A 12 A 22 ],B=[ B 1 B 2 ],P=[ P 1 P 2 ], = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ C 1 :=[ I r    0],
    C 2 :=[0I], C 3 :=[00], if k α ∈E if k α ∈O otherwise (2) View Source where B
    1 =[ I r  0], B 2 =[0  I r ], A 11 and A 22 are symmetric full rank matrices while
    A 12 is a singular matrix, that is det( A 12 )=0 . Also, the matrix s is assumed
    unknown but without a specific decomposition. Remark 3 The form assumed for the
    matrix C is fundamental to the observability property of the plant described by
    (1 a) and (1 c). In fact, a not time-varying matrix C , that is imposing C[k]=
    C 1 or C[k]= C 2 ∀k∈N , allows the following singular observable matrices O 1
    =[ I r A 11 0 A 12 ], O 2 =[ 0 A T 12 I r A 22 ] (3) View Source whose determinants
    depend on the determinant of A12 which in turn is equal to zero by construction.
    On the other side, focusing on the time instants h=[ k α ] , the form proposed

    be extended also for the case α>1 by taking into account the argumentation proposed
    in Remark 4. Proposition 1 Assume α=1,q≤r and rank ( M 1 )=q , then there exist
    two matrices G ~ 1 , H ~ 1 ∈ R 3r×3r such as G ~ 1 := G 1 + W 1 A ^ † 1 ,  H ¯

    P1+ M2 S) M1†, which allow the following Y k+1 = G ~ 1 Y k + H ~ 1 U k ,∀k∈E.
    (9) View Source Proof The existence of the matrix F 1 is a direct consequence
    of the assumptions on the rank of the matrix M 1 . Therefore, under the introduced
    assumptions it is always possible to define the matrices G 1 , H 1 and W 1 in
    (8). On the other side, it is straightforward to show that A ^ 2 = G 1 A ^ 1 +
    W 1 , B ^ 2 = G 1 B ^ 1 + H 1 . View Source Combining such matrix relations with
    those in (6) and recalling that A ^ 1 is a tall matrix (the number of columns
    is less or equal than the number of rows), the following is obtained Y k+1 = A
    ^ 2 z[k]+ B ^ 2 U k =( G 1 A ^ 1 + W 1 )z[k]+( G 1 B ^ 1 + H 1 ) U k = G 1 ( A
    ^ 1 z[k]+ B ^ 1 U k )+ H 1 U k + W 1 z[k] = G 1 Y[k]+ H 1 U k + W 1 z[k] = G 1
    Y[k]+ H 1 U k + W 1 A ^ † 1 ( Y k + B ^ 1 U k ) =( G 1 + W 1 A ^ † 1 ) Y k +(
    H 1 − W 1 A ^ † 1 B ^ 1 ) U k = G ~ 1 Y k + H ~ 1 U k View Source which confirms
    the relation (9). ■ Remark 5 Although requiring that the M 1 matrix must be full
    column-rank seems restrictive, in reality, this condition is commonly satisfied.
    Meteorological dynamics are independent from crop ones, that is A 11 and S do
    not share any eigenvalue. In addition, since A 11 and S are full rank matrices
    while P 1 and P 2 are matrices defined by the surround environment such that P
    1 =γ P 2 with γ∈R , then with probability one (w.p.o.)rank( A 11 P 1 + P 1 S)
    . Finally, noting that A 12 = γ ^ [ 1 1 1 1 ] ] with γ ^ ∈R for r=2 and A 12 =[
    0 ∗ 0 0 ] ] for r>2 , then rank ( M 1 )=q (w.p.o.). Since A 22 is full-rank as
    well, for the above reasons, also the matrix M 2 is commonly full column-rank.
    Thus, it is reasonable to assume that whenever the matrix M 1 is full column-rank
    also the matrix M 2 has the same property. In addition, if rank ( M 2 )=q and
    q≤r then can be exploited the same path proposed to prove Proposition 1 also to
    show that there exists two matrices G ~ 2 , H ~ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ 2 ∈ R 3r×3r having a
    shape similar to those in (9) such that Y k+1 = G ~ 2 Y k + H ~ 2 U k ,∀k∈O (10)
    View Source The relevance of Proposition 1 is underlined by the fact that it guarantees
    a linear input-output relation consequently allowing to apply a control strategy,
    as the one proposed in [27], without knowing the matrices that characterize the
    system described in (1). As stressed in Remark 5, the linear relations (9) and
    (10) can be combined to describe the output behavior of the considered system
    during the whole evolution without limiting our analysis exclusively during even
    or odd time intervals. In particular, starting from an even time instant the following
    holds Y k+3 = G ~ 1 G ~ 2 G ~ 1 Y k + G ~ 1 G ~ 2 H ~ 1 U k + G ~ 1 H ~ 2 U k+1
    + H ~ 1 U k+2 =G Y k + H 1 [ u[k] u[k+1] ]+ H 2 U k+2 View Source with G= G ~
    1 G ~ 2 G ~ 1 , H 1 = G ~ 1 G ~ 2 H ~ 1 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ I r 0 0 0 I r 0 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ + G ~ 1 H
    ~ 2 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ 0 0 0 I r 0 0 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ , H 2 = G ~ 1 G ~ 2 H ~ 1 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ 0 0 I r 0 0 0 0
    0 0 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ + G ~ 1 H ~ 2 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ 0 I r 0 0 0 I r 0 0 0 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ + H ~ 1 . View Source
    Such a relation allows three consecutive output samples to be represented as a
    function of the previous three consecutive input and output time measurements
    and the next three consecutive inputs. Thus, it represents a fundamental point
    for the development of future control strategies. However, to exploit the above
    relation it is necessary to know the matrices G ~ 1 , G ~ 2 , H ~ 1 and H ~ 2
    that characterize (9) and (10), respectively. The following proposition gives
    a way to identify such matrices with no actual knowledge of the dynamical system
    matrices by collecting input-output data. Proposition 2 Assume α=1,q≤m and M 1
    [ M 2 ] be a full column-rank matrix, if the input is rich enough, that is ∀k∈E[∀k∈O]
    exists a finite time interval ρ 1 ∈E such that rank( ∣ ∣ ∣ Y k U k Y k+2 U k+2
    Y k+4 U k+4 ⋯ ⋯ Y k+ ρ 1 U k+ ρ 1 ∣ ∣ ∣ )=3n, (11) View Source then the matrices
    ( G ~ 1 , H ~ 1 )[( G ~ 2 , H ~ 2 )] for which (9)[(10)] holds can be identified
    by collecting at least (2 ρ 1 +6)r input-output data as follows (with i=1[2])
    [ G ~ i  H ~ i ]=[ Y k+1  Y k+3 ⋯][ Y k U k Y k+2 U k+2 ⋯ ⋯ ] (12) View Source
    Proof ⋄ The relation (9) [(10)] can be exploited in order to identify the matrices
    ( G ~ 1 , H ~ 1 )[( G ~ 2 , H ~ 2 )] from the outputs and inputs measurements.
    In particular, the following holds [ Y k+1  Y k+3 ⋯]=[ G ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ i  H ~ i ][ Y
    k U k Y k+2 U k+2 ⋯ ⋯ ] View Source with i=1[2] and k∈E[k∈O] . Therefore, assuming
    the existence of ρ 1 that satisfies (11), the above relation can be manipulated
    in order to obtain (12) which represents a data-driven way to identify the matrices
    that define the linear relation (9)[(10)]. • Fig. 3. A visual representation of
    the input chosen in order to satisfy (11). Show All SECTION IV. Simulation Results
    Consider an area divided into n=4 rectangular parcels, and consequently, let the
    number of the available UAVs be equal to r= n 2 =2 . According to [24], each parcel
    has its own coefficient c i for i∈{1, …, 4} depending on the deep percolation
    and the soil composition that defines the property of the soil to absorb or release
    water. Since the considered area is assumed homogeneous, then the coefficients
    c i are all assumed equal to c=0.003 while it is reasonable to assume that the
    interconnection factor, which represents the percentage of water that each plot
    shares with its neighbors, is the same for all plots and equal to f=0.01 . On
    the other side, the parcel interconnections are defined by the following adjacency
    matrix Adj= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ View Source Thus,
    combining the above information and defining the corresponding Laplacian Matrix
    as L , the dynamic matrix A of the sampled system in (2) can be obtained as A=
    e −(c I n +fL)τ with τ=0.1 as the sampling time. The resulting matrix is A= ⎡
    ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 0.9967 0.0010 0.0010 0.0010 0.0010 0.9967 0.0010 0.0010 0.0010 0.0010

    into A 11 , A 12 and A 22 is under-lined. In addition, as stressed in Remark 1,
    it is straightforward to show that the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix are
    strictly inside the unit disk and both the matrices in (3) are singular, while
    the ones in (4) are full rank. Consider the dimension q of the exogenous system
    introduced in (1 b) equal to 2≤r , then the matrices P 1 , P 2 and S , that define
    the meteorological time evolution and its interaction with the crops, are modeled
    as follows P 1 = P i2 =[ sin(0.2) sin(0.3) cos(0.2) cos(0.3) ], S=[ cos(0.1) sin(0.1)
    −sin(0.1) cos(0.1) ] View Source Since nature has a high degree of unpredictability,
    all initial conditions are considered random variables. Therefore, assuming α=1
    , the input-output relations (9) and (10) hold, and consequently the result of
    Proposition 2 can be exploited in order to find G ~ 1 , G ~ 2 , H ~ 1 and H ~
    2 by applying a sufficiently rich control input (as depicted in Fig. 3). Although
    the formal result in Proposition 2 guarantees an exact identification of the matrices
    G ~ 1 , G ~ 2 , H ~ 1 and H ~ 2 , it may be advisable, in general, to implement
    the approach iteratively, so ensuring a proper fitting of such matrices even in
    the presence of small noise or numerical errors. In particular, a way to properly
    choose ρ 1 consists in waiting for a minimum amount of data, i.e. 20 samples,
    and progressively increasing such time interval as more data are available. The
    result of the described approach is shown in Fig. 4, where the estimation converges
    to the output of the system described in (1) subjects to the input depicted in
    Fig. 3. Fig. 4. A visual representation of the time evolution of the signal resulting

    proposes a novel way to estimate the soil moisture of the crops without prior
    information. The measurements are assumed to be provided by unmanned devices that
    change their position to cover the whole area while the meteorological perturbations
    have been modeled by an external linear system (exosystem). A data-driven intermittent
    observer is introduced to define a representation of the whole system based only
    on the measured data and a numerical simulation is proposed in order to validate
    the theoretical contribution. Future efforts will focus on extending the proposed
    theory to a generic number of unmanned devices, i.e. r∈[q, n] ‘ Furthermore, a
    deep investigation of the conditions under which the matrices M 1 and M 2 are
    not full column-rank will be done. Finally, an interesting research line related
    to this paper will focus on the design of proper coordination strategies for UAVs
    in order to optimize the collection of the data necessary for the estimation by
    limiting movements and reducing the time in flight. Authors Figures References

    This work is motivated by two global trends. First of all, agriculture is responsible
    for approximately 69% of annual water withdrawals globally, of which irrigation
    is a large portion [1]. Second, global food demand is rising [2]. Therefore, a
    major question in arable farming is when, where, and how much irrigation should
    be applied in order to produce food of high quality in large quantities while
    minimizing waste of water. Typically, there are many more farmlands than there
    are irrigation machines, and farmers, therefore, need to carefully choose which
    fields to irrigate in addition to how much water should be applied. We use “fields”
    to denote a connected piece of arable farmland. Fields typically represent a local
    context characterized by, e.g., location, soil composition, and groundwater levels.
    Fields can be of any size: from a large scale (i.e., order of hectares) to a near
    individual crop scale (i.e., square meters). Many uncertainties play a role when
    making irrigation-related decisions, which the farmer has to do on a daily basis.
    There are uncertainties due to disturbances such as (future) weather influences
    (e.g., rain and solar irradiation), but also uncertainty due to lack of accurate
    knowledge of the state of the crops and limited predictability of future crop
    states due to model mismatch and/or parameter uncertainty. In the present article,
    we adopt a model-based approach to design a framework in order to compute the
    optimal actions for the water delivering agents. “Optimal” here is in the sense
    of maximization of a profit function. In this framework, we use crop growth models
    in order to predict the states of the crops in the future. There is a vast amount
    of literature concerned with the modeling of crop growth. For survey articles,
    e.g., [3], [4]. These models are usually simulation models made by agronomists,
    ecologists, or biologists to better understand how crops grow and to predict crop
    yield. For a given set of parameters, inputs, and disturbances, such models predict
    growth during the growing season. Examples include light interception and utilization
    simulator (LINTUL) [5], WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) [6], Simulateur mulTIdiscplinaire
    pour les Cultures Standard (STICS) [7], and AquaCrop [8]. These models have been
    validated extensively. In order to design control algorithms for crop growth,
    one might be inclined to convert and approximate available simulation models into
    a set of differential/difference equations or partial differential equations.
    In some applications, these are good enough as a “first principle” model (e.g.,
    design of state-estimators [9]). However, these models tend to generalize poorly
    when applied to other types of crops, soils, locations, and weather patterns and
    they require extensive calibration. This makes them rather unsuitable for larger-scale
    decision making on crop management such as irrigation as considered in the present
    work. In fact, crop growth simulation models, as discussed in the previous paragraph,
    already suffer from the effects of climate change and are continuously adapted
    [10]. We argue that there is a tremendously important and interesting opportunity
    for system and control engineers and theorists to apply their knowledge of modeling
    in cooperation with the domain experts of agriculture in order to obtain crop
    growth models that: 1) generalize well to different situations (such as climatic
    effects, different crop types, etc.) and 2) can make more use of the existing
    methods in control theory to design controllers. In the present article, we take
    an alternative approach and we focus on a control design that is not driven by
    any severe modification of the crop growth simulation models. In fact, our approach
    does not even require an analytical expression of the crop-growth model, which
    allows for the use of software models. This results in a modular approach, where
    one can substitute a new crop growth model into our framework and thereby making
    it generally applicable. In our proposed optimization framework (defined in Section
    II-C), we make use of only a very small set of assumptions on the crop growth
    dynamics that are general for many different crops in different conditions.1 The
    optimization framework we present can therefore make use of a large collection
    of existing crop growth (simulation) models that have been verified and validated
    in experiments and are continuously updated by domain experts. A. Problem Description
    and System Context One of the key decisions many farmers have to make on a daily
    basis is which fields should receive irrigation and how much irrigation they should
    receive. The difficulty in those decisions is due to several factors such as uncertainty
    in crop states, in how the crops will develop, in what the soil-water content
    is, and in the future weather. Due to the presence of these unknown disturbances
    and uncertainties, farmers need to make use of feedback and thus make their decisions
    in an “online” fashion. Constraints on irrigation agents’ capacities and rates
    also need to be taken into account, as well as the costs of operating these agents.
    “Optimal” decision making in irrigation can then be defined in various different
    ways, dependent on the user. Some farmers may want to maximize their economic
    profit over the season by delivering a large number of high-quality crops. Other
    farmers may want to deliver the most amount of crops by doing the least amount
    of actions or using the least amount of water. There are many forms of applying
    irrigation such as flood irrigation, drip irrigation, spray irrigation, and nebulizer
    irrigation [11]. In this work, we consider agents to be of the latter two types.
    More specifically, we assume that the agents are mobile and can move over a field
    to deliver the water. These include, for instance, popular machines such as traveling
    gun irrigation machines [12], [13]. Summarizing, the problem discussed in this
    work is the following. How to design a framework for optimal online automated
    decision making in irrigation for large-scale arable farming that takes into account
    the limitations of the agents and predictions of crop growth using any crop-growth
    model. B. Previous Work Due to the importance and difficulty of optimal irrigation,
    it has been a topic of interest for many years. Recent developments in the application
    of optimal control to irrigation can be found in [14] and [15] and in model predictive
    control (MPC) for irrigation in [16]–[19]. Optimal control for large-scale irrigation
    channels that do not make use of crop growth models can be found in [20] and in
    [21] for a human-in-the-loop application. An overview of the usage of MPC in agriculture
    can be found in [22]. In many of the irrigation scheduling policies available
    in the literature, it is assumed that every field that requires irrigation can
    actually be irrigated, e.g., [14], [16], [18], [19]. However, the number of irrigation
    machines that farmers have to their availability is typically much less than the
    number of fields (that require irrigation). Hence, there is a need to not only
    compute how much irrigation a field would optimally need (ignoring the possible
    unavailability of machinery) but there is also a need to select the allocation
    of which (sub)fields receive irrigation by which delivery agent. For the above
    reasons, we present in this article a framework for optimal irrigation scheduling
    in arable farming by a group of heterogeneous agents. An important novelty of
    this framework is that it computes the optimal allocation of irrigation while
    taking into account constraints on agent allocations such as: The maximum resource
    carry capacity; The maximum rate of irrigation; Minimization of agent travel distances;
    Returning to a refill station to replenish water; Time-scale separation between
    crop growth dynamics and allocation. Item 5) is of interest as the dynamics of
    crops have time-scales of several days, whereas allocation can occur much faster
    and has a time-scale of hours. For an overview of multi-agent resource allocation,
    see [23] and references therein. The framework we propose is based on ideas from
    MPC. Within this context, a key novel insight is that we provide a technique to
    link short-term water stress effects within the (short) prediction horizon to
    the long-term effects of the crop growth during the remainder of the season. C.
    Contributions Summarizing, the main contributions of this work are threefold.
    First, we present a problem definition of irrigation scheduling in large-scale
    arable farming for optimal control including the (often ignored) allocation constraints
    of irrigation machinery, and we provide a mathematical formulation of this problem.
    Second, the optimal control framework we employ can make use of a wide selection
    of existing crop growth model. This allows for a large applicability to different
    types of crops, soils, locations, and weather patterns. Finally, the proposed
    optimization framework can handle a wide variety of real-world constraints on
    the agent allocation such as carrying-capacity, irrigation rate, and replenishing
    of resources. This article is a significant extension of our preliminary works
    [24], [25]. The extensions include (but are not limited to) the minimization of
    agent travel distances, monitoring of resources of agents and returning to a refill
    location, and an extensive case study of the proposed framework over 33 growing
    seasons. Furthermore, several constraints in the framework have been adapted in
    order to significantly reduce computation time. D. Structure The remainder of
    this article is structured as follows. We end this section with mathematical notations.
    In Section II, we pose a mathematical abstraction of the problem formulation described
    in Section I-A. Constraints on the irrigation machinery (as mentioned in Section
    I-B) are given in Section III, followed by a model of soil water and soil water/crop
    interaction in Section IV. The proposed solution to the formulated problem (the
    optimization framework) is described in Section V. In Section VI, we demonstrate
    the effectiveness of the proposed framework with a realistic case study using
    crop-growth models developed by agronomists. E. Mathematical Notation Let N 0
    denote the set of natural numbers including zero. Moreover, N:= N 0 ∖{0} , and
    B:={0,1} . If M is a matrix, then [M ] ij is used to denote the element on the
    i th row and j -th column of M . We use 1 n and 0 n to denote vectors of size
    n consisting of all ones and all zeros, respectively. Likewise, 1 n×m and 0 n×m
    denote matrices of size n -by- m , consisting of all ones and all zeros, respectively.
    The n -by- n identity matrix is denoted by I n . Furthermore, Tr(⋅) denotes the
    trace of a matrix and diag(c)∈ R n×n denotes a diagonal matrix with the elements
    of vector c∈ R n on the diagonal. Operators “=,” “≤” or “≥” in matrix (in)equalities
    denote element-wise comparisons. SECTION II. System Context In this section, we
    propose a mathematical abstraction of the problem formulation described in Section
    I-A. First, we introduce some notation and properties of the agents. Second, we
    introduce the objective function to be maximized by our framework. A. Multi-Agent
    System Set-Up and Notations We define M:={1,2,…,m} as the label set of (sub)fields,
    with m the total number of fields. Similarly, we define N:={1,2,…,n} as the label
    set of agents, with n the total number of irrigation agents. Typically, in real-world
    problems, n≪m . Let T denote the known length of the growing season and hence
    any day t is in the set T:={0,1,…,T−1} . In addition to fields on which crops
    grow, agents can also be allocated to places for combined storage and refilling.
    We call these locations “stores” and label each store by an index from the set
    V:={m+1,…,m+v} , where v∈N is the total amount of stores. We use “point of interest”
    or “POI” to denote a field or a store. POIs are labeled from the set M + :=M∪V={1,2,…,m+v}
    . At each store k∈V , an agent can refill water at a rate at most r k−m ∈ R ≥0
    . It is assumed that each day t∈T is divided into S∈N time slots (or subtimes)
    in which agents can be allocated. Each agent is allocated only once per time slot.
    The time slots are labeled from the set S:={1,2,…,S} in chronological order. Crop
    growth dynamics typically has a time scale of days to weeks, whereas agents allocation
    can have time scales of hours. By introducing the time slots we separate these
    time scales in our set-up. That is, we can accommodate the fast allocation of
    agents, whilst leveraging on the fact that the crop states do not vary significantly
    on that time scale. We define the allocation matrix A s t ∈ B n×(m+v) such that
    [ A s t ] ij =1 if and only if agent i∈N is allocated to POI j∈ M + in time slot
    s∈S of day t∈T , otherwise [ A s t ] ij =0 . Likewise, we define the delivery
    matrix D s t ∈ R n×m ≥0 such that [ D s t ] ij denotes the amount of irrigation
    that agent i∈N delivers to field j∈M in time slot s∈S of day t∈T . Furthermore,
    we define the daily allocation and delivery matrices as A t = ∑ s∈S A s t  and  D
    t = ∑ s∈S D s t View Source respectively, for t∈T . Agent capacity is captured
    by the vector c ¯ ∈ R n ≥0 , where the i -th element c ¯ i of c ¯ denotes the
    maximum amount of water agent i∈N can store. Similarly, the i -th element d ¯
    i of d ¯ ∈ R n ≥0 denotes the maximum amount of water that agent i∈N can deliver
    per slot. In other words, d ¯ can be used to represent the rate at which irrigation
    can be applied. B. Objective As mentioned in Section I-A, the objectives of a
    farmer can be of all sorts, including maximizing economic profit, minimizing number
    of irrigation agent deployments, or saving water. In our optimization framework,
    we model the objective function as an economic profit function, i.e., the total
    income over the season, minus the total costs incurred. Other perspectives can
    be incorporated by appropriately changing the weights of the income and costs
    terms in the objective function. The income is related to the quantity and quality
    of the crops at the end of the season. The costs include the costs of water for
    irrigation and costs of agent operation such as fuel/energy and operator costs.
    We now show how these incomes and costs lead to the objective function of interest
    in this article. First, let us look at the incomes due to harvest. Let x j t ∈
    R s denote the state vector2 of a field j∈M at time t∈T . In this work, we assume
    that the profit is determined by a linear combination of the elements in the state
    x j T at the end of the season (i.e., at time T ). Let π∈ R s denote the weights
    such that π ⊤ x j T View Source denotes the profit obtained from field j∈M . Note
    that we use the state at time T , the end of the season, as we assume that the
    profit is obtained from the harvest. Second, we look at the costs. We distinguish
    three main costs: operation costs of agents, resource costs and travel costs of
    the agents. For operation costs, we define σ∈ R n ≥0 such that the i th element
    σ i of σ denotes the costs of operation for agent i∈N per slot. This is the cost
    that needs to be paid when an agent is allocated to a field and can represent
    costs such as fuel/energy or labor costs (e.g., [26] for the importance of minimizing
    electricity costs). It is assumed that if an agent is allocated to a store, no
    operations costs are incurred. For the resource costs, we define ρ∈ R ≥0 to denote
    the cost per unit irrigation. Hence, the total amount of expenses over the growing
    season incurred by operation and resource costs can be written as ∑ t∈T σ ⊤ A
    t [ 1 m 0 v ]+ρ 1 ⊤ n D t 1 m . View Source For the travel costs, we define the
    matrix E∈ R (m+v)×(m+v) ≥0 such that [E ] jk denotes the cost incurred from moving
    from field j to field k (with j,k∈ M + ). Hence, the total costs due to agent
    movements can be computed using3 ∑ t∈T ∑ s∈S ∑ i∈N ∑ j∈ M + ∑ k∈ M + [ A s t ]
    ij [ A s+1 t ] ik [E] jk = ∑ t∈T ∑ s∈S Tr( A s t E ( A s+1 t ) ⊤ ) (1) View Source
    where we define A S+1 t = A 1 t+1 for t∈T . Furthermore, we have chosen to not
    take the very last travel cost into account and therefore define A S+1 T = 0 n×(m+v)
    . Note that the matrix E is not necessarily symmetric, i.e., the cost of traveling
    from i∈M to j∈M does not have to be equal to the cost of traveling from j to i
    . Also, the diagonal of E can be comprised of only zeros since, technically, the
    agent does not move from one field to another in that case and does not incur
    costs. However, we can use a non-zero diagonal of E to penalize agents that remain
    stationary on a field without delivering resources. Note that it is assumed that
    the agents are able to move from any POI to any other POI within one time slot.
    Situations with infeasibly large movements are not prevented, but are less likely
    to occur due to the penalization in the objective function. Combining these costs,
    we obtain the objective function J as J= π ⊤ ∑ j∈M x j T − ∑ t∈T ( σ ⊤ A t [ 1
    m 0 v ]+ρ 1 ⊤ n D t 1 m + ∑ s∈S Tr( A s t E ( A s+1 t ) ⊤ )). (2) View Source
    C. Lay-Out of Proposed Solution In essence, the objective is to maximize (2) subject
    to constraints on agent allocation and growth of the crops, in the presence of
    uncertainty about the state of our system, uncertainty in weather predictions,
    and other disturbances. To tackle this problem, we will formalize the agent constraints
    in Section III, followed by a model of soil water and soil water/crop interaction
    in Section IV. In order to deal with the uncertainty in our system, the proposed
    framework will make use of principles from MPC. The adaptation needed to do so
    is described in Section V. SECTION III. Agent Allocation Constraints In this section,
    we will provide a mathematical formulation of several important constraints on
    agent allocation. Section III-A introduces essential constraints that are required
    for any use of the proposed framework. The other subsections contain additional
    constraints that may be added if desired. A. Essential Allocation Constraints
    As already stated in Section II-A, at each s∈S , an agent must be allocated to
    exactly one POI. We, therefore, impose for all i∈N and all s∈S,t∈T ∑ j∈ M + [
    A s t ] ij =1 View Source or stated otherwise, for all s∈S,t∈T A s t 1 m+v = 1
    n . (3) View Source A vital constraint in the agent allocation is that if an agent
    i∈N delivers resources to field j∈M , it must be allocated. Formally stated [
    D s t ] ij >0⇒ [ A s t ] ij =1 (4) View Source for all s∈S and t∈T . Furthermore,
    each agent i∈N cannot deliver more than its maximum delivery rate d ¯ i [ D s
    t ] ij ≤ d ¯ i . (5) View Source We can enforce (4), (5) simultaneously by the
    following linear inequalities, for all s∈S,t∈T,i∈N and j∈M : [ D s t ] ij ≤ d
    ¯ i [ A s t ] ij View Source or, equivalently, for all s∈S,t∈T D s t ≤diag( d
    ¯ ) A s t [ I m 0 v×m ]. (6) View Source B. Refilling Constraints Let c s t ∈
    R n ≥0 denote the amount of water stored by each agent at slot s∈S of day t∈T
    . In order to respect the carrying capacity of each agent it must be true that,
    for all s∈S,t∈T 0 n ≤ c s t ≤ c ¯ . (7) View Source Furthermore, we assume that
    the dynamics of c s t for all s∈S,t∈T equals c s+1 t = c s t − D s t 1 m + R s
    t 1 v (8) View Source subject to (7), where we define c S+1 t := c 1 t+1 and R
    s t ∈ R n×v ≥0 is a decision variable such that [ R s t ] i(k−m) denotes how much
    water is refilled to agent i∈N at store k∈V in slot s∈S on day t∈T . Similar to
    (4), we must have that an agent must be allocated to a store in order for it to
    receive water and, hence, for all i∈N,k∈V,s∈S and t∈T [ R s t ] i(k−m) ≤ r k−m
    [ A s t ] ik (9) View Source where r k−m ∈ R >0 is the maximum refill rate per
    allocation for store k∈V . This can be written in matrix form as R s t ≤ A s t
    [ 0 m×v diag(r) ]. View Source SECTION IV. Model of Water Limited Crop Growth
    So far, we have dealt with the agent allocation side of the optimization framework.
    In this section, we will shift our attention to the crop growth side of the framework.
    First, this section presents the soil water dynamics, and second, the soil water/crop
    interaction. A. Soil Water Dynamics Let w j t denote the soil water content of
    field j∈M at time t∈T . We assume the (unsaturated) water dynamics occurs according
    to the following discrete-time dynamics: w j t+1 = w j t + d j t − v j t + p j
    t (10) View Source where d j t = ∑ i∈N [ D t ] ij is the amount of water field
    j receives at time t , v j t is a disturbance term that includes effects such
    as surface run-off, transpiration, and drainage, and p j t is the precipitation.
    We obtain v j t from the prediction model and weather predictions, and p j t from
    weather predictions/measurements. We assume that the soil for each field has a
    maximum carrying capacity for water called field capacity (fc). It is assumed
    that if w j t exceeds fc j , this amount of water will be lost due to deep drainage
    within one day and the water level will reduce to w j t = fc j . Therefore, in
    effect, we adapt the unsaturated dynamics (10) to w j t+1 =min{f c j , w j t +
    d j t − v j t + p j t }. (11) View Source B. Soil Water/Crop Interactions We assume
    that the prediction model G for the crop state x j t is of the form x j t+1 =
    x j t +G( x j t , w j t , d j t , v j t , p j t , τ j t , i j t ) View Source
    for t∈T , where τ j t ∈R is the daily average temperature and i j t ∈ R ≥0 the
    total daily solar irradiation. Furthermore, in order to model the soil water/crop
    interaction, we assume that G can be decomposed as the product of a water-limiting
    factor θ j t ∈[0,1] and the potential growth G ∗ as G(⋅)= θ j t ( w j t , cr j
    t )⋅ G ∗ ( x j t , τ j t , i j t ). View Source Here, cr j t ( x j t , v j t ,
    p j t , τ j t , i j t ) is the critical water level which is dependent on the
    evapo-transpiration (which is dependent on crop states and weather influences
    such as precipitation, temperature, and irradiation), and G ∗ is the maximum amount
    of growth that is theoretically possible in the case where there is no water shortage,
    i.e., the potential growth. Note that this implies that G ∗ is not a function
    of d j t . The dependency of θ j t on d j t−1 is through w j t by (11). Remark
    1:As an illustrative example of a G ∗ , let us consider the crop growth model
    LINTUL2. In this model, the optimal growth is given by G ∗ =(1/2)λ i j t (1− e
    −κ L t ) , where λ is the light-use efficiency in g/MJ , i j t is the total daily
    solar irradiation in MJ, κ is an attenuation coefficient, and L t is the leaf
    area index (LAI). In order to compute the optimal actions more efficiently, we
    now exploit a key principle of soil water/crop interactions that is common to
    many crop growth models. This principle is used in many different crop growth
    models such as (but not limited to) LINTUL2/3 [5], WOFOST [6], STICS [7], AquaCrop
    [8], and a derivation thereof in [27]. In these models (as well as in our optimization
    framework), the water limiting factor is dependent on w j t in the manner as shown
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Dependency of growth-reduction factor θ j t on the soil water
    content w j t for any t∈T and j∈M . Show All In Fig. 1, wp j is the wilting point
    below which growth does not occur. It holds that wp j < cr j t < fc j for all
    j∈M,t∈T . The key principle mentioned earlier is that the growth is optimal for
    water levels above the critical water level and reduces linearly for values below
    the critical water level until the wilting point. Any crop growth model that satisfies
    the following assumption can be used in our framework as a prediction model. Assumption
    1 (Crop growth model for prediction):The crop growth model used in prediction
    can output the maximum possible growth G ∗ under optimal irrigation (i.e., potential
    growth), the critical water level cr j t and soil water effects v j t , for all
    t∈T . SECTION V. Model Predictive Control Scheme Optimization of (2) subject to
    the allocation constraints of Section III before the growing season starts, is
    generally a computationally demanding problem. Furthermore, the growth of crops
    is highly susceptible to changes in weather and other disturbances. It is mainly
    for these reasons that the proposed framework incorporates ideas from MPC (e.g.,
    [28]). Instead of an entire growing season, the optimization only considers a
    finite horizon of H∈N days. Within these H days, the optimization framework computes
    the optimal amount of irrigation and which agent delivers water to which field.
    In order to take into account a shrinking horizon when t∈T is close to T , we
    make use of H t :=min{H,T−t} instead of H in the remainder. Let H H t :={t,t+1,…,t+
    H t −1} denote the label set of prediction steps in the (receding) horizon for
    time t∈T . In the formulation of the optimization problem, we use the subscript
    “ h|t ” (e.g., D h|t ) to denote the value of a parameter at time h∈ H H t , when
    the optimization is performed at t∈T . In the remainder of this section, we will
    first adapt the objective function (2) such that it can be used in the MPC setting,
    followed by the required adaptations to the allocation constraints. A. Adaptation
    of the Objective Function We adapt (2) to the following objective function that
    is to be maximized at each time t∈T : J t = π ⊤ ∑ j∈M x j T|t − T−t H t × ∑ h∈
    H H t ( σ ⊤ A h|t [ 1 m 0 v ]   +ρ 1 ⊤ n D h|t 1 m + ∑ s∈S Tr( A s h|t E ( A s+1
    h+1|t ) ⊤ )) (12) View Source where we define A S+1 h|t := A 1 h+1|t and A S+1
    t+H|t := 0 n×(m+v) . Since we are optimizing over a finite horizon, we have made
    the following two modifications: 1) a prediction x j T|t at time t for the yield
    at the end of the season and 2) a multiplication of (T−t)/ H t of the resource
    costs in the prediction horizon. We now elaborate on each of these choices separately
    in Sections V-A1 and V-A2. 1) Prediction of the Yield at the End of the Season:
    If we are optimizing over a finite horizon that does not include the end of the
    season, then our approach requires an estimate of x j T|t , the state at the end
    of the season. We will use the following insights in order to obtain such an estimate.
    First, for all j∈M,h∈ H H t , let x ~ j h be such that x ~ j t = x j t and x ~
    j h+1 = x ~ j h + G ∗ ( x ~ j h , τ j h|t , i j h|t ) . The maximum possible growth
    (i.e., there is a complete absence of water stress) for field j∈M during the considered
    prediction horizon is then equal to G j ∘ = ∑ h∈ H H t G ∗ ( x ~ j h , τ j h|t
    , i j h|t ). View Source Second, let x j t,min denote the prediction at t∈T of
    the state at T if there would be no growth during the prediction horizon and optimal
    growth afterward: θ j h =0,h∈ H H t and θ j ι =1,ι∈{t+ H t ,t+ H t +1,…,T} . Similarly,
    let x j max denote the maximal possible yield, which can be achieved in complete
    absence of waterstress during and after the prediction horizon, i.e., θ j ι =1,ι∈{t,t+1,…,T}
    . The proposed estimate of x j T|t is then linear in the θ j h|t for h∈ H H t
    ,j∈M x j T|t = x j t,min +( x j t,max − x j t,min ) ∑ h∈ H H t θ j h|t G ∗ ( x
    ~ j h , τ t h|t , i j h|t ) G j ∘ . (13) View Source Remark 2:For a further interpretation
    of this, let us reconsider the crop growth model LINTUL2 as given in Remark 1.
    Assuming that the LAI does not change much during the prediction horizon, then
    x j T|t ≈ x j t,min +( x j t,max − x j t,min ) ∑ h∈ H H t θ j h|t Q h|t G j ∘
    . View Source The fraction can therefore be interpreted as an average of the reduction
    in growth, weighted according to the solar irradiation. If we furthermore assume
    that Q h|t does not change much in the prediction horizon, then the fraction is
    approximately equal to the average θ j h|t over the prediction horizon. 2) Scaling
    of Resource Costs: Since we are interested in the profit over the entire season,
    we must not only give a prediction of the yield at the end of the season, but
    also a prediction of the resource costs in the remainder of the season. The assumption
    we used in the adapted cost (12) is that the resource costs during the prediction
    horizon are indicative of the resource costs over the entire remainder of the
    growing season. In fact, we assume that the daily average within the prediction
    horizon is equal to the daily average over the remainder of the season. Hence,
    the resource cost during the prediction horizon is multiplied by (T−t)/ H t .
    Note that if t∈T is such that T−t≤H , then the factor (T−t)/H should be equal
    to one and hence the introduction of H t in (12). B. Adaptation of Constraints
    1) Allocation and Refilling Constraints: The adaptation of the essential allocation
    constraints is rather straightforward and we obtain D s h|t ≤diag( d ¯ ) A s h|t
    [ I m 0 v×m ] A s h|t 1 m+v = 1 n (14a) (14b) View Source for all h∈ H H t and
    s∈S . As with the essential allocation constraints, the adaptation of the refilling
    constraints (7)–(9) follows readily and we have, for all s∈S,h∈ H H t : c s+1
    h|t = 0 n ≤ 0 n ≤ R s h|t ≤ c s h|t − D s h|t 1 m + R s h|t 1 v c s h|t ≤ c ¯
    c 1 H+1|t ≤ c ¯ A s h|t [ 0 m×v diag(r) ] (15a) (15b) (15c) (15d) View Source
    where c 1 t|t = c t−1 (i.e., the current inventory) and furthermore c S+1 h|t
    = D S+1 h|t = R S+1 h|t = c 1 h+1|t D 1 h+1|t R 1 h+1|t . (16a) (16b) (16c) View
    Source 2) Water Dynamics: In order to model (11), we use the substitution of w
    j t to w j h|t for t∈T,h∈ H H t and j∈M . However, for ease of computation, we
    also replace the min-function by a set of linear constraints. For brevity of notation,
    let z= w j h|t + d j h|t + p j h|t − v j h|t , then (11) (with the aforementioned
    substitutions), can be rewritten as w j h+1|t =min{z,f c j }=z− max{z−f c j ,0}
                       =: ϵ j h|t . (17) View Source The max-function
    can be modeled alternatively by introducing the three constraints ϵ j h|t ≥ ϵ
    j h|t ≥ ϵ j h|t ( ϵ j h|t −z+f c j )= 0 z−f c j 0. (18a) (18b) (18c) View Source
    The complementarity condition (18c) ensures that either ϵ j h|t =0 or ϵ j h|t
    =z− fc j . Interestingly, (18c) can be removed in the optimization problem, while
    still satisfying ϵ j h|t =max{0,z− fc j } , as explained next. The water level
    w j h|t has a linear effect on the objective function through θ j h|t and x j
    T|t . A larger ϵ j h|t would yield a lower water level, which can only have negative
    effects on the crop growth in the long term (see Fig. 1). Hence, we set ϵ j h|t
    to be optimization variables in our framework and remove the complementarity constraint
    (18c) as the optimal solution will have the smallest value of ϵ j h|t that satisfies
    (18a), (18b), thereby automatically satisfying (18c) without having to impose
    it. This value for ϵ j h|t will be equal to the true maximum. This effect has
    been verified for the discussed framework and no violations of these constraints
    were observed in the simulation results presented in Section VI. In summary, we
    model the water dynamics as follows: w j h+1|t = ϵ j h|t ≥ ϵ j h|t ≥ w j h|t +
    d j h|t + p j h|t − v j h|t − ϵ j h|t w j h|t + d j h|t + p j h|t − v j h|t −f
    c j 0. (19a) (19b) (19c) View Source 3) Soil Water/Crop Interactions: In order
    to model θ j h|t for w j h|t ≥ wp j , we use a similar approach as in Section
    V-B2 above. It is evident from Fig. 1 that, for w j h|t ≥ wp j , it holds that
    θ j h|t =min ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 1, w j h|t − wp j cr j h|t − wp j ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ =1− max{0, cr j h|t

    − wp j View Source for all t∈T,h∈ H H t and j∈M . Similar to how we replaced the
    max-function in (17) with ϵ j h|t , we introduce the auxiliary variable η j h|t
    to represent max{0, cr j h|t − w j h|t } . This can be written to be identical
    to the constraints η j h|t ≥ η j h|t ≥ 0 cr j h|t − w j h|t . (20a) (20b) View
    Source and the complementarity constraint η j h|t ( η j h|t − cr j h|t + w j h|t
    )=0. (21) View Source Note that θ j h|t appears linearly in the objective function
    through x j T|t . A smaller value of θ j h|t , and thus a larger value of η j
    h|t , has a reducing effect on the objective function. Hence, the optimal solution
    will have the smallest η j h|t satisfying (20) and thus satisfy (21) automatically.
    Hence, we can remove the complementarity constraint without changing the optimal
    solution. Then, for w j t ≥ wp j θ j h|t =1− η j h|t cr j h|t − wp j . (22) View
    Source The critical water level cr j h|t is dependent on the evapotranspiration
    of the crop and, hence, it is dependent on several crop states and weather effects
    such as temperature and solar irradiation. This would imply that (22) is a non-linear
    constraint. However, we can find a representable value of the critical water level
    within the prediction horizon by using x ~ t j , i.e., by replacing cr j h|t in
    (22) by cr j t ( x ~ j h , v j t , p j t , τ j t , i j t ) . This substitution
    makes the constraint linear ( θ j h|t and η j h|t are the only remaining decision
    variables). In cases where it is unlikely that the water level reaches levels
    below the wilting point (i.e., w j h|t < wp j ), the constraints (20), (22) suffice
    to model the dependence of θ j h|t on w j h|t as shown in Fig. 1. C. Implementation
    of Control Framework The workings of the control framework are summarized in the
    following algorithm. Algorithm 1 (Irrigation control framework): For each time
    t∈T , the following tasks are to be performed in order. Obtain the current states
    x j t of all fields j∈M . Obtain the weather predictions required for the prediction
    model (temperature, irradiation, and precipitation). Compute, for all j∈M , G
    j ∘ , x j t,min , x j t,max , v j h|t , and cr j h|t (see Section V-A1). Maximize
    (12), subject to (13)–(16), (19), (20), and (22). Execute according to A s t|t
    , D s t|t and R s t|t , s∈S . Repeat for the next day. The optimization problem
    in step 4 is a mixed-integer bilinear problem (MIBP). It becomes a mixed-integer
    linear problem (MILP) if we do not take into account agent travel costs (i.e.,
    E is the zero matrix). SECTION VI. Performance Analysis A. Case Study Over 33
    Years The framework as described in Section V was implemented into MATLAB [29]
    and the optimization problem was solved on a notebook with a 2.60-GHz Intel Core
    i7 processor and 8 GB of RAM, using SCIP [30] and YALMIP [31]. We used the validated
    and realistic LINTUL2 [5], [32], [33] as the prediction model. We consider the
    crop spring wheat and the crop parameters used are the standard, validated ones
    that come with the LINTUL2 model [32]. The “real” dynamics of the field were simulated
    also using LINTUL2. However, several soil/water parameters (such as fc j and wp
    j ) of the real fields were perturbed (at most 10%) from the values of the prediction
    model in order to introduce heterogeneity in the field and model mismatch. Further
    heterogeneity in the fields is introduced by selecting a priori a constant growth
    reducing/improving factor per field as opposed to the ideal setting given by the
    prediction model. These factors range from 0.8 to 1.2 with an average of 1.0.
    Both the growth reducing factors and the change in parameters are unknown to the
    optimization solver. Weather data are obtained from 1966 to 1998 (33 seasons)
    and the location is Eelde, The Netherlands [32]. The weather used in the prediction
    step of the framework is perturbed from the weather data. Similar as in [25],
    this weather perturbation is done using a first-order linear autoregressive model
    with the same lag 0 and lag 1 correlations between the weather states as the historical
    data, see [34]. The system of consideration in this case study consists of N=5
    agents and M=100 fields of equal area, and v=1 store. Agents can be allocated
    S=2 times per day and the prediction horizon is H=12 . Furthermore, T=160,π=500,ρ=1,σ=500
    1 n , d ¯ =100 . We consider x j t to be the mass of the storage organ (“weight
    storage organ” or “WSO” in LINTUL2) to represent the yield at the end of the season.
    The objective function could represent the economic profit and ρ could have, for
    instance, the unit of $ /liter water (similar for π and σ ). However, the objective
    is not only strictly financial as some parameter tuning can be done in order to
    balance the estimate of the “true” economic profit and other effects such as penalizing
    excessive agent movements beyond economic reasons. Introducing currency can therefore
    be misleading and is therefore omitted here. We compare our framework in this
    setting to the following heuristic, which is based on [35]. If the water level
    is below the critical water level (i.e., w j t ≤cr ), then 30 mm of water is applied
    to field j∈M at day t∈T . If this happens to more than nS fields, then the nS
    fields with the largest WSO at that time are irrigated. We do not take into account
    the travel costs (i.e., E= 0 m+v×m+v ) and refilling constraints in this case
    study in order to have a fair comparison between the proposed framework and the
    heuristic. B. Results Over the 33 considered seasons, the value of the objective
    function is on average 5.31% higher when using the MPC compared to the heuristic,
    with a maximum of 18.3% in 1967. The objective function for the MPC was smaller
    than the heuristic in three seasons, but only by a negligible amount, namely 0.8%
    in 1972, 0.3% in 1990, and 0.7% in 1995. Note that the heuristic does not take
    into account all allocation constraints and violations in maximum delivery rate
    were present. Fig. 2 shows an overview of the objective function increase of the
    MPC scheme and Table I shows the performance compared over the years. TABLE I
    Annual Average Performance Comparison for 100 Fields, Five Agents, One Store Fig.
    2. Histogram of the relative increase of the objective function value of the MPC
    relative to the heuristic. Show All Fig. 3 shows several more details of the results.
    On average over the 33 seasons: the WSO is 5.29% larger with the MPC compared
    to the heuristic, while the MPC uses 5.17% less water. These are significant improvements
    in the domain of agriculture. Fig. 3. Simulation results over various years. Here,
    “average” denotes the average over all fields. There was a lot of rain in 1972
    and hence only a handful of irrigation moments were required. For visual clarity,
    the values for the efficiencies were omitted in this graph for 1972. The values
    for water use efficiency are 74.94 and 37.04 for the MPC and heuristic, respectively.
    The values for the irrigation moment efficiency are 1 002 and 1 111 for the MPC
    and heuristic, respectively. Show All The bottom two graphs in Fig. 3 also show
    the “water use efficiency” η w and the “irrigation moment efficiency” η i . We
    have defined these to be equal to, respectively η w = ∑ j∈M x j T 1 ⊤ n ∑ t∈T
    D t 1 m  and  η i = ∑ j∈M x j T 1 ⊤ n ∑ t∈T A t [ 1 m 0 v ] View Source for each
    year. That is, they are the total WSO divided by the total amount of irrigation
    and the total WSO divided by the total number of agent allocation. On average
    over the 33 seasons, the water use efficiency for the MPC is 11.64% higher than
    for the heuristic and the irrigation moment efficiency is 11.7% higher. Calculation
    times for the MPC were on average 3 min and at most 20 min for a single day, which
    allows for practical implementation on a daily basis. The year with the most irrigation
    and most agent allocations (irrigation moments) is 1996, which is also the year
    with the least amount of precipitation. In 1972, 1979, and 1998, the opposite
    was true: there was a lot of rain and hence only a handful of irrigation moments
    were required. In those years, the performance of the MPC is only marginally better
    than the heuristic. In general, the relative benefit of the MPC is low in extremely
    wet years and high in extremely dry years. C. Traveling Costs In order to demonstrate
    the traveling costs, we have done a numerical study over five seasons (1977–1981).
    We simulated the case of N=2 agent and M=25 fields. Furthermore, π=100,ρ=1,σ=10
    1 n , and the remaining parameters are the same as discussed in Section VI-A.
    We studied the case in which the 25 fields are arranged in a 5-by-5 grid and that
    the distances are given based on their central locations. For example, field 1
    and field 8 are a distance (12 + 22)1/2 apart since field 8 is one row up and
    two columns further. The distance from the fields to the virtual field is assumed
    to be equal to 2 and [E ] ii =0 for all i∈ M + . For each season, we used our
    framework to optimize the objective function both with and without the traveling
    costs, in parallel. Table II shows several results. It is evident that including
    the traveling costs induces an additional punishment on the number of agent allocations
    (i.e., besides the costs induced by σ ). This also shows in the results: in three
    out of five seasons there were significantly less agent allocations when taking
    traveling costs into account. In all five seasons, the traveling costs where indeed
    significantly reduced in the optimizations with the traveling costs in the objective
    function. On average, the traveling costs were reduced by 13%. The last column
    of Table II shows the relative differences in the values of the objective function.
    For the optimizations that did not take into account the traveling costs, we computed
    the traveling costs a posteriori and corrected the objective value for these costs.
    The objective value when taking the travel costs into account in the optimization
    was on average 1.26% larger. Calculation times per day were on average 16.8 s
    when not taking the travel costs into account (MILP) and 55.1 s when we do take
    them into account (MIBP). The maximum times were 180 and 236 s respectively. TABLE
    II Performance Comparison When Taking Into Account Traveling Costs Relative to
    Not Taking Traveling Costs Into Account. Analysis for 25 Fields, Two Agents, One
    Store SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work In this work, we introduced a problem
    of irrigation scheduling in large-scale arable farming, together with a mathematical
    formalization of this problem amendable for online optimization. In particular,
    we introduced a model predictive control framework in order to translate this
    problem into a real-time feasible formulation. This framework is practical to
    use as it can make use of a wide variety of crop growth model and it allows many
    real-world constraints on the agent dynamics and crop growth to be included. Although
    this article is concerned with the delivery of water, the proposed framework could
    be generalized to other resources as well. There are several interesting directions
    for further research. First, a sensitivity analysis on the effects of the weather
    disturbances, crop growth model parameters, and MPC framework parameters are of
    great interest to further assess the robustness of the framework. Second, it is
    interesting to compare the suggestions of the MPC framework to historical data
    of farming practices. Both for the validation of our framework as well as to investigate
    whether we can derive better heuristics for farmers that do not use the framework.
    Finally, we assume full-state information on the crops. It is interesting to study
    whether the presented framework can be adapted to be used for the allocation of
    sensing agents for state estimation. Furthermore, we presented a realistic case
    study based on a well-known crop growth model (LINTUL2) and real weather data
    over 33 growing seasons, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced
    framework. We introduced both parameter uncertainties and weather uncertainties
    and compared our framework to a state-of-the-art heuristic. For the chosen parameters,
    we were able to obtain a 5.31% larger value of the objective function on average.
    Our proposed framework was able to generate 5.29% more yield, while using 5.17%
    less water. These are significant improvements that help in tackling two global
    trends: to reduce water use in agriculture whilst providing more food. Authors

    1. Introduction Agriculture is the backbone of most economies in the world as
    it contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and provides
    food security (World Bank, 2020d). Conversely, agriculture has been regarded as
    a significant water user sector as it abstracts 70% of the world’s freshwater
    resources to irrigate 25% of the world''s croplands (FAO, 2020a, FAO, 2017a, Khokhar,
    2017). Climate change and increasing population do impose additional pressure
    to resources, such as water availability, that are vital for agricultural production
    (Ungureanu et al., 2020). According to the Anon (2019), the world population will
    hit 9.7 billion by 2050 translating into increased demand for nutritious food
    and water resources. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) forecasts a
    more than 50% increase in irrigated food production by 2050, which will require
    a 10% increase in water abstracted for agriculture, provided water productivity
    improves (FAO, 2020b). The land on which food is cultivated does not expand, which
    means agricultural cropping systems need to utilize the available water and land
    resources efficiently to feed the future population. Understanding the mechanisms
    that can improve water use efficiency and result in significant water savings
    and higher yield is therefore paramount. Water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture
    is the ratio of estimated irrigation water requirements to the actual water withdrawal
    (FAO, 2020a). Water use efficiency is dimensionless and can be applied to plant,
    field, scheme, as well on basin and country scale. Agronomists, however, define
    water use efficiency in terms of crop yield per amount of water used to produce
    the yield (Hatfield and Dold, 2019, Sharma et al., 2015, Ullah et al., 2019, Unver
    et al., 2017). Water use efficiency has gained significant attention from researchers
    as water scarcity continues to vary in both space and time across the world due
    to the effects of climate change (Hess and Knox, 2013). Competition from other
    sectors of the economy for the scarce water resource has made agriculturalists,
    irrigation engineers, and policy-makers revisit the way water is used in agriculture.
    Apparently, state of the-art approaches to water management and systems will need
    to be adopted to address declining land base and water allocations to meet agricultural
    production needs. Precision agricultural technologies are key in ensuring a higher
    water use efficiency (Evans and Sadler, 2008). Precision agriculture is at the
    centre to shape itself to provide solutions to the overarching problems in agriculture.
    Yin et al. (2021) described precision agriculture as the “use of technologies
    that integrate sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery, and informed
    management to improve production by accounting for dynamics within sustainable
    agricultural systems”. Precision agriculture and smart irrigation, in particular,
    enables farmers to save precious resources without subjecting plants to moisture
    deficiency (Pierce, 2010). Smart irrigation involves the application of water
    at the right time, in the right amounts, and at the right spot in the field (Singh
    et al., 2019). Therefore, it requires the use of monitoring and control strategies
    for optimum irrigation scheduling taking into consideration the variation in soil
    moisture conditions, changing weather patterns, and plant physiological conditions.
    Conventional irrigation systems apply irrigation water without considering the
    spatiotemporal variation of soil characteristics and changes in weather variables
    that affect crop evapotranspiration (Vories et al., 2021). This subsequently leads
    to spatial variation in the actual depth of irrigation water received by plants.
    Applying more than required irrigation water results in fertilizer leaching, deep
    percolation, and surface ponding and runoff while inadequate irrigation may lead
    to plant stress that may result in a reduction in crop yield and quality. Implementing
    an optimised irrigation schedule through a smart irrigation system requires sensors
    to monitor soil, plant, weather conditions. On the other hand, irrigation control
    deals with the allocation of inputs and making necessary adjustments according
    to the crop response to save irrigation water while mitigating the effects of
    disturbances and uncertainties (Abioye et al., 2020a, Zazueta et al., 2008). Over
    the past few years, several survey articles have been published on improving water
    use efficiency in irrigated agriculture (Chai et al., 2014, Hatfield and Dold,
    2019, Howell, 2001, Taheripour et al., 2016, Ullah et al., 2019). Other past reviews
    have focused on the use of smart technologies like smart sensors, Internet of
    Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in agriculture (Adeyemi et al., 2017,
    Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020, Koech and Langat, 2018, Li et al., 2020, Velmurugan
    et al., 2020, Zinkernagel et al., 2020). One of the most recent survey papers
    in the realm of smart irrigation was performed by Abioye et al. (2020b). The authors
    highlight the application of monitoring and control strategies in precision irrigation.
    In our opinion, the authors give a valuable start to fellow researchers interested
    in smart irrigation. However, concerning the application of monitoring and control
    strategies for water use efficiency improvement, to the best of our knowledge,
    there appear to be very limited systematic literature reviews. The authors fail
    to show how monitoring and control strategies water use efficiency in precision
    agriculture. This review further builds upon existing literature by combining
    both smart strategies used in monitoring crop water use and irrigation control
    techniques to improve water use efficiency. 2. Real-time irrigation scheduling
    Irrigation scheduling is the decision of when and how much water to apply to the
    field and thus has a direct effect on water use efficiency (Broner, 2005); and
    (Koech and Langat, 2018). The quantity of water to be applied is estimated using
    a criterion to determine the irrigation requirement and strategy to prescribe
    how much to apply. Efficient application of irrigation water requires an understanding
    of the dynamics of plant water use, which has a relationship with the weather,
    soil characteristics, and plant physiology. Efficient irrigation scheduling applies
    irrigation water at the right time and in the right quantity to optimize production
    and offset adverse environmental impacts. On the other hand, poor irrigation scheduling
    results in under-watering or waterlogging which affects water use efficiency (Hassan
    et al., 2021). Real-time irrigation scheduling is pertinent in saving water by
    applying the quantity required to meet plant needs. Several irrigation scheduling
    tools have been developed to help irrigators apply water precisely to crops (Andales
    et al., 2019). Growers who do not use any irrigation scheduling tool often rely
    on their experience to schedule irrigation (Anon, 2010). Recent research has proved
    that growers who rely on heuristic methods of scheduling like manual, time-based,
    and volume-based irrigation scheduling register significant water losses (García
    et al., 2020). An effective real-time irrigation scheduling event requires monitoring
    of the factors that affect plant growth and a control strategy for the delivery
    of the right amounts of irrigation water. 3. Monitoring in smart irrigation systems
    To improve water use efficiency, it is pertinent to monitor specific factors that
    influence crop growth and development. Monitoring in the perspective of smart
    irrigation also entails real-time data collection on the status of soil, plant,
    and weather parameters cropped area through the use of state-of-the-art communication
    technologies (Abioye et al., 2020b). The development of a real-time monitoring
    system involves the integration of sensors with a wireless sensor communication
    network or IoT framework. Wireless networks are very significant in real-time
    monitoring for smart irrigation since they have sensing, processing, and transmission
    capabilities (Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020). The wireless sensor network comprises
    various sensor nodes connected through a wireless connection module (Hamami and
    Nassereddine, 2020). Monitoring in smart irrigation can either be soil-based,
    weather-based, or plant-based monitoring as depicted in Fig. 1. Download : Download

    methods in smart irrigation. 3.1. Soil moisture monitoring Soil moisture monitoring
    involves measuring either the soil water potential or the soil water content,
    it has been used widely for irrigation scheduling (Delgoda et al., 2016). Monitoring
    the soil moisture in the plant root zone is important as it helps in understanding
    the moisture dynamics and its relationship with the volume of irrigation water
    and plant water uptake. Several options exist for determining soil moisture levels.
    The direct soil moisture measurement (gravimetric sampling) and indirect methods
    like eletromagetic property, heat conductivity, neutron count, water potential,
    and electrical resistance. With advances in microcomputer and communication technology,
    varieties of soil sensors for example ground, aerial and satellite moisture sensors
    are gaining momentum in the suite of irrigation tools (Earth Observation System,
    2020a). Soil moisture sensors have a small footprint on the field with sensors
    at multiple depths, soil moisture dynamics can be captured. Installing the sensors
    at different depths increases the accuracy and also helps in understanding the
    changes in soil water content in response to irrigation and crop water use (Soulis
    et al., 2015). Soil sensors give a wide range of data on the soil''s physical,
    chemical, and mechanical properties taken as optical, radiometric, mechanical,
    acoustic, electrical, electromagnetic, pneumatic, or electrochemical measurements
    (Zinkernagel et al., 2020). The measured variables helps in the determination
    of parameters such as the Maximum Allowable Depletion (MAD) (Li et al., 2020).
    Detailed descriptions of the functionality of soil moisture sensors and their
    characteristics can be found in Pardossi et al. (2009); and Pardossi and Incrocci
    (2011); and Thompson et al. (2017). Fig. 2 presents the most commonly used soil
    moisture sensors in research and vegetable production. Download : Download high-res

    in research and vegetable production. Adapted from: (De Pascale et al., 2018,
    Thompson et al., 2017, Zinkernagel et al., 2020). Determination of spatiotemporal
    variability of soil moisture content is vital for various applications, this has
    prompted the development of different measurement techniques over the last years.
    Soil moisture content is measured as Volumetric Moisture Content (VMC). Soil moisture
    content sensors infer volumetric moisture content based on changes in the thermal
    properties or electrical properties of the soil (Peddinti et al., 2020). The electrical-based
    sensors used to measure Volumetric Moisture Content rely on the propagation of
    electromagnetic waves in the soil. These sensors fall into various types i.e,
    Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR), Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR), capacitance,
    and resistance sensors. Frequency Domain Reflectometry sensors are capable of
    determining the bulk dielectric constant by measuring the frequency variations
    of an electro-magnetic pulse propagated into the soil (Fertinnowa, 2020b). Lozoya
    et al. (2016) used FDR sensors to measure field volumetric soil moisture content.
    The sensor node was implemented with a low-cost Arduino Mega board based on an
    ATmega 328 microcontroller. The sensors were placed on crop root level and had
    a volumetric moisture content range of 0 – 50% with 0.1% resolution. To optimize
    water use efficiency in vegetables, Yadav et al. (2020) used six (6) capacitance
    soil moisture-based sensors with a data logger at three (3) locations. The authors
    programmed irrigation scheduling using upper field capacity and lower thresholds
    of soil available water. The results revealed an improvement in water use efficiency
    compared to conventional methods of irrigation scheduling. Domínguez-Niño et al.
    (2020) reported that using capacitance-type soil moisture sensors combined with
    FAO’s soil water balance model provided a sound basis for automated irrigation
    scheduling in orchards. The disadvantage associated with soil moisture-based irrigation
    scheduling is that plant water uptake and stress does not only respond to the
    soil water content but also to atmospheric conditions, nutrient availability,
    root zone salinity, and pest and disease infestation. With variation in soil characteristics,
    accurate irrigation schedules are established if many representative monitoring
    sites are established rather than using a single point. Recently, researchers
    are combining remote sensing with ground sensors to solve the problem of heterogeneity
    (Ahmad et al., 2021, Babaeian et al., 2019, Klemas et al., 2014). Liao et al.
    (2021) in experimenting with a smart irrigation system in a greenhouse using soil
    moisture sensors used a logic diagram to describe the irrigation scheduling process
    as shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling. Adopted from
    Liao et al. (2021). 3.2. Weather-based monitoring Weather-based monitoring involves
    real-time estimation of reference evapotranspiration ET using measured weather
    parameters and thus indicates the water lost by the plants and the soil environment
    (Abioye et al., 2020b, Adeyemi et al., 2017). The quantity of water lost through
    evapotranspiration depends on humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and air temperature.
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate
    for determining crop water use in smart irrigation systems. Where soil or plant
    measurements are not possible, weather parameters are used to give an approximate
    irrigation schedule (White and Raine, 2008). The FAO Penman-Monteith equation
    discussed in Allen et al. (1998), presents a procedure for calculating hourly
    or daily evapotranspiration values using standard climatological measurements
    of air temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed. The daily crop
    water use can then be estimated using Eq. 1. (1) Where; Crop evapotranspiration
    (mm day−1) Crop coefficient Reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1). Most real-time
    weather-based monitoring systems have an automatic weather station with sensors
    for humidity, temperature, wind speed, rainfall, solar radiation, and atmospheric
    pressure (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Dataloggers are configured to automatically acquire
    data at a set interval and the data is then transmitted via a communication system
    to an online data access portal. The data logger manages communication protocols
    with the remote server using a WSN or IoT framework. The data is sent to smart
    irrigation controllers that combine with site-specific variables such as soil
    type to adjust irrigation schedules (Hydropoint, 2017b). The factors that affect
    the performance and choice of a weather monitoring system range from robustness,
    accuracy, installation and maintenance requirements, measurement suite, remote
    data acquisition, season capabilities, and power requirements. (Khoa et al., 2019)
    implemented smart water management in farming using an IoT platform. The authors
    proposed a novel topology of sensor nodes using affordable and efficient components.
    With a LoRa LPWAN (Long Range Low Power Wide Area Network) technology transmission
    module, the authors reported good performance of the system. Similarly, Wasson
    et al. (2017), used a weather-based monitoring system and transmitted the real-time
    air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity data via a wireless
    communication standard. Coelho et al. (2020) developed a system for monitoring
    soil moisture and environmental parameters using the IoT. Data acquisition was
    carried out employing sensors connected to a micro-controller system, and the
    signals were transmitted through a radio frequency module using the LoRaWanTM
    protocol. Irrigation schedules developed using weather measurements are widely
    used, however, the soil characteristics often used for estimating soil water volume
    are based on the soil texture and yet soil structure and organic matter content
    affect available soil moisture. 3.3. Plant-based monitoring Irrigation scheduling
    can be achieved by monitoring the plant-water-status indices. The relationship
    between crop water stress and soil water deficit makes it possible to estimate
    irrigation scheduling. The sensitivity of the measurement made to determine water
    deficit in a plant at a particular crop stage influences the efficiency of plant-based
    irrigation scheduling (Gu et al., 2020). Jones (2004) classified plant-based monitoring
    into plant-water-status monitoring which involves direct measurement of leaf,
    xylem, or stems water potential and plant physiologic monitoring that involves
    stomatal conductance, thermal sensing, sap flow, and xylem cavitation measurements.
    3.3.1. Leaf turgor pressure sensors Leaf turgor pressure sensors detect leaf water
    stress by measuring relative changes in leaf turgor pressure (Zimmermann et al.,
    2013). The magnitude of turgor pressure is dictated by rootwater uptake, transpirational
    water loss and by the celluar osmotic pressure. An example of the leaf turgor
    pressure sensor is the non-invasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe also know
    as the ZIM-Probe. The ZIM-probe provides real-time measurements of even minute
    changes in turgor pressure within leaves (Zimmermann, 2011, Zimmermann et al.,
    2013). It consists of two stamps that are each equipped with a magnet. One stamp
    also contains a sensitive pressure sensoring-element, which sends detected pressure
    changes to the ZIMtransmitter and telemetric unit. The counter stamp contains
    a screw thread, which enables adjustment of the distance between the two magnets
    as depicted in Fig. 4. The ZIM-probe has been successfully tested under laboratory,
    greenhouse and field conditions on a variety of herbaceous and woody plant species
    (e.g. grapevine, barley, arabidopsis, tomato, tobacco, banana, paprika, wheat,
    maize, beech, oak, populus, olive, avocado, plum, orange, grapefruit, and eucalyptus).

    Fig. 4. ZIM-Probe (http://www.zim-plant-technology.com). 3.3.2. Leaf thickness
    sensors Advances in electronic technologies have enabled researchers to develop
    small leaf thickness sensors. (Afzal et al., 2017, Seelig et al., 2012) developed
    tiny leaf sensors and evaluated them on a tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum)
    and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) respectively. Seelig et al. (2012) observed that
    irrigation timing based on leaf thickness measurements improved water use efficiency
    by 25–45% compared to the preset irrigation scheduling treatments. Afzal et al.
    (2017) reported that the daily CAP variations decreased when soil moisture was
    below the wilting point and completely ceased below the soil volumetric water
    content of 11%, suggesting that the effect of water stress on CAP was observed
    through its impact on photosynthesis. The results suggest that leaf thickness
    and CAP can be used for estimating plant water status. These studies suggested
    leaf thickness variations as a feasible plant-based method for monitoring water
    status. 3.3.3. Sap flow sensors The development of reliable heat pulse and energy
    balance thermal sensors for sap-flow measurement in the stems of plants has opened
    up an alternative approach to irrigation scheduling based on measurements of sap-flow
    rates (Jones, 2004). Because sap-flow rates are expected to be sensitive to water
    deficits and especially to stomatal closure, many workers have tested the use
    of sap-flow measurement for irrigation scheduling and control in a diverse range
    of crops, including grapevine (Jones, 2004). The Dynagage Sap Flow Sensors are
    the latest technology for measuring the sap flow, and thus the water consumption
    of plants (Ecotechtonic, 2016). These energy balance sensors measure the amount
    of heat carried by the sap which is converted into real-time sap flow in grams
    or kilograms per hour. The sensors are non-intrusive and not harmful since the
    plants are heated up 1 °C to 5 °C typically. The principles of heat balance sensors
    are scientifically proven and references exist for most major crops and many tree
    species. Unlike other methods, Dynagages require no calibration since sap flux
    is directly determined by the energy balance and rates of heat convection by the
    sap flow (Dynamax Inc, 2007). The need for this new technology is great because
    it is an affordable and practical way to measure the water use by plants of agricultural,
    economic and ecological importance. Plants in greenhouses, nurseries or in natural
    environments can be measured with the same ease. 3.3.4. Xylem cavitation sensors
    In transpiring plants, water in the xylem vessels is under tension. This tension
    is directly proportional to the water deficit to such an extent that the water
    columns can fracture, or ‘cavitate’(Jones, 2004). The cavitation events lead to
    the explosive formation of a bubble, initially containing water vapour. These
    cavitation events can be detected acoustically in the audio or ultrasonic-frequencies,
    and the resulting embolisms may restrict water flow through the stem. Substantial
    evidence, though largely circumstantial, now indicates that the ultrasonic acoustic
    emissions (AEs) detected as plants become stressed do indeed indicate cavitation
    events and that AE rates can be used as an indicator of plant ‘stress’. 3.3.5.
    Stem diameter variation Stem and fruit diameters fluctuate diurnally in response
    to changes in water content, and so suffer from many of the same disadvantages
    as other water status measures. Nevertheless, the diurnal dynamics of changes
    in diameter, especially of fruits, have been used to derive rather more sensitive
    indicators of irrigation need, where the magnitude of daily shrinkage has been
    used to indicate water status, and comparisons of diameters at the same time on
    succeeding days give a measure of growth rate. Although changes in growth rate
    provide a particularly sensitive measure of plant water stress, such daily measurements
    are not particularly useful for the control of high-frequency irrigation systems.
    Nevertheless, several workers have achieved promising results for low-frequency
    irrigation scheduling by the use of maximum daily shrinkage (MDS). New trends
    in plant-based monitoring involve the use of optical sensors to assess the status
    of plant water stress, drought, nutrient level, and pest and disease infestation.
    Optical sensors are broadly classified into contact or non-contact sensors. Whereas
    contact sensors are physically mounted so that they are in contact with the plant,
    non-contact sensors are either proximal (handheld, fixed or vehicle-mounted) or
    remote (aerial and satellite-based data acquisition) (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Several
    researchers including Aleotti et al. (2018), Jia et al. (2019), and Uddin et al.
    (2017) have generated irrigation maps through monitoring vegetation using unmanned
    aerial vehicles with high-resolution cameras. Similarly, Lozoya et al. (2019)
    employed spectral reflectance sensors to estimate the health status of the plant
    in a controlled environment agriculture experiment. The authors found out that
    the two methods achieved similar spectral results on the health status of the
    plant, which could be integrated with soil moisture sensing for optimal irrigation
    control. The major constraint in the application of plant-based sensors for commercial
    irrigation scheduling is that they do not provide a direct measurement of the
    quantity of irrigation water to be applied (White and Raine, 2008). It requires
    using plant-based irrigation scheduling conjunctively with soil moisture measurement
    and the soil water balance model. Table 1 summarizes the monitoring strategies
    that have been employed in recent years to schedule irrigation. Table 1. Summary

    control strategies for smart irrigation systems For irrigation to be sustainable,
    control strategies that apply irrigation water precisely have to be adopted. An
    irrigation controller is an essential part of the irrigation system and helps
    to achieve labour savings in addition to applying the required volume of irrigation
    water for a specified period leading to high efficiency in water, energy, and
    fertilizer use (Boman et al., 2018). Irrigation control strategies are divided
    into open-loop systems and closed-loop systems. While open-loop systems apply
    a preset action like in simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive
    feedback from sensors, make decisions and apply the resulting decisions to the
    irrigation system. Fig. 4 presents a detailed classification of irrigation control
    strategies derived from literature studies. 4.1. Open-loop irrigation control
    In an open-loop system, the operator decides on the amount of water that will
    be applied and when the irrigation will take place (Boman et al., 2018). This
    information is then programmed into the controller and the water is applied according
    to the desired schedule. Open-loop systems are either time-based or volume-based
    as shown in Fig. 5 (Abioye et al., 2020b). Open-loop systems have a clock that
    is used to start and stop irrigation events (Zazueta et al., 2008). Download :

    of irrigation control strategies. Adapted from (Abioye et al., 2020b, Boman et
    al., 2018, McCarthy et al., 2013). Sudarmaji et al. (2019) developed and used
    time-based automatic irrigation systems for both drip and sprinkler irrigation,
    the system was found to apply water according to the set time times. Similarly,
    Montesano et al. (2016) compared time-based irrigation control with soil moisture-based
    control and reported low water use efficiency with 18% leaching compared to soil
    moisture-based control in a soil-less lettuce experiment. Since there is no soil
    moisture and weather monitoring in an open-loop system, sensors are not required.
    This makes the system inexpensive however with constraints of failing to respond
    to varying soil and environmental conditions. 4.2. Closed-loop irrigation control
    In closed-loop systems, a control strategy for irrigation decisions is developed.
    Having defined the strategy, the control system takes over and makes irrigation
    scheduling decisions (Boman et al., 2018). Sensors help to provide feedback to
    the controller on which the irrigation decisions are based. Feedback and control
    in a closed-loop system are done continuously and therefore, require data acquired
    by monitoring devices like soil moisture, air temperature, solar radiation, wind
    speed humidity, and rainfall as well as system parameters like pressure and flow.
    In closed-loop control, a decision of whether or not to initiate an action is
    based on a comparison between the current state of the system and the specified
    desired state (Boman et al., 2018). Fig. 6 is a schematic presentation of a closed-loop
    control system. Download : Download high-res image (62KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Block diagram for an open-loop control system. Closed-loop
    control strategies are further subdivided into linear control, intelligent control,
    optimal control, and other control strategies as depicted in Fig. 5. 4.2.1. Linear
    control Linear control in closed-loop irrigation is further classified as linear
    quadratic control and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control. Proportional
    integral derivative-based irrigation controllers have been widely used in irrigation
    research and other industrial applications because of their simplicity, low cost,
    and extensive control algorithm (Aguilar et al., 2015). “The principle of PID
    controller is to read a sensor, then compute the desired actuator output by calculating
    proportional, integral, and derivative responses and summing those three components
    to compute the output” (National Instruments Corperation, 2020c). Although PID
    controllers suffer setbacks when faced with external disturbances and non-linear
    systems, it is more efficient because of its control ability on the actual output
    of a process. Lacasta et al. (2014) implemented a decentralized feedback discrete
    PID controller integrated with the hydraulic model to achieve a reliable complete
    simulation tool for predictive purposes. The results showed that the PID controllers
    effectively captured the stochastic phenomena and provided the correct gate movements
    to obtain the desired water levels. Likewise, Arauz et al. (2020) designed a PI
    controller for irrigation canals based on linear matrix inequalities. The authors
    solved an Linear Matrix Inequalities-based optimal control problem to obtain sparse
    feedback that provided the PI tuning; the results indicated a 30% improvement
    in PID tuning and were able to satisfactorily control canal water levels. Azar
    et al. (2020) designed and manufactured a smart irrigation mobile robot with a
    soil moisture sensor. The authors introduced a simulation analysis of the designed
    smart irrigation mobile robot by using One-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) PID controller.
    The results indicated that the smart irrigation mobile robot produced the desired
    output parameters. Nonetheless, classical closed loop controllers such as PID
    find it hard to control multi-variable and moving processes with time delays (Abioye
    et al., 2020a, Abioye et al., 2020b). Improving the controller performance requires
    linking feedback paths or cascading several PID controllers. Given the non-linearity
    of PIDs, there are inadequate gain selections of the control systems. Hybrid fuzzy
    PID is required for optimal control of irrigation systems. Tuning a PID requires
    the integration of intelligent algorithms such as hybrid fuzzy PID for optimal
    control of irrigation systems (Chao et al., 2019, Maghfiroh et al., 2020). 4.2.2.
    Artificial intelligence in closed-loop irrigation (Mccarthy, 2004) defined Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,
    especially intelligent computer programs. AI is an evolving technology in the
    agricultural domain. AI-based machines and systems, have taken today''s agricultural
    production systems to a different level. This technology has enhanced crop production
    and improved real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing and irrigation, and
    marketing (Talaviya et al., 2020). AI has the capability of solving multivariate,
    non-linear, and time-variant complex problems affecting the irrigation system.
    AI algorithms can mimic the human decision-making process when applied to a certain
    problem domain. AI has been implemented in irrigation systems for adaptive decision-making
    processes in a form of ANN, fuzzy logic, and expert systems (Adeyemi et al., 2017).
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a variation of the machine learning model that
    resembles the neural network of the human brain (Campos et al., 2020). While synapses
    connect the neurons in a human brain, in ANN, synapses are replaced by weights
    and biased connections. This helps to map the relationship between inputs and
    outputs (Campos et al., 2020). ANN-based controllers have learning and adaptation
    capabilities to the variable dynamics which makes them suitable for irrigation
    control systems (Abioye et al., 2020b). In recent years, various studies have
    explored the applicability of Artificial Neural Networks in irrigation scheduling.
    King et al. (2020) used ANN modelling to develop and evaluate data-driven models
    for predicting the reference canopy temperatures needed to compute crop water
    stress index for sugarbeet and wine grape. The data-driven models developed by
    the authors were able to estimate reference temperatures, enabled automated calculation
    of the crop-water-stress index for effective assessment of crop water stress.
    Adeyemi et al. (2018) modelled soil moisture content using Dynamic Neural Networks
    and reported significant water savings in an AQUACROP simulation of a potato growing
    season. Similarly, Karasekreter et al. (2013) registered 20.5% and 23.9% in water
    and energy savings when an ANN for scheduling with soil moisture and physical
    parameter inputs was implemented in a strawberry orchard. The major drawback with
    ANN systems is that large datasets for ANN model training are required. The accuracy
    of the ANN-based irrigation scheduling depends on how representative the data
    is of the physical system and thus data collection using precision instruments
    needs to be carefully undertaken. Fuzzy logic-based methodology focuses on decision
    making by allowing the expression of logical values between true and false and
    describes the uncertainty and non-linearity of real-world problems (Krishnan et
    al., 2020). “A fuzzy logic system is made up of a set used to classify input data
    into membership classes, a decision rule is applied to each set which culminates
    in a human-like decision output from the system” (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Fuzzy
    logic has been applied in irrigation control and has been recommended by researchers.
    For example, Mendes et al. (2019) developed a fuzzy inference system that decided
    when to increase or decrease the speed of the central pivot by considering the
    spatial variability of the field. The system was reported to work efficiently.
    Fuzzy irrigation controllers can accurately calculate the required amount of irrigation
    water and address the non-linearity associated with the process (Abioye et al.,
    2020b). Although Fuzzy Logic-based irrigation controllers have been reported by
    researchers as efficient, the accuracy and performance of the prediction entirely
    depend on the expertise of the designer about plant dynamics and fuzzy rule formulation.
    Another aspect of Artificial Intelligence in irrigation control is expert systems.
    An expert system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI)
    technologies to simulate the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization
    that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field (Janjanam et al.,
    2021). Typically, an expert system incorporates a knowledge base containing accumulated
    experience and an inference or rules engine -- a set of rules for applying the
    knowledge base to each particular situation that is described to the program.
    The system''s capabilities can be enhanced with additions to the knowledge base
    or to the set of rules. Current systems may include machine learning capabilities
    that allow them to improve their performance based on experience, just as humans
    do. An expert-controlled irrigation system aims to provide farmers with the expertise
    on how to determine the exact quantity of crop water needed at the right time,
    weather, and growing medium such as humidity, temperature, and soil types (Nada
    et al., 2014). Several researchers including (Eid and Abdrabbo (2018); Hazman
    (2015); Ragab et al. (2018); Shahzadi et al., 2016) have used expert systems for
    various applications in agriculture. The performance of an expert system is largely
    dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge acquisition process. Process errors
    pose a great threat to expert systems reliability and performance. 4.2.3. Model
    predictive control Model Predictive Control (MPC) has its roots in optimal control.
    The principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to forecast system behaviour and
    optimize the forecast to produce the best decision-the control move at the current
    time (Rawlings et al., 2018). Model predictive control is a very flexible optimal
    control framework based on solving constrained optimal control problems online
    repeatedly (Mao et al., 2018). MPC has been widely used in modern manufacturing
    industries due to its ability to handle multivariate processes and to address
    state and input constraints (Ding et al., 2018, Lozoya et al., 2014, Lozoya et
    al., 2016, Puig et al., 2012). In a control problem, the goal of the controller
    is to calculate the input to the plant such that the output follows the desired
    reference (Anon, 2018). MPC uses a model of the plant to make predictions about
    future plant output behaviour and an optimizer that ensures that the predicted
    future plant output tracks the desired reference (Anon, 2018). Fig. 7 is a schematic

    Several researchers such as; Abioye et al. (2021); Ding et al. (2018); Lozoya
    et al. (2014); McCarthy et al. (2014); Puig et al. (2012); Saleem et al. (2013);
    and Zhang et al. (2015) have used Model Predictive Control strategies in irrigation
    scheduling in controlled environment agriculture. MPC has shown better performance
    in controlling air temperature in greenhouses compared to Proportional Integral
    Derivative control. However, the applications in irrigation are still minimal
    with many studies stopping at the simulation phase, and thus the impact on water
    use efficiency and water productivity is not known. More so, the MPC methods often
    used are Classical and Improved MPC. There is a need to evaluate stochastic and
    Hybrid MPC strategies for efficient irrigation scheduling in open-field agriculture.
    There are many uncertainties and unpredictable disturbances from the environment
    exist unlike in a greenhouse environment. A summary of irrigation control strategies
    as used in irrigation are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation control strategies

    (2014) 5. Opportunities for improving water use efficiency in open field smart
    irrigation systems The need to improve water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture
    has gained serious attention from researchers in recent years. This is because
    agriculture has been reported to be a significant water user sector and yet spatiotemporal
    water scarcity indices are on the rise leaving little or no water for agricultural
    production. Producing more crop per drop requires that soil and weather parameters
    are precisely monitored and irrigation scheduled to meet the crop water demand.
    Commercial automated irrigation systems offered by major irrigation companies
    are programmed to irrigate at time intervals for predefined periods, and it is
    usually based on the user''s empirical knowledge of crop needs, soil characteristics,
    and weather factors. Some farmers use either soil moisture-based scheduling or
    weather-based scheduling. These methods have been reported to save water. Consequently,
    closed-loop-based feedback control strategies have been proposed for smart irrigation
    as opposed to open-loop systems which are characterized by over and under irrigation.
    Several studies have developed process dynamics models on which closed-loop irrigation
    schedules are based (Delgoda et al., 2016, Ding et al., 2018, Goodchild et al.,
    2015; Lozoya et al., 2016; Lozoya et al., 2019; Saleem et al., 2013; Karasekreter
    et al., 2013; Ragab et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). The system dynamics estimated
    and formulated in these studies are based on the soil water balance model without
    capturing the dynamic nature of weather, soil characteristics, and plant water
    use. Capturing weather and plant water use dynamics ensures that all disturbances
    to the system are well incorporated in the algorithm which improves the accuracy.
    Therefore, there is a need to address this gap by developing a mathematical model
    that incorporates the dynamics of soil moisture content, weather, and crop growth
    parameters obtained from a combination of weather, soil, and plant sensors in
    open field experiments. A novel irrigation control strategy based on a hybrid
    model predictive control needs to be evaluated in an open field irrigation environment
    and the resulting water use efficiency and water productivity determined. 6. Conclusions
    In this manuscript, a review of smart irrigation monitoring and control strategies
    for improving water use efficiency in precision agriculture has been presented.
    The review has been developed around monitoring strategies for irrigation scheduling
    and irrigation control techniques. In addition, a discussion on opportunities
    for future research based on research gaps has been established. In this regard,
    it is concluded that a combination of weather-based, soil-based, and plant-based
    monitoring strategies coupled with a discrete model predictive control strategy
    needs to be studied in an open field environment. Unlike controlled environment
    agriculture research, open field agricultural irrigation systems are faced with
    uncertainties that need to be studied. Future research will thus focus on developing
    process dynamics models for irrigation scheduling and establishing the effects
    of smart monitoring and control strategies on water use efficiency and water productivity
    in open field agricultural systems. Funding information This research was funded

  description: Water scarcity is an urgent issue to be resolved and improving irrigation
    water-use efficiency through closed-loop control is essential. However, the first-principle
    laws that describe the complex agro-hydrological dynamics pose challenges in control
    applications. In this work, we propose a 2-layer neural network (NN) framework
    to approximate the complex nonlinear dynamics of the agro-hydrological system
    to reduce the computational cost of the first-principle model. The multi-step
    ahead open-loop prediction performance of the proposed framework is compared with
    a benchmark long-short-term-memory (LSTM) NN model, indicating the effectiveness
    of the proposed framework.

    IEEE Conference Location: Vancouver, BC, Canada Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    Water scarcity is a rapidly escalating global issue due to various factors such
    as population growth and climate change. Approximately 70% of the freshwater is
    consumed by agriculture activities [1]. Thus, improving the water-use efficiency
    in the agriculture industry is essential. Currently, practical irrigation policies
    are mostly determined based on heuristic or empirical knowledge regardless of
    real-time feedback from the field, which is also referred to as open-loop irrigation
    policies. The efficiency of this approach is typically low, as the applied irrigation
    amount can be imprecise and lead to over or insufficient irrigation. Increasing
    attentions have been drawn to closed-loop irrigation over the past decade [2],
    [3]. Advanced control strategies such as MPC are popular due to their ability
    of handling constraints and multiple objectives simultaneously [4]–[9]. One of
    the major challenges in applying advanced control to the agro-hydrological system
    is the high computational cost. The water dynamics are highly nonlinear and are
    often described by the Richards equation, which is a nonlinear PDE developed based
    on first principles [10]. Spatial discretization is often required to simplify
    the Richards equation in applications [10], however, the resulting nonlinear ODE
    system is still challenging to solve and involves more states. Model reduction
    or approximation techniques are commonly used, for example, in [6] a linear parameter-varying
    (LPV) model was identified for agro-hydrological dynamics approximation. Computational
    cost reduction was observed but was still not sufficient for real-time optimizations.
    Motivated by the accuracy and computational efficiency of the neural network (NN)
    reduction model presented in [11], we propose a 2-layer NN framework to approximate
    the agro-hydrological dynamics. Section II introduces the considered agro-hydrological
    system, and section III presents details of the proposed NN framework. Model validation
    is provided in IV. Finally, two plant-model-missmatch compensation strategies
    are investigated to improve the prediction performance. Fig. 1. A schematic diagram
    of the considered agro-hydrological system. Show All SECTION II. Preliminaries
    A schematic of the agro-hydrological system of interest is shown in Figure 1.
    Only the soil water dynamics on the vertical axis are considered. The crop of
    interest is grass. Irrigation is applied with a sprinkler and is assumed to reach
    the soil surface evenly. Precipitation is considered as a known disturbance based
    on weather forecasting data and is assumed to reach the soil surface in identical
    ways as irrigation. A. Soil Water Dynamics Based on first principles, the soil
    water dynamics can be modeled using the 1-dimensional Richards equation with the
    crop and weather information taken into account [10]: c(h) ∂h ∂t = ∂ ∂z [K(h)(
    ∂h ∂z +1)]−α(h) K c E T 0 z r (1) View Source where h[m] is the capillary potential,
    c(h)[ m −1 ] denotes the soil capillary capacity, and K(h)[m/s] is the soil hydraulic
    conductivity. z represents the vertical axis of the soil, with the upward direction
    considered as the positive direction. c(h) and K(h) are modeled by the van Genuchten-Mualem
    soil hydraulic model [12] (2)-(3): c(h)=( θ s − θ r )αn(1− 1 n ) (−αh) n−1 [1+
    (−αh) n ] 1 n −2 (2) View Source K(h)= K s [ (1+ (−αh) n ) −(1− 1 n ) ] 1 2 ⎡
    ⎣ ⎢ 1− [1− [ (1+ (−αh) n ) −(1− 1 n ) ] n n−1 ] 1− 1 n ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ 2 (3) View Source
    where K s [ m/s] denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity, θ s [ m 3 / m 3
    ], θ r [ m 3 / m 3 ],α[ m −1 ] , and n are soil-property-related parameters. Sandy
    loam soil is considered in this work and the corresponding parameters can be found
    in [13]. The −α(h) K c E T 0 z r term in (1) captures the effect of weather and
    crop, where α(h) and Kc are dimensionless factors, namely the water stress factor
    and the crop coefficient. E T 0 [ m] denotes the reference evapotranspiration
    and is assumed to be a known weather-dependent disturbance. z r =−0.13m represents
    the rooting depth of the crop and is assumed to be time-invariant in this work.
    B. Boundary Conditions The boundary conditions employed in this work are presented
    in (4)-(5). At the soil surface, the Neumann boundary condition is employed while
    free drainage is assumed at the bottom. ∂h(t) ∂z T=−1− I(t)+P(t) K(h(t)) (4) View
    Source ∂h(t)+z ∂z | B =1 (5) View Source where I(t)[m/s] and P(t)[m/s] denote
    the rate of irrigation and precipitation at time t. Note that interception caused
    by grass leaves is ignored in this work, only evapotranspiration, precipitation,
    and irrigation are considered. C. Model Discretization The system of equation
    (1) is discretized over the vertical spatial axis following the approach proposed
    in [10], which leads to an ODE system: x ˙ (t)=f(x(t), u(t)) (6) View Source where
    x∈ R n=26 and u∈ R r=1 are the state and input vector respectively, while f defines
    the nonlinear system dynamics. The total depth of soil considered is 0.5 m and
    is evenly discretized into 26 nodes. The water dynamics at the center of each
    node are used to represent the dynamics of the entire node. In this work, irrigation
    rate I(t)[m/s] is the system input u, h[m] at the discretized nodes represents
    the system states x. The system output y∈ R l=1 is the volumetric water content
    θ[ m 3 / m 3 ] at the rooting depth, which is an algebraic function of the state
    vector defined by the soil-water retention equation of van Genuchten (7). Eqn.
    (6) and Eqn. (7) are used to generate all training datasets. θ(h)=( θ s − θ r
    ) [ 1 1+ (−αh) n ] 1− 1 n + θ r (7) View Source Fig. 2. A schematic diagram of
    the proposed 2-layer NN framework. Show All SECTION III. Reduction NN Model Design
    To reduce the computational complexity of the first-principle model, a two-layered
    NN framework is proposed to approximate its nonlinear dynamics. In this section,
    details regarding the proposed framework will be discussed. Section III-A introduces
    the motivation and provides an overview of the proposed framework. Section III-B
    and III-C discuss the data generation procedure for the individual layers of the
    framework respectively. A. Overview The motivation for designing the proposed
    framework is the unsatisfying prediction performance of a single LSTM. Furthermore,
    it was found that a single LSTM provides much better prediction performance if
    the operating region is small. Detailed simulation results will be presented in
    section IV. A schematic diagram of the proposed framework is presented in Figure
    2. The first layer contains multiple sub-models (Model 1 – I, referred to as M
    1 , M 2 ,⋯ , MI in the following text) while the second layer contains one model
    (Model A, referred to as MA). Each sub-model is responsible for a sub-operating
    region. The union set of the sub-operating regions forms the entire operating
    region of interest. M 1 − M I are LSTMs while MA is a fully-connected NN. At the
    current time step t, the system input and output obtained from p previous time
    steps are fed to Model 1 – I: N N in = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ u(t−p+1),y(t−p+1) u(t−p+2),y(t−p+2)
    ⋯ u(t),y(t) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ , View Source The I one-step-ahead predictions of the
    system output (N N out 1 =[ y ¯ 1 (t+1),⋯, y ¯ I (t+1) ] T ) are returned from
    the sub-models. N N ou t 1 is then feed to MA, where the final prediction of the
    system output at the next time step (N N out 2 = y pred (t+1)) is obtained. Inspired
    by Mao et al. [6], the proposed framework adopts the idea of the LPV models, which
    enhances the model performance by combining predictions made by multiple sub-models.
    B. Data Generation - First Layer As discussed in the previous section, the first
    layer of the proposed framework consists of I LSTMs. In this work, I = 3 is used.
    Table I presents the operating regions in terms of the system output of the sub-models.
    Each model is equivalent to a nonlinear function: m i : R 20×2 → R 1 , i=1,2,3
    View Source where the model input is a matrix and the output is a scalar. 20 is
    the number of the past input-output data points (p = 20), 2 is the number of system
    input (n = 1) plus the number of system output (l = 1). All models consist of
    a sampling time of 2 hours. TABLE I Operating Ranges of the Sub-Models Fig. 3.
    A sector of the training dataset of M2 Show All The training datasets are generated
    separately for each model such that the system output varies in the selected operating
    range. For each sub-model, a 30000-points-dataset is generated. Multi-level pseudorandom
    input signals are employed. The signal is similar to a pseudorandom binary signal
    except that it has multiple levels, which helps to incorporate the nonlinearity
    of the agro-hydrological system. More details regarding the design of multi-level
    pseudorandom inputs can be found in our previous work [11]. Figure 3 presents
    a segment of the training input signal and the corresponding output for M2, which
    is generated by simulating the discrete ODE system 6 and the algebraic equation
    7. Note that a random noise signal ϵ is added to the output trajectory to mimic
    real process operations, which is shown in Figure 3(b) in red. The max magnitude
    of ϵ is defined as follows: ϵ max =0.1[ y max − y min ] View Source where ymax
    and ymin are the maximum and minimum value of the system output in the dataset.
    All datasets need to be reorganized to match the input-output structure of the
    NNs. Scaling is also required such that the magnitudes of the scaled data are
    less than 1. All simulations are carried out in Python and TensorFlow [14] is
    used to train the NNs. Readers may refer to [11] for more details regarding data
    pre-processing and NN training. Fig. 4. A sector of the training dataset of MA
    Show All C. Data Generation - Second Layer The second layer of the proposed framework
    consists of a fully-connected NN equivalent to the following nonlinear function:
    m A : R 3 → R 1 View Source The inputs to model MA are the one-step-ahead predictions
    of the system output made by M1, M2 and M3, while the output is the actual system
    output prediction. Under the objective of predicting the system output over the
    entire operating range of interest, the training dataset of MA covers the entire
    operating range. A section of the training dataset including 100000 points is
    presented in Figure 4, where the input signal and the corresponding output trajectories
    without and with white noise added are shown. Compared to those used for sub-models
    training, this dataset spans all the sub-operating regions with more aggressive
    dynamics. Note that an impulse irrigation signal is used to provide a more aggressive
    output response that varies in a larger operating range, which is desired for
    MA training. Similar to that discussed in the previous section, reconstruction
    and scaling is done for this dataset. Following the pre-treatment, the dataset
    is fed to the pre-identified sub-models. The predictions made by the sub-models
    are collected, which are the designed inputs for MA and are used to train MA.
    SECTION IV. Model Validation The prediction performance of the proposed framework
    is validated in this section. The sub-models are validated first in IV-A. The
    proposed framework is then compared with a single LSTM in IV-B. The maximum number
    of prediction steps of step is N = 20 for this work. A. First Layer The multi-step-ahead
    prediction performances of M 1 − M 3 are presented in this section. Validation
    datasets are obtained in similar manners as the training datasets. 20% white noise
    is added to the system output of the validation data, which helps to test the
    performance of the models. At any given time step, noise-treated system input-output
    data are fed to the model for one-step-ahead prediction. Starting from the second
    step, the prediction made by the model at the previous step will be used as the
    initial condition of the current step. This procedure is repeated 20 times, providing
    twenty-steps-ahead predictions. TABLE II NRMSE of Multi-Step-Ahead-Predictions
    of the Sub-Models Table II summarizes the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE)
    of the multi-step-ahead predictions in the desired operating range of each model.
    The NRMSE is defined as follows: NRMSE=( y max − y min ) −1 ∑ t f i=1 ( y act
    (i)− y pred (i) ) 2 t f − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (8) View Source
    where tf is the total number of validation data points, yact and ypred are the
    true and predicted system outputs respectively. Figures 5, 6, and 7 present the
    multi-step-ahead open-loop prediction performance of M1, M2, and M3 respectively.
    In all three figures, the black curves represent the actual output trajectories.
    The solid blue curves, dash-dotted red curves, and dashed yellow curves are the
    single-step-ahead, ten-step-ahead, and twenty-step-ahead predictions respectively.
    All three models provide reasonable multi-step-ahead prediction without delays
    in the presence of noise. For M1, small prediction offsets can be observed in
    Figure 5 when the value of the system output is low. Figure 6 shows only some
    minor offsets exist at the local extremes for M2. For both M1 and M2, the effect
    of noise seems to be minor. In Figure 7, the noise has a stronger impact on the
    single-step-ahead prediction especially when the output converge to steady-states.
    As the number of prediction steps increases, the effect of the noise deviates
    and becomes insignificant. Similar to M1 and M2, M3 also has some minor offsets
    at the local extremes. For different operating ranges, the system output dynamics
    are different. When the soil moisture content and the irrigation rate is low,
    the system does not have obvious steady-states (Figure 5). As the operating range
    shifts to the higher magnitude side, the soil moisture content tends to saturate
    to steady-states (Figure 7). B. The Proposed Framework The multi-step-ahead prediction
    performance of the proposed framework is investigated in this section, where an
    LSTM is used as the benchmark approximation model. The same validation dataset
    is used to compare the performance of the two approximation approaches, which
    spans the entire operating range of interest. Figure 8 and 9 present the open-loop
    prediction trajectory of the system output based on the benchmark LSTM and the
    proposed framework respectively. The single-step-ahead, ten-step-ahead, and twenty-step-ahead
    predictions are presented in each Figure with the same line style as introduced
    in the previous section. The NRMSE values under the two cases and the percentage
    difference △ between them are summarized in table III. The percentage difference
    is calculated with respect to the NRMSE of the benchmark LSTM: Δ= NRMS E LSTM

    performance of the 2-layer NN framework. Show All TABLE III NRMSE of Multi-Step-Ahead-Predictions
    of the NN Models As presented in Figure 8, the LSTM can respond to sharp changes
    efficiently without delays. However, significant offsets are observed at the local
    minimums and the local maximums with larger magnitudes. A small section of the
    trajectories is amplified, which can be seen on the top-right corner of Figure
    8. In the zoomed-in plot, significant offsets can be observed in both the local
    maximum and the minimum. Better prediction performance is observed in Figure 9.
    To be specific, the proposed 2-layer framework can capture the dynamics at the
    local minimums much better compared to the LSTM. From the zoomed-in window on
    the top right, it can be observed that the predictions of the local minimum and
    maximum are more accurate compared to the LSTM. Table III indicates matching results,
    showing that the NRMSE values of the proposed framework are significantly lower
    than that obtained with the LSTM for all number of prediction steps. The improvement
    of the proposed framework is more significant when the number of prediction steps
    is low and slowly reduces as the prediction steps increase. It is noticed that
    the proposed framework cannot accurately approximate the local maximums with larger
    magnitudes. To account for this problem, we introduce a bias-and-scale-updated
    model to capture the plant-model-mismatch, of which the details are provided in
    the following section. SECTION V. Plant-Model-Missmatch Correction To capture
    the plant-model-missmatch, two correction approaches are investigated based on
    the proposed 2-layer NN framework. The first approach is to add a simple bias
    term b1 based on the prediction error: y act = C 1 ( y pred )=ypred+ b 1 (9) View
    Source The second approach is to fit a first order linear model that maps the
    predicted output to the actual measurement: y act = C 2 ( y pred )=a.ypred+ b
    2 (10) View Source where a and b2 are parameters to be identified. The parameters
    are updated at a certain frequency for both approaches. In the following subsections,
    the detailed updating policies of the two approaches are first introduced, followed
    by results comparison. A. Single Bias Term The step-by-step updating policy of
    the bias term b1 is summarized as follows: Determine the updating frequency fu
    of the parameter. Note that fu should be a divisor of N. Initialize time t = 1.
    Provide the initial condition N N in (t) to the 2-layer NN framework. Initialize
    b1 with some guess. Here b 1 =0 is used. Initialize the step counter i=1 , y pred
    (0)= y act (t) Simulate the 2-layer NN framework and record the prediction y pred
    (i) . Pass the raw prediction through the correction model C1: y ^ pred (i)= y
    pred (i)+ b 1 View Source Save the prediction error η(i) . Note that yact is obtained
    by simulating the discretized Richards equation ahead of time. η(i)= y act (t+i)−
    y ^ pred (i) View Source Update i=i+1 . If i is divisible by fu, update b1: b
    1 = 1 f u ∑ j=i− f u +1 i η(j) View Source If i<N , update t=t+1 . Return to step
    3. Terminate when t> t f , where tf is the total number of data available. B.
    Linear Model The step-by-step updating policy of the linear model parameters a
    and b2 is summarized as follows: Determine the updating frequency fu. Note that
    fu should be a divisor of N. Initialize time t = 1. Provide the initial condition
    N N in (t) to the 2-layer NN framework. Initialize a and b2 with some guess. Here
    a=1 , b 2 =0 is used. Initialize the step counter i=1 , y pred (0)= y act (t)
    Simulate the 2-layer NN framework and record the prediction y pred (i) . Pass
    the raw prediction y pred (i) through the correction model C2 and save y ^ pred
    (i) : y ^ pred (i)=a⋅ y pred (i)+ b 2 View Source Update i=i+1 . If i is divisible
    by fu, update a and b2 by solving the following optimization problem: min a, b
    2 ∑ i− f u +1 i [ y act (t+j)−(a⋅ y ^ pred (j)+ b 2 )] (11a) View Source a∈A (11b)
    View Source b 2 ∈B (11c) View Source where (11b-11c) are constraints on the parameters,
    A and B are compact sets. If i > N, update t = t + 1. Return to step 3.. Terminate
    when t> t f , where tf is the total number of data available. Note that to find
    a and b2, an optimization problem is solved such that a and b2 are bounded in
    a reasonable range. The optimization problem is solved in Python using CasADi
    [15]. TABLE IV Performance of the Mismatch Correction Approach In Terms of Average
    Absolute Error C. Results Comparison Recall the prediction horizon of interest
    N = 20. Thus updating frequencies f = 1,2,5,10 are tested and compared, of which
    the results are summarized in table IV. The performance is measured using the
    average absolute prediction error vmm: v mm = 1 N⋅ t f ∑ t f ∑ N | y act − y ^
    pred | View Source where the same definitions are kept for all variables. For
    f = 5, 10, the single-bias correction approach leads to more significant errors
    and is not applicable. The linear model correction shows very minor performance
    improvements. When f = 2, similar improvements in the prediction performance are
    observed in both approaches. When f = 1, the single bias correction performs similarly
    as when f = 2. For the linear model correction, f = 1 is not applicable. Considering
    the computational complexity of the two approaches, the single bias correction
    with f = 2 is selected. SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Works In this work,
    motivated by the impractical computational cost of first-principle-based advanced
    control, a data-driven 2-layer NN framework is proposed to approximate the complex
    nonlinear dynamics of the agro-hydrological system. The proposed framework is
    shown to have satisfactory open-loop prediction performance which outperforms
    a benchmark LSTM model. In future works, the advanced control of the proposed-framework
    in the presence of noise and weather disturbances will be investigated. Authors

    Water is an essential Common Pool Resource (CPR) that is important for life on
    earth and sustains agriculture for human societies. Water scarcity and fluctuations
    are increasing in many parts of the world due to climate change, population and
    economic growth (Gleick, 2018; Distefano and Kelly, 2017). In recent years, water
    quality is deteriorating in several countries, causing a threat to food security
    in these countries and increasing concern for further water availability (Boyd,
    2019). It is, therefore, necessary that the existing water resources be distributed
    among users more efficiently. In the agriculture sector, the low profit and large
    losses of water have served as an argument for efficient agricultural water management.
    Irrigated agriculture now occupies 20% of the total cultivated land globally (FAO,
    2010). However, the feasibility of new irrigation projects to ensure food security
    is questionable, given the increasing agitation over the negative consequences
    of large infrastructures (dams, reservoirs), land losses due to salinization (Huang
    et al., 2018) and efficiency related paradoxes (Grafton et al., 2018). Reforms
    in water related policies are considered one of the most effective instruments
    available to enhance water-efficiency (Johansson et al., 2002). In this context,
    the Nobel prize winner Elinor Ostrom has identified concrete design principals
    to craft institutions for long-enduring irrigation systems which include monitoring
    and efficient allocation of water (Ostrom, 1993). Therefore, among the many different
    aspects of an irrigation system, water allocation related policies are essential.
    During the last decade, the farming sector has seen the introduction of sensing
    and control technologies that have the potential to improve the information accessibility
    of farmers leading towards efficient use of water resources (Galioto et al., 2020).
    Lack of use of information and communication-based technologies in the agriculture
    sector is a major problem as it increases pressure on water resources and contributes
    to unsustainable agricultural practices due to uncertain information environment
    (Nakasone and Torero, 2016). The information led technologies and value of information
    concepts have been used in numerous fields, e.g., engineering, economics, medicine
    and finance, but this concept has seldom been used in the agriculture sector (Galioto
    et al., 2020). Here, we leverage the availability of such technologies to formulate
    a water allocation mechanism. In this mechanism, users make decisions using information
    provided by ICT based sensing technologies. The allocation of water and the objectives
    of water related policies can be obtained through several allocation mechanisms.
    Water distribution mechanisms range from fully centralized control by the government
    to completely decentralized water markets (Dinar et al., 2015). Past literature
    that investigates water allocation and pricing mechanisms worldwide include (Dinar
    and Subramanian, 1998; Jones, 2000; Johansson et al., 2002; Tsur et al., 2004a,
    Tsur et al., 2004b; Dinar and Mody, 2004; Molle and Berkoff, 2007). These studies
    compare the efficiency among different water allocation and pricing mechanisms
    and compare the experiences and policies in the global setting. The conclusion
    of these and other related studies is that no single type of water allocation
    and pricing mechanism is optimal in all contexts. Therefore, there is no best
    practice that can be suggested to one country or region (Dinar et al., 2015).
    Water users in various countries and regions face different problems and needs
    for water allocation and pricing mechanisms. Furthermore, future water scarcity
    produced by climate change will most likely lead to different water allocation
    and pricing needs than those addressed by the mechanisms used in the past. Water
    markets with well-defined, tradable rights have been proposed in many studies
    to manage demand and supply-side fluctuations (Meran et al., 2021). Some studies
    suggest that when water is traded instead of being distributed in a fixed way,
    the sustainability of the water resource and equity in the system are improved
    (Prieto, 2021; Bithas, 2008; Bakker, 2001). In this spirit, some countries have
    now institutionalized water markets. Water markets take both demand-side and supply-side
    measurements into account to increase water use efficiency and to handle drought-like
    situations. Australia has set up the biggest water market in the world, which
    is being used extensively to transfer water amongst users in the Murray-Darling
    Basin (Quiggin et al., 2010; Grafton et al., 2014). Similarly, water markets are
    also operational in Colorado and California, USA. For water markets to work properly,
    clearly defined private water rights are essential (Murphy et al., 2009; Bakker,
    2011). Water markets usually reward those who participate in trade but do not
    consider the spillover effects of the trade on individuals outside the market
    itself, so a specific procedure for the compensation of these individuals needs
    to be introduced (Ostrom, 1993). In developing economies such as Pakistan, this
    implies that water markets may lead towards further inequity and advantage of
    influential users. In fact, informal water markets that already exist in Pakistan
    are known to be exploitative and unfair (Razzaq et al., 2019; van Steenbergen
    and Oliemans, 2002). Therefore, instead of trading water between individuals,
    we consider a system in which water is allocated by a central planner or a regulator
    to meet individual demands while maximizing social welfare. The central planner
    (called in this paper as the principal-agent) also determines a fair cost using
    a type of auction-based pricing mechanism. This is only possible in a closed-loop
    system in which principal-agent take into account the actual water demand while
    allocating water among the users. Currently, large irrigation networks around
    the world, such as the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) in Pakistan, are managed
    as open-loop systems (Cantoni et al., 2007). An open-loop Agricultural Water Management
    (AWM) system does not take into account the actual on-farm crop water demand.
    In IBIS, water is distributed at the canal command level using a strictly followed
    rotational roster scheme, introduced under British colonial rule, locally known
    as warabandi (Anwar et al., 2016). During a rotation cycle, each farmer receives
    water in fixed turns. Under this supply-based water distribution mechanism, each
    farmer gets a fixed amount of water depending upon its farm size (Shah et al.,
    2016). This differs strikingly from demand-based allocation mechanisms where water
    is supplied to farmers according to their demand (Siddiqi and Wescoat, 2013).
    Finally, irrigation systems are also complex socio-ecological systems in which
    human behavior plays a significant role in mediating fair allocations (Konar et
    al., 2019). Therefore, the objective of timely water delivery to varying crop
    water demands can not be met by a rigid open-loop supply-driven system. Here,
    we present a demand-driven closed-loop system which takes the actual on farm demand
    into account. In what follows, we present a systems theory (mechanism design)
    based approach to improve the overall agricultural productivity by designing a
    system-level policy for an efficient and fair distribution of surface water at
    the farm level. The demand-based water allocation scheme for the irrigation system
    is enabled using economic interventions and sensor technology. The allocation
    is coupled with an auction-based pricing mechanism. A case study, that is based
    over data sets taken from real field surveys is presented for validation of the
    proposed mechanism. Our results suggest that under certain realistic assumptions,
    the proposed mechanism helps decrease groundwater pumping and conserve surface
    water. In the process, we have proposed a pricing scheme for the IBIS in which
    undervaluing of water is a primary issue (Akram, 2013). It is important to note
    that although the proposed scheme sets a price for the water, the intention is
    not to maximize revenue of the central planner, but to ensure productive use of
    surface water in a socially efficient manner. In the proposed approach, the demand
    can be met using surface water from an irrigation canal network regulated by a
    principal-agent such as a regulatory authority. In the face of a shortage, the
    farmers resort to expensive pumping of non-renewable groundwater to meet their
    demand. A cropping season is divided into equal slots of fixed duration. At the
    beginning of each time slot, the principal-agent solicits the valuations of the
    farmers and sorts the bids received from the users in decreasing order and starts
    fulfilling the demands from the top. The central planner uses Vickrey Clarke Groves
    (VCG) mechanism to compute the payments (Vickrey, 1961; Clarke, 1971; Groves et
    al., 1973). The VCG designs payments in a way that motivates users to reveal their
    true valuation, i.e., no benefit can be gained by misreporting (Varian and Harris,
    2014; Nisan and Ronen, 2007). Social equity in water allocation is most easy to
    ensure via a central planner (Tedesco et al., 2016), but the central planner needs
    true water demands to allocate water in equitable manner. Since VCG promotes true
    valuation, it compels farmers to quantify their demands. Thus, this is a step
    towards an effective demand based allocation system. The remainder of the paper
    is divided into the following sections. Section 2 presents the irrigation model,
    farm demand dynamics and warabandi distribution mechanism in IBIS. Section 3 outlines
    the proposed water distribution and pricing mechanism. Section 4 explains the
    case study site and the Monte-Carlo simulation for comparison between the warabandi
    mechanism and the proposed distribution mechanism. The discussion on Monte-Carlo
    simulation is in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6. 2. System model & dynamics
    In this section we first describe the Indus basin irrigation system in which we
    evaluate our framework. The water is supplied to the farms in the IBIS using a
    supply-based allocation mechanism. The amount of water required at a farm depends
    upon soil moisture needs of the farm and cannot be serviced by supply-based water
    allocation mechanism. Next, we discuss the farm water demand dynamics, followed
    by the discussion on currently practiced warabandi water allocation system in
    IBIS. 2.1. Irrigation system Large irrigation systems provide water to the agricultural
    lands through a large network of canals. In the Indus basin irrigation system
    (IBIS), link canals transfer water from one river to another. Main (primary) canals
    take water directly from rivers, dams, or reservoirs. Branch canal is also a type
    of the main canal. Distributary (secondary) canals draw water from the main canals
    to feed minor (tertiary) canals. Minor canals feed water to watercourses. Watercourses
    are known as \"Khalas\" in the local language. Watercourses can directly take
    water from main canals or distributary canals. The farmers take water for their
    farms directly from the watercourses. Multiple farmers draw water from a single
    watercourse. We assume there are N farms sharing a watercourse. A schematic diagram

    Farm water demand The farm water demand depends upon soil moisture level of the
    farm. The soil moisture level is defined as a percentage ratio of the volume of
    absorbed water to the total volume of the soil sample under observation. Water
    is applied to keep the soil moisture at a certain level so that the crop does
    not go under stress. As part of the water pricing and distribution mechanism (to
    be discussed in the next section), we assume that soil moisture measurement is
    available at each farm. 2.2.1. Soil moisture dynamics Now, we discuss the soil
    moisture dynamics of a farm. The soil moisture level is the ratio between the
    absorbed water volume and the total soil volume under consideration. The soil
    moisture level depends upon inflows from surface water irrigation, ground water
    pumping, rainfall, crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation. The soil moisture
    level for farm n at time t is given by θk(t) where n ∈ {1, 2, 3. . . . . . . N}.
    To avoid under and over irrigation, the soil moisture level must stay within a
    pre-defined range which depends upon soil properties. This range is specified
    using upper and lower soil moisture level thresholds represented by and respectively,
    with . A moisture level above can hinder plant growth and production, due to the
    seepage of the necessary nutrients below the root zone. A moisture level below
    applies stress to the crop, as in this case the plant has to draw water from a
    larger depth. To get the maximum yield, The farmer n has to retain soil moisture
    level θn(t) within the interval . The soil moisture dynamics of a farm are given
    as follows (1) We adopt this model from Lozoya et al. (2014). In practice, farmers
    employ different affordable technologies to directly measure the soil moisture
    content. However, to obtain the progression of water demand, we use the water
    balance Equation 1 to simulate the dynamics of the soil moisture level. In(t)≥ 0
    is the water inflow through surface water irrigation or ground water pumping,
    Rn(t)≥ 0 is the rain, En(t)≥ 0 is the rate of water loss to crop evapotranspiration
    and Dn(t)≥ 0 is the rate of water loss to deep percolation (more details about
    these terms are discussed by Allen et al. (1998). The scope of water balance models
    ranges from the global water cycle to soil moisture trends at the plant root level
    (Hussain, 2019). Furthermore, water balance models are developed for varying complexity
    levels and different time scales, e.g., yearly, monthly, daily and hourly (McCabe
    and Markstrom, 2007). These models are used for many water-related applications
    such as water supply, water allocation, flood estimation, and waste water management
    (Boughton, 2005). Crop evapotranpiration is calculated by multiplying the reference
    evapotranpirtion ET0(t) with crop coefficient Kc(t). Relationship of crop evapotranpiration
    En(t) with crop coefficient and reference crop evapotranpiration is given as follows
    (2) The deep percolation rate depends upon soil moisture level, when soil moisture
    level increases, the percolation rate also increases due to the action of differential
    pressure (Ooi et al., 2008). Conversely, the percolation rate decreases as the
    moisture level decreases. This effect leads towards the proportional relationship
    between the soil moisture level and deep percolation. This proportional relationship
    is used by several other studies including Lozoya et al., 2016, Lozoya et al.,
    2014, Saleem et al. (2013), Maheswararajah et al. (2011). Therefore, we assume
    that the deep percolation rate is proportional to the soil moisture level, i.e.,
    D(t) = cnθn(t), where cn≥ 0 is a deep percolation constant. Now, the updated soil
    moisture equation is as follows (3) In this model, θn(t) ∈ [0,1] ∀ t covers the
    entire physically realizable range of the moisture level. Fig. 2 represents an
    illustrative trajectory of soil moisture level for a farm. The upward spikes represent
    the application of water through surface irrigation, groundwater pumping, or rain.
    When no water is applied, the soil moisture level decays due to evapotranspiration
    and deep percolation. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download : Download

    2.2.2. Water demand model Each farm n’s instantaneous water demand is proportional
    to the farm size An, irrigation depth ln and difference between soil moisture
    level and maximum soil moisture level threshold which is represented by . The
    factor shows the required increase in soil moisture level to keep moisture at
    the optimal level. We represent the water demand of a farm n with dn(t), which
    can be calculated with the following equation (4) where β ≥ 1 is the irrigation
    coefficient. β = 1 means irrigation efficiency is 100%, the higher values of β
    represents the irrigation inefficiency. We assume that water demand is fulfilled
    either through surface water or groundwater. Water is applied to the farm either
    when surface water is available or when the soil moisture level θn(t) reaches
    the minimum moisture level threshold i.e, . In the former case, the farmer has
    to pump groundwater to satisfy demand. We assume groundwater is in abundance and
    the farmers can pump water according to their demand. Next, we explain the water
    distribution mechanism practiced in the IBIS for more than a century, followed
    by our proposed water distribution mechanism. 2.3. Warabandi water distribution
    system Water allocations in IBIS occur at three different levels: at the reservoir
    (source or river); among the main and distributary canals; and among the farms
    at the watercourse level. In this paper, we will discuss water allocation mechanism
    at watercourse level because the central planner and user’s interaction occurs
    at this level. The mechanism of distributing water among farms along watercourses
    is known as warabandi (Wescoat et al., 2018). It is a water distribution mechanism
    introduced in 1873 to distribute water among water users in the old Punjab of
    present-day Southeast Pakistan and Northwest India. Under this mechanism, water
    is divided among water users based on their farm size, i.e., the proportion to
    their land. In this mechanism, each season is divided into cycles of fixed duration.
    Each cycle is of 7 days ( in some cases days) and during each cycle, each farmer
    gets a fixed amount of water. The value of unit irrigation time tu is the same
    for all farmers. The unit irrigation time tu in hours per acre and a farmer’s
    turn time tt for a weekly warabandi roster are as follows (5) where C is the cultivable
    command area of the watercourse, i.e, the area that can be cultivated in the command
    area, is the total \"filling time\", is the \"draining time\" and An is the farm
    size (Zardari and Cordery, 2010; Bandaragoda, 1998). Filling time (or \"Khal bharai\"
    in local jargon) corresponds to the delay taken by the flow to fill the part of
    the watercourse directing towards the farm. Draining time (or \"Nikal\" in local
    language) is the time for which a farm may keep getting water from the watercourse
    even when it is closed upstream and is diverted to the other farm. A farmer’s
    turn time can be converted into water volume received by the farmer by multiplying
    turn time with watercourse discharge capacity. In the warabandi system, water
    supply is conventionally determined as explained and does not take into account
    the actual on-farm water demand. If a farmer receives water less than on-farm
    water demand, the farmer either has to face low yield or invest in pumping groundwater.
    Water in the surplus of demand is unproductive and wasted in the form of run-off.
    In what follows, we propose a demand-based water distribution mechanism instead
    of distributing water in pre-determined order to address precisely this inefficient
    water distribution issue. 3. The demand-based water distribution mechanism Here,
    we outline the framework for our proposed mechanism. In the proposed approach,
    each farmer is interested in buying a shared resource, i.e., surface water. The
    shared resource is regulated by a central planner or principal agent. The entire
    season is divided into intervals of fixed duration T. The interval T represents
    the time between subsequent irrigation decisions by farmers and the k’th interval
    is ((k − 1)T, kT], where k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . . . . }. At the beginning of each
    interval, the principal-agent solicits the valuations and demands of the players
    regarding the shared resource. Then based on the valuations and demands received
    by the principal and the availability of the shared resource, the resource is
    distributed among the farmers. In this section first we explain the bidding process
    from farmers’ perspective. Next, we discuss the water allocation and pricing done
    by the principal agent. 3.1. The bidding process At the start of each time interval
    k, the principal-agent asks the farmers for their valuation. Based on their valuations,
    the farmers bid how much they value surface water during that time slot. The bid
    of farmer n is bn(Tk) and it includes how many units of water she needs and the
    price per unit of surface water that she is willing to pay. For simplicity we
    use the shorthand notation bn(k) to represent bn(kT) (similarly for other functions
    as well). Thus bn(k) is a pair, i.e., , where is how much farmer n claims to value
    a unit of surface water and dn(k) is the demand. For farmer n, the demand function
    dn(k) is the amount of water required in k’th interval. If this demand is not
    satisfied with the surface water, farmer n will pump ground water to satisfy demand
    when moisture level θn(k) is less than the minimum moisture level threshold ,
    i.e, . The farmer can pump groundwater anywhere in the interval k whereas surface
    water is available to the farmers at the start of each interval k. The actual
    valuation vn(k) of farmer n for surface water depends upon a number of factors
    that include groundwater pumping cost Cg (Knapp et al., 2018), current water demand
    dn(k) of the farm (Mallios and Latinopoulos, 2001) and farm size An (Tang et al.,
    2013). The valuation for farmer n at interval k is given as follows (6) It is
    important to note that vn(k) does not represent the actual bid of the farmer which
    may be different. 3.2. Water allocation and pricing After receiving the bids from
    all farmers, the principal-agent decides how to divide water among the farmers
    and how much each farmer needs to pay for the water they receive. Here, we explain
    the water allocation followed by a discussion on water pricing. 3.2.1. Water allocation
    To decide regarding the distribution of water, the principal-agent evaluates each
    farmer’s willingness to pay pn(k) for water by computing (7) Next, the principal
    orders the bids received from the farmers such that the highest bidder receives
    water with first priority. Next, if there is still water left, the principal-agent
    provides water to the second highest bidder and this continues until all the surface
    water is divided among the farmers. Since the supply of surface water is variable
    and depends on a variety of parameters that include rainfall, water supply from
    glacier melt, governmental policies etc, how many farmers actually receive water
    in k’th interval cannot be known in advance. The water distribution decision by
    the principal-agent is represented by D(k) = [D1(k), D2(k), . . . . , DN(k)].
    Based on the defined water distribution mechanism, farmer n receives Dn(k) units
    of water in the k’th interval, such that Smin≤Dn(k)≤dn(k). represents the minimum
    required amount of water flow in the watercourse to ensure water supply to a farmer.
    The utility of farmer n in k’th interval is un(k), which is thus given as (8)
    where the factor dn(k) − Dn(k) is the unmet demand which farmer will have to meet
    by pumping groundwater if she does not receive the required amount of surface
    water from the principal. 3.2.2. Water pricing To compute the surface water payments
    of farmers, the VCG (Vickrey Clarke Groves) mechanism is used, we represent the
    payments by . To calculate payments based on VCG mechanism, the principal-agent
    computes D(k) and D−n(k) for each farmer n, where D(k) is the social decision
    vector by principal, i.e., how much surface water each farmer was allocated in
    k’th interval and D−n(k) is the hypothetical social decision vector, i.e., how
    much water would have been allocated to each farmer if farmer n did not participate
    in the bidding process. Next, the payment of each farmer n in k’th interval is
    computed as follows (9) Payment of a farmer n in 9 is the difference between social
    utilities of other farmers in the absence of farmer n and social utilities of
    other farmers in the presence of farmer n. This method of computing payments takes
    into account the social impact of a farmer participation in the bidding process.
    Note that in the bidding, if Dn(k) = 0, i.e., a farmer n who did not receive surface
    water in k’th interval will not have to pay. Next, we explain the payments for
    farmers who receive surface water in the interval k. A farmers’ payment is according
    to her social impact on other farmers as it depends upon other farmers bid. Let
    n1, n2, ⋯ , no is an indexing of farmers such that , where is willingness to pay
    for water as defined in 7. This indexing classifies the farmers in the decreasing
    order of priority to get a portion of water from the available surface water supply.
    Let the surface water supply be such that the first m farmers in the decreasing
    order of priority receive water, i.e., for 1 ≤l≤m. The water allocation mechanism
    and the decision D(k) by the principal-agent makes sure that the water demand
    of the first m − 1 farmers is fully satisfied and farmer nm receives a portion
    of surface water which is less than her total demand, i.e., (10) where is the
    surface water received by the farmer nm such that . To calculate the payment of
    the farmer nl, we need to determine . Among the m farmers getting water in the
    k’th interval, the bid of farmer nl will only influence the farmer nm whose water
    demand was not fully satisfied. The farmers n1, ⋯ , nl−1, nl+1, ⋯ , nm−1 will
    yet receive surface water equal to their demand whether nl participates in the
    bidding process or not. Thus, (11) for all j ∈ {1, …, i − 1, i + 1, …, m − 1}.
    If farmer nl did not take part in the bidding, extra units of surface water are
    available for other farmers. Therefore, the amount of surface water received by
    farmer nm will certainly increase. Let represent the quantity of surface water
    received by farmer nm if farmer nl did not take part in the bidding. Then, (12)
    Thus, if is adequate then the water demand of farmer nm will be entirely fulfilled.
    Furthermore, if , then farmers who did not initially receive water may obtain
    water. Let the quantity be adequate to not only fulfil the water demand of farmer
    nm but p extra farmers as well, i.e., nm+1, nm+2, ⋯ nm+p also receive water. In
    the case in which farmer nl did not take part in the bidding, the utilities of
    farmers nm, km+1, ⋯ nm+p will increased. Thus, the payment for farmer nl will
    be as follows (13) 4. Results In this section, we present a case study to compare
    the performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism with the warabandi
    distribution mechanism practiced conventionally in the IBIS. We use the past data
    to form initial models of soil moisture dynamics. Next, we incorporate the collected
    data in our pricing and allocation scheme to compared it with the currently used
    water distribution mechanisms in the study region in particular and the Indus
    Basin Irrigation System in general. First, we evaluate performance for nominal
    parameters in the case study area followed by exhaustive numerical simulations
    to compare both water distribution mechanisms over the physically realizable range
    of parameters. We find that the proposed distribution mechanism performs better
    than the round-robin warabandi system in terms of surface water use and groundwater
    pumping. 4.1. Study area Area irrigated by watercourse 91093/L located at Moza
    joyia, in central Punjab, Pakistan, is chosen as the case study site, as shown

    Punjab, Pakistan. It draws water from the Balloki barrage located on river Ravi.
    The Ravi river is a 720 km long trans-boundary river that passes through eastern
    Pakistan after crossing northwestern India. It is one of the major rivers of the

    of model parameters In this section, we discuss the methods, equations, and data
    resources used to compare performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism
    with the warabandi distribution mechanism. First, we discuss the parameters used
    to calculate the soil moisture dynamics, which include crop coefficients, reference
    evapotranspiration, deep percolation constant, maximum and minimum soil moisture
    threshold, and precipitation. At the end, we explain the irrigation depth, which
    is used to measure farm water demand. 4.2.1. Crop coefficient Crop coefficient
    Kc(t) is used in calculating evapotranpirtion as shown in equation 2. Several
    studies (ElGhandour et al., 2019; Jayanthi et al., 2001; Irmak et al., 2011) show
    that remote sensing based techniques can be used to measure crop coefficient.
    Crop coefficient Kc(t) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI(t)) have
    a linear relationship (Trout and Johnson, 2007; D’Urso, 2010). A simple linear
    relationship between Kc(t) and NDVI(t) is as follows: (14) We adopt this model
    from Kamble et al. (2013). We have used the time series SENTINEL-2 10 m × 10 m
    resolution data to derive NDVI(t). Near-infrared and red bands of the data are
    used to measure NDVI(t). The NDVI(t) is given by: (15) where R is the reflectance
    in the red and NIR is the reflectance in the near infrared region of the spectrum.
    Data was collected from July 2018 to October 2018. During this time period at
    different time steps, the crop coefficient in our study area is shown in Fig.
    5. The average crop coefficient at the start of the season is low, representing
    less vegetation and crop coefficient values. In September, high crop coefficient
    values show the high cropping intensity in the area. Near the end of the season,
    crop coefficient values start gradually decreasing, which shows harvesting of
    the crop. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    services (USGS, 2020b). The spatial resolution of the data is 1 km × 1 km. There
    are five pixels of Reference evapotranspiration ETo(t) data that overlap with
    our study area. The pixel area overlapping with our study area is shown in Fig.

    evapotranspiration in equation 2 is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranpiration
    ET0(t) with crop coefficient Kc(t). The spatial resolution of crop coefficient
    Kc(t) is 10 m × 10 m. In order to match the spatial resolution of Kc(t) and ET0(t),
    we have assumed that reference evapotranspiration ETo(t) value is the same for
    all 10 m × 10 m pixel which are part of a 1 km × 1 km pixel of ETo(t). Hence,
    the crop evapotranspiration En(t) spatial resolution is 10 m × 10 m. 4.2.3. Precipitation
    Precipitation Rn(t) data was collected from the data portal developed by the Center
    for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (CHRS, 2020a). We have used data with
    daily temporal resolution and its spatial resolution is 4 km × 4 km. The rainfall

    We have installed a soil moisture sensor in our study area. Data coming from this
    sensor is used to calculate the deep percolation constant cn at this point in
    the study area. The cn value at this point in the study area is 0.15 × 10−4. Deep
    percolation constant depends upon soil type. We have assumed a small random variation
    in the calculated value measured from the installed sensor, to calculate the deep
    percolation constant values at other farms. The deep percolation constant value
    for each farm is selected from the range [0.5 × 104, 2 × 104] using a uniform
    random distribution and this range covers almost all types of soils in the study
    area. 4.2.5. Irrigation depth Irrigation depth ln is used to calculate water demand
    of a farm as shown in equation 4. It depends upon the soil type and root depth
    of the crop. Soil type in our study area is loamy. Major crops in our case study
    area are alfalfa, maize, cotton, sugarcane, sorghum, potatoes and wheat. These
    type of crops have deep rooting zone. We estimate the irrigation depth using a
    method described by Brouwer et al. (1989). Estimated irrigation depth in our case
    study area is 100 mm. 4.3. Simulation In this section, we compare the performance
    of the proposed water distribution mechanism with traditional warabandi distribution
    mechanism in our study area. We assess performance of the proposed mechanism based
    on the amount of extra groundwater pumped and the amount of surface water wasted.
    Our goal is to compare both mechanisms over physically realizable range of parameters.
    Before presenting the results of Monte-Carlo simulation, first we illustrate the
    results with nominal parameters, then we present the Monte-Carlo simulation. In
    the end, we present interesting cases from Monte-Carlo simulations. 4.3.1. Simulation
    setup There are a total of twenty-four farmers, i.e., N = 24. We evaluate performance
    for a single cropping season of approximately four months (July 2018 to October
    2018) and seventeen weeks. The maximum and minimum moisture level threshold depends
    upon the soil type. The study area is small and the soil type is the same throughout
    the area. We assume constant maximum and minimum moisture level thresholds so
    that and respectively for all farms. The initial condition θn(0) for each farm
    is randomly chosen from the interval [0.10, 0.25] using a uniform random distribution.
    The design capacity of the study area watercourse is not available. We assume
    that study area watercourse design capacity is equivalent to the design capacity
    of the watercourse adjacent to our study area as area irrigated by both watercourses
    is approximately equal.The design capacity of the adjacent watercourse is 1.6 × 106
    cusec/week (On Farm Water Management, 2017). In Pakistan, the average canal efficiency
    is 75% (Frenken et al., 2012). Thus, only 75% of the watercourse design capacity
    water reaches the watercourse, i.e., 1.2 × 106 cusec/week. Under the proposed
    mechanism, each farmer computes the water demand and declares a bid at the start
    of each week. The farmers fulfill their water requirements through groundwater
    pumping if surface water is insufficient to meet their demand. The groundwater
    cost in our study area is Cg = 0.10 PKR. The farmers may also pump groundwater
    during the week if the soil moisture level θn(t) reaches the lower threshold ,
    i.e, . In the warabandi mechanism, the water is distributed among farmers using
    a roster shown in Table 2. This warabandi roster is rotational and repeats each
    week. 4.3.2. Performance evaluation for nominal parameters We evaluate surface
    water wasted, the difference in pumped water and the difference in cost incurred
    by farmers to compare the proposed mechanism with the warabandi mechanism for
    a nominal set of parameters. The surface water supply each week is shown in Fig.
    8. Each farm soil moisture level over the entire season is shown in Fig. 9. Water
    demand and the surface water received at the start of the week by each farmer
    when water is distributed through the proposed mechanism and warabandi mechanism
    are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 respectively. The surface water received and groundwater
    pumped in the proposed mechanism are shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download high-res

    In Figs. 10 and 11 water demand for all farmers in week 3 is almost zero. Water
    demand is zero in this week due to rain. Although water demand is zero in this
    week, farmers are receiving water in the warabandi mechanism. In the proposed
    mechanism, water is not being supplied to farmers with zero demand since water
    is provided to farmers depending upon their demand. In warabandi mechanism, farmers
    are receiving water irrespective of their demand. Farmers 1, 4 and 5 are receiving
    more water compared to other farmers in the proposed mechanism. Fig. 12 shows
    that farmer 1, 4 and 5 are not pumping groundwater throughout the season except
    in week 6. The soil moisture level of farmer 1, 4 and 5 reaches the minimum moisture
    threshold at the end of the week. Thus at the start of each week, their demand
    is higher and they bid for water at a higher price, consequently getting water
    at a high priority. All other farmers’ moisture level touches the minimum moisture
    level threshold during the week. Thus, all other farmers have to fulfill their
    demand during the week through groundwater pumping. Farmers cannot wait for the
    surface water supply at the start of the week as the surface water supply is uncertain
    in the study area. In the proposed mechanism, if a farmer’s water demand and per
    unit of water bidding price is small compared to other farmers, the farmer may
    not get water or get water less than the demand. For example, in week 12, farmer
    19’s water demand is less than other farmers, so she did not receive water that
    week. The surface water bidding price per acre and charged price per acre in PKR
    are shown in Fig. 13. The bidding price is always greater or equal to the charged
    price. Farmers are getting charges for surface water in week 1, 5, 7 and 12. Farmers
    are not getting charged for surface water when water available is greater than
    the total demand of all farmers because the procedure of farmer’s payment calculation
    considers the social impact of a farmer on other farmers. when water available
    is greater than the total water demand of all farmers, there is no social impact
    of a farmer on others. Download : Download high-res image (380KB) Download : Download

    water pumped, the difference in total surface water used and difference in total
    cost incurred by all farmers combined when water is distributed through warabandi
    distribution mechanism compared to proposed allocation mechanism in the study
    area. A positive difference in total water pumped indicates more pumping in the
    warabandi case. The difference is almost zero during a few weeks. Groundwater
    pumped is almost equal during these weeks in both distribution mechanism. Fig.
    14 also shows the difference in surface water used per week between the warabandi
    distribution mechanism and the proposed allocation mechanism. A positive difference
    indicates more water is being used in the warabandi mechanism compared to the
    proposed mechanism. In the warabandi distribution mechanism, if the water received
    is more than demand, farmers do not use extra surface water, resulting in wastage
    in the form of run-off. Farmers do not receive excess water in the proposed mechanism
    since water is supplied according to their demand. Download : Download high-res

    compared to the proposed mechanism. Fig. 14 also represents the weekly difference
    in the total cost incurred by all farmers combined between the warabandi distribution
    mechanism and proposed allocation mechanism. A positive difference indicates farmers
    are incurring more costs in the warabandi mechanism. A negative difference indicates
    more cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism. In the proposed mechanism,
    surface water price is always less than groundwater price since farmers’ willingness
    to pay for surface water is less or equal to groundwater price. In the warabandi
    mechanism, surface water price is a fixed one time cost in a season and is negligible
    compared to groundwater pumping price. The cost incurred by farmers in week 1,
    5, 7 and 12 is negative since surface water price in these weeks is non-zero.
    Surface water price is non-zero in week 1, 5, 7 and 12 for most of the farmers
    and zero during other weeks as shown in Fig. 13. In the proposed mechanism, the
    surface water payment for a farmer is non-zero when surface water is scarce, i.e.,
    the surface water supply is not enough to fulfill all farmers’ water demand. The
    proposed pricing mechanism charges farmers according to their social impact on
    others. It does not charge farmers when water is in abundance since water usage
    by a farmer does not affect water availability for other farmers. The positive
    cost difference in week 2, 6, 10, 13, 14 and 16 indicates that the groundwater
    pumping cost combined with surface water cost in the proposed mechanism is less
    than the groundwater pumping cost in the warabandi mechanism. It also suggests
    that more water is being pumped in the warabandi mechanism in these weeks. Zero
    difference means an equal amount of groundwater is being pumped and surface water
    cost in the proposed mechanism is zero. The comparison results indicate that the
    proposed mechanism performs much better than the warabandi mechanism in terms
    of water efficiency. Since less water is being pumped and there is no surface
    water wastage in the proposed mechanism. In the proposed mechanism, the weekly
    cost incurred by farmers is low compared to warabandi mechanism when farmers are
    pumping lower amount of water and surface water is enough to meet farmers demand.
    The cost incurred by farmers is higher in the proposed mechanism when surface
    water available is less than the total water demand of the farmers. 4.3.3. Monte-Carlo
    simulations Next, to compare both mechanisms over the physically realizable extent
    of the parameter space, we perform repetitive numerical simulations by randomly
    varying the model parameters over a range that impersonates real-world behavior.
    We analyze the difference in total water pumped, the difference in total surface
    water used and total difference in cost incurred to compare both mechanisms while
    randomly varying the surface water supply, deep percolation constant, crop coefficient
    and rain amount over the physically realizable range. The maximum available surface
    water in the study area watercourse is 1.6 × 106 cusec. Surface water supply range
    is [0, 1.6 × 106] cusec. The deep percolation constant ck range is [0.5 × 10−4,
    2 × 10−4] and this range covers almost all types of soils in our study area. The
    crop coefficient Kc(t) and reference evapotranspiration ETo(t) are chosen randomly
    from the data set given by Ullah et al. (2001) for the study area. The daily rain
    data of the past 21 years was obtained from data portal developed by NASA (Anon,
    2021). The daily rain in the simulation is chosen randomly from 21 given samples.
    The initial condition θk(0) for each farmer is chosen through uniform distribution
    over an interval [0.10, 0.25]. We have repeated these simulations 1 × 104 times.
    Fig. 15 shows the total difference in water pumped, the surface water used and
    cost incurred by farmers when water is distributed through warabandi mechanism
    compared to the proposed mechanism. The positive difference in water pumped represents
    that more water is being pumped in the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed
    mechanism. The average difference in pumped water is positive because farmers
    get water in the warabandi mechanism regardless of their demand. Farmers have
    to pump water if water received by a farmer is less than her demand to fulfill
    its water requirements. Therefore, on average, farmers have to pump more water
    in the warabandi mechanism than the proposed mechanism. The positive difference
    in surface water wasted shows that more water is being used in the warabandi mechanism
    than the proposed mechanism. In the warabandi mechanism, when the water received
    by a farmer is greater than her demand, the extra water gets wasted in the form
    of run-off. The negative difference in the total cost represents that farmers
    are incurring more costs in the proposed mechanism. In the proposed mechanism,
    the principal-agent charges farmers for surface water when water is scarce, while
    in the warabandi mechanism, farmers pay a negligible cost once in a season. Download

    The total difference in water pumped, the surface water used and the cost incurred
    by farmers in the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism. The
    general results of Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate a better performance through
    our approach but there are some anomalies. In the Monte-Carlo simulation, the
    difference in groundwater pumping is negative for a small number of cases. This
    negative difference represents more groundwater pumping in the proposed mechanism.
    The negative difference in cost shows more cost is being incurred in the proposed
    mechanism. These anomalies do not disaffirm the proposed mechanism, as we will
    explore these exceptions in the next section. 5. Discussion In this paper, we
    have compared the performance of the proposed mechanism with warabandi mechanism.
    We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism based on the amount of water
    pumped, amount of surface water wastage and cost incurred by farmers. In the Monte-Carlo
    simulation, the general conclusion about performance of the proposed mechanism
    holds for majority of the cases over the realistic parameter values. Despite these
    results, some exceptions exist, but these exceptions happen only in a minority
    of cases. Even in these minority of exceptions, less surface water is being used
    in the proposed mechanism. Groundwater pumping in the proposed mechanism compared
    to warabandi mechanism is higher in a minority of cases. For groundwater pumping,
    we explore the worst-case encountered in the Monte-Carlo simulation. In the worst-case,
    the total groundwater pumped difference is − 1.601 × 106 cusec throughout the
    season when water is distributed using the warabandi mechanism compared to the
    proposed mechanism. The negative sign represents more groundwater is being pumped
    in the proposed mechanism. In this case, farmers are pumping extra water in the
    proposed mechanism because the water demand is high and the surface water supply
    is scarce. The surface water supply is less than the demand in most of the weeks
    throughout the season, as shown in Fig. 17. In case of scarcity, the proposed
    mechanism provides water to the farmers who value it the most. Therefore, in case
    of scarcity, other farmers have to pump groundwater to fulfill their demand. Even
    in the worst case, the overall water usage (groundwater and surface water) is
    less in the proposed mechanism. The difference in water usage per week for this
    case is shown in Fig. 16. Farmers use less water (groundwater and surface water)
    throughout the season except in weeks 2,6,10 and 13. Overall, farmers are using
    less water in the proposed mechanism. Download : Download high-res image (114KB)

    the season when maximum groundwater is being pumped in the proposed mechanism
    compared to the warabandi mechanism. In the Monte-Carlo simulations, the cost
    incurred by farmers is greater most of the time in the proposed mechanism. This
    does not go against the intention of the proposed mechanism, which was fair pricing
    and allocation of water. Even then, a lot of cases occur with cost saving because
    the proposed mechanism does not charge for water when the water supply is greater
    than water demand and less groundwater pumping leads towards cost saving in the
    proposed mechanism. For cost incurred by farmers, we explore the worst-case encountered
    in the Monte-Carlo simulation. In the worst-case, the difference in the total
    cost incurred by farmers is − 8.56 × 105 PKR throughout the season when water
    is distributed using warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism. The
    negative sign represents that the higher cost is being incurred in the proposed
    mechanism. This higher cost in the proposed mechanism is because of the higher
    water demand compared to the surface water supply. For this case, the water demand
    and surface water supply throughout the season is given in the Fig. 18. The cost
    incurred by farmers is higher when the surface water supply is scarce. The proposed
    mechanism charges farmers when the surface water supply is scarce. Download :

    For the case when the maximum cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism
    compared to the warabandi mechanism. Our results show that the proposed mechanism
    leads to a more efficient utilization of surface water and a corresponding reduction
    in wastage. Similar effects have been observed in real-world cases (Naghdi et
    al., 2021; Kadi and Ziyad, 2018; Fu et al., 2018) where demand-based allocation
    schemes have led to better utilization of surface irrigation water. Groundwater
    depletion is posing threat to global food and water security (Famiglietti, 2014;
    Wada et al., 2010). We have demonstrated that the groundwater usage has reduced
    when surface water is distributed through the proposed mechanism. Similar results
    can be seen in studies (Zeinali et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2015) where efficient
    distribution of surface water led towards sustainable groundwater usage. Undervaluation
    of water has been a significant challenge in ensuring fairness in irrigation systems
    around the world (Du et al., 2010; Lahsen et al., 2016; Munguía-López et al.,
    2019). The second price auction that we propose has been shown to guarantee truthful
    valuation on behalf of the bidders (Easley et al., 2010) both in theory and in
    practical settings (Nisan and Ronen, 2007; Varian and Harris, 2014). Furthermore
    the VCG mechanism that lies at the heart of our approach ensures a fair pricing
    scheme by taking into account the social impact of a user on other users. VCG
    is widely used in other related settings as well (Hobbs et al., 2000; Samadi et
    al., 2012; Langbort, 2012; Tanaka and Gupta, 2016), where it provides an attractive
    market model by attaining zero efficiency loss and individual rationality (Shoham
    and Leyton-Brown, 2008). 6. Conclusion This paper discusses a demand-based surface
    water distribution mechanism. The proposed mechanism’s objective is to distribute
    surface water among farmers in a socially optimal manner while decreasing surface
    water wastage and groundwater pumping. The mechanism promotes truthful reporting
    of water valuation by farmers. Through a case study conducted at a watercourse
    in IBIS, we have exhibited that the farmers pump less water when water is distributed
    using the proposed mechanism compared to the traditional warabandi system in IBIS,
    assuring a more sustainable future for groundwater resources. We also see that
    under the proposed mechanism, there is no surface water wastage as farmers are
    getting surface water as per their demand compared to the warabandi mechanism.
    In the warabandi mechanism, a fixed among of water is supplied to farmers irrespective
    of their demand. In the proposed mechanism, farmers’ weekly water costs are low
    compared to the warabandi mechanism when the surface water supply is enough to
    fulfill all farmers’ demands at the start of the week and farmers pump less groundwater
    throughout the week. In the case of surface water abundance, the proposed pricing
    mechanisms do not charge for water as the net social impact of a farmer using
    surface water is zero on other farmers. In the case of scarcity, the proposed
    mechanism charges a farmer according to her water usage impact on other farmers’
    water supply. The weekly water costs incurred by farmers are high when surface
    water is scarce. Although the approach has been demonstrated for a specific region
    in the Indus basin, the technique is generic and applicable to other regions as
    well. Lastly, we hope that this study serves as a small step towards solving an
    important problem of agricultural water management in particular and Common Pool
    Resources (CPR) in general. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

    Introduction The steady increase in the world’s population is resulting in a global
    competition for water resources. Although water consumption in the domestic and
    industrial sectors has increased, however, agriculture accounts for the most significant
    proportion, with a staggering 70% among all consumers (Eston, 2016, Kale Celik
    et al., 2018). Moreover, the effect of climate change, global warming and bioenergy
    demands are also expected to increase further water demand globally (Richey et
    al., 2015, UN, 2020). The major sources for water in agriculture include irrigation
    and natural rainfall. Rainfall is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability,
    thus necessitating farmers or researchers to use precision irrigation to supplement
    inadequacies of rainfall throughout the cultivation period (Oborkhale et al.,
    2015). Given the depletion of water resources, precision irrigation has emerged
    as an essential strategy for water-saving among farmers. Precision irrigation
    can be defined as the application of water at the right time, amount and place-based
    by monitoring of weather and control of soil moisture and crop response (Al-Karadsheh
    et al., 2002, Aleotti et al., 2018). One of the major challenges to achieving
    precise irrigation management is the disturbance in terms of water loss associated
    with the process and the need to compensate for it (Abioye et al., 2020a). Disturbance
    may include change in irrigation water flow, temperature, pressure, even water
    loss etc., and may lead to undesirable consequences on plant performance. For
    example, the effect of temperature variation in a greenhouse may be negligible.
    However, an abrupt increase or decrease in temperature in a tropical environment
    may have severe implications on the yield. The advent of Internet-of-Things (IoT),
    has enabled many new applications, including smart agriculture. In an IoT setting,
    embedded devices can be effectively used to monitor the weather and soil moisture
    variability needed for control irrigation decisions, resulting in optimized water
    usage that can help nations struggling with fulfilling the increasing water demand
    (Elijah et al., 2018, Harun et al., 2019). Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a
    multivariable control strategy that uses a mathematical model to predict the time
    evolution of a system and minimize a cost function based on the prediction while
    handling the constraint on the process. The design objective of MPC is to optimize
    the future behaviour of process output by computing a trajectory of the future
    control variable. The three types of approaches generally used for MPC based controller
    design are differentiated based on the model structure used. The earlier formations
    of MPC used models based on finite impulse response and step response (Keesman,
    2011). However, these models require large model orders and are limited to a stable
    process (Ławrýnczuk, 2013). The second category of MPC controllers was designed
    using a transfer function model. Although these models are applicable to both
    stable and unstable process, these models are considered less effective for multivariable
    control problems (Keesman, 2011). The third category is the state-space formulation
    of MPC was introduced in (Rossiter, 2017). MPC based state space has gained more
    popularity due to its simplistic design framework (leading to lower computational
    complexity) and a direct link to classical linear quadratic regulators (Rossiter,
    2018). For the same reason, we use the state-space formulation identified using
    system identification in this paper. In discrete-time MPC (DMPC), at each time
    step, an open loop optimization problem is solved over a control horizon ), i.e.
    is based on the concept of optimizing the future control trajectory over a control
    horizon using the current state what should be the control signal to obtain the
    optimal output for future time steps. In particular DMPC optimizes the difference
    of the control signal for  = 0, 1, 2, … , time steps, where is the control signal
    is the sampling instant. The prediction horizon ( represents the length of time-steps
    in the future for which the response is considered. For example, if the response
    for the next 20 time steps is considered in the optimization model based on optimizing
    the control signals over the next 10 time steps, then the and Typically, therefore,
    the control vector would capture the control signal for the control horizon and
    assume the rest of the signals in the control horizon to be zero, i.e., for ,
    …, . However, there may be a case where the neglected control signals may have
    a small magnitude but are not zero (Kwon and Han, 2005, Zhao et al., 2018). The
    reason for having a shorter control horizon is to reduce the complexity by reducing
    the number of required parameters in the prediction model. Precision irrigation
    includes of simple and low-cost embedded devices for controlling and monitoring
    the soil moisture content of the soil for various crops. These devices are deployed
    in remote locations and are constrained in terms of processing power, memory capacity,
    and energy availability (Aman et al., 2019, Naveed Aman et al., 2019). Therefore,
    any technique proposed for precision irrigation should efficiently utilize the
    device resources and be light-weighted in terms of resource consumption. Thus,
    this paper proposes the use of Laguerre functions to design a DMPC based irrigation
    control scheme. The first step in designing an MPC based controller is the accurate
    estimation and formulation of the system dynamics. Most of the existing works
    on system identification are based on the soil moisture equation without capturing
    the changing dynamics of soil, plant, and weather (Delgoda et al., 2016, Drgona
    et al., 2018, Goap et al., 2018, Saleem et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2018, Zhang et
    al., 2018, Arriaga and Muriel-Fernández, 2014, Abbas et al., 2015, Abioye et al.,
    2020b). The control strategies that have been investigated in the context of precision
    irrigation can be divided into a close loop and open loop methods. Some of the
    existing open-loop control methods for precision irrigation include (Montesano
    et al., 2016, Sudarmaji et al., 2019), however, in most cases most of the works
    lead to under or over estimation of irrigation as well as report difficulty in
    capturing the changing process dynamics. Therefore, closed-loop based feedback
    control strategies were proposed for precision irrigation (Marinescu et al., 2017,
    Venkatapur and Nikitha, 2017). However, most of the works in this direction focus
    on wireless communication aspects of the IoT devices monitoring and controlling
    irrigation However, the critical aspects of controller tuning are left to intuition
    and experience based on off/on control decisions (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018,
    Goap et al., 2018, Klein et al., 2018, Revathi and Sengottuvelan, 2019). Similarly,
    rule-based control using fuzzy logic for irrigation management was proposed in
    (Ge et al., 2013, Hussan and Hamouda, 2014, Ji et al., 2012) also depends on the
    knowledge of the designers and suffer from stability issues. Other closed loop
    techniques use proportional integral and derivative (PID) controllers (Bi and
    Zheng, 2014, Goodchild et al., 2015, Sheikh et al., 2018). Although PID controllers
    may result in lower computational complexity, however, they result in slow response
    times and overshoots (Goodchild et al., 2015). Conventional MPC has been proposed
    in (Lozoya et al., 2014, Lozoya et al., 2016, Balbis and Jassim, 2018, Adeyemi
    et al., 2018, Pawlowski et al., 2017). However, to achieve higher accuracy using
    these methods, a large control horizon is required which increases the computational
    complexity exponentially. To solve this issue identified above, the proposed control
    technique for precision irrigation has the following desirable characteristics
    as compared to the existing technique. Firstly, an identified state space model
    incorporating the dynamics of soil moisture content as well as experimental data.
    The resulting model captures the changing dynamics of system considering the water
    need of crop as well as water loss due to evapotranspiration, i.e., modelling
    effect of the crop coefficient (kc) (Abrishambaf et al., 2019). Secondly, the
    use of DMPC using Laguerre functions results in higher accuracy by capturing the
    system dynamics over a large prediction horizon while maintaining a lower computational
    complexity thanks to Laguerre functions. The proposed Laguerre based MPC technique
    makes it possible for embedded devices to consider a larger control horizon. This
    paper focuses on the problem of designing a precision irrigation scheme using
    state identified DMPC and Laguerre functions. For the formulation of the proposed
    DMPC based irrigation scheme, experimental dataset was collected from a greenhouse
    cultivated cantaloupe crop. This data is then used to identify the state-space
    model using system identification estimation. The identified state-space model
    is then used to derive the Laguerre networks for the problem, which is used to
    evaluate and optimize the control trajectory. The major contribution of this paper
    is as follows: i. Identifying a state-space model of soil moisture, for a cantaloupe
    crop using experimental data. ii. Deriving a light-weight Laguerre function based
    solution for the precision irrigation DMPC problem. iii. Evaluating the effectiveness
    of the proposed scheme by comparing it with the discrete linear quadratic regulator
    (DLQR). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the
    system model and Section 3 presents the state-space model identification. Section
    4 presents the proposed irrigation control technique. Section 5 discusses the
    simulation results and presents the performance analysis of the proposed technique.
    Finally, the paper conclusion is concluded in Section 6. 2. System model framework
    The system model framework used in this paper is shown in Fig. 1. This model,
    consist of a greenhouse environment located at Universiti Teknologi, Malaysia.
    The greenhouse was constructed using transparent ultra violet plastic nylon and
    tick net material with a height of 2.5 m, a width of 5.3 m and a length of 11.5
    m, as shown in Fig. 2 (Mahmud et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image

    setup for data collection. An Arduino based weather station was used to estimate
    the reference evapotranspiration in the greenhouse environment and used to obtain
    real-time data for the proposed model. Note that represents potential water loss,
    whereas, is the actual water loss from plant and surface of the growing medium.
    The greenhouse uses Raspberry Pi (Rpi) as embedded controller to monitor and control
    cantaloupe plant for data collection. The RPi is interfaced with soil moisture
    sensors, camera sensor and an Espresso Lite v.2.0 connected to the flowmeter.
    The VH 400 soil moisture was used to measure the volumetric water content of the
    soil in % from 0 to 100%, with output voltage proportional to the moisture level.
    The VH 400 soil moisture has a temperature operating range of −40 °C to 85 °C
    and is insensitive to salinity. The RPi camera is used for real time monitoring
    of plant health status and tracking the crop growth performance, i.e. leaf area
    index (LAI) and height of the plant. The leaf area index (LAI) of the plant is
    estimated by feature extraction of colours, dimensions and sizes of the leafs
    through the openCV library. A similar approach is taken to estimate height of
    a plant using masking technique. can then be derived by taking the ratio of the
    LAI and the plant height (Fernández-Pacheco et al., 2014). The YF-201 flowmeter
    is used to measure the volume of water used for irrigation to each irrigation
    time step. The flowmeter is an interface to the RPi via an ESPresso Lite V.2.0
    card. In the greenhouse, the proposed technique is executed by multiple IoT devices
    for precision irrigation. 3. State-space model formulation In this section, the
    formulation of the state-space model used in the design of the proposed irrigation
    control technique is described. To acquire the data used for generating the identified
    state-space model, we used the IoT based data acquisition system described in
    Section 2 was used. The data is in the form of input and output, where the input
    variable include soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration while the output
    is the irrigation volume . A total number of 20,703 experimental data samples
    were collected and split into two halves, i.e., 10, 351 were used for model estimation,
    and the other half was used for model validation. In addition, the experimental
    data pre-processing was carried out to removes the trends, filtering, outliers,
    and means (Abioye et al., 2020b). In addition, the identified continuous-time
    state-space model using the acquired data is estimated as follows. (1) (2) With
    (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Where represents the state of the system (soil moisture before
    irrigation), represents the control signal (irrigation volume), and represents
    the response of the system (soil moisture after irrigation). Note that represents
    the disturbance to the system. Next step is to transform this continuous-time
    state-space model to a discrete-time state-space model by sampling at a frequency
    of one sample per 10 min. The following discrete-time state space model is obtained:
    (8) (9) With (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) To evaluate the accuracy of the state-space
    model, we compare the simulated model response with the measured output in Fig.
    3. The corresponding weather data is shown in Fig. 4. It is observed that the
    identified discrete-time state-space model could accurately capture the process
    dynamics. Moreover, the disturbance has also been considered in this model. Download

    Weather data of the greenhouse environment. Note that Fig. 3 shows that the moisture
    content remains within the typically of 40% to 60% most of the time. However,
    occasionally the soil moisture content surpasses 60%, this is because the plant
    growing medium used was soil-less coco peat, whose soil moisture content can result
    in values above 60% in some instances (Awang et al., 2009, Schulker et al., 2020).
    Moreover, the points in time where the moisture content surpasses 60% represent
    the moments when the instantaneous value of the moisture around the sensor probe
    make a spike at the time of irrigation. This also shows that calibrating the moisture
    sensor in the range of 0 to 100% volumetric water content experimentally as well
    as using the sensor data sheets in better accuracy of measurements. To use this
    state-space model to build an MPC based controller, the discrete-time state-space
    model was first transformed into an augmented state-space model. The standard
    procedure for obtaining the augmented state space was used in this paper; interested
    readers can refer to (Wang, 2009). 4. Proposed precision irrigation control technique
    Denoting the control vector (irrigation volume to be applied over the control
    horizon) to be optimized in an MPC by , which can be defined as: (15) where represents
    the current time. It was observed that each element in Equation (15) could be
    written using the discrete Dirac delta function as follows: (16) where (17) This
    shows that if is considered a coefficient vector, then can be used to capture
    that control trajectory. In simple words, the control trajectory can be evaluated
    using a pulse operator. Thus, the for  =  was approximate using a discrete polynomial
    function. For the purpose of the use of discrete Laguerre functions, (Mahmoud,
    2018) proposed to approximate the sequence to , , . One of the primary reasons
    for choosing Laguerre networks is their well-known orthonormality which is used
    in the design of the discrete-time MPC. Laguerre networks are characterized by
    two parameters, the scaling factor and the number of terms . The - transforms
    of discrete-time Laguerre networks can be written as (Mahmoud, 2018). (18) (19)
    Note that is also known as the pole of the discrete-time Laguerre network, and
    A typical discrete-time Laguerre network is shown in Fig. 5. Also, denoting the
    inverse -transform by then the discrete-time Laguerre function of at time is obtained
    as follows: (20) Download : Download high-res image (30KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Discrete-Time Laguerre Networks. Similarly, after obtaining
    the discrete-time Laguerre functions for the set of discrete-time Laguerre functions
    can be represent as follows: (21) From Fig. 5, it is observe that: (22) with .
    Thus, using (22), it is observed that satisfies the following difference equations:
    (23) Where is an matrix. If we let  =  then, (24) and (25) Using (25), it is trivial
    to show that is reduced to a set of pulses as in (16), i.e., similar to the traditional
    approach for designing MPC (Wang, 2009). In this paper, a discrete-time Laguerre
    functions with was used to achieve the performance improvements discussed in Section
    5.3. Note that the orthonormality of Laguerre functions can be expressed as follows:
    (26) In DMPC design, the control trajectory represents the impulse response of
    a stable dynamic system. Thus, the objective here is to capture this dynamic response
    using Laguerre functions. Laguerre functions have traditionally been used for
    representing the discrete-time impulse response of a dynamic system, i.e., the
    impulse response of a stable system is captured using Laguerre functions as follows:
    (27) Similarly, a Laguerre functions was used to represent the control horizon
    at time instant as follows: (28) where is an arbitrary future sample instant.
    By comparing equation (16) with (28), it was observe that the control horizon
    have been gotten rid of i.e., depends on the number of terms uses in the Laguerre
    networks. This shows that by using (28), the complexity of the control trajectory
    is determined by the number of terms . Note that a long control horizon in traditional
    MPC design results in higher complexity. However, a long control horizon can be
    reduced using (28) can be achieved by selecting a larger value for a value for
    i.e., if then the optimization problem is reduced to optimizing parameters as
    compared to in the traditional approach to MPC design where . Re-writing (28)
    in vector form: (29) where is the parameter vector and is given by (21). Using
    the state-space model obtained in Section 3, gives Eqs. (28), (29). (30) (31)
    The state variable is choose as follows: (32) Where is the desired set point for
    the soil moisture content. Using (29) and the orthonormality property of Laguerre
    functions, the cost function is formulated below: (33) where and is a diagonal
    matrix representing the weighting factor in MPC (Rossiter, 2017). It was observed
    that the cost function in (33) resembles that of a discrete linear quadratic regulator
    (DLQR). Note that DLQR has been applied successfully to a wide range of applications,
    including irrigation, to optimize controllers in terms of cost function parameters
    defined by a control system engineers (Arriaga and Muriel-Fernández, 2014). Therefore,
    having a formulation of the cost function similar to DLQR helps us to use DLQR
    as a benchmark for the proposed DPMC precision irrigation control strategy. Using
    a partial derivative approach, it can be shown that the optimal solution for the
    cost function in (33) can be obtained as follows: (34) where (35) Using (34),
    the optimal Laguerre coefficients can be obtained for the proposed DMPC model
    described by (28), (29). In the precision irrigation problem, the constraints
    usually include constraints on the irrigation volume and soil moisture content,
    i.e. and . To introduce constraints on the irrigation volume and soil moisture,
    the maximum and minimum limits was introduced and denoted by and , respectively.
    The constraint on is activated in two cases: i. If , i.e., the current irrigation
    volume calculated by the proposed DMPC model exceeds the maximum irrigation limit
    for any period. ii. If , i.e., the current irrigation volume is below the minimum
    limit for irrigation. Algorithm 1 below shows the process of calculating the incremental
    control signal after including constraints. Note that the control vector contains
    two elements, one for irrigation volume and the second for the reference evapotranspiration
    . The effect of in real-time was considered, and included in the process of calculating
    in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Calculate the change in the control signal for the
    current interval Input: , Output:   ←   ←   ←   ←  If then     Else if    However,
    the incremental change in was ignored, i.e., the second element of , when applying
    constraint. This is done because the updated is obtained from the weather station
    and not from the feedback loop. We represent the first element of the vector by
    Moreover, and denote the maximum and minimum limits on the irrigation volume.
    The flowchart in Fig. 6 illustrates the proposed DMPC approach using Laguerre
    functions, where the parameters are initialized according to the reference values
    of the parameters specified for growing cantaloupe plant. Moreover, other parameters
    such as constraint limits and state variables are also initialized. After that,
    the Laguerre functions and the terms used in (34) are calculated. Then using a
    loop, the plant model is simulated, i.e., (28), (29) for iterations. Download

    Proposed DMPC based precision irrigation technique. 5. Results and discussion
    This section presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed technique based on
    system dynamics simulations in MATLAB, experimental implementation on RPi’s, and
    efficiency analysis using worst case complexity. 5.1. System dynamics To evaluate
    the effectiveness of the proposed technique, the proposed controller was implemented
    in MATLAB to carry out simulations thoroughly. The state of the art for designing
    controllers based on state-space models is the linear quadratic regulator, in
    particular the discrete-time linear quadratic regulator (DLQR). Although DLQR
    based controllers have optimal system dynamics and have successfully been applied
    to various control applications (Tanaka and Koga, 2019). Therefore, a DLQR based
    controller was used as a benchmark to compare the performance of the proposed
    technique. In the proposed technique, the precision irrigation controller was
    first designed without constraints to study the system dynamics and make sure
    the system is stable and can accurately approximate the behaviour of a DLQR controller.
    Fig. 7(a) shows the eigenvalues of the proposed technique and in a DLQR based
    controller. It was observe that the eigenvalues obtained from the discrete-time
    MPC based controller are approximately identical to the ones obtained from a DLQR
    controller. Thus, the proposed technique can accurately approximate the behaviour
    of the DLQR controller. Fig. 7(b)-(d) show the comparison of the optimal incremental
    control, control, and output response for soil moisture generated by the proposed
    technique with a DLQR based controller. It is observed using the Laguerre network
    in the proposed technique is almost identical to the trajectory obtained from
    the DLQR system. Similar results for the output response was observed. Although
    the settling time is a bit higher for the proposed technique. However, the difference
    is not significant, and the proposed technique successfully keeps the soil moisture
    content within the allowed range of 30% to 45%. Thus, the proposed technique can
    be used to design a stable controller for control of irrigation. Download : Download

    Observed that even after introducing constraints to the proposed technique, the
    system remains stable. Although the settling time has increased, but the increase
    is not significant, i.e., 1,167 m-seconds. From Fig. 8(b), it was observed that
    the constraints on the lower limit for the irrigation volume is activated at sampling
    instant 30. However, the system response stays stable within the range of 30%

    It was observed that the system dynamics of the proposed technique without constraints
    are very close to that of DLQR. Although adding constraints increases the peak
    time and settling time. However, given the fact that the sampling interval for
    irrigation is typically in the magnitude of hours. Thus, we can conclude that
    the proposed technique effectively be used for real-time application for precision
    irrigation. Table 1. Comparison of System Dynamics. Index POR (%) DR (%) (mS)

    evaluation This section discusses the results after implementing the proposed
    technique on a RPi based controller described in Section 2, to study the amount
    of water saved as compared to a DLQR based controller. The evolution of hourly
    irrigation volume for the proposed technique in response to the actual evapotranspiration
    and corresponding moisture level is shown in Fig. 9. It is observed that the proposed
    technique successfully keeps the soil moisture content within the allowed range.
    To further appreciate the superiority of the proposed technique in terms of reducing
    water usage as compared to the DLQR based controller, Fig. 10 presents the results.
    It is observed that the proposed technique results in a significantly lower water
    consumption. The proposed technique resulted in a cumulative water consumption
    of 1135 L (L) over the 21 days period while the DLQR based controller resulted
    in 1640 L of water being consumed. Thus, the proposed technique resulted in a
    30% reduction in water usage. Note that the results are just for one area, if
    the proposed technique is used to control a larger area comprised of multiple
    area, the amount of water saved will be multiple folds. Download : Download high-res

    after using Laguerre networks to approximate the control trajectory in the proposed
    technique, a thorough analysis based on computational complexity is presented
    in this section. Denoting the worst case polynomial time by then . Given the dimension
    of matrix C in the state space model, i.e., , then the computational complexity
    for DLQR system is quasi-quadratic, i.e. (Dean et al., 2019). Similarly, the computational
    complexity of normal DMPC is given by where is the control horizon (Richter et
    al., 2012). However, approximating the control horizon using Laguerre functions
    greatly reduces the number of optimization parameters as compared to traditional
    DMPC and DLQR systems. In the proposed technique we got rid of the control horizon
    and instead use tuning parameters, i.e., and . Therefore, the computational complexity
    is dictated by these parameters. For example, to achieve a long control horizon,
    a larger value of with smaller can be chosen to reduce the optimization parameter
    which results in lower computational complexity. Note that the proposed technique
    is reduced to the traditional MPC approach when and . Thus, the computational
    complexity of the proposed precision irrigation technique using Laguerre networks
    to approximate the control trajectory in DMPC has a computational complexity of
    . Note that , therefore, the computational complexity of the proposed technique
    is significantly lower than traditional MPC. This becomes obvious from Fig. 11.
    It can be observed that the scaling behaviour of the proposed technique is significantly
    better than traditional DMPC and DLQR. The computational complexity increases
    rapidly as the control horizon increased when the number of input is large. This
    shows that the proposed technique is light weight and can be used for real time
    application in precision irrigation. Moreover, if the proposed technique is implemented
    as an online solution, the server can scale the technique to a more significant
    number of devices which will be more appropriate for large greenhouse environments
    or agricultural fields. Download : Download high-res image (197KB) Download :

    introduction of constraints increases the computational complexity even further.
    However, using Laguerre functions, the number of parameters is reduced. For example,
    if in DMPC and DLQR we applied constraints to our problem with a control horizon
    of 30, then DMPC and DLQR need to consider 60 inequalities. Whereas, the same
    control horizon can be approximated using in the proposed technique, which is
    translated to 20 inequalities. Thus, in the presence of constraints, the proposed
    technique helps in reducing the computational complexity even more. 6. Conclusion
    This paper presents an improved control technique for precision irrigation in
    agriculture. The proposed technique is based on the discrete-time MPC using state-space
    formulation. The state-space model was identified using data obtained from a greenhouse
    in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The Laguerre functions were used to approximate
    the control horizon of the DMPC problem. Simulations results in MATLAB showed
    that the proposed technique can accurately approximate the bahviour of DLQR based
    controller. Actual implementation in a greenhouse environment showed that the
    proposed technique can result in significantly lower water consumption, i.e. 30%
    less water was consumed in 21 days using the proposed technique as compared to
    existing techniques. A Performance analysis of the proposed technique showed that
    it has significantly lower computational complexity appropriate for low end embedded
    devices typically used for precision irrigation control in Agricultural application.
    The proposed technique has significantly lower computational as compared to existing
    techniques. Therefore, it would be interesting to implement it in a distributed
    system such as the IoT. Thus, this can be considered as a future work to use the
    proposed technique to control a large number of IoT devices with an online cloud
    based solution. CRediT authorship contribution statement Emmanuel Abiodun Abioye:

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. INTRODUCTION Agricultural crops rely on some amount
    of water supply to produce profitable yield. However, securing this water supply
    is becoming more difficult with the onset of climate change and rapid urbanization
    [1]. Thus, there have been efforts to develop technologies that reduce water usage
    for agricultural consumption while mitigating the adverse effect on crop yields.
    The application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the agricultural crop industry
    aims to improve water efficiency and has gained popularity in recent years [2],
    [3]. The IoT approach utilizes on-site field sensors, off-site environmental sensors,
    or a combination of both to determine precise timings in irrigation. Field sensors
    such as water level sensors, moisture content, and soil water potential have been
    deployed to determine proper irrigation management [4], [5]. Environmental sensors
    that estimate evaporation and crop transpiration or evapotranspiration are also
    used to calculate overall water demand in the field [6], [7]. With the availability
    of these sensor information, crucial decision points on when and how much to irrigate
    can be determined precisely. For this work, we focus on rice for the study of
    irrigation control with sensors as it is considered the most water intensive crop.
    Due to this biological property, the traditional method of achieving the characterized
    optimal rice yield is to maintain ponded water. However, there can be substantial
    water savings using two approaches. One approach is the use of weather forecasts
    in advance control methods such as model predictive control (MPC) [8], [9], [10].
    Another approach is to empirically characterize the physiological mechanisms of
    crop growth in a simple rule based irrigation management technique called alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) [11]. This study designs crop growth dynamics in an MPC
    framework combining the principles of the two aforementioned water saving approaches.
    There are two main contributions. First, we present crop growth models in an MPC
    framework and numerical relaxations for tractability. Second, we simulate and
    compare the performance of different irrigation management techniques with the
    proposed MPC framework. By integrating crop growth dynamics into the MPC framework,
    our results indicate greater precision in mitigating the adverse effects of reduced
    water consumption across different fields and seasons. A. Crop growth Experimental
    studies on irrigation management have shown that there can be intermittent drying
    periods with small to medium effect on yield production depending on the intensity
    and duration of the drying event [12]. A conservative variant called ’Safe-AWD’
    was developed to take into account crop growth characteristics to minimize yield
    reduction [13]. Safe-AWD in rice allows for water to subside in the field up to
    15cm below the soil surface. Supplemental rules require to suspend AWD and revert
    to ponded irrigation at certain phases in the crop development to minimize crop
    drought stress. This ponding event should be implemented at the beginning of sowing
    and during the middle of panicle formation phase of crop growth. These ponded
    timings are crucial points where the crops growth efforts are focused in creating
    organs for maximal crop yield. There are also points in crop growth where the
    crop gradually become less drought sensitive. This occurs right before flowering
    and a few weeks before grain harvest. There are complex interacting growth dynamics
    as well. For example, the later phases will require slowing down leaf growth to
    prioritize grain growth [14]. These qualitative descriptions of crop growth are
    important to note as they will be useful in validating results of different irrigation
    schemes. While the rules of Safe-AWD capture best practices, the challenge is
    to contextualize crop drought stress and water savings in a mechanistic viewpoint.
    And there have been several works that present rice growth models. These rice
    crop growth models commonly describe systems of equations for leaf, biomass, and
    grain formation [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, they are too complex and often
    reserved for exploratory studies on crop management and not real time control
    such as MPC. In contrast, this work presents crop growth models derived from system
    identification techniques to be used in MPC. B. MPC in Irrigation MPC is a robust
    controller that can accommodate well defined system constraints and multi-objective
    decision making. Using a combination of on-site and off-site sensors, MPC has
    been applied in precision irrigation. But these utilize water balance model that
    only consider water supply and demand in the field [14]. The objective is to track
    a desired amount of water in the soil. The model does not account for the physiological
    effects undergone by the crop under such irrigation decisions. Our work differs
    in this aspect as the use of both crop growth and water balance model allows for
    design trade-offs between water savings and yield reduction. C. Outline Sect.
    II describes crop growth and water balance model to be used in an optimization
    problem for MPC. Sect. III presents our experimental methdology. Next, Sect. IV
    compares the performance of our crop growth MPC (CG-MPC) with water balance based
    MPC (WB-MPC), Safe-AWD benchmarked with traditional ponded irrigation. We conclude
    with Sect. V, which summarizes the impact of the study and future works. SECTION
    II. Models for Irrigation In this section, we present the crop growth model and
    the water balance model. We discuss linear approximations for characteristics
    of growth dynamics. The overall MPC problem is presented as a mixed-integer quadratic
    programming (MIQP). A. Crop Growth Model Crop growth variables leaf area index,
    biomass, and grain yield formation are used to build the model. While crop growth
    is often characterized as a non-linear equation, it can be approximated by piece-wise
    linear dynamic equations separated by growth phases [19]. There are four main
    phases in rice development namely; basic vegetative phase (BVP), photosensitive
    phase (PSP), panicle formation phase (PFP), and grain filling phase (GFP). These
    phases indicate a particular point in crop growth where important organs are developed
    and has significant changes in the growth trajectory of the crop [20]. To standardize
    varying growth rates across different combinations of genetic varieties and environmental
    conditions, a quantitative developmental stage index (DVS) is used. From seedling
    to harvest, DVS values ranges from 0.0 to 2.0. Each phase will switch to the next
    once a certain value of DVS is reached. Then, it is translated back to its equivalent
    in days after seedling emergence. For brevity, we will only mention that DVS index
    is determined using weather data and a set of pre-determined parameters specific
    to a crop variety. This index can be pre-computed in a rice growth simulation
    software. [18] In each variable, the dynamic growth equations have the same model
    structure. The parameters of each dynamic equation differ for each stage k. The
    growth dynamics are described as follows, LA I i+1 BI M i+1 Gr Y i+1 = a k 0 +
    a k 1 ⋅LA I i + a k 2 ⋅BI M i + a k 3 ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + a k 4 ⋅ D i  for k=1,2,3,4
    = b k 0 + b k 1 ⋅LA I i + b k 2 ⋅BI M i + b k 3 ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + b k 4 ⋅ D i  for
    k=1,2,3,4 = c k 0 + c k 1 ⋅LA I i + c k 2 ⋅BI M i + c k 3 ⋅Gr Y i + c k 4 ⋅ D
    i  for k=3,4 (1) (2) (3) View Source where i is time in days. The model parameters
    are a k i , b k i ,and c k i where k = 1, 2, 3, 4 represent BVP, PSP, PFP, and
    GFP respectively. Eq. (1) models Leaf Area Index (LAI) which describes the canopy
    density of the crop. LAI is a dimensionless variable with range 0-10 indicating
    the ratio of leaf area over ground area. Eq. (2) models biomass (BIM) which is
    the weight of plant material per area (Kg/ha). Eq.(3) models grain formation per
    area (GrY , in Kg/ha), the endpoint of which is the overall crop yield. Note that
    (3) is present only when the crop developmental phases are at PFP and GFP. Solar
    radiation (Rad, MJ/hr) is an external variable acquired from the meteorological
    data on the field’s location. The interaction between leaf area index and solar
    radiation (LAI·Rad) relates biomass acquired from photosynthesis by the crop canopy.
    Lastly, D (mm) is water deficit referenced at the soil surface. Parameters a k
    4 , b k 4 , and  c k 4 specifically translate this water deficit to stress in
    the growth equations. B. Water Balance Model The soil water balance equation accounts
    for water that is coming in and out of the field and is dictated by the dynamic
    equation, W i+1 = W i + I i + R i −E T i − P i (4) View Source where W is the
    water level (mm), I is the amount of irrigation applied (mm), R is the amount
    rain (mm), ET is the evapotranspiration (mm), and P is percolation (mm). Here,
    we disregard runoff which is the amount of water spilled over when water level
    exceeds the height of constructed field bund. The scenario is unlikely to happen
    under mild drought conditions and will be further constrained by MPC implementation.
    Negative and positive water level values pertain to water level being below and
    above the soil surface respectively. Percolation and evapotranspiration is determined
    jointly by environmental factors such as air temperature, wind speed, and soil
    type as well as crop physiological conditions. Physiological conditions however
    are difficult to estimate. For example, the plant will inhibit transpiration by
    closing its stomata to preserve water and combat drought stress [21]. Thus, previous
    works on MPC were limited to utilize environmental factors to estimate evapotranspiration
    in water balance models. But in our work, we explicitly relate our crop growth
    model variables LAI and BIM to estimate the combined demand of evapotranspiration
    and percolation by, ETA P i = d k 0 + d k 1 ⋅LA I i + d k 2 ⋅BI M i + d k 3 ⋅LA
    I i ⋅Ra d i + d k 4 ⋅E T ref i + d k 5 ⋅E T ref i ⋅LA I i + d k 6 ⋅E T ref i ⋅BI
    M i + d k 7 ⋅E T ref i ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + d k 8 ⋅ETA P t−1 + d k 9 ⋅ D t−1 fork=1,2,3,4
    (5) View Source where ETAPi is the overall water demand of the crop-soil system,
    ETAref is the reference evapotranspiration which is the evapotranspiration of
    a theoretical plant in stress free condition. Variable ETAref is determined by
    meteorological data and considered as an external variable to the system. Parameter
    d k 0 describe percolation. Parameter d k 1−2 links to direct effects of the states
    LAI and BIM to evapotranspiration. Parameters d k 3−7 denote the interaction effects
    of external environmental variables with crop growth variables. All parameters
    d k 0−9 have different values for each growth phase k. The piece-wise modeling
    of the system allows to capture physiological phenomenon wherein certain phases
    in crop development are more resilient to drought stress from water deficit. Water
    deficit is then translated from water level as, D i ={ 0 W i , , if W i ≥0 if
    W i <0 }. (6) View Source When there is ponding, water deficit should be D = 0.
    This consideration is important as it is assumed that there should be no drought
    stress when the soil is fully saturated. Likewise, this also ensures increasing
    water levels over fully saturated soil does not boost growth. This introduces
    conditional non-linearities in the formulation and can be relaxed using the big-M
    technique, W i ≥M⋅( B i −1) W i <M⋅ B i D i = W i ⋅ B i B={0,1} (7) (8) (9) (10)
    View Source where M is a sufficiently large constant and B is a binary variable.
    C. MPC Formulation The MPC algorithm solves an optimization problem at each time
    step. The problem solves a multi-objective expression, V LAI i V BIM i V GrY i
    V = (LA I i −LA I opt i ) 2 = (BI M i −BI M opt i ) 2 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ (Gr Y i −Gr Y opt
    i ) 2 0 ,if k=3,4 ,if k=1,2 ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ = ∑ i=1 i=H−1 (λ⋅ I i + γ 1 ⋅ V LAI i + γ 2
    ⋅ V BIM i + γ 3 ⋅ V GrY i ) + v 1 ⋅ V LAI H + v 2 ⋅ V BIM H + v 3 ⋅ V GrY H (11)
    (12) (13) (14) View Source where LAIopt, BIMopt and GrYopt are optimal leaf area
    index, biomass, and yield trajectories. These optimal trajectories can be predetermined
    before optimization by simulating ponded irrigation where there is no drought
    stress. The objective weights λ, γ1−3, υ1−3 pertains to irrigation action, set-point
    tracking, and endpoint tracking. The MPC is formulated as a MIQP due to constraint
    in the water deficit equation, min. subjectto W 1 LA I 1 Gr Y 1 V eqs.1−3(crop
    growth) eqs.4−5(water balance) eqs.7−10(waterdeficit) I – ≤ I i ≤ I ¯ = W t =L
    A ^ I t ,BI M 1 =B I ^ M t =G r ^ Y t ,ifk=3,4 ∀i=1,2,…,H (15) (16) (17) (18)
    View Source where H is the optimization horizon. Irrigation constraints are defined
    by (15) where the lower and upper constraints are I = 0mm and Ī = 100mm respectively.
    The current water level reading from the sensor is constrained to be the initial
    starting point of the optimization in (16). Though there are no real time sensor
    reading of LAI, BIM, and GrY , they are updated by their estimates from the result
    of previous optimization as in (17),(18) and set to typical initial values at
    the beginning of the MPC run. In the sequence of solution for the irrigation variables,
    only the first I1 is used for actual irrigation and the process is repeated until
    harvest. The optimization horizon H shrinks to the days left until harvest when
    the horizon is longer. We summarize the primary limitations of this model. First,
    it is assumed fertilizer application is within standard management. Second, we
    ignore the delaying effect on crop growth due to severe drought stress [21]. This
    means that transitions across developmental phases are mainly driven by the external
    variable in weather temperature. Given sensor measurements and weather forecast,
    the exact timing of model phase switching is determined before solving the optimization
    problem. Lastly, the depth where crop’s roots can reach available water in the
    soil is considered constant. This is a reasonable assumption for rice planting
    practices. Furthermore, this allows (4) to describe a single soil layer which
    reduces model complexity. These are assumed because MPC is designed to operate
    under milder drought conditions. SECTION III. Experimental Simulations Identifying
    model parameters directly from experimental data is challenging, particularly
    for leaf area index and biomass since they require destructive methods such as
    sampling subplots in the field for laboratory analysis. We present our methodology
    to characterize our model and control performance across wet and dry seasons.
    In this section, we numerically solve our MIQP problem for entire planting seasons.
    All calculations were done on a laptop computer with dual core 2.5GHz processor
    and 8GB RAM using python 3.7 with gurobi solver [22]. Simulation time for each
    field scenario is less than a minute. Using ponding irrigation as a benchmark,
    we evaluate the performance of CG-MPC against WB-MPC, and Safe-AWD. A. Parameter
    Estimation The problem of sparse data is circumvented by interpolating experimental
    data with a specialized rice simulation software ORYZA3. The software ORYZA3 generates
    a best fit model from collected data for specific rice varieties. Input data for
    the ORYZA3 simulations are composed of rice variety specific quantitative properties,
    soil properties, and meteorological data. The ORYZA3 simulation produces daily
    data on all the necessary crop variables that can now be used to explore different
    irrigation scenarios. The scenarios generated should provide sufficient excitation
    in finding the parameters of our crop growth model. The International Rice Research
    Institute has a dataset of varieties experimentally calibrated with ORYZA3. The
    rice variety chosen for this study is IR72 and the data can be found in [23].
    For this particular dataset, transplanting was done hence growth trajectories
    would exhibit a drop due to shock on the 12th day. The phenomenon is most evident
    for leaf area index. Simulation starts on the 18th day (DVS=0.2) to discount the
    effect of transplanting shock. The calibrated DVS values corresponding to the
    start of developmental phases BVP, PSP, PFP, and GFP are 0.0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.5
    respectively. This allows us to pre-determine the specific days for each developmental
    phase k. The average duration of the planting season is 107 days after seedling
    emergence. Note that this parameter estimation process needs to be repeated for
    different calibrated rice variety and soil type, but it needs to be done only
    once. We use the coefficient of determination score (R2) to quantify the performance
    of our model in comparison to 160 randomly generated test scenarios in ORYZA3.
    Crop variables LAI, BIM, and GrY have R2 scores of 0.97, 0.99, and 0.98 respectively.
    For simulating MPC irrigation management, eight scenarios are explored. The scenarios
    are varied combinations of weather and calibrated soil properties from actual
    experimental data. It comprises of six dry and two wet season conditions. It was
    not possible to get continuous data from ORYZA3 to update the MPC simulation at
    each iteration. Our own model was augmented by the model error characterized from
    the parameter estimation process to provide an ad-hoc solution instead. B. Irrigation
    Schemes and Metrics Ponding irrigation management is set at about an upper water
    level threshold of 50mm then allowed to lower at 10mm which it is then irrigated
    50mm/day until upper threshold is reached again. Ponded irrigation is considered
    as the non-drought stress optimal growth trajectory and used as a benchmark for
    water savings and grain yield. The trajectories are pre-determined using ORYZA3.
    Safe-AWD rules are implemented as previously descibed. The water balance based
    MPC (WB-MPC) is formulated using only the water balance equation as dynamic constraints.
    The objective is to track water level 10mm below the soil surface which is a conservative
    target with good water savings relative to ponding. Upon some investigation, longer
    horizons improve MPC solution. However, the horizon length should realistically
    consider the ability to forecast meteorological data. We find a horizon of 28
    days is suitable enough. To focus on the crop variables, we restrict our MPC simulations
    to perfect forecast of meteorological data for this horizon. The objective weights
    of CG-MPC were tuned to prioritize tracking optimal growth trajectories over water
    savings. But it is further tuned to be at least relatively competitive to WB-MPC.
    Total irrigation reduction (%) can be computed using applied irrigation, Ponded−Irrigation
    Ponded ⋅100%. Likewise, grain yield reduction (%) is simlarly computed as, Ponded
    yield−Irrigation yield Ponded yield ⋅100% . The root mean square error (RMSE)
    is used to compare the tracking of optimal growth trajectories of each irrigation
    scheme. SECTION IV. Results and Analysis We first analyze the average behavioral
    results of each irrigation scheme. In Fig. 1, we see that RMSE of CG-MPC has the
    best tracking for all crop variables. The graph of leaf area index shows WB-MPC
    and Safe-AWD deviates from the optimal trajectory. For WB-MPC, it starts to occur
    slightly before PSP. This early deviations in biomass and leaf area subsequently
    affected grain yield in the latter phases. Even a conservative water level tracking
    of -10mm creates adverse effects. It can be remedied by having an elevated water
    set-point at the beginning then switch to an aggressive one later. However, this
    highlights the limitation of WB-MPC. Knowing the right water level set-point for
    different rice varieties and soil properties is not intuitive. It also produced
    highly non-sparse irrigation control which is operationally expensive. For Safe-AWD,
    leaf area index deviation starts to occur in the middle of PSP which corresponds
    to the drying event. Note, it is not always critical to have high leaf area. Recall
    the aforementioned phenomenon of the crop inhibiting leaf growth to minimize transpiration
    during drought stress. At PSP, drying event is beneficial since biomass nutrients
    will be directed towards building grain instead of leaves when heading into PFP.
    Further evidence is given by Safe-AWD having better grain formation RMSE, even
    though the leaf area index RMSE of WB-MPC is lower than Safe-AWD. Safe-AWD has
    lower biomass RMSE than WB-MPC. With enough tracking of optimal biomass, good
    recovery from drought stress is possible. This shows that drought stress should
    generally be avoided during BVP while it can be induced during PSP. Although the
    drying event is comparatively less aggressive, the timing of drying in CG-MPC
    was similar to Safe-AWD. During PSP for example, the crop was generally allowed
    to recover with some irrigation event around DVS=0.6. In the water level recharging
    for PFP, CG-MPC maintains water at the soil surface by an irrigation peak event
    around DVS=0.9, while Safe-AWD injects two peak irrigation events to reach ponding
    threshold and gradually allows it recede. As previously mentioned, the rules developed
    for Safe-AWD were rigorously studied and determined by numerous field experiments
    while the model derived for CG-MPC followed mechanistic principles in crop modeling
    literature. The timing similarity of induced drought of CG-MPC to Safe-AWD validates
    that the crop model presented captured the latent physiological dynamics of rice.
    A summary of the result is shown in Fig. 2. Safe-AWD has an advantage over the
    two MPC schemes as it produces the largest gap in trade-off between irrigation
    and yield as shown in Fig 4. The WB-MPC result produced comparable levels in terms
    of water savings with CG-MPC but with high variance. WB-MPC performed worst in
    terms of yield reduction mitigation due to it being agnostic of crop dynamics
    even with the conservative water level set-point. However, CG-MPC showed virtually
    negligible adverse effects of drying events on yield with very high precision
    across different environmental conditions and still with significantly good controlled
    reductions in irrigation. SECTION V. CONCLUSIONS Simulations of irrigation schemes
    for rice were performed. The result highlights the importance of the timing and
    degree of alternately wetting and drying in rice crop. Though yield reductions
    are relatively small, the wide-scale adoption of Safe-AWD or WB-MPC is often challenged
    with the variability of its yield reduction across specific rice variety, soil
    type, and meteorological interactions. The yield reduction can sometimes be the
    marginal difference in a famer’s income. The integration of mechanistic crop growth
    dynamics in MPC irrigation can now be used to significantly and precisely manage
    the risk of yield reduction with water savings. This demonstrates the potential
    to reliably incorporate irrigation limits or water contracts for future sustainable
    irrigation policies under climate change. Future work needs to explore the following:
    develop non-invasive measurement methods to collect real-time leaf area index
    and biomass estimates, comparison of different calibrated varieties, robustness
    against differing degrees of forecast uncertainty, and implement a schedule constraint
    to minimize abrupt changes in irrigation events caused by daily MPC computation
    in order to ease practical implementation. Fig. 1. Average growth and water trajectories
    of irrigation schemes: Ponding (dotted), CG-MPC (solid line), WB-MPC (dashed),
    Safe-AWD (dotted dash), and Rain (bars). The RMSE was computed across all eight
    scenarios using the Ponding result as baseline. The RMSE for leaf area index are
    the following: 0.21 for CG-MPC, 0.35 for WB-MPC, and 0.46 for Safe-AWD. The RMSE
    for biomass are 189.56 for CG-MPC, 488.49 for WB-MPC, and 387.59 for Safe-AWD.
    The RMSE for grain yield formation are 35.31 for CG-MPC, 244.89 for WB-MPC, and
    101.56 for Safe-AWD. Show All Fig. 2. Effect of Irrigation Scheme on Yield and

    issue Keywords Precision agricultureAgrotechnology 1. Introduction 1.1. Global
    challenges The global population is expected to grow by approximately one third
    between 2009 and 2050, which is an increase of approximately 2.3 billion people
    (FAO, 2009). In order to sustain this growth, the food production has to increase
    as well. Combined with the trend of urbanisation (UN, 2018), it becomes increasingly
    more important to produce more food using the available farmland. The current
    resource-intensive farming paradigms have shown not to be scalable due to their
    enormous environmental impacts such as deforestation, water scarcity, and green
    house gas emissions (FAO, 2017). As such, it is an imperative challenge to increase
    the crop yield per available area, whilst significantly reducing the usage of
    resources such as water, pesticides, and herbicides in order to minimise the environmental
    impact and increase the sustainability of the food production chain. Due to its
    global scale, developing and developed countries alike will face the challenges
    of revolutionising the paradigms of agriculture. In 2015, 17 global sustainability
    goals for 2030 were identified in The General Assembly of the United Nations (2015).
    Agriculture plays a prominent role in many of these goals. The clearest presence
    of agriculture is in Goal 2: “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition
    and promote sustainable agriculture” (The General Assembly of the United Nations,
    2015 p. 14). However, the importance of agriculture can also be seen in Goals
    6, 12, 13, 14, and 15 (sustainable management of water, sustainable consumption
    and production patterns, combat climate change, sustainable use of oceans, and
    protection of ecosystems, respectively). 1.2. Goal and scope In the present paper
    we will discuss the challenges within arable farming to which the control engineering
    society could contribute significantly. In particular, the main focus of this
    paper is automated decision making in arable farming. This includes management
    of resources such as water, herbicides and pesticides, as well as the management
    of sensors. In this work we will highlight several of such challenges with the
    goal of (further) enticing control engineers to this important and societally
    relevant line of research. It is noteworthy to mention that there is a vast amount
    of literature on control of crops in greenhouses (as well as greenhouse horticulture).
    Greenhouses are evidently more ‘controlled’ environments and ‘less harsh’ than
    fields of crops, which has led to control methods that are not directly applicable
    to arable farming. On the actuation side, greenhouses are able to control humidity,
    carbon dioxide levels, temperature, and irradiation. Irrigation can sometimes
    occur on an individual crop level. Also the placement of sensors is more ubiquitous.
    This has led to much interesting research and many successful instances of control
    applications, see, e.g., Van Straten and Van Henten, 2010, Van Straten et al.,
    2010. Anyone interested in control for arable farming is advised to study the
    applied control technologies in greenhouses as well. Additionally, much research
    has been carried out on the topic of machinery and robotics for arable farming,
    which is of interest as well. However, in the present work the focus is on management
    and allocation of machinery and robots. Methods of sensing, manipulation, path
    planning, and motion control of such robots are left outside the scope of this
    work (for a review, see, e.g., Bechar and Vigneault (2016)). 1.3. Outline of the
    paper The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we provide
    a definition of Precision Agriculture (PA) and how it is related to the global
    challenges mentioned above. In Section 3 we present our main recommendations for
    research directions for the control scientists and engineers interested in PA.
    Several advanced applications of these research directions are presented in Section
    4. Practical recommendations and considerations for doing research in these directions
    are presented in Section 5 and we end with conclusions in Section 6. 2. Precision
    agriculture objectives There are numerous definitions of Precision Agriculture
    (PA) (see, e.g., Jawad et al., 2017, McBratney et al., 2005, Pierce and Nowak,
    1999). In the present paper, we consider PA to be the type of agriculture that
    aims to maximise the number of (correct) decisions per unit area of land per unit
    time with associated net benefit (following McBratney et al. (2005)). Led by the
    global challenges mentioned in Section 1.1, we define the global goal of PA for
    the purpose of the present paper to be: To help farmers across the world to increase
    the production of high-nutritious foods at minimal environmental impact through
    the use of technologies, in order to sustain the food demand of humanity. The
    technologies mentioned in the global goal above include advanced machinery, data-gathering
    and processing infrastructure, and automated decision making schemes. In the present
    work we will mostly focus on the data-gathering and automated decision making,
    as these are closest to the control community. However, these are evidently strongly
    related to the machinery. There are many different kinds of machines and robots
    for arable farming on both the sensing and actuation side (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Hajjaj and Sahari, 2016), such as automated harvesting robots (Bac et al.,
    2014, Zhao et al., 2016), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing (Lottes
    et al., 2017, Mulla, 2013, Zhang and Kovacs, 2012), and machines/robots for application
    of resources such as fertiliser, pesticides, and water (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016).
    Closely related to the robots are the advanced machines that farmers operate.
    Both agricultural robots and machines are an integral part of farm-wide automated
    crop growth management. In the remainder of this section we will elaborate further
    on several aspects of the PA goal, including minimal resource usage and environmental
    impact (Section 2.1), and availability of technology (Section 2.2). 2.1. Minimal
    resource usage and environmental impact The four main resources used in arable
    farming are water, fertiliser, pesticides, and fuel for machinery. In the remainder
    of this section we will discuss these in more detail. 2.1.1. Water Currently,
    there are several countries facing a freshwater crisis. Studies show that many
    more cities and countries across the planet will face a freshwater crisis if water
    is kept being used at the current rate (FAO, 2011). Of all the water withdrawn
    for human use, 70% is used for irrigation (FAO, 2011). This is mainly due to the
    vast scale at which crops are produced. For example, in order to produce a kilogram
    of rice, over 1600 litres of freshwater is needed and one kilogram of potatoes
    needs approximately 287 litres of freshwater (Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2010a). Livestock
    has an even worse ‘efficiency’ in terms of produced mass and nutritious value
    relative to the water needed (Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2010b). This is partly due
    to the fact that animals are higher in the foodchain and thus require a large
    amount of crops, which in turn require a lot of water. Hence, reducing the water
    usage in arable farming could have a huge impact on the availability of freshwater
    throughout the world. The importance of smart irrigation systems is explicitly
    stated in FAO (2011, p. 8): “Most future growth in crop production in developing
    countries is likely to come from intensification, with irrigation playing an increasingly
    strategic role through improved water services, water-use efficiency improvements,
    yield growth and higher cropping intensities”. 2.1.2. Fertilisers The main components
    of fertilisers are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) (often abbreviated
    as NPK). Remaining nutrients include calcium, magnesium, and sulphur (Kiiski et
    al., 2016). Insufficient application of nitrogen, the primary component of fertiliser,
    can result in low crop yields and insufficient food production, whereas an excess
    can lead to serious environmental harm (Hasler et al., 2015, Stevens, 2019). These
    negative effects include increased greenhouse gas emissions, poor air quality
    and water pollution (Stevens, 2019). It is predicted in Springmann et al. (2018)
    that in the absence of technological changes and mitigation measures, the environmental
    effects of excessive use of nitrogen and potassium in agriculture will increase
    between 2010 and 2050 by 50% to 90% and reach dangerous levels. In most countries
    there are strict regulations as to how much nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
    can be applied. Timing of fertilisation is delicate. If fertiliser is applied
    too late then the crop will have a reduced growth. On the other hand, if it is
    applied too early, then the nutrients may be lost in the soil. This makes it an
    interesting case study for control engineering, especially in the case where there
    are many (sub)fields requiring large-scale control and optimisation, see, e.g.,
    Cobbenhagen et al. (2018). 2.1.3. Pesticides The objective of using pesticides
    is to protect crops from pathogens and parasites. Pesticides are, by definition,
    toxic and bio-active substances (Imfeld & Vuilleumier, 2012). As a result, the
    use of pesticides can affect the health of the crops, soil, and humans (Carpy
    et al., 2000, Imfeld and Vuilleumier, 2012, Maroni et al., 1999). Limiting the
    usage of pesticides is not only desired due to its negative side effects, it is
    also a cost saver for the farmer. Hence, the careful application of pesticides
    is an interesting topic for research in control engineering. It could be interesting
    to see what the optimal policy is under risk constraints. In Section 4.1 we will
    focus on intercropping, a technique that has the potential to reduce or even eliminate
    the use of pesticides. 2.1.4. Fuel One of the resources that should not be forgotten
    is the fuel used by the farming machinery. In fact, the logistics within the entire
    foodchain ‘from farm to plate’ is an interesting topic of research, but is not
    considered here (refer to, e.g., Wakeland et al. (2012)). In terms of local usage
    of farming machinery, the minimisation of fuel results in obvious reductions in
    greenhouse gas emissions and less expenses for the farmer (see, e.g., Dalgaard
    et al. (2001) for a study on the impact of fossil fuel use). 2.2. Availability
    of technology Farming is a business. Income is generated by the sale of high quantity
    and high quality foods and the expenses are mainly governed by resource usage
    and labour. Advanced PA technologies can potentially have high starting costs.
    One might argue that these start-up costs may hold back the implementation of
    the technologies at smaller farms. However, investing in PA technologies becomes
    a necessity if smaller farms want to compete with larger farms that have more
    capital and invest in these technologies. It is thus of importance to keep in
    mind how advanced technologies can be used in less technologically developed areas
    or by smaller farms. When discussing new technologies in farming it is easy to
    forget that it is worthwhile to investigate ‘lower-tech’ solutions. For example,
    it can be argued that with an increase in advanced decision support systems (DSS),
    that there is also a demand for DSS that require limited computation power and
    sensing capabilities. The latter system helps farmers that do not have access
    to state-of-the-art sensors to make better informed decisions. Instead of allocation
    of automatic sensors such as UAVs, such a DSS would advise the farmer where and
    what to measure (even visual/manual inspection) such that the DSS obtains better
    information on the current state of the field and hence can make better decisions.
    Due to the reduction in costs of GPS devices and wireless technologies, it is
    possible to create ‘lower-tech’ solutions for information gathering in PA, see,
    e.g., Maia et al., 2017, Wachowiak et al., 2017 for examples. 3. Model-based crop
    growth management 3.1. Why model-based crop growth management? A fundamental question
    in PA is what the level of ‘precision’ should be. Consider two extreme scenarios,
    the first of which is where an entire field is treated homogeneously, the second
    scenario is where each plant in the field is individually monitored and controlled.
    Evidently, the first scenario is suboptimal: there are variations over the field
    and not all crops and soils in a field have the same properties nor do the crops
    have to ‘behave’ the same. However, it is a cheap/easy option in terms of monitoring
    and caring. The second scenario may produce more crops as each plant is treated
    individually and therefore its needs can be exactly met. The downside of this
    scenario is that it is rather difficult and expensive to monitor each plant individually
    and (currently) the costs of this approach are larger than the potential profits.
    It is evident that these two extreme scenarios are suboptimal. This raises the
    question where the optimal level of precision is between these extremes, that
    is, the level at which the costs of managing and monitoring are balanced with
    the profits due to the level of attention given to each crop. The trend in developments
    in PA is clearly towards operating at a higher resolution, which can, for instance,
    be seen from the developments in and usages of sensors and actuators (Reyns et
    al., 2002). However, we hypothesise that, in order to push for an increased resolution
    in PA, we require a scalable ‘software approach’ in order to go beyond the hardware
    limitations of sensors and actuators. This hypothesis is the main motivation for
    the importance of doing model-based crop growth management. The main idea of which
    is to create a ‘digital twin’ of the crops (i.e., crops are monitored by monitoring
    a simulation model of the crop growth), which uses sensor inputs of the crop or
    nearby crops in order to predict the state of the crop. Additionally, this model
    of the crop is used to compute the best actions for the crop (e.g., amount of
    irrigation or fertiliser). The addition of a model-based crop growth management
    to the sensors and actuators increases the resolution of PA. The hypothesis above
    is central to this paper and due to the importance of a model-based control approach,
    several interesting and important opportunities for the systems and control community
    in PA can be identified. In the remainder of this section we elaborate on three
    important research directions for the interested control engineer: crop growth
    models for control, model-based control of crop growth, and estimation of state
    variables of crops and fields. These subjects all contribute to the purpose of
    farm-wide on-line automated decision making and/or providing decision support
    to the farmer. We refer to the seminal work McBratney et al. (2005) in which general
    research lines of PA have been identified. These research lines form the starting
    point of our work; we will specify and detail them for the systems and control
    engineering community and expand upon them. 3.2. Crop growth modelling for control
    There exists a plethora of models that predict the growth of crops. See, e.g.,
    Brisson et al., 2003, de Wit et al., 2019, Shibu et al., 2010, Steduto et al.,
    2009, and Bouman et al. (1996) and the references therein. Most of them are well-validated
    and proved to be able to predict the crop growth. These models have traditionally
    been created by biologists, ecologists, and agronomists. However, these models
    typically do not lend them to be directly used by ‘standard techniques’ from control
    engineering in order to design controllers or state estimators (Carson et al.,
    2006). In many research areas within control engineering, it is assumed that the
    dynamical model of the system to be controlled is given by a proper mathematical
    description, for instance, in terms of a set of differential or difference equations.
    These can be linear or non-linear, and they may include partial derivatives. The
    aforementioned crop growth models generally are not in such a form. They are mostly
    in the form of executable simulation models, consisting of many lines of code.
    Although many models do have differential and difference equations at their core,
    much of the reasonable performance in prediction comes from added relations. Such
    relations take the form of, e.g., ‘if-else-statements’ and look-up tables for
    empirical data. In order to bridge the gap between these crop growth models and
    the control engineering domain, we identify the following directions of research:
    (1) Adaptation of control methods such that the existing crop growth simulation
    models can be used directly. (2) Creation of novel crop growth models that rely
    on the domain knowledge of the experts, but with the intent to have both appropriate
    prediction accuracy and a mathematical description of reasonable complexity that
    lends itself to be used in ‘conventional’ control engineering methods. (3) Identification
    of models based on data and related data-driven control methods. The difference
    between direction (3) and the other two is that (3) allows for the use of black-box
    models. In this work we focus on the first two of these directions. The interested
    reader is referred to, e.g., Beza et al. (2017) for a recent review on using data
    in modelling the yield gap. It should be mentioned that it may be interesting
    to explore the use of reinforcement learning if only simulation models are available
    (see, e.g., Bu and Wang, 2019, Jiang et al., 2018, Sun et al., 2017 for recent
    examples). However, such control policies have the downside that they lose much
    ‘explainability’ of the optimal actions, which is important for practical implementation.
    This will be further discussed in Sections 3.3 Difficulties in crop growth modelling,
    5.2 User adoption . Note that data-driven methods combined with expert domain
    knowledge (i.e., grey-box modelling) have high potential. This allows data to
    be used in modelling, while maintaining a high level of explainability and generality.
    Aside from the fact that it may be interesting to employ the models in control
    engineering methods, there are additional benefits in creating models as described
    in (2). Firstly, by explicitly stating the workings of such models they become
    more accessible to the users. It allows for scientists to share and improve them
    and apply them to different locations, crops and weather patterns. Furthermore
    such models allow governmental agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGO)
    and companies to create their own decision support systems. 3.3. Difficulties
    in crop growth modelling In many situations, control engineers are designing controllers
    for a system that they can redesign. For instance, in electro-mechanical devices,
    one may be able to change the mechanical or electrical design in order to obtain
    a system that is ‘easier’ to model and control (e.g., reducing the extent of non-linear
    dynamics by more expensive or better designed hardware). In arable farming, we
    are dealing with a biological system where such modifications are difficult. Moving
    crops from arable lands into greenhouses is the primary example of how one might
    control part of the dynamics. For instance, farmlands located on an uneven terrain
    may see a movement of soil water due to gravity. When crops are placed in a greenhouse,
    they are most of the time placed in containers with soil, which can be set level
    and hence reducing (or even eliminating) such effects. In mechanical systems,
    a first approximation of the dynamics can often be done by an application of Newton’s
    second law of motion and constitutive relations such as Hooke’s law. It is then
    relatively easy to obtain a simple, yet descriptive, dynamical model. Further
    predictive performance is then obtained by adding more relations and including
    non-linear effects. The same can be said of electrical systems and thus also electro-mechanical
    systems. The basis of modelling crop growth for arable farming is ‘storage’ (integrator)
    of sugars, water, and biomass. Hence, it often exhibits first-order behaviour.
    The difference with the electro-mechanical situation discussed above is that most
    of the predictive performance of the crop growth models comes from the ‘non-linear
    inputs’. These non-linear inputs in crop growth modelling are not as well-known
    and often require a high degree of non-linearity and many (unknown) parameters.
    Recently, a successful instance of this approach was shown in Pelak et al. (2017),
    where a crop growth model with four first-order non-linear differential equations
    (the states are canopy cover, relative soil moisture, total nitrogen content in
    the soil, and the crop biomass) was demonstrated. The typical time scale for performing
    actions in farming is minutes to hours, whereas the time scale of crop growth
    dynamics is typically in the order of days. On top of that, the objective of decision
    making is often related to a terminal reward as harvesting is done at the end
    of the growing season, which has a duration of multiple months. In greenhouse
    management, the short-term decision making (temperature, ventilation, etc.) is
    often made by a closed-loop decision making system, whereas the long-term decisions
    are made by the farmer/grower (Van Straten et al., 2000). Increasingly more novel
    research is done towards extending the short-term decision making over increasingly
    longer time scales. This raises the question of how these facts can be leveraged
    to improve arable farming. Any practically useful crop growth model should be
    able to handle the different circumstances between farms. For example, a crop
    growth model should be able to take into account the local soil parameters, and
    climate and weather patterns. Not for the purpose of creating a ‘crop growth model
    for all’, rather due to the fact that designing a model for every farm and crop
    cultivar separately is not a sustainable option. It is therefore of interest that
    crop growth models for control can be calibrated with relative ease and have parameters
    that are ‘explainable’ to the user (i.e., no black-box parameters that require
    ‘tweaking’). Another reason why it is important to have explainable parameters
    in crop growth models is that models are continuously adapted due to the effects
    of climate change (Asseng et al., 2015) and responses at the farm-level to climate
    change are required (Reidsma et al., 2010). Hence, in order to be able to adapt
    models even slightly, a high degree of ‘explainability’ is needed. 3.4. Model-based
    control Model-based control in PA is concerned with computing the optimal allocation
    of resources such as water, fertiliser, and pesticides, to fields using models
    to predict the future crop growth. The objective by which the ‘best’ actions are
    judged is a combination of financial profit, risk aversion, and environmental
    impact. The current state-of-the-art for many arable farmers that make use of
    such models, is to run (Monte Carlo) simulations where the actions and weather
    patterns are varied. Based on the outcomes of these simulations, a reasonable
    set of actions is selected. See, e.g., Bergez et al. (2010) for an example application.
    In recent years, there have been several endeavours into optimal control methods
    that explicitly use crop growth models in order to compute the ‘optimal’ amount
    of water to irrigate crops, see, e.g., Cobbenhagen et al., 2018, Kalboussi et
    al., 2019 and for a model predictive control setting, see, e.g., Lozoya et al.,
    2014, Saleem et al., 2013, Schoonen et al., 2019. For illustrative purposes, we
    have included an example of the latter in the Appendix, which is based on previous
    work (Schoonen et al., 2019) by some of the authors of the present paper. On a
    larger scale, the control of irrigation networks between farms has been extensively
    studied in, e.g., Cantoni et al., 2007, Mareels et al., 2005, Negenborn et al.,
    2009. However, due to the large scale of irrigation networks, these controllers
    do not make use of crop growth models. The primary research directions we identify
    in model-based control for farm management are: (1) The design of control methods
    to be used with (existing) crop growth models. (2) The incorporation of the allocation
    of water, fertiliser, and pesticides into a single framework. (3) The scalability
    of control methods to large-scale systems. (4) How to deal with or exploit the
    time-scale separation between the crop/field dynamics and control actions (see
    Section 3.3) in control schemes. Related to these practical primary research directions,
    we identify several questions that may find a partial answer to the directions
    mentioned above. Firstly, the model-based approach may give answers to the question
    of which level of granularity in both time and space is optimal. The scalability
    of the control methods, item (3) in the list above, is especially important if
    the granularity is high. Secondly, it may increase our understanding of the interplay
    between when to fertilise and when to irrigate. There is much biological and ecological
    theory on how these factors influence each other and it is thus of interest to
    investigate what an optimal control approach would provide as the optimal pattern
    of applying fertiliser and irrigation. 3.5. State estimation and digital twins
    The use of sensors in arable farming has drastically increased over the past decades
    (Reyns et al., 2002) as well as research into vision-based sensing (Chen et al.,
    2002). These systems can measure a wide variety of properties of the crop and
    soil such as leaf area, soil water content, and soil conductivity. Not all of
    these measurements are properties that would typically be a state in a dynamical
    crop growth model. It is the use of empirical correlations that are employed in
    order to estimate the status of the crop using the measurements. For instance,
    using hyperspectral imagery of the crops, one can compute the NDVI (normalised
    difference vegetation index) from which approximations of the ‘leaf area index’
    and nitrogen content in the leafs can be obtained (see, e.g., Carlson and Ripley
    (1997)). State observers could be used in conjunction with on-line parameter updates,
    which enables the creation of ‘digital twins’ of the crops and fields. This provides
    better insights into what is happening on the fields and the importance of digital
    twins was stated in our central hypothesis in Section 3.1. The first research
    direction we identify from a control-theoretical perspective is to analyse which
    measurements lead to observability (or detectability) of the states of the crops
    and soils. Using the crop growth models for control it could be possible to design
    observers. See, e.g., Bono Rossello et al. (2019) for a recent example of using
    a simple water/soil model in order to design observers to monitor the soil water
    content. Secondly, the design of state observers could lead to an increase in
    understanding of where one wishes to sense. For instance, farmers that have several
    UAVs would like to know when and where they should fly them to collect measurements.
    At first glance, there are many possibilities: to the field with highest uncertainty
    of crop states, to the ‘best’ fields that have the highest (potential) yield,
    the ‘worst’ fields, and more. All these possibilities have their benefits and
    downsides, but the question remains which is the best in the grander scheme of
    farm management. Combined with a controller design, it may be possible to device
    the optimal policy of allocation of sensing agents such as UAVs. 3.6. Reduced-order
    crop models Reduced order crop growth models are especially useful in the crop
    growth management of large-scale farms. Consider the case where a farmland is
    divided into hundreds or thousands of subfields. Using reduced order crop growth
    models may then help to significantly reduce the computation time, while still
    performing well in such a large-scale setting. If one were to obtain a crop growth
    model that lends itself to be used to design controller and state estimators,
    a natural question would then be whether the closed-loop system is of minimal
    order.1 If the controller and sensors can achieve the same input–output behaviour
    with fewer states, then the system model is not minimal. Even if the model is
    minimal, it may be interesting to analyse which of the states are the most ‘important’
    in the model and subsequently obtain a reduced order model. Such an approach has
    the potential to objectively quantify the relative importance of sensors and resource
    inputs to the overall crop management. This would provide an interesting new perspective
    on the role of decisions and measurements in PA. 4. Advanced applications Building
    upon the essentials of model-based control and estimation in arable farming as
    discussed in Section 3.4, we present three advanced applications in this section.
    These applications are intercropping, multi-agent systems, and vertical farming.
    4.1. Intercropping: Enabling natural symbiosis When discussing arable farming,
    chances are that large swathes of land with a single crop come to mind. Naturally,
    crops would not grow as such large mono-cultures. There is a natural symbiosis
    between crops, other plants, bacteria, and animals that enable an exchange of
    protection and nutrition. Intercropping is the practice of cultivating different
    crops in close proximity with the intentional purpose to benefit from a natural
    symbiosis. Intercropping is one of the core applications within the science of
    agroecology (Wojtkowski, 2019). Initially, humankind’s first attempt at farming
    had different types of crops close together. As human societies grew larger, managing
    of such multi-crop fields became too difficult in order to satisfy the increasing
    demand of food as settlements grew in population. The difficulty in managing intercropped
    fields arises due to the fact that if many crops grow close to one another, it
    is more difficult to seed, monitor and harvest. Humanity therefore shifted towards
    monoculture farming over time as it was more efficient due to the available specialised
    tools and animal labour (later machine power). Yet, intercropping is still widely
    used by farmers with small lands in the tropics (Boudreau, 2013), but it currently
    is not manageable for large-scale farms. There are several advantages to intercropping.
    Firstly, by placing different types of crops close to one another, crops may benefit
    from natural protection from diseases (Boudreau, 2013). This reduces the need
    of pesticides and herbicides. Secondly, intercropping stimulates an increase in
    biodiversity in the soil and of insects. This can lead to an increase of nutrients
    for the crops and a healthier soil. Thirdly, the density of crops in a field can
    be higher in intercropping, which may lead to a higher yield. An example is placing
    a crop with deep roots near a crop with a shallow root system. Systematic research
    on intercropping started many years ago, see, e.g., the seminal work by Vandermeer
    (1989). However, it has even recently been argued that there still is a need of
    a systematic theory behind agroecology and intercropping (Wojtkowski, 2019). The
    interplay between crops, soils, and pests is delicate and not straightforward.
    For instance, intercropping in itself does not reduce pest damage (Smith & McSorley,
    2000 p. 154). It is evident that control theory and especially game theory may
    provide interesting new insights into the dynamics of intercropping (Wojtkowski,
    2019 p. 187). Yet, surprisingly little research has been done within these domains
    (to the best of our knowledge). An exception can be found in the domain of statistics
    (Federer, 1999, Lupatini et al., 2014). It is a great and highly relevant challenge
    for the domain of systems and control engineering to develop such theories for
    agroecology. The second challenge is of a more applied nature. Due to the fact
    that intercropped fields do not necessarily follow the ‘row orientation’ that
    conventional mono-cropped fields have, a new kind of machinery is required to
    seed, monitor, maintain, and harvest. We identify the computation of optimal patterns
    for such new machinery as the second challenge for control engineering within
    agroecology. It should be mentioned that there are forms of intercropping that
    follow the traditional ‘row orientation’, which is known as ‘strip cropping’ (Francis
    et al., 1986, Mousavi and Eskandari, 2011). In strip cropping, each row has the
    same type of crop, but adjacent rows may have different crops. A recent meta-analysis
    (Yu et al., 2015) has shown that intercropping can, on average, result in a 22%
    increase of crops relative to mono-cropping. Fig. 1 illustrates the differences
    between the various configurations of crop orientations. There is an even more
    advanced form of intercropping, namely agroforestry (Sanchez, 1995, Torralba et
    al., 2016). It takes ecology ‘into a third dimension’ and it is the science of
    cultivation crops in combination with trees. As in ecology, the aim is to improve
    productivity of the farm through symbiosis of the crops and trees. Evidently,
    this can increase the complexity of decision making and hence it is of interest
    to study it from the systems and control perspective. Download : Download high-res

    in configuration of crops on arable land: traditional monocropping (left), stripcropping
    (middle), and full intercropping (right). The different colours represent different
    crops. 4.2. Soil compaction and the disturbance of the top soil: Multi-agent systems
    and remote sensing By driving large machines over the soil, the biotope of the
    top-soil is heavily disturbed and compacted, which can have negative impacts on
    the soil health and the crop yield (Lipiec & Hatano, 2003). In order to manipulate
    the crop by the least amount and minimally disturb the biotope of the top-soil,
    the trend to make use of both lighter and smaller tractors, and remote sensing
    is evident. Application of nutrients and other resources is therefore challenging.
    Smaller resource-delivering vehicles (both ground or aerial) evidently have a
    smaller capacity. As discussed earlier, by careful monitoring one can reduce the
    amount of resources that need to be delivered to the crops. However, there are
    still considerable amounts that need to be delivered. In order to lessen the disturbance
    of the top soil, there are desires and trends to reduce the mass (or size) of
    a resource delivering agent by orders of magnitudes 10 to 100, whereas the decrease
    in resource delivered by advanced optimisation schemes will most likely be in
    the order of 1.2 to 2. This implies that many resource delivering agents are required
    in order to fulfil the resource demands for crop production. This warrants a careful
    deployment and allocation of agents. Hence, it is necessary to develop multi-agent
    optimisation tools. An example of a multi-agent resource allocation scheme for
    irrigation can be found in Schoonen et al. (2019). 4.3. Vertical farming In 2018,
    approximately 55% of the world population resided in urban areas. That number
    is expected to increase to 69% by 2050 (UN, 2018). With this global increase of
    urbanisation, there is a rising demand for locally grown food. Vertical farming
    is a way to incorporate farming into cities. It is called ‘vertical’ due to the
    fact that such farms take form of high-rise buildings where produce is grown on
    each floor (Benke and Tomkins, 2017, Garg, 2014). It has been shown that it has
    the potential to be an economically viable way to produce food with a small environmental
    footprint and area demand (Banerjee and Adenaeuer, 2014, Benke and Tomkins, 2017,
    Kalantari et al., 2018). Currently there are successfully operating vertical farms
    around the world, see, e.g., Benke and Tomkins, 2017, Kalantari et al., 2018 for
    an overview. The most successfully grown crops in vertical farming today are leafy
    greens (Sarkar & Majumder, 2015). Part of the reason of the low environmental
    footprint is that vertical farming requires less water than traditional farming
    as there is less evaporation and water can be recycled more easily. Many of the
    vertical farming operation make use of hydroponics, where the crops are placed
    in nutrient-enriched water rather than soil. This eliminates the need for fertiliser
    and pesticides (Benke & Tomkins, 2017). Since the farmlands are stacked upon each
    other in vertical farming, not every floor can obtain sunlight as well as in an
    ordinary greenhouse. Such artificial lighting comes at an increase in investment
    costs and energy costs which should, of course, be taken into account. Vertical
    farming poses challenges for many disciplines of engineering. The challenge we
    identify for system and control engineering is the automated management of crops
    in vertical farming. Just as in traditional greenhouses, the environment is closed,
    which allows for better monitoring and control of the crops. One might argue that
    this is no longer arable farming and it is more related to growing crops in greenhouses.
    The reason why we include vertical farming in the present paper is that there
    is a need for arable crops to be grown within the vertical farming environment.
    Hence, when designing models, controllers, or estimators for arable farming, it
    is of interest to consider how these would work in vertical farming in order to
    increase the number of crops that can be grown in such environments. 5. Practical
    considerations So far in this work we have discussed the challenges and opportunities
    for control engineering within arable farming. In this section we will provide
    several considerations and recommendations to take into account when tackling
    the challenges discussed throughout this work. 5.1. Domain knowledge The most
    important consideration is the involvement of domain experts. As mentioned in
    Section 3.3, crop growth modelling is an inter-disciplinary activity where researchers
    from disciplines such as agronomy, biology, and ecology have done a tremendous
    amount of work in order to better understand crop growth. Whether designing a
    crop growth model for control or adapting an existing crop growth model to be
    used in control, the domain knowledge is extensive and must be consulted. 5.2.
    User adoption In any case of practical controller design, one must take the user
    into consideration. This is definitely very much the case in arable farming. The
    control actions are, in general, performed by the farmer as the primary user.
    As mentioned, it may be the case in the future that robots perform farm management
    with the human out of the control loop, but this is currently not the case and
    will not be for the near future. With automated decision making with humans in
    the loop, the computed decisions and state estimations must be explainable to
    a reasonable degree. The most prominent reason is that if the computed decisions
    are not reasonable at first glance, then the user may not execute them at all.
    Notice for instance, that the terminology within PA for automated decision making
    algorithms is ‘decision support system’ (DSS): the farmer still makes the ultimate
    decision and is only advised by the DSS. We refer to Van Straten et al. (2000)
    for a survey done among suppliers of control systems for greenhouses as well as
    users of the control systems (i.e., farmers) on the requirements of control systems
    for proper adoption. One of the questions that was often asked by the farmers
    in this survey was whether the prediction models can be trusted (Van Straten et
    al., 2000 p. 233). It is thus of key importance that the crop growth models to
    be used in any control scheme should have an explainable behaviour. 5.3. Degree
    of available equipment Many novel robots, machinery, and sensors come to market
    every year. It is tempting to design automated decision making systems that use
    such hardware as there is obviously a market for such systems. As mentioned in
    Section 2.2, it is also of importance to design advanced decision making schemes
    that do not rely on such machinery. In the design of control methods for arable
    farming, one must thus take in mind which types of machinery and how much computing
    power will be available to the farmer. 6. Conclusion In this work we identified
    several research directions for control engineering research within the domain
    of precision agriculture (PA) for arable farming with the purpose of attracting
    control engineers and researchers to the highly relevant and interesting application
    domain. We presented an overview of the challenges that humanity faces and how
    PA can help to tackle these challenges. For research in the short term, we highlighted
    optimal control of resources through model-based control of crops, and estimation
    of crop and soil states as the main directions of research. We gave specific research
    questions on these topics and how they can lead to answering fundamental questions
    in farming operations. Using model-based crop growth management as a central notion,
    it was shown that deployment of ‘digital twins’ of crops and soils can help increase
    the precision of decision-making in agriculture and thus increase the quality
    and quantity of the food while taking into account environmental and financial
    aspects. Beyond control of resources, estimation, and control-relevant crop-modelling,
    relevant research directions for control engineering in advanced applications
    such as intercropping, multi-agent systems, and vertical farming were stated in
    detail. These are research directions for the long term. Many fundamental challenges
    in PA for arable farming can be researched from the perspective of control engineering
    and it offers the systems and control community an interesting and important research
    area. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no

    model-based control using existing crop growth models For illustrative purposes,
    we include an example of a control scheme that utilises some structure of several
    crop growth models in a model predictive control setting. In this example we consider
    a single field that is operated by a single irrigation agent. This example is
    a simple set-up of the more general setting as discussed in previous work by some
    of the authors of the present paper (Schoonen et al., 2019), which considers multiple
    (sub)fields and multiple irrigation agents. The model of the crop growth dynamics
    is here assumed to be a simulation model. Consider the set-up of a single arable
    field where the crops and soil are homogeneous over the space. Let denote the
    length of the growing season and we consider growth and actuation to occur on
    a daily basis, to this end we label time from the set ≔ . Let be the state vector
    of crops on day , where the states include, for instance, the biomass of the crop
    organs and the leaf area, and let denote the amount of water that is irrigated
    on day . Let be a vector that represents the relative weighting of the crop states
    to each other and the amount of irrigation. The simple objective we consider here
    is to maximise the crop yield at harvesting, whilst minimising the amount of irrigation
    (the cost of irrigation is normalised to 1). In a mathematical formulation, we
    consider the maximisation of (A.1) with , as the optimisation variables. The discrete-time
    dynamics of the crop are assumed to be for , where is the crop growth, which depends
    on the crop states, soil water content, weather influences and irrigation. Hence,
    we can rewrite (A.1) as (A.2) We resort to maximising using a model predictive
    control (MPC) scheme. A popular method to model crop growth is by introducing
    a hierarchy in growth and production factors (Van Ittersum et al., 2003): growth-defining
    factors, growth-limiting factors, and growth-reducing factors. The growth-defining
    factors determine the maximum possible growth and are dependent on crop-specific
    parameters and weather influences such as temperature and solar irradiation. The
    growth-limiting factors are due to shortage or excess of water and nutrients such
    as nitrogen. The growth-reducing factors are due to, e.g., weeds and pests. A
    common way to model the growth reducing factor due to water shortage is the following.
    Let denote the growth-reducing factor due to water shortage on day and let denote
    the soil water content. Furthermore, let be the wilting point such that if the
    soil water level is below , there is no growth possible ( ). Let denote the critical
    water level, which is dependent on both the state of the crop and weather influences.
    For , it is assumed that there is no reduction in growth due to water shortage
    ( ). Between and , increases linearly, see also Fig. A.2. Versions of such models
    for growth-reduction due to water shortage can be found in, among others, LINTUL2/3
    (Shibu et al., 2010), WOFOST (de Wit et al., 2019), STICS (Brisson et al., 2003),
    AquaCrop (Steduto et al., 2009) and a derivation thereof in Pelak et al. (2017).

    Fig. A.2. Dependency of growth-reduction factor on the soil water content for
    a day , where is the critical water level, is the wilting point and is the field
    capacity. For illustrative purposes, let us assume that there are no other growth-limiting
    factors and there are no growth-reducing factors. Under this assumption, the crop
    growth at time can be modelled as (A.3) where is the maximum potential growth
    (due to growth-defining factors). As an illustrative example of a , let us consider
    the crop growth model LINTUL2/3 (Shibu et al., 2010). In this model, the optimal
    growth is given by , where is the light-use efficiency in g MJ−1, is the total
    daily solar irradiation in MJ, is an attenuation coefficient and is the leaf area
    index (LAI) at time . From (A.3), one might be inclined to assume that the crop
    growth has been separated into a part that is dependent on the soil water level
    ( ) and one that is dependent on the crop states ( ), but there is an interplay
    between the soil water level and the crop growth. In the example with the LINTUL2/3
    model mentioned above, it is clear that this occurs through the LAI ( ), which
    is typically a state in most crop growth models. However, when doing MPC with
    a (relatively small) finite horizon of several days up to two weeks, many crop
    states do not vary much or their variation can be approximated. This allows the
    MPC to compute the optimal amount of irrigation needed for crop growth through
    and the crop growth model can provide a reasonable approximation for . The last
    item we need to take into account is that the objective function considers a ‘terminal
    cost’ as we require the crop state at the end of the season. It was shown in Schoonen
    et al. (2019) that a reasonable approximation is that the reduction of crop growth
    outside of the prediction horizon is equal to average reduction of crop growth
    within the prediction horizon. To this end, we perform two additional simulations,
    one where the growth is optimal from the current day to the end of the season,
    and one where there is almost complete stop of growth. Linear interpolation between
    the results of these two simulation by using the average crop growth reduction
    within the prediction horizon, yields an approximation for . In this way, we have
    limited the number of simulations to be done compared to a crop growth management
    system that uses Monte Carlo simulations, as it is only required to know (an approximation
    of) within the prediction horizon and an approximation of the yield at time of
    harvest. Furthermore, we are now able to use the amount of irrigation as an optimisation
    variable, rather than discretising it as is done in the Monte Carlo setting. This
    is especially important in the setting where we do not wish to irrigate a single
    field, but multiple (sub)fields (more than 100 or 1000) using a limited number
    of irrigation machinery. We refer to the original work (Schoonen et al., 2019)
    for more information on the control in this setting. This example only considered
    a single field, a single resource (water), and a single delivery agent. Farming
    considers many more (sub)fields, resources, and deliver agents. This introduces
    non-trivial constraints on the allocation that should be taken into account (see
    Schoonen et al. (2019)). Beyond such extensions, it is also of importance to consider
    the advanced applications as discussed in Section 4. It is evident that there
    are huge challenges for modelling, model-based management, large-scale control
    and optimisation, and estimation. References Asseng et al., 2015 Asseng S., Zhu

    Abstract Distributing water optimally is a complex problem that many farmers face
    yearly, especially in times of drought. In this work, we propose optimization-based
    feedback control to improve crop yield and water productivity in agriculture irrigation
    for a plantation consisting of multiple fields. The interaction between soil,
    water, crop (sugarcane in this work), and the atmosphere is characterized by an
    agrohydrological model using the crop water productivity modeling software AquaCrop-OS.
    To optimally distribute water over the fields, we propose a two-level optimal
    control approach. In this approach, the seasonal irrigation planner determines
    the optimal allocation of water over the fields for the entire growth season to
    maximize the crop yield, by considering an approximation of the crop productivity
    function. In addition, the model predictive controller takes care of the daily
    regulation of the soil moisture, respecting the water distribution decided on
    by the seasonal planner. To reduce the computational complexity of the daily controller,
    a mixed-logic dynamical model is identified based on the AquaCrop-OS model. This
    dynamical model incorporates saturation dynamics explicitly to improve model quality.
    To further improve performance, we create an evapotranspiration model by considering
    the expected development of the crop over the season using remote-sensing-based
    measurements of the canopy cover. The performance of the two-level approach is
    evaluated through a closed-loop simulation in AquaCrop-OS of a real sugarcane
    plantation in Mozambique. Our optimal control approach boosts water productivity
    by up to 30% compared to local heuristics and can respect water use constraints
    that arise in times of drought. Key Points A two-level optimization method is
    proposed that is tailored to solve the optimal irrigation problem of a large-scale
    plantation AquaCrop-OS is used to model the agrohydrological system using real
    data and to simulate a plantation consisting of multiple fields The proposed optimization
    method produces optimal irrigation schedules in periods of drought and maximizes
    water productivity 1 Introduction Global water demands are projected to increase
    by 20% to 30% by 2050 compared to 2010 levels, due to population growth and emerging
    economies (Burek et al., 2016). Agriculture is the largest global consumer of
    the available water resources, accounting for 69% of annual water withdrawals
    (IEA (International Energy Agency), 2016). Therefore, a pivotal step in addressing
    the alarming water scarcity problem is improving irrigation efficiency in agriculture.
    Conventionally, irrigation operates under open-loop conditions, making use of
    heuristics or empirical data. These traditional approaches miss out on real-time
    feedback information from the fields, such as evapotranspiration rates and soil
    moisture measurements. As a result, open-loop irrigation methods are often unable
    to irrigate with precision, leading to overirrigation. With increasing interest
    to achieve precision irrigation, model predictive control (MPC) has been explored
    in the past decade as an optimal feedback control method. In MPC, the evolution
    of a system (e.g., the crop field) is predicted using a model, subject to the
    control inputs (e.g., amount and timing of irrigation). These control inputs are
    then optimized with respect to the desired trajectory of the system states that
    would optimize some performance (e.g., maximize crop yield or minimize water use).
    The control inputs corresponding to the first time step are implemented and for
    the next time step the optimization procedure is repeated using newly obtained
    measurements and state estimates. Park et al. (2009) used MPC to maintain the
    soil moisture and salt levels of a field below a desired threshold. McCarthy et
    al. (2014) divided a heterogeneous field in zones based on spatial and temporal
    differences and used MPC to optimize irrigation. An MPC framework was developed
    in Saleem et al. (2013) using a water balance model for real-time irrigation scheduling
    to minimize the root zone soil moisture deficit and the amount of irrigation.
    Delgoda et al. (2016) identified a linear model based on the crop water productivity
    model AquaCrop using a water balance and used MPC to minimize the root zone soil
    moisture deficit, with a limit on the water supply. Mao et al. (2018) approximated
    a nonlinear agrohydrological model with a linear parameter varying model and used
    MPC to maintain the soil moisture within a desired target zone. The typical objective
    of the aforementioned studies is to maintain the soil moisture of a single field
    at a desired set point or within a target zone using hourly or daily time steps.
    However, the aforementioned methods do not relate water stress to yield, which
    is the main performance indicator for any crop in the real setting. Furthermore,
    water use should also be considered over the entire growth season (a priori preferably
    because farmers need to be able to plan ahead), not just from day to day as water
    resources are often limited and droughts are becoming increasingly common. This
    issue has been addressed in feedforward approaches (e.g., Dudley et al., 1971;
    Georgiou & Papamichail, 2008; Protopapas & Georgakakos, 1990; Wardlaw & Barnes,
    1999) that schedule irrigation over entire growth seasons. However, the main shortcoming
    of these later methods is that they miss out on real-time feedback information
    from the fields to help decide where and when to allocate the water. Recently,
    to optimize water allocation on both a daily and seasonal temporal scale, Nahar
    et al. (2019) have proposed a hierarchical feedback approach to maximize yield
    over an entire growth season. A top-level scheduler calculates a target soil moisture
    value for each remaining day in the growth season for a single field and a lower-level
    controller follows the target soil moisture. Then, the proposed closed-loop scheduling
    approach is compared to open-loop scheduling over a full season (by crop yield
    and water consumption). However, the authors were unable to show significant difference
    between the two approaches. In this paper, unlike in the papers discussed above,
    we consider the more general problem of optimal soil moisture control of multiple
    fields (e.g., a plantation) for a full growth season. Here we consider allocating
    water optimally over the growth season with daily irrigation control for multiple
    fields, while considering water availability changes throughout the season. This
    adds complexity to the control problem, as operational constraints need to be
    included (such as a limited number of fields that can be irrigated in a day) and
    trade-offs need to be made between irrigation and crop yield of the different
    fields. Furthermore, the growth stages of the fields can be different, as often
    not all fields can be planted and harvested at the same time. We propose a novel
    two-level feedback control approach for the water distribution of an entire plantation,
    in order to improve the water use efficiency and yield. A process schematic of
    the proposed two-level control approach is depicted in Figure 1. The seasonal
    irrigation planner determines the optimal distribution of irrigation water over
    the fields and growth stages of the crop for the entire growth season, in order
    to maximize the crop yield under scarce water conditions. We could also maximize
    economic return from the water. However, in this work we consider a plantation
    that has the same crop on all fields and so maximizing yield is the same as maximizing
    economic return. The daily irrigation controller uses MPC to regulate a target
    soil moisture zone subject to the (seasonal) irrigation constraints set by the
    seasonal irrigation planner and operational constraints. In our framework, we
    apply MPC in a receding horizon implementation, where the input sequence that
    yields an optimal predicted output while simultaneously satisfying all the constraints
    is computed using predicted weather conditions. Receding horizon control accomplishes
    feedback against uncertain disturbances by applying only part of the computed
    input sequence (here for 1 day) and then updating the system states using new
    information (e.g., deviations in temperature and precipitation) and recomputing
    the next optimal sequence a day later. As the prediction horizon slides along,
    this process of state updates using measurements, prediction and control optimization
    is repeated. This process is generally inherently robust to a small amount of
    uncertainty (Mayne et al., 2000), and good closed-loop performance can be expected
    in this application if the water availability and plant water demand do not change
    drastically. To validate our method we model a real sugarcane plantation from
    Mozambique in AquaCrop-OS (Foster et al., 2017) (the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations [FAO] standard for simulating the crop yield response when
    water is a key limiting factor in crop production) and evaluate the performance
    of our two-level optimization algorithm using closed-loop simulations in AquaCrop-OS.
    Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Process diagram for the proposed two-level
    optimization approach for precision irrigation. The seasonal irrigation planner
    first calculates the water amount that each field can use during each growth stage;
    the daily model predictive controller then regulates the soil moisture using irrigation
    control while respecting the water amount that the seasonal irrigation planner
    imposed. Note that if the water availability changes during the season the seasonal
    irrigation planner can reevaluate the water distribution. This paper is organized
    as follows: In section 2, we model the (1) agrohydrological system using a simple
    water balance from literature, which we expand on by including a novel mixed-logic
    saturation model; (2) evapotranspiration process by assimilating case study specific
    crop growth data and atmospheric parameters; (3) effect of water stress on crop
    growth using piecewise linear approximations of a crop yield model for sugarcane.
    We complete the section with an exposition of the complete optimization problem
    and our proposed two-level optimization method that is used to solve it. In section
    14, our proposed models are identified and validated on an AquaCrop-OS simulation
    model of a real sugarcane plantation in Mozambique. In section 17, we evaluate
    the performance of our two-level optimization method by conducting three closed-loop
    simulations using AquaCrop-OS involving (1) the effect of decreasing water use
    on crop yield, (2) comparing the water productivity of our proposed approach with
    the plantation''s approach of irrigation every 3–4 days to field capacity, and
    (3) assessment of the performance of our proposed approach under water scarcity.
    Section 22 summarizes some conclusions and further research required to realize
    an implementation of the proposed approach in the real irrigation system. 2 Modeling
    and Optimal Control The objective of precision irrigation is to maximize the yield
    and water efficiency by irrigating the fields with an adequate amount of water
    at the most suitable time instants. Therefore, the crop yield is maximized by
    minimizing the amount of water stress the crop is exposed to. This water stress
    occurs when not enough water is available in the root zone of the soil for the
    crop to absorb with its roots. Therefore, in order to minimize the water stress,
    a model of the agrohydrological system is needed that characterizes the interaction
    between soil moisture, the crop and the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effect of
    the water stress on the yield needs to be quantified per growth stage, such that
    irrigation is prioritized in the water sensitive stages. This is achieved by considering
    a simplification of the yield prediction function proposed in Raes et al. (2006).
    Finally, the irrigation of the fields is constrained by operational limitations,
    such as water availability or availability of human operators and/or machinery
    such as sprinklers. 2.1 Agrohydrological Modeling Here we consider a plantation
    with multiple fields, where each field j is characterized by a field-specific
    agrohydrological dynamical system. A schematic of this agrohydrological model
    for a single field is shown in Figure 2, together with water fluxes at the boundaries
    of the root zone. In the agrohydrological system, water transportation takes place
    by means of rainfall, drainage, evaporation, transpiration, and irrigation. Here,
    soil homogeneity for each individual field is assumed, that is, a field is modeled
    using a single soil layer, and a simplified water balance approach (Delgoda et
    al., 2016; Jensen et al., 1971) is used for irrigation control. This simplified
    water balance approach is selected over more complex modeling approaches like
    those of Mao et al. (2018) for computational feasibility reasons, as the complexity
    of the scheduling problem will grow exponentially with the number of fields in
    the later. Furthermore, the system will operate using a daily time step, for which
    the dynamics are more easily captured in a simple water balance. A crop experiences
    water stress when the potential energy of the soil water limits the availability
    of water extraction by the plants roots, that is, the total available water (TAW)
    in Figure 2 drops below the water stress threshold. This water stress threshold
    depends on the crop type and the evaporation power of the atmosphere. The water
    stress is expressed by the Root Zone Depletion (RZD) (Allen et al., 1998), which
    is the combined amount of rain and irrigation needed to bring the soil moisture
    content of the root zone back to field capacity. A negative RZD indicates excess
    water, which will be drained away from the field over time. Let the variable D
    represent the RZD of a field; then its dynamics can be given as follows (Allen
    et al., 1998): (1) where D(k) is the RZD at the end of day k, E∗(k) is the total
    crop evapotranspiration for the day, Pe(k) the effective rainfall (i.e., the rainfall
    reaching the soil after interception by the canopy), I(k) the irrigation depth,
    G(k) the deep percolation (drainage), R(k) the runoff, and k the time step in
    days. The groundwater tables of the fields we consider here are low; therefore,
    the contribution of capillary rise is considered negligible. Note that for notational
    convenience, we omit the field index j from the equations here. Furthermore, the
    variables from Equation 1 are all expressed in millimeters by normalizing over
    the surface area. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Basic water balance
    model (adapted from Allen et al., 1998, Figure 43), RAW and TAW stand for readily
    and total available water to the plant, respectively. The RZD indicates the required
    water amount to bring the soil moisture content back to field capacity. 2.1.1
    A Mixed-Logic Saturation Model The RZD is, as the name implies, dependent on the
    root zone depth (Zr) of the plant during its growth: (2) where θFC is the volumetric
    soil water content at field capacity and θ(k) the soil water content at end of
    day k, expressed in mm3/mm3. Following heavy rain or irrigation, the RZD might
    exceed the field capacity (D(k) < 0). Depending on the hydrological parameters
    of the soil this excess water will drain over multiple days (Raes et al., 2006,
    2018). However, for reasons of simplicity, we assume all fields are well drained
    and that the soil moisture content is back to field capacity at the end of the
    first day of free drainage. Note that for soils that are not well drained the
    deep percolating of the excess water may take longer than 1 day. However, we assume
    that for the majority of the days that the fields are operated the soils are unsaturated.
    Furthermore, in a closed-loop system with frequent measurements the soil moisture
    estimation errors introduced by this saturation modeling error are small. When
    the soil becomes saturated, it cannot hold any more water and the remaining irrigation
    or rainfall can be considered as surface runoff. However, any excess water is
    assumed drained in 1 day, so saturation never occurs and . Consequently, we rewrite
    Equation 1 to obtain the following agrohydrological model: (3) The conditionally
    switched depletion dynamics in Equation 3 can be converted into a set of linear
    dynamic equations and linear inequalities involving real and integer variables
    called a mixed-logic dynamical (MLD) model (Bemporad & Morari, 1999). 2.1.2 Remote
    Sensing Data-Based Evapotranspiration Model Evapotranspiration is the largest
    contributor to consumptive water use by crops in the agrohydrological cycle. Therefore,
    it is the main driver for irrigation and it should be estimated accurately to
    achieve precision irrigation. Using the Pennman-Monteith method (Allen et al.,
    1998) or the Priestley-Taylor equation (Priestley & Taylor, 1972), a reference
    evapotranspiration can be calculated that can then be adjusted with growth stage
    dependent coefficients for each crop type to estimate the actual evapotranspiration
    of a crop. In recent years, the application of remote sensing data for agricultural
    decision making has been researched extensively (e.g., Champagne et al., 2010;
    Estes et al., 1978; Martens et al., 2017; Mulla, 2013). A particularly promising
    remote-sensing-based vegetation index is the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI), which measures reflectance of the near-infrared and red range of
    the light spectrum. Vegetation can be particularly well measured using NDVI as
    plants contain varying amounts of chlorophyll that reflect the light in a distinct
    way. As a result, NDVI is strongly correlated with physiological processes like
    evapotranspiration (Kamble et al., 2013; Trout et al., 2008) and biomass (Goswami
    et al., 2015). In Zhang et al. (2015), evaporation for sugarcane in Hawaii is
    estimated using NDVI measurements. The NDVI values are used to estimate the canopy
    cover using linear regression and subsequently the canopy cover is used to estimate
    evapotranspiration using another set of linear regression models. This motivates
    using NDVI directly to obtain estimates of the crop evapotranspiration. For scheduling
    irrigation, we propose a new approach to model evapotranspiration that uses NDVI
    data as a surrogate for canopy size (as directly measuring canopy size for a large-scale
    plantation is infeasible) to indicate the expected progress of crop growth in
    a typical growth season. The evapotranspiration is partitioned into (soil) evaporation
    and transpiration. The evaporation largely depends on the area of the soil covered
    by the canopy, that is, when the canopy size increases a smaller fraction of the
    soil is exposed to the Sun and the evaporation will decrease. Conversely, when
    the canopy size increases the transpiration will increase as a larger canopy will
    generally consume more water. Therefore, an NDVI-based canopy size curve estimate
    can be used as a measure of the increasing transpiration levels over the season
    and also the corresponding fraction of water lost as evaporation, which decreases
    over the season. Creating an estimate of this expected crop growth in a growth
    season requires an NDVI data set, weather data, and planting and harvest dates
    from at least one past growth season of the fields. However, the growth of a crop
    depends heavily on the crop varieties, water stress, application of fertilizer,
    and soil type. Therefore, for a plantation, we assume that the group of fields
    used in the method grow the same crop with similar characteristics; this method
    can be repeated for each group of fields in a plantation to obtain accurate evapotranspiration
    estimates. In applications where small holder farmers are involved, this assumption
    may not be true and evapotranspiration models for each crop type could be aggregated.
    The first step of the method is to model the effect of seasonal air temperature
    changes on the different growth seasons. By incorporating the evolution of temperature
    over time, we correct for the effect of temperature on the crop development over
    the growing cycle. This is necessary because the planting and harvest dates describing
    each growth season can be different for each field, often due to logistical reasons,
    such as number of harvesting/planting machines available, human operator availability,
    and water availability. Using the planting date and air temperature data, the
    NDVI data points are linked to heat units, expressed in Growing Degree Days (GDD),
    to describe crop development (in °C day−1). In this approach, the time required
    to reach a particular growth stage is expressed in Cumulative GDD (CGDD) instead
    of number of days. Here we use the method from McMaster and Wilhelm (1997), a
    popular approach from among many methods, where both maximum and minimum temperatures
    are bounded before calculating the CGDD: (4) where the base temperature Tbase
    is the lower bound below which crop development halts. The average temperature
    Tavg is calculated using (5) (6) (7) where Tmax(k) and Tmin(k) are the maximum
    and minimum air temperature, respectively, and and are the maximum and minimum
    air temperature adjusted for the upper and lower thresholds that limit crop development.
    The upper threshold temperature Tupper indicates the upper bound on air temperature
    above which crop development no longer increases and Tbase is the temperature
    below which growth does not progress. The second step, involves fitting a curve,
    fNDVI, through the NDVI-CGDD points of all growth seasons of all fields that represents
    the expected evolution of the crop size over the season. Note that the type of
    curve appropriate to use depends on the quality and quantity of the data. The
    obtained curve describes the expected canopy size over the growth season as a
    function of the amount of “warmth” that the crops have experienced since planting.
    As a final step, evapotranspiration is split into an evaporation and a transpiration
    part. The evolution of both the transpiration and evaporation is described by
    the evolution of the canopy size captured by our NDVI-based curve. However, with
    an increase in the canopy size the transpiration increases and the evaporation
    decreases. Let (a new counter) denote the CGDD of the crop at the end of day k:
    (8) where k0 is the planting day of the field. Then, the evolution of the evaporation,
    fevap, can be described as a function of the curve fNDVI: (9) where (10) Consequently,
    the evaporation contribution to the evapotranspiration is assumed to be negligible
    when the canopy is fully grown. If this is not the case, a value higher than can
    be chosen to increase the value of fevap( ) in full grown canopy conditions. For
    the transpiration we can directly use the NDVI-based growth curve. Finally, the
    curves describing the evolution of the transpiration and evaporation over the
    growth season are used to estimate the evapotranspiration ( ) of the crop over
    the growth season: (11) where α1, α2, and α3 are coefficients that are estimated
    through linear least squares using the historic data of the reference evapotranspiration
    Eref( ). Furthermore, the linear term α3 corrects for the linear dynamics in evapotranspiration
    as a function of the season, which is not captured by the transpiration and evaporation
    curves. Note that temperature predictions are needed to estimate , which then
    allows to predict future evapotranspiration values using Equation 11. Furthermore,
    the reference evapotranspiration Eref( ) is the same for all fields, as we assume
    the fields are located in the same geographically small (i.e., same climate) area.
    2.2 Crop Yield Model 2.2.1 Defining Water Stress The amount of water available
    to the crop is the difference between the permanent wilting point (minimal amount
    of soil water required for the plant not to wilt) and the field capacity. However,
    when the soil water content drops below the water stress threshold (see Figure
    2), the roots cannot uptake water quickly enough to respond to the water demand
    and the crop starts experiencing stress. Furthermore, the deeper the roots the
    bigger the soil column from which the plant can draw water. Therefore, the point
    at which the crop starts experiencing water stress can be expressed as a function
    of the effective rooting depth: (12) where p ∈ [0, 1] is the fraction of the TAW
    below which the crop experiences water stress, θFC is the soil moisture content
    as a fraction of the field capacity, and θWP is the soil moisture content as a
    fraction of the wilting point. The roots are initially established at a small
    depth when the crops are first planted and gradually grow to the maximum depth.
    However, if the soil becomes too wet (D(k) < 0) the crop also starts experiencing
    water stress, due to anaerobic conditions and water logging. Therefore, we define
    the target zone in which the crop experiences no water stress as (13) The lower
    bound is enforced by the assumed rapid drainage, that is, D(k) ≥ 0 ∀k. To track
    the violation Dv(k) of the upper bound of the target zone, a performance constraint
    is introduced: (14) where ϵ(k) ∈ [0, p(θFC − θWP)Zr(k)] is a virtual state with
    the same bounds as D(k) in Equation 13. Note that when D(k) does not violate the
    target zone, we have , resulting in . This is true because we are solving a linear
    problem. Then, by penalizing the value of Dv(k), the violation of the upper bound
    of the target zone is minimized. 2.2.2 Modeling the Effect of Water Stress on
    Yield The effect of violating the target soil water content, that is, water stress,
    on the yield depends on both the reduction in the evapotranspiration (i.e., the
    level of water deficit) and the growth stage. As in the literature and standard
    FAO of the United Nations approaches (Steduto et al., 2012), we model the response
    of yield to water stress using sensitivity indices λℓ for each growth stage ℓ.
    These sensitivity indices, together with the potential water use Wp, ℓ and actual
    water use Wa, ℓ, specify the effect of water stress on yield decline in each growth
    stage (Doorenbos & Kassam, 1979): (15) where is the relative yield, the left-hand
    side is the relative decrease in yield, and denotes the fraction of reduction
    in water available to the crop in growth stage ℓ compared to the potential water
    use, that is, is the total crop water use without stress or other limiting factors.
    This Wp, ℓ value can be estimated using the evapotranspiration estimate derived
    in section 3: (16) where is a subset of days in the growth season during which
    the crop is in growth stage ℓ ∈ {1, … , Ngs}, where Ngs denotes the number of
    growth stages. Assuming optimal agronomic practice, the actual water use is equal
    to the potential water use when the soil moisture is in the target zone. However,
    when the tolerable depletion exceeds the threshold (Dv(k) > 0), the crop experiences
    water stress and the actual water use is diminished: (17) The effect of RZD on
    E∗( ) can be modeled by introducing a water stress factor Ks( ) (Allen et al.,
    1998): (18) where (19) We assume that under feedback control the soil moisture
    content will not be allowed to drop below the wilting point; therefore, the water
    stress factor can be reduced to (20) Next, by substituting Equations 16-20 in
    Equation 15, we can express the yield as a function of the root zone water dynamics:
    (21) Over the growth season, the sequence of relative yield decreases in each
    stage are multiplied to compute the overall yield decrease (Hanks, 1974; Jensen,
    1968). This however results in a high-order (i.e., order equal to number of growth
    stages) nonlinear function with multiplicative terms between all variables. Therefore,
    the overall yield is often approximated using a first-order (i.e., additive) compounding
    function (Bras & Cordova, 1981; Stewart et al., 1977), which we use for the MPC
    controller as the multiplicative approach is not computationally feasible. Although
    the additive approach is used to formulate our yield maximizing objective functions,
    the performance of the MPC controllers are tested using the multiplicative formula
    in closed-loop simulations with AquaCrop-OS. Note that for the seasonal irrigation
    planner, the multiplicative compounding function is approximated by a piecewise
    function, see section 8. Consequently, the performance criterion of the MPC controller
    is expressed as follows: (22) The only variable in Equation 22 that we can manipulate
    is Dv(k) by controlling the amount of irrigation. The other variables can all
    be calculated or predicted before each optimization iteration of the MPC problem.
    Therefore, the water stress cost (Jws) to minimize in order to maximize the yield
    can be expressed as follows: (23) where wℓ( ) is the weight on water stress in
    growth stage ℓ: (24) The evapotranspiration of each growth stage can be predicted
    a priori for the entire growth season using historic data, predictions of the
    temperature, and Equation 11. Furthermore, estimates of the crop sensitivity indices
    can be obtained from literature (see Allen et al., 1998) or can be estimated using
    a crop model analysis. Moreover, estimates of the root depth can be obtained from
    field measurements or literature. Therefore, the weights wℓ can be calculated
    a priori for the current growth season. Moreover, note that the framework presented
    in this work is flexible in choosing sensitivity indices: any number of growth
    stages can be defined. The crop yield will be maximized over a finite prediction
    horizon with length Np using a rolling horizon approach (Camacho & Bordons, 1995),
    that is, MPC. For computational reasons, the prediction horizon will likely not
    cover the entire growth season. Therefore, we rewrite Equation 23 to (25) where
    is a subset of days in the prediction horizon during which the crop is in growth
    stage ℓ ∈ {1, … , Ngs}. 2.3 Optimal Irrigation Allocation Over Growth Stages Anticipating
    droughts, local water authorities often limit the amount of water that each farmer
    can use for irrigation in the upcoming growth season or year. However, how to
    allocate this water over the fields and the growth stages to maximize profit or
    yield is nontrivial. The allocation does not only depend on maximization of the
    yield but also costs such as the fixed costs of planting (or not planting), costs
    of fertilizer use, and costs of required machinery for irrigation. However, all
    these costs can simply be included as objectives in the optimization problem,
    emphasizing the generality of our modeling approach. For the purpose of this work,
    we only consider the allocation of the available water over all fields to maximize
    the yield, such that no crops die. This optimal water allocation optimization
    is performed by the seasonal irrigation planner, before the growth season starts,
    as the management of the plantation will have to plan ahead the allocation of
    other resources such as machines and labor. Although the water availability throughout
    the season could change, in this work we assume that the water availability is
    known before and will not change (as it is agreed upon in the yearly contract
    with the local water authority). However, in our formulation we keep track of
    how much water was applied in past growth stages of each of the fields and their
    current progress in the season. Therefore, the seasonal irrigation planner can
    be used to redistribute the water throughout the season given the new water availability
    constraints. To model the effect of water deficit and stress on yield as accurately
    as possible, the multiplicative compounding function is used to plan water allocation
    for a growth season. Let denote the set of fields and let be the estimate of the
    potential water use in growth stage ℓ of field . Then, the total yield Ytot of
    a plantation for a growth season is described by the summation of crop yields
    computed by the multiplicative compounding function: (26) where Aj is the surface
    area of field j, Yp the potential yield per area (which is assumed the same for
    each field), and Wa, ℓ, j is the actual water use of field j in growth stage ℓ.
    Furthermore, the total water use over the growth season is (27) Then, if the plantation
    is assigned an amount of water Wmax for the growth season, the optimal water allocation
    problem can be defined as (28a) (28b) (28c) where Tℓ ∈ [0, 1] is the minimum relative
    water use of each growth stage below which the crop suffers terminal moisture
    stress and dies ( ). Note that the optimization problem is nonlinear and nonconvex,
    due to the multiplicative compounding function. Furthermore, the constraint needs
    to be satisfied for the problem to be feasible. A crop kite is a tool that visualizes
    the space of possible yields and actual water uses when considering the effect
    the temporal distribution of water use has on the yield (Smilovic et al., 2016).
    The solutions to the optimization problem from Equation 28a define the upper bound
    of the crop kite, see Figure 3. The crop is essentially a convex set that indicates
    how much effect the temporal water use distribution can have on the yield. For
    example, when only 70% of the potential water use is available the resulting yield
    can be anywhere from 22% to 55% of the potential yield, depending on how the water
    is allocated across the growth stages in the growth season. Figure 3 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint In green the crop kite of sugarcane, using crop sensitivity
    values from Table 1 and . The red crosses and lines represent a piecewise affine
    approximation of the upper bound of the crop kite using Equation 32. The optimization
    problem from Equation (28a) is nonconvex and the difficulty of solving it scales
    exponentially with the number of fields. Therefore, we approximate it to render
    our seasonal irrigation planner computationally feasible. First, consider the
    alternative problem formulation in which we have to allocate water to one growth
    stage ℓ until , then where to allocate the remaining water to another growth stage,
    and so on. This alternative optimization problem is a scheduling problem: What
    is the best order of growth stages to allocate the available water to in order
    to maximize the yield? To answer this question, consider the contribution values
    cℓ of each growth stage ℓ per water unit to the yield: (29) The ranking of the
    cℓ values determines the solution to our alternative problem: each growth stage
    receives the minimum required amount of irrigation for the crop not to die (feasibility
    requirement for a solution to this problem), then the growth stage with highest
    contribution cℓ receives water up to potential water use (or however much water
    is available), then the remaining water is allocated to the growth stage with
    second highest contribution value, and so on. Let be the set of growth stages
    with a contribution value ci or higher and be the set of growth stages with a
    contribution value lower than ci, where i ∈ {1, … , Ngs}. Then, the upper bound
    of the crop kite is approximated by a set of points (one for each growth stage).
    Each of the points consists of a relative yield coordinate (Yi) and a relative
    water use coordinate (Wi): (30) (31) These points can be calculated a priori for
    each growth season and are connected with straight lines (as we increase water
    use for one growth stage at a time) to form a piecewise affine approximation of
    the upper bound of the crop kite: (32) This piecewise affine approximation of
    the upper bound of the crop kite can be calculated for all fields using the potential
    water use predictions. Furthermore, by using binary variables to model the switching
    behavior, Equation 32 can be converted to an MLD system following the method of
    Bemporad and Morari (1999). Then, denote by the expected yield of field j using
    the MLD reformulation of Equation 32. Consequently, the nonlinear, nonconvex optimization
    problem from Equation 28a can be reduced to an mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) problem: (33a) (33b) (33c) which can be efficiently solved using state-of-the-art
    MILP solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi. The solution can then be used to constrain
    the water use of each growth stage for each field, in order to maximize the total
    yield with the available water. To illustrate the performance of the piecewise
    approximation, the upper bound is approximated for the crop kite depicted in Figure
    3, see the red curve and crosses. Because of the nonlinearity of the multiplicative
    compounding function the contribution values actually change as water is allocated
    to growth stages. However, in the approximation we assumed fixed contribution
    values (i.e., average contribution per unit of water). This assumption introduces
    errors when the contribution values are similar, as then the available water should
    be divided between the competing growth stages for optimality. This is actually
    the case for the third and fourth growth stages of the example in Figure 3. Here,
    the contribution values of the third and fourth growth stage are 0.2026 and 0.2208,
    respectively. However, the approximation is still good in this case, as the estimation
    error is small. As a future improvement the water could be split between growth
    stages that have similar contribution values to reduce the error, for example:
    If the contribution values are within a tolerance of 0.05, the remaining water
    is divided half-half between the two growth stages. 2.4 Operational Constraints
    The feasibility of the calculated daily irrigation schedules depends on the local
    operational constraints of the plantation. These constraints can be divided in
    two groups: Resource constraints: These constraints indicate a limitation in the
    availability of certain resources required for irrigation, for example, availability
    of human operators or sprinklers. Another example that often constrains the irrigation
    of the fields is the maximum amount of water that can be used for irrigation over
    a growth season or year. This amount is often decided on by local water authorities
    or the government in anticipation of droughts. Hydraulic infrastructure constraints:
    These constraints define the bounds of the daily amount of irrigation. The pumps,
    channels, and gates conveying water to the fields have a limited capacity. Note
    that the hydraulic dynamics of water conveyance and the operating of pumps, valves,
    and gates is not part of this work and will require further research. Any type
    of resource and hydraulic infrastructure constraints can be included in the framework
    presented in our work. However, for illustrational purposes, we only consider
    two resource constraints and one hydraulic infrastructure constraint. The resource
    constraints are the maximum number of fields that can be irrigated in a day and
    the maximum irrigation water use of the entire season calculated using the approach
    from section 8. The hydraulic infrastructure constraint defines an upper bound
    on the daily amount of irrigation that is determined by the maximum gate flow
    through the inlet to the fields. 2.4.1 Maximum Number of Fields Scheduled for
    Irrigation Depending on the water delivery capacity of the hydraulic infrastructure
    and the daily availability of the aforementioned resources a certain maximum number
    of fields can be irrigated in a working day. Let δj(k) be the binary decision
    variable that indicates whether to irrigate a plot at day k. Moreover, let be
    the desired amount of irrigation. Then, the following mixed-integer linear inequalities
    (Bemporad & Morari, 1999) will satisfy , : (34a) (34b) (34c) (34d) where (35)
    (36) It is assumed that the number of fields that can be irrigated on day k of
    the prediction horizon, Nf(k), is known a priori at each optimization iteration.
    Thus, to respect the maximum number of fields to irrigate the constraint (37)
    is sufficient. 2.4.2 Restricting Water Use Over Growth Seasons The seasonal irrigation
    planner solves the optimization problem from Equation 33a to determine the maximum
    water use Wa, ℓ, j for each growth stage ℓ for each field j. This amount can then
    be used to constrain the water use for each growth stage of each field. However,
    the prediction horizon may not extend to the entire growth stage. In that case,
    the daily irrigation controller cannot oversee the consequences of using too much
    water at the start of the growth season. Therefore, the following constraint is
    used for the water use of field j in growth stage ℓ in the prediction horizon:
    (38) where Wprev, ℓ, j is the amount of water that has previously been applied
    to the field in growth stage ℓ, is the set of days that field j is in growth stage
    ℓ in the prediction horizon, and is the number of remaining days that field j
    will be in growth stage ℓ. At the start of each optimization iteration the value
    of Wprev, ℓ, j is updated with the irrigation from the previous day(s). In case
    there is a lot of precipitation at the start of the growth stage, the amount irrigated
    will be small and Wprev, ℓ, j will remain relatively small. As a result, more
    water is available for the rest of the season. Furthermore, if the water availability
    changes in the season, the seasonal irrigation planner can optimize Equation 33a
    again given the new situation and the previously applied water amounts, to obtain
    a new water distribution schedule for the future growth stages of all fields.
    2.5 Operational Optimization Problem Formulation In the daily irrigation control,
    minimizing the water stress cost defined in Equation 25 results in a minimization
    of the violation Dv(k) for all fields over the prediction horizon. As a result,
    Equation 14 can be rewritten into (39) (40) As the optimization problem is linear,
    the minimization of Dv(k) implicitly also minimizes D(k); consequently, Equation
    3 can be rewritten as follows: (41) (42) Reformulation of the two state update
    equations (Equations 3 and 14) into four linear inequalities eliminates the need
    to model their switching behavior using binary variables, reducing the computational
    burden significantly. However, the optimization problem is still an MILP problem,
    due to the operational irrigation constraints: (43a) (43b) (43c) (43d) (43e) (43f)
    (43g) (43h) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a weight factor indicating the relative importance
    of water use minimization with respect to water stress minimization and γ(k) > 0
    is a weight factor indicating the relative importance of irrigating earlier or
    later in the prediction horizon. Furthermore, Dv, j(k) is the RZD upper bound
    violation on field j. Note that the bold symbols (e.g., D(k)) denote vectors containing
    the respective variables for each field in the plantation. The formulated MILP
    problem can be efficiently solved using state-of-the-art MILP solvers such as
    CPLEX or Gurobi. 3 Model Identification and Validation The control approach proposed
    in our work will be evaluated on a simulation of a specific furrow-irrigated area
    of the Xinavane Sugar Estates (Tongaat Hulett) in Xinavane, Mozambique (see Figure
    4). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint In (a) the geographical location
    of the study area is depicted. In (b) the layout of the fields subject in this
    work is depicted. A pumping station pumps water out of the river into a system
    of concrete canals from which the water is conveyed into earth canals by opening
    gates. From the earth canals (that are adjacent to the fields) the water is siphoned
    into the furrows of the fields. The sugarcane plantation is competing with the
    water needs of a rapidly urbanizing population downstream, increasing agricultural
    and industrial water uses under the stresses of climate change (Gelcer et al.,
    2018). Furthermore, storing water is not possible and the large-scale plantations
    consist of multiple clusters of fields, which each have their own (downstream)
    pumping stations that draw water from the same river; therefore, Tongaat Hulett
    has the objective to use as little possible as water while maximizing yield. The
    selected area has a size of approximately 420 ha divided over 24 plot served by
    a network of open canals. Each plot consists of two to four fields, adding up
    to 79 fields in the selected area. There is an upstream gate and canal present
    for each of the fields, so they can be irrigated separately. The fields are currently
    irrigated every 3–4 days by human operators, the net irrigation requirement is
    approximately 1,650 mm/year, and the average precipitation in the area is approximately
    650 mm/year. Through a network of open canals each field is provided water by
    an upstream gate with a maximum capacity of 60 liters per second. This maximum
    flow to the field together with the 8 hour working day of the operators, constrain
    the maximum amount of irrigation that can be applied to each plot. Each of the
    fields considered in this work is modeled as an agrohydrological system in AquaCrop-OS,
    using soil and crop parameters that are representative of the in-field situation
    in Xinavane (and that are taken the same for each field). Note that lateral dynamics
    are not included in the modeling approach: So fields have no effect on adjacent
    fields. Furthermore, the rainfall and temperature is assumed equivalent for each
    field, as the fields are located in the same geographically small (same weather)
    area. Note that the application efficiency of furrow irrigation is incorporated
    in the identification process of the water balance model used in the daily irrigation
    controller; therefore, our method is not restricted to a specific infield irrigation
    strategy as we can account for the different application efficiencies in the MPC
    model. The complete set of parameters of the soil, the crop, and the field management
    settings used for modeling the fields can be found in the supporting information.
    3.1 Data for Agrohydrological Modeling For each field in the case study area,
    the recorded planting and harvest dates from 2013–2017 were used. Furthermore,
    from conversations with local operators and management the local irrigation practice
    can be summarized as follows: After initially planting the sugarcane (or shoots
    in case of ratooning), the (dry) field is irrigated to field capacity to promote
    the germination, this initial irrigation cycle can take up to 3 days. Next, over
    the course of the growth season the field is irrigated to field capacity with
    an irrigation frequency of once every 4 days. Finally, when the sugarcane has
    matured, the field is harvested and after approximately one week the field is
    replanted and the next growth season commences. Unfortunately, accurate and sufficiently
    detailed data on local irrigation records and soil moisture measurements were
    not available. Therefore, using the aforementioned irrigation practice, real historic
    growth season weather data, and the calibrated soil and crop parameters (e.g.,
    canopy decline/growth coefficients, soil evaporation coefficients, and soil composition;
    see the supporting information), the growth seasons are recreated using simulations
    in AquaCrop-OS. The resulting data set of 316 growth seasons spread over 5 years
    and 79 fields can then be used for identification of the proposed model. This
    data set consists of evapotranspiration data, canopy cover data, soil moisture
    data, rooting depth data, and yield data. 3.2 Identifying and Validating the Evapotranspiration
    Model The evapotranspiration model (see Equation 11) uses an estimate of the size
    of the canopy cover as a function of thermal time (in the form of an NDVI-CGDD
    curve, see Equations 9 and 11) to fit the coefficients α1, α2, and α3 using the
    evapotranspiration data set generated in AquaCrop-OS. However, AquaCrop-OS does
    not generate NDVI data; instead, canopy cover data are directly used to estimate
    the size of the canopy cover as a function of the thermal time. The average evolution
    of the canopy cover over thermal time is estimated using a random half of the
    generated canopy cover data set. During each growth season the evolution of the
    canopy cover will be slightly different, due to different atmospheric conditions.
    To obtain a smooth curve that best describes the average canopy cover development,
    we use the following procedure: Divide the canopy cover data points into Ng groups,
    based on evenly spaced sections of the thermal time. This number of groups depends
    on the density of the data: The more data points the more groups can be used.
    For each group calculate the average thermal time and the average size of the
    canopy cover; this is a new data point. Therefore, the number of groups should
    be chosen such that the distance between the new data points is minimized, while
    still obtaining a smooth curve. Finally, draw a curve through the new averaged
    data points. We use a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP)
    (Fritsch & Butland, 1984) that interpolates the data locally using a cubic function.
    Note that quadratic or linear interpolation can also be used. In this case, cubic
    interpolation was chosen as a compromise between number of coefficients and accuracy
    of the fit. The resulting size of the canopy cover when using is depicted in Figure
    5. In Figure 5a, the raw data points of the size of the canopy cover as a function
    of thermal time are depicted that are obtained by simulating local practice of
    irrigating to full capacity every 4 days. Note the enlarged box illustrating the
    (tight) spread of the data. In Figure 5b the resulting PCHIP curve is plotted
    that connects the decimated data points. The curve is smooth without any sudden
    jumps. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint In (a) the canopy cover data
    points are depicted. In (b) the decimated data points (triangles) and the resulting
    PCHIP curve are shown. In (c) the modeling errors of the evapotranspiration model
    are depicted as a function of the thermal time. Next, the canopy cover PCHIP approximation,
    temperature data, and reference evapotranspiration data from the identification
    half of the data set are used to estimate the model coefficients from Equation
    11 using linear least squares. The model coefficients are determined as with a
    root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.55 mm and a variance accounted for (VAF) of
    93.58%. Furthermore, in Figure 5c the spread of the modeling error as a function
    of the thermal time for the validation set is depicted. Here, the modeling error
    (ME) is defined as follows: (44) The evapotranspiration model performs best when
    the canopy cover reaches its maximum size. Conversely, when the size of the canopy
    cover is low and when the crop starts to age the contribution of the evaporation
    to the overall evapotranspiration is high. The evaporation dynamics are not well
    captured as wetting events are not included in the modeling. However, the model
    is still able to provide estimates for the evapotranspiration within a 25% error
    margin for over 75% of the growth season. Furthermore, sugarcane is relatively
    insensitive to water stress in the last growth stage (Doorenbos & Kassam, 1979;
    Robertson & Donaldson, 1998); therefore, modeling errors in this growth stage
    will likely not have a large influence on the controller''s performance. We note
    that the spread of the canopy cover data points is rather small and unrealistic
    in Figure 5a. To illustrate that the proposed method also works in the real world,
    we have also constructed an NDVI-CGDD curve using real NDVI data for the Xinavane
    area, which is shown in the supporting information for this manuscript. 4 Simulation
    Results and Discussion To evaluate the performance of the proposed feedback control
    scheme, we conduct closed-loop simulations with the complex crop water productivity
    model AquaCrop-OS. Although our control model uses a simple water balance (see
    Equation 1) with only a nonzero drainage term when the soil becomes saturated
    (see Equation 3), the AquaCrop-OS model does include more complex dynamics; for
    example filtration is modeled using spatial discretization of the soil layer(s)
    (Raes et al., 2009). The sufficiency of a simple control model is shown in the
    closed-loop performance of three complex system simulations on AquaCrop-OS in
    sections 18–20. In the first simulation, we investigate the effect of decreasing
    the water availability on the yield, when using the proposed control scheme. In
    the second simulation, a comparison is made between the performance of the local
    irrigation approach and the proposed MPC approach in terms of water productivity
    and yield. In the last simulation, the water saving capabilities of the MPC approach
    are compared with that of the local irrigation approach by constraining the amount
    of irrigation for each growth season. 4.1 Simulation Settings The goal of the
    simulations is to investigate the maximum (theoretical) benefit that can be achieved
    by using an optimal control approach. Therefore, no stochastics are added to the
    simulations and perfect root zone soil moisture measurements for all fields are
    assumed to be available at the start of each day. In the preseason, the soil moisture
    measurements that the daily irrigation controller receives are at an depth of
    30 cm, the depth at which the roots initially establish after planting. Furthermore,
    a perfect forecast of the evapotranspiration, temperature, rainfall, and planting
    and harvest dates is assumed to be available to the daily irrigation controller.
    Conversely, the controller imitating the local irrigation practice has information
    on the exact amount of irrigation required to irrigate to field capacity and applies
    this to the field, provided it does not violate the maximum amount of irrigation.
    To that end, each field is provided water by an upstream gate with a maximum capacity
    of 60 L/s. This maximum flow to the field together with the 8 hr working day of
    the operators constrains the maximum amount of irrigation that can be applied
    to each field. The sensitivity indices and growth stage definitions that the two-level
    approach uses are listed in Table 1. The sensitivity indices are derived from
    Moutonnet (2002), the growth stage lengths in number of days are retrieved from
    the provided example files for sugarcane in AquaCrop-OS, and the thermal times
    are calculated using Equation 4 with a base temperature and maximum temperature
    of 12°C and 32°C, respectively, and historic data from Xinavane. Table 1. Growth
    Stage Definitions Used for Simulations Growth stage Length (days) Length (CGDD)
    λℓ Establishment 7 82 0.4a Tillering 53 618 1.2a Yield formation 270 3,151 1.2a
    Ripening 35 408 0.1b a These values are taken from Moutonnet (2002). b This value
    is taken from Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). All simulations start on 30 May 2013,
    7 days before the first field is planted and end on 31 December 2017. In this
    period, all fields will have had four full growth seasons. The relative cost of
    irrigation to water stress is set to , a value small enough to ensure the controller
    irrigates whenever necessary to avoid violating the RZD upper bound and big enough
    to provide an incentive to not waste water. Moreover, irrigation should be delayed
    if it is not directly required to avoid violating the defined soil moisture bounds.
    To provide this information to the daily MPC controller, we penalize irrigation
    at the end of the prediction with and with (see Equation 43c) at the beginning
    of the horizon and linearly interpolate the cost between the two. Finally, the
    fraction of the available water at which the crop starts to experience stress
    is set to %. An important remark is that the daily MPC controller can irrigate
    in the fields in the preseason, if necessary. However, no costs are included in
    the optimization problem to penalize soil moisture deficits in the preseason;
    therefore, if the controller decides to irrigate a field in the preseason it is
    only in anticipation of a soil moisture threshold violation after the field has
    been planted. Furthermore, as mentioned above irrigation is delayed unless necessary
    to avoid violating the RZD bounds. Therefore, the daily irrigation controller
    will only irrigate in the preseason if the field is too dry before planting or
    when the daily irrigation controller is constrained by an irrigation frequency
    (which is the case in Simulations 2 and 3 in sections 19 and 20, respectively).
    Note that if the daily irrigation controller applies irrigation in the preseason
    the used water is added to the total water use in the upcoming season in all simulations.
    4.2 Simulation 1: Effect of Decreasing Water Availability on Yield The effect
    of water stress on yield (summarized in yield sensitivity indices) is often based
    on open-loop predictions and regression methods. Therefore, in this first simulation
    we investigate the effects of restricting water use on closed-loop results. First,
    we establish the potential water use when using full (optimal) irrigation: Each
    of the fields can be irrigated daily, only limited by the maximum amount of water
    that can be provided by the upstream gate and the length of a working day. Ideally,
    the prediction horizon covers the whole growth season; however, limited by the
    available memory on the computer used for simulations we set the length of the
    prediction horizon to  days (as large as possible). As the irrigation frequency
    is not bounded for this simulation, the constraints from Equation 34a are relaxed
    (removing all integer variables from the optimization problem) and the problem
    is reduced to a continuous linear programming problem. The results indicate, for
    each field, how much water is required in each growth stage for maximum yield.
    Then, for a fraction of this potential water use we calculate the optimal water
    allocation for each growth season of each individual field using Equation 32.
    These amounts are then used to constrain the water use in each growth stage of
    each field. The result is an approximation of the upper bound of the crop kite
    (from Figure 3), see the beeswarm plot in Figure 6a. The yield declines progressively
    as the water is increasingly restricted. In Figure 6b, the rainfall and evapotranspiration
    data is depicted for each of the seasons. The low amount of rainfall in Season
    3 explains the rapid yield decline when reducing actual water use: The decrease
    in amount of irrigation is a larger proportion of the total seasonal water in
    dry seasons than rainy seasons. The reason that Season 1 maintains a higher yield
    under water stress than the other seasons is that the soil moisture is initialized
    at field capacity for all fields. Therefore, a buffer of water is retained in
    the soil below the crop''s roots, which is tapped into as the root depth increases.
    After the first season, this extra water source can be depleted. Figure 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint In (a) the effect of decreasing water use on the yield
    is depicted in beeswarm plots; for each restricted water use on the horizontal
    axis a collection of points is depicted that represent the relative yields of
    each field in the seasons. This figure shows the reduction in yield we can expect
    when water use is reduced under different atmospheric conditions. To clarify the
    spread of the results the potential evapotranspiration is plotted against the
    rainfall in (b). 4.3 Simulation 2: MPC Versus Local Irrigation Practice In this
    second simulation, we compare the performance of the proposed MPC approach with
    that of the irrigation practice described in section 14. In this local irrigation
    practice of Mozambique, the fields are irrigated every 4 days. Constraints are
    added on the number of fields that can be irrigated each day (Equation 37) to
    ensure the daily MPC controller does not irrigate more frequently than the local
    practice. Furthermore, both the MPC and the local irrigation approach have no
    maximum water use constraint in this simulation. The optimization problem that
    is repeatedly solved by the daily MPC controller at each time step in Simulations
    2 and 3 belong to the class of MILPs, which we solve using Gurobi (v8.1.1) (Gurobi
    Optimization, 2015) accessed via its MATLAB interface. Although Gurobi can find
    solutions with arbitrarily small optimality gaps to the globally optimal solution,
    the computational effort (measured in CPU time) can become too large based on
    problem size and the prescribed optimality gap. To complete our simulations to
    ‘near’ optimality within a reasonable time frame, we set the prediction horizon
    length to  days and set the relative optimality gap tolerance to 1%. To account
    for pathological cases we limit the maximum computation time to 3,600 s. This
    prediction horizon is still large enough to cover the first two growth stages
    completely (7 and 53 days, respectively). In Figure 7, we show the amount of water
    used for irrigation in all four seasons against the final attained yields for
    all fields. For all fields, the MPC controller uses less water while producing
    an equal or higher yield than the local irrigation practice. The amount of water
    that the MPC controller can save with respect to the local practice seems to be
    proportional to the amount of rainfall in a season. This is especially noticeable
    in Figure 7c, where the difference in water use is small and the season was relatively
    dry (see Figure 6b). Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A comparison of
    the water productivity of the MPC controller and the local irrigation practice
    for each of the four growth seasons. In (a)–(d) the results of, respectively,
    Seasons 1–4 are shown. 4.4 Simulation 3: Irrigation Under Water Scarcity To illustrate
    the water saving capabilities of our MPC approach over the local approach of simply
    irrigating every few days (described in section 14), we now consider a simulation
    scenario in which available water volume is limited. As opposed to the first simulation,
    we limit the TAW volume of all the fields combined to 80% of the potential total
    water use (established by the results from the first simulation). Therefore, in
    this simulation we solve the optimization problem from Equation 33a for all fields
    at once (for one growth season at a time). The result is a maximum water volume
    per growth stage per field for a single growth season, such that the overall crop
    yield of that season is maximized. These maximum water volumes are then converted
    to irrigation depths using the surface areas of the fields. Finally, the irrigation
    depth per season per field is constrained using the inequality constraint from
    Equation 38. Note that, similarly to the second simulation, the irrigation frequency
    is limited by imposing constraints on the number of fields that can be irrigated
    in a day. When the real plantation in Xinavane faces drought, the local staff
    reduces the irrigation frequency in an attempt to reduce the water use. The workers
    always irrigate the fields to field capacity, in order to minimize the number
    of revisits to each field. We compare the water use of the local irrigation practice
    with an irrigation frequency of 4, 5, 6, and 7 days with that of the MPC controller.
    The results are listed in Table 2. Only the MPC controller is able to meet the
    water volume constraints; the local approach uses too much water in all of the
    seasons for all the irrigation frequencies. Note that even though the MPC controller
    irrigates in the preseason the total amount of irrigation for the season is not
    exceeded. Table 2. Actual Water Use (× 106 m3) of All Fields Combined for Each

    that in the MPC results the preseason amounts of irrigation are added to the total
    water use of the subsequent season. a Feasible seasons. 5 Conclusions and Future
    Research The optimization problem of allocating water over multiple fields of
    a plantation in order to maximize the seasonal yield or profit is highly complex,
    as we have to consider many factors, such as different crop stages, restrictions
    on seasonal water volume, available machinery (e.g., sprinklers), and human operators.
    In this work, we propose a methodology to reduce this complex problem into two
    separate optimal control problems, which are solved using a two-level structure
    consisting of a seasonal irrigation planner and a daily MPC irrigation controller.
    The seasonal irrigation planner considers the allocation of the available water
    of the upcoming growth season over the crop stages of each field, such that the
    overall yield is maximized. For the optimization of this water allocation, we
    assume that within a crop stage the allocated water is distributed perfectly temporally
    and spatially such that the water stress is minimized. This minimization of the
    daily water stress is realized by an MPC controller that decides on the daily
    irrigation amounts of each field, such that the water stress is minimized for
    all fields, while not exceeding the total water amounts that were allocated for
    each field by the seasonal irrigation planner. Although the realized precipitation
    and temperature in the season may be different from those of the optimal plan
    proposed by the seasonal irrigation scheduler, the MPC controller receives daily
    measurements and consequently updates its policy accordingly to correct for the
    deviations from the optimal plan. For the seasonal irrigation planner we describe
    the total expected yield over multiple fields by the summation of crop yields
    computed by the multiplicative compounding yield function from (Raes et al., 2006).
    As this function is highly nonlinear and nonconvex, the difficulty to find optimal
    solutions scales exponentially with the number of fields. Therefore, we approximate
    it using an alternative problem formulation. The result is an efficient formulation
    of the seasonal irrigation planner that determines the optimal water distribution
    over the fields to maximize the overall yield, subject to local operational constraints
    such as restrictions on seasonal water volume or fertilizer amounts. The MPC controller
    minimizes the daily water stress by scheduling irrigation such that the soil moisture
    of the fields is regulated within a water-stress-free zone. This requires a model
    of the interaction between the soil, the atmosphere, and the crop. A simple water
    balance model is created for which the saturation dynamics are modeled explicitly
    using conditionally switched depletion dynamics. Furthermore, evapotranspiration
    is predicted using a linear model based on remote sensing measurements of the
    canopy cover, temperature data, and evaporation and transpiration data obtained
    from closed-loop simulations in AquaCrop-OS. The effect of water stress on the
    crop yield is included in the cost function of the daily irrigation controller
    using an additive crop production function. This provides the daily controller
    with information on which fields have priority in receiving water. The two-level
    approach presented can handle resource and hydraulic infrastructure constraints.
    Therefore, the approach is generic as it is not restricted to a specific irrigation
    method, crop, soil type, or local environment. The performance of our two-level
    approach is evaluated on three closed-loop simulations in AquaCrop-OS of a sugarcane
    plantation (from Tongaat Hulett) located in Xinavane, Mozambique. The parameters
    in AquaCrop-OS are set to match the parameters of the real plantation. Then, using
    the local standard irrigation practice (irrigate each field every few days) from
    the Xinavane sugarcane plantation the growth seasons from 2013 till 2017 are recreated.
    This data set is then used to identify the water balance model parameters and
    evapotranspiration model parameters. The goal of the simulations is to investigate
    the maximum (theoretical) benefit that can be achieved using our optimal control
    approach. In the first simulation, we study the effect of water scarcity on the
    season yield under our proposed two-level approach. The results give an indication
    of the decline of yield as a function of water availability that can be expected.
    This can be useful information for decision makers to decide on the water distribution
    of upcoming seasons. In the second simulation, the water productivity of the proposed
    two-level approach is compared to a simple heuristic of irrigating the fields
    to field capacity every 4 days. Our two-level approach achieves the same seasonal
    yield as the local irrigation practice, while using up to 30% less water. In the
    third simulation, the total water use is restricted to 80% of the potential water
    use and the capabilities of the local irrigation practice and our optimal control
    approach in producing feasible irrigation schedules are tested. Our control approach
    is able to satisfy the water use constraint while maximizing the water productivity.
    The local approach of irrigation every few days to field capacity was not able
    to constrain seasonal water use to a feasible amount. A next step toward implementation
    of closed-loop algorithms such as the one proposed in our paper is creating reliable
    observers for soil moisture. Such an observer could be designed by combining in
    situ and satellite remote sensing data approaches to create soil moisture measurements,
    which can then be incorporated into the control loop. Furthermore, our future
    work will explore stochastic MPC methods for hedging land, water (and labor) allocation
    against uncertainty in water availability within the proposed framework. Another
    step to take for implementation is to evaluate the effect of the uncertainty of
    rainfall. However, under sparse rainfall events the effect of the rainfall uncertainty
    on the performance will likely be minimal as the controller can change the irrigation
    schedules following a measurement after a rainfall event has occurred. Nonetheless,
    the effect that uncertainty of rainfall has on irrigation control will need to
    be researched more in depth to render our approach feasible for a broader range
    of climates. Acronyms CGDD Cumulative Growing Degree Days FAO Food and Agriculture

  description: The demand for freshwater is on the increase due to the rapid growth
    in the world's population while the effect of global warming and climate change
    cause severe threat to water use and food security. Consequently, irrigation systems
    are tremendously utilized by many farmers all over the world with its associated
    high amount of water consumption from various sources posing a major concern.
    This necessitates the increased focus on improving the efficiency of water usage
    in irrigation agriculture. The advent and rapid successes of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and advanced control strategies are being leveraged to achieve improved
    monitoring and control of irrigation farming. In this review, a thorough search
    for literature on irrigation monitoring and advanced control systems highlighting
    the research works within the past ten years are presented. Attention is paid
    on recent research works related to the monitoring and advance control concepts
    for precision irrigation. It is expected that this review paper will serve as
    a useful reference to enhance reader's knowledge on monitoring and advanced control
    opportunities related to irrigation agriculture as well as assist researchers
    in identifying directions and gaps to future research works in this field.

    due to the rapid growth in the world’s population while the effect of global warming
    and climate change cause severe threat to water use and food security. Consequently,
    irrigation systems are tremendously utilized by many farmers all over the world
    with its associated high amount of water consumption from various sources posing
    a major concern. This necessitates the increased focus on improving the efficiency
    of water usage in irrigation agriculture. The advent and rapid successes of the
    Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced control strategies are being leveraged to
    achieve improved monitoring and control of irrigation farming. In this review,

    Agriculture serves as a significant source of food production and job creation
    to the growing demand of the human population all over the world upon which most
    economies survive. It is also part of the key economic sector, significantly contributing
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) of most countries. The success of this crucial
    sector relies absolutely on water supplies as crop cultivation naturally thrives
    on the availability of water. However, the scarcity of freshwater poses significant
    threats to food security and sustainable developments in some parts of the world.
    Therefore, efficient use and conservation of water for irrigation is needed to
    increase food production while equally preventing water scarcity crises (Tsang
    and Jim, 2016). Rainfall and irrigation are significant sources of water for agriculture.
    Rainfall is unreliable, and moreover, excess supplies may cause some undesirous
    effects on crops such as surface runoff and, erosion while it scarcity may even
    cause drought. Consequently, a controlled system of watering the farm, irrigation,
    is highly practiced for crop cultivation as an alternative to a natural rainfall
    water source for plants. The irrigation system is an essential agricultural practice
    where water is artificially applied to the soil to supply a controlled amount
    of water necessary for plant growth and development (Oborkhale et al., 2015; Shibusawa,
    2001). In a conventional irrigation system, farmers apply uniform irrigation across
    every part of the farm without considering the variabilities on the field and
    the water need of the crop. Therefore, this method has lesser water-saving capability
    and can cause over-irrigation in some part of the farm while other parts are under
    irrigated which may lead to undesired water stress on the plants (Anusha et al.,
    2017, Kumar et al., 2017, Lakhiar et al., 2018, Say et al., 2018). Also, most
    of the commercial irrigation controllers available in the market are pre-programmed
    to supply water at predefined intervals, which offer offline irrigation scheduling
    based on empirical knowledge of dynamics of weather variables, as well as soil
    and plant characteristics (Lozoya et al., 2014). Other issues in irrigation systems
    involve scarcity of water due to the effect of drought and climate change, environmental
    disturbance, the nonlinear nature of plant dynamics, changing dynamics of weather,
    dynamic crop water uptake of plants (Yusuke, 2018). To address these issues, precision
    irrigation concept for optimal water-saving and better yield is adopted. Precision
    irrigation is the integration of information, communication, and control technologies
    in the irrigation process to obtain optimal usage of water resources while minimizing
    environmental impact (Shibusawa, 2001, Zacepins et al., 2012). Precision irrigation
    takes into account the spatial and temporal soil variation, soil structure and
    hydraulic properties, plant responses to water deficit, changing weather variables
    through effective monitoring via Internet of Things (IoT), to make better irrigation
    decisions that have the potential to help achieve high water saving and improved
    yield (Bitella et al., 2014, Capraro et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2002). It has
    been argued that this variability can be managed and economic benefit can be derived
    by meeting the specific irrigation needs of individual crops and their management
    zones through precision irrigation approach (Cambra et al., 2018, Chami et al.,
    2019, Smith et al., 2009). Precision irrigation is an excellent water-saving technique
    for maximizing yield and providing water at the desired location based on the
    water needs of the plant (Niu et al., 2015; Evett et al., 2009; Smith and Baillie,
    2009). Also implied is the idea that the system will be managed to achieve a specific
    target by aiding the delivery of nutrients and water directly to the roots of
    each plant. This keeps the soil moisture at optimal levels to eliminate surface
    run-off, and deep percolation as the design process is conducted based on the
    ability of the soil to absorb water and the amount of crop water demand (Daccache
    et al., 2015). Therefore, this method results in increased productivity and improved
    quality of yield while ensuring maximum water use efficiency (Tropea, 2014, Smith
    et al., 2010). However, to provide efficient precision irrigation, the integration
    of the IoT for data acquisition as well as monitoring, control theory, and decision
    support technologies must be considered in irrigation management (Pham and Stack,
    2018, Zamora-izquierdo et al., 2018). In the context of precision irrigation,
    control is the ability to reallocate inputs and adjustment of irrigation management
    according to the crop response deficit while ensuring optimal water-saving and
    mitigating the effects of disturbance and uncertainties (De Baerdemaeker, 2000,
    Smith and Baillie, 2009). However, in all cases, there is a need to sense the
    response of plants to the applied water at a scale appropriate for management
    as well as deciding for improved irrigation using both real-time and historical
    information for subsequent irrigation applications at an appropriate spatial level
    (Shashi et al., 2017). This process requires the application of real-time monitoring
    and advanced control strategies. In control theory, advanced control strategies
    refer to a broad range of techniques and technologies implemented within a process
    and industrial control system, while control theory is referred to as a subfield
    of electrical engineering and mathematics, which deals with the dynamical behaviour
    of systems. The attainment of desired dynamical behaviours defines the precision
    of the output and is determined by the model of the input and the controlled parameters.
    In precision irrigation, plant properties and weather parameters are relied upon
    with the use of sensors and several models to provide desired control of irrigation.
    Several review articles have been published which are related to precision agriculture,
    as seen in Semananda et al., 2018, Pierpaoli et al., 2013. In addition, review
    work on the opportunities in IoT monitoring and how the combination of IoT, big
    data and data analytics has enabled precision and sustainable agriculture has
    been discussed (Khanna Abhishek, 2019, Dlodlo and Josephat, 2015, Elijah et al.,
    2018b, Kamilaris et al., 2017, Martín et al., 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017, Munoth
    et al., 2016). Also, a review by Ding et al. (2018), described the development
    of a predictive model for control in agriculture, its challenges and future perspective.
    While a review of optimization methods and performance evaluation of irrigation
    projects was carried out by Aliyev, 2018, Elshaikh et al., 2018. Presently, there
    is no review paper combining both monitoring and control strategies for precision
    irrigation systems, hence necessitating the need for a critical review on precision
    irrigation with the integration of all the monitoring and control techniques used
    for water-saving agriculture. Therefore, this paper discusses advanced control
    and monitoring strategies for precision irrigation system with the integration
    of irrigation monitoring methods. The control techniques presented in this paper
    are basically classified into an open and closed-loop control system. The goal
    is to sort out and abridge a reasonable part of previous research work and further
    recognize and identify the research trends for precision irrigation control systems.
    Next, Section 2 discusses the review methodology, and Section 3 discusses the
    different methods of irrigation systems, while irrigation monitoring based on
    the Internet of Things is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 explains the integration
    of advanced control strategies to enhance the precision irrigation system, while
    the last section discusses the future research direction and conclusion. 2. Review
    methodology The methodology applied in the selection of works of literature that
    are published on precision irrigation and all its existing control strategies
    includes an extensive search through a different multidisciplinary online database,
    such as Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, MDPI,
    Google Scholar, and other Scopus indexed journals, etc. In such enormous research
    libraries, numerous research articles related to monitoring and control in irrigation
    were found. Therefore, in selecting relevant papers for this review, emphases

    3. Classification of irrigation methods For an impressive plant growth and development,
    appropriate water supply is essential. When rainfall is inadequate, water must
    be supplied to crops through irrigation (Brouwer et al., 1990b). Different irrigation
    methods that can be used to provide water to plant is shown in Fig. 4. The irrigation
    types are categorized into traditional and modern techniques based on their tendency
    to offer water saving, be precisely monitored, scheduled, and controlled. The
    quantity of irrigation water to be applied to any plant depends on the method
    of the irrigation system adopted, plant water demand, and the soil type. Any of
    the adopted irrigation methods will have an influence on the nutrients, infiltration
    rate, evaporation rate, water absorption pattern, and deep percolation of the
    soil. Download : Download high-res image (390KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Different methods of irrigation. The traditional surface irrigation
    methods which is classified in Fig. 4, applies and distributes water to the surface
    of the soil based on the gravity flow without any form of sensing and control
    action (Ghodake and Mulani, 2016). The traditional surface irrigation type is
    the oldest and most common irrigation method, which was practiced all over the
    world (Yonts, 1994). Examples of the traditional surface irrigation methods such
    as furrow, flooding, and manual watering are commonly used by peasant farmers.
    However, these methods require good soil surface levelling to ensure adequate
    water distribution to prevent the water applied from draining away (Zhang et al.,
    2004). In addition, the water-saving capacity of these methods is low due to the
    potential losses of water, which is due to the massive evaporation process and
    uncontrolled irrigation volume (Gillies, 2017). Traditional surface irrigation
    is characterised by excessive water supplied to the plants which often leads to
    surface runoff, deep percolation, which increases the tendency of leaching, reduces
    the soil nutrients level, and results in reduced crop yield (Adamala et al., 2014).
    Therefore, surface irrigation can be enhanced to achieve precision irrigation
    through the adoption of modern water saving technology as well as the needed monitoring
    and control strategies to increase its water usage efficiency (Koech et al., 2010).
    In modern water saving methods, which are classified as subsurface (capillary)
    and surface (drip or sprinkler irrigation). Many studies have investigated subsurface
    irrigation and found out that it offers higher water-saving and better yield output
    when compared with other types surface of irrigation (Nalliah and Sri Ranjan,
    2010, Li et al., 2018, Ohaba et al., 2015, Shukri et al., 2014, Shukri et al.,
    2014, Shukri Bin Zainal Abidin et al., 2012). Subsurface capillary irrigation
    is a type of subsurface irrigation that works based on the action of gradually
    supplying water from a source directly to the root area by using a capillary medium.
    Some capillary mediums which were usually used in this method are wicks, mats,
    ebbs, porous ceramics, and flows (Semananda et al., 2018, Cai, 2017, Wesonga et
    al., 2014). In the application of the subsurface irrigation method, Rahman et
    al. (2019) proposed the horizontal and vertical fibrous capillary interface to
    transfer water from the supply tank to the root zone of the plant. The subsurface
    capillary irrigation process works based on a negative pressure to transport water
    using the capillary interface to the root zone of the plant. Based on the results
    obtained from both references, it has been shown that the horizontal type interface
    offers higher water saving potential and the better yield on their test crop compared
    to the vertical type interface. Other research works on capillary irrigation have
    also proven the advantage of this method to provide higher water saving in performing
    irrigation process in agriculture compared to other methods (Kamal et al., 2019,
    Ferrarezi, 2016, Kinoshita et al., 2010, Masuda, 2008). However, Fujimaki et al.
    (2018) have observed that the upward movement action of water via capillary can
    irreversibly accumulate salts in the plant growing medium, thereby increasing
    the salinity of the soil, which can be reduced only when water leaching occurs
    in the medium. Therefore, an efficient monitoring and control system for the capillary
    irrigation method is needed to overcome the soil salinity problem. Surface drip
    irrigation is one of the modern water saving irrigation methods which supplies
    water slowly through narrow tubes to provide water to the soil near the plant
    roots (Brouwer et al., 1990a). This irrigation method reduces the rate of water
    loss, which occurs due to evaporation that was affected by wind and surface runoff
    (Pramanik et al., 2016, Bhalage et al., 2015, Rekha et al., 2015). Likewise, Elasbah
    et al. (2019) have claimed the effectiveness of a drip irrigation method to offer
    an efficient irrigation system by providing the precise amount of nutrients to
    the plants to reduce the amount of nutrient leaching. However, to design and manage
    a surface drip irrigation system, proper knowledge regarding water distribution
    wetting patterns, spacing between emitters/dripper are needed to avoid a higher
    amount of water loss due to the evaporation process on the soil surface and water
    use efficiency (Bajpai and Kaushal, 2020, Hou et al., 2015). Despite several advantages
    of drip irrigation method, it suffers from a high setup cost, especially for a
    more massive farm due to various accessory requirements needed to perform the
    irrigation process such as pipes, head trickles, and emitters (Bralts and Edwards,
    1987). Also, regular maintenance for the emitters is required to avoid any blockage
    that might affect the water supplied to the plant (Ravina et al., 1992). Sprinkler
    irrigation is another type of modern irrigation method similar to the pattern
    of precipitation on the plant. The water sprinkling process is performed by using
    the spray head and extensive piping system to ensure a large coverage area for
    irrigation. There are several types of sprinkler irrigation methods, such as the
    centre pivot, standalone, linear, and lateral move sprinkler, as contained in
    Fig. 4. This method tends to irrigate a larger land area due to its broader irrigation
    coverage, as demonstrated in (Evans et al., 2012, Evans and King, 2012). However,
    this method suffers from a high operating cost as it requires several accessories
    such as sprinkler head, high-pressure pump, pipes, and energy supplies for the
    water pump system such as engine oil and electricity. In addition, sprinkler irrigation
    is found to be inadequate to be applied in a windy environment due to a high water
    loss rate as a result of wind drift and evaporation (Xingye et al., 2018; Zhao
    et al., 2009). Furthermore, this method also requires regular maintenance for
    nozzle replacement, and pipe connections need to be regularly checked as leakage
    in pipe connections will reduce the water sprinkling uniformity throughout the
    farm, thus affecting the crop productivity. Whatever method of irrigation adopted,
    subsurface, drip, or sprinkler irrigation, there is a necessity to consider improvising
    for its shortcoming by real-time monitoring and advanced control design aimed
    at achieving enhanced and desired precision. This is done by the application of
    relevant sensing devices to measure controlled parameters. The next section outlines
    the monitoring techniques adopted in literature. 4. Monitoring in precision irrigation
    Efficient monitoring system for various parameters that affect the plant growth
    and development is very vital towards designing an efficient irrigation control
    system to improve food production with minimum water loss. Monitoring in the context
    of precision irrigation also involves the collection of data that accurately reflects
    the real-time status of soil, plant, and weather of the irrigation areas of the
    plants through the use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT) technology. To develop a real-time monitoring system, the IoT has paved
    its way for the use of low-cost hardware (sensors/actuators) and communication
    technologies (Internet) to enhance the monitoring and control system for the irrigation
    process (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). Similarly, distributed WSN nodes also
    play a significant role in real-time monitoring for precision farming. They are
    a network of sensor nodes interconnected wirelessly to sense, compute, and transmit
    information of various parameters and designed for large scale and long term deployment
    (Hamouda, 2017). The implementation of IoT to monitor essential parameters in
    precision irrigation has become a trend where seamlessly connected sensors, cameras,
    and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), drones as well as satellites for data acquisition
    and onward data transmission using cloud service platform is used as illustrated
    in Fig. 5 (Karim et al., 2017, Dubravko Ćulibrk et al., 2014). Download : Download

    IoT- based Monitoring Architecture. The cloud platform offers services such as
    data analysis of sensor monitored parameters for decision making, visualization,
    and actions (Rajeswari et al., 2017). Farmers and researchers can remotely access
    the IoT cloud server where the control and monitoring algorithms are deployed
    using smartphones or fixed devices to provide better insights and to enhance the
    decision-making process in real-time (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Pongnumkul et al.,
    2015). Thus, the monitoring process for soils, crops and weather parameters will
    become more efficient and convenient for farmers, which will further enhance the
    effectiveness of precision irrigation control system and to ensure a good quality
    food production (Andrew et al., 2018, Kushwaha et al., 2015, Mohanraj et al.,
    2016, O’Grady and O’Hare, 2017, Rajeswari et al., 2017, Saiful et al., 2020, Uddin
    et al., 2017). As seen in Fig. 5, IoT and WSN are essential aspects that enhance
    monitoring process in agriculture as well as the use of other different sensors,
    where sensed parameters can be transferred through different wireless communication
    technologies such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless protocol, and GPRS/3G/4G
    Technology. Also, Low Power Wide Area (LWPA) wireless technologies like LoRa,
    LTE Cat-NB1, Sigfox, and LTE Cat M1 have also been used for wide area coverage
    monitoring (Elijah et al., 2018a, Jawad et al., 2017, Li et al., 2017, Ramesh
    and Rangan, 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Lin et al., 2015, Bitella et al., 2014).
    Some of the essential parameters that are usually monitored and considered for
    the design of a precision irrigation control systems are shown in Table 1, while
    the highlight of the various monitoring and sensing methods towards the achievement
    of precision irrigation are discussed under the soil, weather and plant-based
    monitoring as discussed in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Table 1. Summary of basic

    the most crucial parameters needed for plant growth. High spatiotemporal monitoring
    of soil moisture content is necessary towards ensuring optimal irrigation scheduling.
    Several IoT-based soil moisture monitoring for irrigation management using Raspberry
    Pi and Arduino prototyping board. This is interfaced with different sensors for
    real-time soil moisture fluxes for monitoring of crop water use for irrigation
    decision and scheduling (Divya, 2019; Rao and Sridhar, 2018; Krishna, 2017; Anusha
    et al., 2017; Rajalakshmi and Devi, 2016; Chate and Rana, 2016; Kothawade et al.,
    2016). The type of soil moisture sensing used is a low-cost capacitance-based
    type that is based on the dielectric device working principle. According to Shigeta
    et al. (2018), real-time soil moisture sensing using capacitance-based sensors
    is applicable for practical measurement of soil moistures fluxes by correlating
    the volumetric water content (VWC) of the soil and the capacitance of the sensor
    probes inserted in the soil with reasonable accuracy. A more accurate soil moisture
    sensing approach can be achieved using a time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors
    which comprises of two parallel rods inserted to the soil at the depth at which
    the moisture content is desired. An electromagnetic pulse is radiated from the
    sensor rod, from which the rate at which the pulse is conducted into the soil
    and reflected back to the soil surface is directly related to the soil moisture
    content. However, a high sampling rate is required for the TDR soil moisture sensors
    to receive a good signal reflected from the soil hence, making this type of sensor
    very expensive for farmers to deploy at a large scale for soil moisture monitoring.
    A low-cost monitoring irrigation system was proposed by Bitella et al. (2014)
    for multisensory measurement of soil water content at different depths, soil,
    and air temperatures. The soil sensor probes used for monitoring the soil water
    content are the dielectric probe operating with a sensing frequency of 80 MHz.
    The sensors were interfaced with Arduino Uno microcontroller as an analog input
    while the Wi-Fi module ESP8266 was used to transmit the data to the internet for
    data logging. Related work using Node MCU was carried out by (Chieochan et al.,
    2017; Kumar et al., 2017). Similarly, an IoT-based field monitoring was implemented
    with a cloud base monitoring and data analysis using Arduino as a controller by
    (Jha et al., 2017, Salvi, 2017, Yashaswini et al., 2017). Their findings confirmed
    that the collected data was used to make a prediction that was used to achieve
    reduced water consumption and for planning the strategies to get better crop yield.
    An IoT soil moisture monitoring approach by Hebbar and Golla (2017), took advantage
    of the wireless networks that utilized GSM network and infrared communications
    to offer automatic water supply for plants for water-saving. The proposed system
    was controlled by PIC microcontroller 16F877A to turn the ON/OFF pump using a
    relay driver after checking the moisture level with the help of a capacitance-based
    soil moisture sensor consisting of two electrodes gauging the resistance of the
    soil. Also, a soil moisture monitoring using sensor layout network technology
    was integrated with IOS/Android application by Isik et al. (2017) where data from
    different DS200 soil moisture/humidity sensors with the accuracy of ±2% is placed
    close to the root zone of the plant at a different region of the sensor layouts
    transmitted via Wi-Fi to a mobile phone-based on IOS/Android to the central control
    unit for opening and closing condition of electro valves. The electro valve controls
    the amount of water to be supplied to the lateral drip line. Another monitoring
    domain of soil nutrient was demonstrated by Zhang et al. (2017), with an IoT approach
    using a portable soil nutrient detector. Other parameters sensed alongside with
    soil nutrients include soil moisture, air/soil temperature, and humidity using
    the SHT 17 digital sensor interfaced wirelessly with JN5139 system control node
    using Zigbee. The sensed parameter was fed into a decision support system (DSS)
    for decision making for an irrigated citrus cultivation. A friendly monitoring
    technology for soil and nutrient sensing, referred to as chameleon, was implemented
    by Fandika et al. (2019). This approach makes use of chameleon colours to represent
    the different states of soil moisture and nutrient level as low, moderate, high.
    This friendly technology has helped local farmers in Malawi get insight from colour
    for moisture content without using figures from sensor calibration to improve
    their water management. A design of silicon chip for in-situ monitoring of the
    soil nitrogen cycle was reported by Joly et al. (2017), using an ion-sensitive
    field-effect transistor (ISFET) microsensor for measuring soil pH and soil nitrogen
    content. Likwise, Bah et al. (2012) reviewed and proposed soil nutrient monitoring
    using on the go sensor technologies deployed for site-specific management of nutrient
    concentration where the efficient mapping of nutrient variability can be carried
    out using electromechanical and optical sensors. Another innovative soil moisture
    monitoring approach was demonstrated by Huuskonen and Oksanen, (2018) through
    the use of drones camera on aerial surveillance to create soil maps to determining
    the soil sample location and management zones. After analysis of the images, the
    result contains soil moisture and nutrient contents of different zones for irrigation
    planning and scheduling. The quality of water used for irrigation was monitored
    using the IoT approach and reported by Prasad et al. (2016), where oxidation-reduction
    potential, conductivity, salinity and potential hydrogen (pH) were sensed in real-time
    using different types of sensors. Continuous monitoring of these parameters is
    necessary for maintaining functional health status for plants. 4.2. Weather based
    monitoring One area of the increased interest of weather-based monitoring is the
    real-time estimation of the reference evapotranspiration (ETO) using measured
    weather variables as an indication of water loss from the plant and the soil environment.
    The rate of water loss largely depends on the precise measurement of solar radiation,
    air temperature, and wind speed. This data can be measured using IoT- based weather
    stations and other various types of sensors, as seen in Table 1. One of the most
    popular technological approaches that are used in precision monitoring of weather
    and environmental parameters is by using WSN (Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018, Keswani
    et al., 2018, Difallah et al., 2018, Hamouda, 2017, Mohanraj et al., 2017, Saraf
    and Gawali, 2017, Viani et al., 2017, Patil et al., 2013). The implementations
    present WSN as an alternative and efficient way in which various sensors are interconnected
    to monitor physical or surrounding environmental conditions for a large cropping
    area. The system was reported to achieve real-time monitoring and analysis of
    data from the sensors in a feedback loop, which activates the control devices
    based on a pre-calculated threshold value. Wasson et al. (2017) presents an IoT-based
    weather monitoring system which monitors and analyse the crop environment like
    air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and moisture content in
    the soil, making use of different weather-based sensors interfaced with wireless
    communication standard for real-time data transfer and web-based services. A similar
    approach was demonstrated by Shahzadi et al. (2016), where three sensor networks
    with each comprising three soil moisture sensors, temperature, and leaf wetness
    were used for precise and accurate sensing of moisture content, weather and leaf
    wetness of the farm layout. The sensor nodes intercommunication was established
    using ZigBee-802.15.4 wasp-mote board with a transmission range of 500 m at 38,400
    bps through the gateway to the webserver where an expert system takes irrigation
    decisions. Villarrubia et al. (2017) demonstrated a multi-agent-based monitoring
    approach using an open-source platform called PANGEA for collecting various forms
    of weather variables using sensors for temperature, solar radiation, humidity,
    pH, wind, and soil moisture. The platform comprises several Master and Slave nodes
    that are sensor networked to communicate at 433 MHz radiofrequency for sensor
    data transfer. The collection of various sensor data was fused using a fuzzy expert
    system to decide the volume of water needed for irrigation. Similarly, Rahman
    et al. (2019) developed an IoT dashboard for the management of a smart fibrous
    capillary irrigation system. Several variables, such as soil moisture content,
    weather, and others plant information are displayed on the dashboard, while the
    real time capture plant images for estimating leave area index is illustrated
    in Fig. 6. This helped in enhancing monitoring and control using an IoT system
    as a critical tool that is targeted at precision irrigation. With the help of
    real-time monitoring of weather variables, an hourly estimation of reference evapotranspiration,
    which determines water loss from soil and plant canopies, was computed using an
    FAO-56 Modified Penman-Monteith equation using a developed Arduino based IoT Davis
    Vantage Pro 2 weather station. The Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration model is
    shown in Eq. (1). (1) where is the reference evapotranspiration (mm/hour); Δ represents
    the slope of saturation vapour pressure (kPa°C−1); Rn is the reference crop canopy
    net radiation (W/m2); λ represent the latent heat of vaporization (kPa°C−1); T
    represents the mean air temperature in Celsius; is the Mean daily or hourly wind
    speed at 2-m height (ms−1); represent the stream pressure of saturation vapour
    (kPa) (Rahman et al., 2018). The estimated reference evapotranspiration can be
    used to determine the actual evapotranspiration ( ), which is the water loss from
    a particular crop, from where the estimated amount of water to compensate for
    the water loss is computed for onward application to the plant, based on the crop
    coefficient ( ) which varies from one plant to another. (2) Download : Download

    monitoring Plant-based monitoring using optical sensors has emerged as a widely
    used approach to assess plant water stress status, determining the health status
    of crops as well as potential threat to plant growth and development such as drought,
    lack of nutrients, and attacks from pest. Some of these optical sensors can be
    fixed (immovable) closed to the plant or mounted on moving platforms such as drones,
    UAVs, movable sprinkler machines (Bogue, 2017), and satellites (Nutini et al.,
    2017). Wireless sensor networks and gateway node approach were developed by Jia
    et al. (2019) to collect soil moisture content in the tea plantation using captured
    images of the cultivated plant and soil. The pictures of the tea leaves were gathered
    for assessment of the tea deficiency by using a high definition camera mounted
    on the UAV. The proposed system helped in water conservation to a great extent
    and also reduces soil erosion as only required fertilizers are injected via the
    drip system. The integration of the IoT together with wireless sensor networks,
    as demonstrated by Bauer and Aschenbruck (2018), was used for in situ monitoring
    of the Leaf area index (LAI), a vital crop parameter used for optimal irrigation
    and crop performance. This was achieved using an optical filter and diffuser for
    photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurement needed to derive a reliable
    estimate of LAI. The use of UAV equipped with high-resolution cameras for smart
    aerial monitoring of irrigation area vegetation was presented by (Aleotti et al.,
    2018, Uddin et al., 2017). This area now has an increased research focus towards
    achieving precision irrigation. In Aleotti et al. (2018), the UAV with an on board
    camera containing Sony IMX 219 CMOS sensor was configured to fly over the irrigation
    field testbed. The integration of multispectral images captured by the UAV cameras
    with DSS was used to compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
    map used for precise control of the linear sprinkler machine used for irrigation
    of the tomato cultivated field layout. The authors reported that a higher water
    saving could be achieved with the integration of NDVI technical index with DSS.
    Similarly, Harun et al. (2019) proposed an improved indoor farming IoT monitoring
    for the growth of Brassica Chinensis plant, where remote monitoring of spectrum
    using light sensors as well as a network of sensors for monitoring of CO2, ambient
    temperature, humidity, nutrient and Leaf area index was presented. The combination
    of these conditions was used to apply water to the plant, which was controlled
    by the pulse-width modulated (PWM) actuator interfaced with IoT embedded device.
    The study was able to establish the effect of photoperiod light spectrum and intensity
    to determine the optimal plant physiology and morphology, such as leaf photosynthesis
    rate, water used efficiency, leaf stomatal conductance and chlorophyll on Brassica
    Chinensis. A cyber-physical system model approach for smart monitoring of potatoes
    vegetation status was demonstrated by Rad et al. (2015). The architecture for
    the monitoring system was in four layers, namely, physical, network, DSS, and
    application layers. Real-time information is obtained from sensors mounted on
    UAV, tractors, and satellites via the physical layer. The network layers help
    to access and transmit information interfaced with the DSS layer where maps of
    vegetation (NDVI), soil resources as well as chlorophyll content are computed,
    and lastly, the application layer forms the interface between the decision layer
    and the human operator. Lozoya et al. (2016) implemented a sensor network for
    monitoring and control of green pepper vegetation in four different irrigation
    area layouts. Each of the irrigation areas was monitored using a 10HS volumetric
    water content sensor, hunter flow sensor, camera for capturing vegetation images,
    actuator nodes which contain a rain bird irrigation valve for on/off control of
    water, as well as IoT-based weather station for estimation of reference evapotranspiration.
    Likewise, Lozoya et al. (2019) analysed two methods of spectral sensing instruments
    such as decagon’ spectral reflectance sensor and Mapir’s survey 3 camera’s ability
    to measure plant health status through NDVI in a greenhouse experiment. It was
    reported that both methods, achieved similar spectral results on plant health
    status, which could be combined with soil moisture sensing for optimal irrigation
    control. Readers are refer to Table 2 for more detail description of various literature
    on real time monitoring for precision irrigation. Table 2. Detailed description

    5. Control techniques for precision irrigation Adopting advanced control techniques
    in an irrigation system helps to achieve the application of water in the desired
    proportion to crops at the right time, to achieve high water use efficiency, increased
    yields, energy-saving, optimise fertilizer use and labour saving (Boman et al.,
    2015). Therefore, leveraging on the monitoring of several parameters influencing
    irrigation performance such as air and canopy temperature, rainfall, evapotranspiration,
    and solar radiation, various control methods have been suggested to improve optimal
    irrigation systems and to increase their efficiency (Marinescu et al., 2017).
    It is possible to categorize the irrigation control techniques primarily into
    closed-loop and open-loop control strategies. Similarly, the combination of both
    closed-loop and open-loop control method has also been proposed as a hybrid control
    strategy. The irrigation controllers are examined in this section based on these
    classifications into different irrigation control techniques, as illustrated in
    Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (281KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Classification of different Control techniques for Precision Irrigation
    System. 5.1. Open loop irrigation control technique In an open-loop irrigation
    control system, irrigation decisions are made empirically by the operator using
    both mechanical or electromechanical irrigation timers and the volume of water
    to be delivered or indirectly via the speed of a movable sprinkler machine. The
    volume of water and the time for irrigation is often specified and applied based
    on the knowledge of the operator on perceived crop response, rather than on a
    precise measurement (Zazueta et al., 2008). Also, irrigation systems control based
    on open-loop have been broadly used by farmers, and it implies that a pre-set
    action is done using irrigation timers (Agency, 2017). The parameters set by the
    system operator are often the time and the volume of water to be supplied, not
    minding the crop response. An open-loop system is simple to implement because
    sensors are not required in order to measure the varying parameters affecting
    the plant, such as soil moisture contents, other weather variables, and also no
    need for feedback concept, hence saves cost (Harper, 2017). The block diagram
    of the open-loop irrigation system is illustrated in Fig. 8. Download : Download
    high-res image (53KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Block diagram
    of the open-loop irrigation system. A time-based sprinkler and drip irrigation
    system for coastal horticulture was carried by Sudarmaji et al. (2019) based on
    the open-loop control approach. The timing was designed using a real-time clock
    (RTC) interfaced with an Arduino board connected to an actuator for switching
    on the DC pump for drip and AC pump for sprinkler irrigation. Montesano et al.
    (2016) implemented a timer-based irrigation system in a greenhouse. The results
    show that timer-controlled irrigation experienced 18% leaching with a leaser leaf
    area index when compared to the performance with a closed-loop sensor-based approach.
    The issue associated with the open-loop irrigation control method is its susceptibility
    to environmental disturbances. The control input does not generally take the dynamics
    in the system into consideration. It also cannot automatically react to varying
    conditions in the environment, development stage requirement of plants, and requires
    frequent resetting to achieve high levels of irrigation efficiency (Patil and
    Desai, 2013). Examples of the open-loop irrigation techniques are irrigation timer,
    volume-based, and conventional approach, as illustrated using the block diagram
    in Fig. 8. Irrigation timers are simple controllers consisting of clock units
    capable of activating one or more subunits of the irrigation system at a specific
    time. 5.2. Closed loop irrigation control system The closed-loop irrigation controllers
    operate based on a feedback control scheme designed to keep the desired output
    condition by comparing it with some pre-set conditions to decide the duration
    and amount of water supply to plants. In Klein et al. (2018), a closed-loop irrigation
    system fully automates the delivery of irrigation and calculates the water requirement
    of the plant. The operator creates a general control approach in closed-loop systems,
    and once the overall approach is formulated, the control system takes over the
    time and frequency of water supply to plants (Patil and Desai, 2013). The decisions
    as to when and where to irrigate are dependent and guided by various data obtained
    from sensors as feedback and compared with the desired set point, as illustrated
    in Fig. 9. Therefore, sensing of environmental and canopy variables (such as soil
    moisture, NDVI (images of the plant), LEA index) as well as weather (temperatures,
    humidity, solar radiation, etc.) as seen in Table 1 are required when designing
    automatic irrigation controllers (Deng et al., 2018, Adeyemi et al., 2017). The
    present condition of the decision variables is compared against some certain decision
    statements, to initiate action on the control of irrigation. Download : Download

    of the closed-loop irrigation system. Many research works have been published
    on monitoring and automatic irrigation integrated with the IoT system based on
    closed-loop irrigation control principles. They made use of a closed-loop control
    approach, where soil, plant, and weather variables are combined to measure water
    demand of the crop and for irrigation scheduling and optimization. However, the
    nonlinear nature and changing dynamics of plants, make control of irrigation extremely
    cumbersome. Also, due to the necessity of the use of numerous sensors into the
    irrigation system coupled with the challenges of installations and calibrations,
    they require immense implementation expenses by farmers and researchers. This
    survey paper divides the closed-loop control approach to linear control, such
    as Proportional Integral Derivative controller, intelligent, optimal/adaptive,
    and other control schemes, as illustrated in Fig. 7. 5.2.1. Linear control 5.2.1.1.
    Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) based irrigation controller Over the years,
    classical proportional-integral-derivative popularly known as PID has been widely
    used for industrial feedback control systems due to their simple structure, extensive
    control algorithm, and low cost. It offers better efficiency because of its control
    ability on the actual output of a process to track the set output while minimizing
    error (Mantri and Kulkarni, 2013). However, classic PID controllers may suffer
    a setback in control performance when faced with external disturbances, also being
    a linear controller, it is not suited for systems that are highly nonlinear (Yesil
    et al., 2014). To achieve good control performance, each component in the control
    loop can be characterized by tunning appropriate PID controller parameters. Empirical
    methods are used to evaluate the PID parameters with consideration of how the
    system functions under open-loop circumstances. An improved PID controller unit
    was developed, with a constrained integral function, to ensure proper regulation
    during the diurnal cycle of adequate water to meet the need of the plant (Goodchild
    et al., 2015). The controller reacts rapidly to varying environmental conditions,
    including precipitation occasions, which can result in controller windup, under
    watering, and stress circumstances of the plant. The work shows how a constraint
    PID controller functions to provide robust and precise irrigation management watering
    (Rodríguez et al., 2015). For a similar purpose, to address the linearity and
    non-linearity of associated with the dynamics of irrigation farming of crops,
    Zhang et al., 2018, Yubin et al., 2017, Bi and Zheng, 2014 proposed a PID fuzzy
    control strategy of water and fertilizer for precision irrigation. The study shows
    that reasonable control of water and fertilizer ratio in agricultural irrigation
    and water conservation was achieved with better controller robustness and stability.
    For the same purpose, Yubin (2018) demonstrated a control technology based on
    PID fuzzy algorithm for precise application of water and fertilizer, the PID controller
    is based on fuzzy rules and rules-based matrix table for real-time self-parameter
    tuning as well as effectively predicting the water requirement of the crop to
    achieve precision irrigation. The implementation results show that the PID fuzzy
    control system has the advantages of high control precision with reducing overshoot
    by 14.68% and better stability, but the control performance was degraded when
    the fertilizer density change significantly. A similar result was obtained in
    Bi and Zheng (2014), where the integration of grey theory, fuzzy rules and PID
    algorithm for fertilizer and water precision control with very low control overshoot
    and robust stability was reported. Classical closed-loop control technology such
    as on/off, proportional (P), proportional-integral (PI), and proportional integral
    differential (PID) are easy to implement, but are unable to control multivariable
    and moving processes with time delays, however, by cascading several PID controllers
    or linking feedback paths, the control performances can be improved to a near
    adaptive manner (Norhaliza et al., 2011). Furthermore, another challenge of the
    PID controllers is the improper gain selections of these control systems, which
    can lead to unstable conditions as the systems are non-linear and have non-modelled
    dynamics. Since it is hectic to tune a PID controller and considering its inability
    to handle multivariable control problems such as irrigation systems, there is
    need for researchers to look towards the direction of tuning the parameters of
    PID controllers using intelligent algorithms such as particle swarm optimization,
    genetic algorithm or hybrid fuzzy PID for optimal control of irrigation system.
    5.2.2. Intelligent control for precision irrigation Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    is a machine’s ability to learn and execute comparable tasks that characterize
    human thinking, and it is dedicated to making the machine smarter (Fuentes and
    Tongson, 2018). It offers the potential for solving complex problems affecting
    the irrigation system, which are multivariable, non-linear, and time-varying (Su
    and Ma, 2012). When applied to a specific problem domain, AI algorithms can emulate
    the process of human decision making. They have been implemented in the form of
    fuzzy logic, ANN, Support vector machines, and decision trees with significant
    success to date (Singh and Jha, 2012). Applying machine learning techniques to
    automatically extract new knowledge in the form of generalized decision rules
    towards the best management of natural resources such as water to achieve precision
    irrigation was carried out by Dimitriadis and Goumopoulos (2008). Similarly, different
    classification and regression algorithms were applied to the collected dataset
    using various sensors to develop models that could be able to predict an irrigation
    plan weekly. Also, the potential of applying machine learning on datasets for
    prediction of yield and disease was reported by Goldstein et al. (2018). In this
    review, the intelligence-based irrigation controllers discussed are; ANN, fuzzy
    logic-based as well as other evolutional algorithms that have been used for optimizing
    irrigation as summarised in Table 3 and discussed in the following subsections.

    Boolean logic, which allows the expression of logical values between true and
    false and describes the uncertainty and non-linearity of the real-world problems,
    is known as fuzzy logic (Hasan et al., 2018). Precision irrigation using fuzzy
    logic has been utilized in many kinds of literature due to the fact that it does
    not require an accurate model of the plant object before it can be controlled
    (Wang and Zhang, 2018; Dela Cruz et al., 2017; Al-Ali et al., 2015, Hussan and
    Hamouda, 2014, Patil et al., 2013, Touati et al., 2013, Patil et al., 2012). In
    complex systems such as irrigation with its characteristic nonlinearities, it
    is difficult to obtain the mathematical model that describes the system. Hence,
    fuzzy controllers have the potential to replace the role of a mathematical model
    with a fuzzy model based on the rules formulated in an if-else and then format
    that is inspired by expert knowledge of the process (Ramli et al., 2017). A fuzzy
    irrigation system was modelled and simulated by Mousa et al. (2014); the computation
    of evapotranspiration (ETo) was carried out with the help of fuzzy inference system
    using input variables such as temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation. The
    results demonstrate that the fuzzy model is a quick and accurate tool for achieving
    desired evapotranspiration as well as the required net irrigation to compensate
    for the water loss due to evapotranspiration. In another work, Keswani et al.
    (2018), proposed variable learning rate gradient descent feed-forward neural network-based
    pattern classification to forecast soil moisture content, while the valve control
    commands were processed using a fuzzy logic-based weather condition modelling
    system to manipulate the control commands by considering different weather conditions.
    Fengshen et al. (2018) presented the combination of neural network prediction
    and fuzzy control algorithm, which combines fertilization with irrigation precisely
    to reduce irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers, save the production
    resources, reduces the production costs and improves the efficiency of agricultural
    products enterprise. In order to maximize the efficiency and production for irrigation
    system, Hussain et al. (2011) developed a fuzzy logic controller to estimate the
    amount of water of plants in distinct depth using the irrigation model, soil type,
    environmental conditions of greenhouse and the type of plant that affect the greenhouse
    irrigation system. A DSS-based on the combination of the wireless sensor and actuation
    network technology and fuzzy logic theory is proposed to support the irrigation
    management in agriculture (Viani et al., 2017), while Alomar (2018) developed
    a fuzzy logic controller leveraging on IoT for smart irrigation. Fuzzy irrigation
    controller has proved to be a beneficial control algorithm towards ensuring precision
    irrigation to improve water use efficiency by accurately calculating the amount
    of irrigation and addressing the non-linearity associated with the process. However,
    the performance and accuracy of the fuzzy irrigation controller depend on the
    designer’s knowledge of the dynamics of the process (plant) to help in formulating
    the fuzzy rules and proves its feasibility using long term data obtained experimentally.
    5.2.2.2. Artificial neural network based irrigation controller An Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) is an information processing algorithm inspired by how information
    is processed by biological nervous systems like the human brain. The human brain
    consists of billions of neurons that intercommunicate for information processing
    (Liakos et al., 2018). The artificial neurons in ANN are synonymous with the biological
    neurons in human being based on the nonlinearity properties of ANN, the input,
    and output mapping capacity for the prediction of different dependent variables
    (Tsang and Jim, 2016). ANN-based controllers have been applied in irrigation control
    systems because of their tendency to learn and adapt to the dynamics of the changing
    variables affecting irrigation. ANN has also been used as a smart strategy that
    is important in countering the issue of formulating mathematical models using
    the first-principles approach. A conceptual framework and estimation of evapotranspiration
    using computation technique of artificial neural network was carried out by Kelley
    and Pardyjak, 2019, Sharma and Regulwar, 2016, Bemani et al., 2013 to be facilitated
    by matching irrigation rates to crop water demand based on estimates of actual
    evapotranspiration(ETC), while analysis of error of an ANN controller based on
    reference evapotranspiration was carried out by Susilo et al. (2014). Other methods
    of estimation of evapotranspiration were extensively discussed by Obiechefu (2017).
    To ensure efficient irrigation scheduling, Umair and Muhammad (2015) proposed
    an ANN-based controller modelled in MATLAB, using weather variables as input parameters.
    Additionally, Gu et al. (2017) developed a predictive model using an improved
    backpropagation (BP) neural network, which was tuned by genetic algorithm (GA)
    to speed up the convergence of the network, preventing it from getting stocked
    in local minima. Similarly, research work for a step ahead prediction was carried
    out by Wong et al. (2018), It asserts that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a
    subclass of ANN, was able to capture highly non-linear systems dynamics sufficiently
    which makes it suitable predictive control. Another version of RNN called Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was used for predicting water table depth over the long-term
    in agricultural areas by using collected times series data (Adeyemi et al., 2018c;
    Jianfeng et al., 2018), the predictive model achieves higher regression coefficient
    (R2) scores when compared with other machine learning algorithms. The combination
    of reinforcement learning and ANN for irrigation control system were also carried
    out by Lijia et al. (2018), where an off-line learning simulation of sensors and
    crop yield data was carried out. The artificial neural network-based fast models
    for soil water content using DSSAT and crop yield was developed to improve the
    learning process. The ANN algorithm has proven to be a veritable tool for precision
    irrigation based on previous research; more work still needs to be carried out
    in the tuning of the ANN controllers. Most of the reviewed papers are simulation-based,
    further efforts should be made in the implementation of this artificial intelligence
    algorithms on embedded system hardware to ensure proper validation of simulation
    findings. However, the accuracy of the ANN-based prediction model or controller
    depends on how well the data feed in thoroughly represent the behaviour of the
    system. Efforts should be made to collect data of needed parameters using good
    and quality sensors, proper sampling time needs to be chosen during data collection.
    5.2.2.3. Expert systems based irrigation system An expert system is an algorithm
    that is developed to mimic the problem-solving ability of a human expert on a
    specific area of expertise by using artificial intelligence. It typically consists
    of a structure and intuitive knowledge-based component as well as an inference/control
    component (Mishra et al., 2014). An expert system solves problems using the expert
    experience who is consulted, relying on intuitive logic, belief, experience as
    well as the rule of the thumb. An expert system is being used in problem-solving
    activities such as planning, forecasting, control system, monitoring, fusing,
    prescribing, and interpreting decision making (Khamkar, 2014). According to Nada
    et al. (2014). An irrigation system control based on expert system aims to provide
    farmers with irrigation expertise on how to determine the exact amount of crop
    water need at the right time, weather, and growing medium such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil types. This was demonstrated in Shahzadi et al. (2016), where
    an expert system for smart agriculture leveraged on the IoT- based monitoring
    for real-time input of different sensor data to the server where the expert system
    algorithm was deployed. The structure of the expert system for the irrigation
    decision proposed for the cotton crop was programmed using C language integrated
    production system. This contains the knowledge base with working memory, inference
    engine as well as a user interface. A similar expert system using a wireless sensor
    network monitoring approach for the cultivation of plant harnessing and ontology
    was embarked upon by (Panawong and Namahoot, 2017). The wireless sensor network
    was applied to collect and transfer data of soil moisture, soil pH, and sunlight,
    which is further fed into the expert system on the webserver to decide the water
    and fertilizer requirement of the plant. The expert system was then interfaced
    with an android smartphone for queries of the decision support in real-time. A
    rule-based expert system named technical specification of drip irrigation-expert
    system (TSDI-ES), developed by Ragab et al. (2018) was used for choosing the right
    components (such as filters, motor, pumps, fertigation device) for irrigation
    network control unit to address the shortage of expert for farm automation. The
    investigation result on the TSDI-ES algorithm shows that proper control unit components
    can be chosen by the expert DSS. Eid and Abdrabbo, (2018) developed a hybrid expert
    system for irrigation management using visual basic programming and access software
    for the database design. The expert system requires data of crop (harvesting date,
    planting date, crop coefficient (Kc), crop height, and root depth), climatic data
    (ETo, ETc), physical properties of the soil (field capacity, wilting point etc.)
    and input project data (such as area, available discharge and irrigation time).
    The result obtained revealed that the ISM expert system (ES) out performed other
    ES by 20% in terms of water use efficiency for tomato crop. Similar method was
    also implemented by Khamkar (2014) for design of expert system for precise drip
    irrigation of sugarcane in India. Expert system can be used to enhance the precision
    irrigation, by using different knowledge based input to realise optimal decisions
    for precision irrigation. However, the performance of an expert system is based
    on the accuracy of the knowledge input and rules design by the expert. 5.2.2.4.
    Genetic algorithm based irrigation controller Genetic Algorithm (GA) is influenced
    by how living organisms can adapt to the harsh realities of life in a hostile
    environment, i.e., by evolution and inheritance. GA is a stochastic global search
    technique that mimics natural evolution. This evolutional algorithm is population-based,
    which imitates the process of selection of fittest individuals for reproduction.
    It operates with a fixed-size population of feasible alternatives to problem called
    individuals, which are changing over time. Three critical components of genetic
    algorithm operators are selection, crossover, and mutation. GA has been utilized
    in the optimization of the water system (Sadati et al., 2014), and irrigation
    networks (Fernando et al., 2014) and also operational scheduling of irrigation
    canal by Mathur et al. (2009). According to Chen et al. (2011), GA is best suitable
    for getting a globally optimal solution when compared to other nonlinear methods
    of programming. GA has been successfully used in tuning controllers such as PID
    and other optimal controllers. According to Mantri and Kulkarni, (2013), the parameters
    of PID controller such as , , and are difficult to tune. However, the controller
    design parameters were tuned by a genetic algorithm which provides faster response
    time, better stability, and robustness than the Zeigler-Nichols (Z-N) classical
    method and other tuning methods. An improved GA (IGA) based multilevel parameter
    optimized feature selection algorithm for extreme machine learning (ELM) classifier
    (IGA-ELM), which was integrated with an IoT- based DSS, was proposed by Kale and
    Sonavane (2019). The computation complexity of most advance controllers can be
    adequately managed using the integration of an evolutionary algorithm in the tuning
    of an optimal controller, which can enhance the usability of the controller for
    irrigation. 5.2.2.5. Particle swarm optimization based irrigation controller Particle
    Swarm Optimization (PSO) is based on the paradigm of swarm intelligence, and it
    is motivated by the social behaviour of animals like fishes and birds. It was
    developed to describe the social behaviour of animals and is capable of handling
    an optimization test. So, a new optimizer based on the model called Particle Swarm
    Optimization was proposed (Wang et al., 2018). PSO is an intelligent evolutionary
    algorithm, which belongs to a class of optimization called metaheuristics. It
    is also a robust stochastic optimization algorithm that has been successfully
    applied in various fields such as agriculture, science, and engineering. According
    to Çam et al. (2015), PSO was developed because of the challenges of using mathematical
    models in solving optimization problems. This advancement led to the development
    of heuristic optimization algorithms to drive the events in nature. PSO is an
    algorithm based on swarm intelligence. The animals moving like swarm can readily
    achieve their goal. Random movements of swarm creatures make their easy access.
    Each individual is referred to as particle while the population is called a swarm.
    Each particle sets its position to the best position according to their previous
    experience. Moubarak et al. (2018) demonstrated the tuning of PI control of irrigation
    pump speed using the PSO algorithm. The performance was compared with that of
    the conventional Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) methods, where the PSO tuned with different
    performance indices had a better response, efficiency, reduced overshoot, and
    robust stability. PSO has also successfully been used for optimal irrigation scheduling
    by Liu et al. (2018), Moubarak et al. (2018), Pawda et al. (2013), Afshar and
    Rpour (2007). It also offers the potential of been used for tuning irrigation
    controllers for optimal performances. The tuning of optimal controllers using
    PSO could help reduce the computational burden, as it speeds up the convergence
    of error to global minima and searches efficiently under numerous constraints.
    5.2.2.6. Hybrid intelligent systems Hybrid intelligent systems are the combination
    of at least two artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as neural networks
    and fuzzy logic referred to as neuro-fuzzy; others are GAPSO and fuzzy PID. Çam
    et al. (2015) proposed a hybrid optimization approach to Multi-Layer Perceptron
    using the combination of an artificial bee colony, GA and PSO to help the critical
    parameters of backpropagation algorithm such as learning rate and momentum coefficient
    to speed up learning and deviation ratio from the global minimum and improved
    the robustness and stability of the system. Also, Allawi et al. (2018) developed
    an artificial intelligence model called Shark Machine Learning Algorithm (SMLA)
    to provide optimal operational rules. This algorithm outperformed GA and PSO when
    compared. In Tseng et al. (2018), aerial agricultural images of soil moisture
    condition was used to support automatic irrigation; the study proposed the used
    of seven different machine learning algorithms to learn local soil moisture conditions
    using images of the soil. The simulation result of the controller shows that water
    consumption was reduced by 52% and robust to errors in irrigation level, location,
    and timing. Related work was carried out by Wen and Shang (2019), where two machine
    learning algorithm (support vector machine and random forest) were combined to
    analyse remote sensing data for crop identification. In the work of Perea et al.
    (2018), the combination of dynamic Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) architecture,
    the Bayesian framework and Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used for forecasting the
    short term daily irrigation water demand when data availability is limited. When
    compared to previous work, the model developed enhanced the forecast precision
    by 3% to 11%. Similarly, in Ma et al. (2019), the combination of farmer''s knowledge
    and the IoT was used for deficit irrigation control. Images of the soil were captured,
    and feature extraction was carried out using a convolutional neural network for
    soil moisture prediction and further fed into the fuzzy controller. The combination
    of the IoT was used to get information from the field, artificial intelligence
    and image processing was used to provide more precise and comprehensive control
    to enhance the irrigation process and hydroponics system, as seen in Mehra et
    al. (2018) where the integration of ANN and Bayesian network algorithm with IoT
    for intelligent interaction and control of hydroponics system input parameters.
    Likewise, the combination of AI algorithms, greenhouse climate, irrigation, and
    crop growth control challenge embarked upon by Hemming et al. (2019), was aimed
    at combining horticultural expertise with AI offers a breakthrough in fresh food
    production with limited resources. Integrating a hybrid intelligent algorithm
    for control of irrigation can help achieve robust precision irrigation and can
    be used to enhance the performance and smartness of existing irrigation controllers.
    5.2.3. Model predictive based irrigation controller Model Predictive Control (MPC)
    is a multivariable computer control algorithm that became popular in the power
    plants, chemicals, and petroleum industries (Qin and Badgwell, 2003). It has also
    been applied in a wide variety of industrial applications such as pharmaceuticals
    (Wong et al., 2018, Lee et al., 2016), wastewater treatment plants (Rahmat et
    al., 2011), building (Bosschaerts et al., 2017), food processing, automotive,
    and aerospace (Yakub and Mori, 2013). According to Ding et al. (2018), although
    MPC is an industry born process control method, it is incredibly applicable in
    agricultural activities such as irrigation control, given that it can deal efficiently
    with multivariable, nonlinear, and large time-delay systems such as irrigation.
    MPC has the advantages of dealing with constraints; its capability of utilizing
    simple models, closed-loop stability, and its robustness against parametric uncertainties
    make it one of the most popular multivariable control algorithms (Mohamed et al.,
    2015). Also, MPC is an industrial control technique employed in decision support
    for large scale multivariable problems with multiple constraints (Ocampo-Martinez,
    2010). It requires a heavy computational burden to optimize the future control
    inputs and future process responses that are predicted using a mathematical model
    and optimized according to a cost function. In order to obtain a future value
    of the performance criterion, this control technique uses a plant model and an
    optimizer for calculating plant input. The performance of the system is predicted
    over a finite horizon subject to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of
    the plant (Lozoya et al., 2014). All systems experience one form of constraint
    to another, ranging from physical, environmental to economic constraints, which
    limits the operation of a process. By adopting advanced process control techniques
    such as MPC for irrigation control, excellent performance, better efficiency and
    optimality can be achieved when compared to the use of classical control methods
    (Balbis et al., 2006). Because of the robustness of MPC, the concept of shifting
    the prediction and control horizon based on the next sampling step is always applied,
    wherein the prediction horizons define the optimal future control signal. However,
    it suffers the challenge of very high computational complexity due to the fact
    that it solves online optimization at every time step, which needs to be addressed.
    Proper system identification of a plant is required to be carried out to identify
    model parameters to help reduce the design effort and computational load of the
    predictive model controller (Wahab et al., 2008). This advanced process control
    method requires an accurate process model that tries to summarize and describe
    the behaviour of the system. Better satisfactory control performances can be achieved
    based on the accuracy of the process model. Perhaps, the most important use of
    the system model arises in predictive control applications, in which the model
    is used to predict the process output behaviour when facing changes in set point
    or inputs. Developing the mathematical model can be achieved using either the
    first principle approach when the physics of the process is understood or by using
    data-driven or soft computing approaches such as system identification and other
    artificial intelligence approaches (neural networks, LSTM). An example of the
    data-driven modelling approach was carried out by Ławrýnczuk (2013), who also
    observed that the development and validation of the first principle-based model
    are complicated and proposed a soft computing approach using a neural network
    as a better alternative. MPC provides control actions by repeatedly solving a
    constrained optimization problem, with predictions obtained using the model of
    the plant. The control action is provided by minimizing a cost function subject
    to constraints over a finite prediction horizon. This can be applied to multi-input,
    multi-output (MIMO) systems (Bordons, 2003). Another approach that was adopted
    by Delgoda et al. (2014) applied grey box modelling using linear time series data
    obtained from a water balance model. The system identification was carried out
    considering under saturated circumstances and noise on the soil moisture readings.
    The model fits of 84 and 63 percent for the two-field information set observed
    and satisfaction in all residual tests while the model fit above 99% using AQUACROP
    model data. Furthermore, a grey box system identification method was also compared
    with a white box, otherwise known as the first principle approach used to develop
    a model for a model predictive controller used for a multi-zone office building
    (Picard et al., 2016). Another modelling approach in many kinds of literature
    is by using the system identification method, which is an essential tool for technical
    areas that provides a mathematical and physical representation of a dynamic system
    through different models that can be used for controller design, but they require
    operational data (Mathworks, 2015). In order to combine the best features of the
    two approaches, dynamic modelling based on the combination of system identification
    and physical modelling was proposed by (Adeyemi et al., 2018b; Ooi and Weyer,
    2008). This method was also adopted by Adeyemi et al. (2018a), where system identification
    was used to develop a data-driven model for prediction of plant transpiration
    dynamics. The results obtained stated that a second-order discrete-time transfer
    function model adequately explained the dynamics with an average determination
    coefficient of ±R 0.93 0.04 with incoming radiation, vapour pressure, and leaf
    area index as inputs. While first principle-based models or grey boxes are desirable,
    obtaining models that are effective and fit for purpose may not always be practical,
    and precision irrigation agriculture has often depended on data-driven modelling
    for system identification instead. A research work carried out by Winkler et al.
    (2016), was able to overcome the physical constraint of the traditional irrigation
    system with the emergence of a sprinkler node capable of sensing the local soil
    moisture, communicating it wirelessly, and actuate its sprinkler based on a centrally
    computed timetable. The author suggested that future work may be directed to data-driven
    system identification, where soil moisture and weather variables measurements
    leveraging on the IoT and knowledge of fluid movement can be used to build the
    predictive model over time to address the changing dynamics of the environment.
    Although few of researchers have adopted the use of a predictive model for control
    as seen in (Delgoda et al., 2016a, Delgoda et al., 2016b, Lozoya et al., 2016,
    Saleem et al., 2013, Puig et al., 2012) for irrigation control as summarized in
    Table 4, there is still need for its enhancement to help achieve water saving,
    minimize the energy needed for irrigation and to ensure better yield by developing
    better predictive models, optimization algorithm and by integrating IoT for enhancement
    of the monitoring and real-time adaptive control. According to Koech and Langat
    (2018), real-time optimal based control of the irrigation system is still is rapidly
    attracting more research effort for surface irrigation because of its ability
    to improve water use efficiency, as illustrated in Fig. 10. Therefore, MPC has
    been an optimal based control, which offers a very promising method for improving
    water use efficiency, as 40% of the water consumed by irrigation can be saved
    using a predictive model when compared with the conventional system or open-loop
    automatic irrigation system (Lefkowitz, 2019). Table 4. Application of MPC for

    in the tuning of the model predictive controllers using evolutional algorithms
    such as GA and PSO, towards the realization of smart irrigation systems (with
    optimization and real-time control) for improving water use efficiency (WUE).
    Future work should focus on adaptive model predictive control to be able to track
    the changing dynamics and uncertainties effectively. Also, due to the computation
    complexity of predictive and optimization algorithms, which makes it challenging
    for its implementation on target embedded systems, future work should focus on
    leveraging on industrial IoT servers for real-time control of the irrigation process.
    5.2.4. Adaptive decision support system and other precision irrigation control
    method The characteristics of soil, plant, and weather variables that affect the
    cropping system are dynamic and nonlinear; hence, they are time-varying parameters.
    In farming, the properties that typically vary within and between seasons which
    include crop coefficient, plant growth, soil properties, and environmental factors.
    Therefore, those factors have a direct effect on the timing and irrigation quantity
    needed for ideal plant growth (Evans and King, 2012). The heart of an adaptive
    decision support system includes the real-time monitoring of the various parameters
    using different types of sensors as well as the modification and adjustment of
    the adaptive rules in the decision support system. Adaptive Decision Support System
    makes use of sensor feedback readings of soil, plant, and weather parameters stored
    on cloud platforms to regularly re-adjust the scheduling algorithm to maintain
    the required irrigation system efficiency. The adaptive performance of the system
    is measured on how well the changing dynamics of the plant in terms of infield
    temporal and spatial variability is captured. The adaptability to parameter uncertainties,
    spatial variabilities and the environmental disturbances on irrigation systems
    have been extensively investigated by using optimal control with the adaptive
    feature as well as variable rate water application systems proposed by numerous
    researchers (Pereira et al., 2018, Raine and Mccarthy, 2014, Smith et al., 2009,
    Evans and Sadler, 2008). Also, several works on the adaptive control of machines
    based on continuous move systems such as low energy precision application (LEPA),
    centre pivot, a linear and lateral move for spatially variable irrigation has
    been carried out (Debauche et al., 2018, Peters, 2014, Smith et al., 2009). Due
    to their present automation stage and the big coverage area using a single lateral
    pipe, these systems are particularly suited for variable rate implementation (Adeyemi
    et al., 2017). A sprinkler controlled with a modulated pulse on a self-moving
    linear sprinkler system was applied by Evans et al. (2012b), where wireless sensor
    network-based DSS was optimized to adapt changes of crop type, irrigation pattern,
    and field location for instructions on individual sprinkler heads on how much
    water to apply and where it is needed. Similarly, Patel et al. (2017) successfully
    applied a DSS for an on-farm sensor-based irrigation water management to determine
    the timing and volume of irrigation using a border, sprinkler, and drip irrigation
    systems for wheat, maize, potato, and chili crops. However, the usage and adoption
    of the various types of site-specific variable rate (SS-VRI) precision irrigation
    technologies have generally been limited by farmers and researchers. Thus, a potential
    barrier is that full implementation of advanced SS-VRI generally has the most
    demanding requirements and the most complicated and costly control systems of
    all precision irrigation technologies (Evans and King, 2012). Simulation models
    can be used to simulate crop reactions to irrigation and plant management based
    on the physical modelling of the crop phenology by first principles (Mccarthy
    et al., 2014). These simulation models offer the opportunity to enhance precision
    irrigation strategies as the need for time-consuming field experiments is eliminated
    (Cong et al., 2017). A simulation framework called VARIwise, which was used for
    precision irrigation and capable of performing real-time decision support, was
    proposed by Mccarthy et al. (2014). The framework was able to integrate input
    information from real-time sensors for irrigation adaptive decisions. However,
    simulation models are necessary to assist irrigation decisions making in order
    to achieve model precision; most often, the information is limited to a particular
    plant that the platform is accessible for that purpose. The limitation in data
    available for this endeavour often limits the use of the platforms to specific
    crops. Similarly, a crop water model newly developed by FAO, called Aqua Crop,
    simulates the response of water to crop yield. It was calibrated using ten years
    of daily weather data to grow winter wheat and subsequently used to simulate yield
    under different sowing dates, irrigation frequencies, and irrigation sequences
    (Ali and Abustan, 2013). The simulation result shows that under the prevailing
    climatic and soil conditions, irrigation frequency is the most water-efficient
    schedule for wheat. The results further indicate a lower yield trend under late
    sowing. An optimization framework based on simulation for the ideal fertigation
    schedule was developed by Cong et al. (2017). The problem is represented in the
    form of decision tree graphs, and ant colony optimization (ACO) is used as the
    optimization engine and a process-based crop growth model to evaluate the objective
    function. The results show that ACO was able to identify irrigation and fertilizer
    schedules that result in better net returns while using less irrigation water
    and fertilizer. Also available in the literature is a crop process-based model
    called DSS for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). This software consists of 16
    different crop models with software to evaluate and apply the crop models for
    various purposes. However, it is increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT
    crop models, because different sets of computer code were written for different
    crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves
    (Jones et al., 2003). Levidow et al. (2014) suggested that for farmers and researchers
    to be able to use a DSS efficiently, it should not be too complicated but user-friendly,
    affordable, and informative systems helpful to achieve precision irrigation. 6.
    Commercial irrigation system for farmers and researchers As precision irrigation
    control is crucial to increase productivity and ensuring food security, so many
    companies have developed a smart watering system that may help achieve high water-saving
    and precise irrigation; few are highlighted in Table 5. Most of the products aim
    to achieve precision irrigation and reducing the stress involved in manual irrigation.

    However, the high cost of acquiring these state-of-the-art devices poses a significant
    challenge to farmers and researchers. Also, most of these commercial irrigation
    systems available in the market are custom-built, therefore, making them difficult
    to be appropriately tuned and adaptively controlled. Furthermore, most of the
    commercial irrigation systems do not consider soil, plant, weather parameters
    conditions in making irrigation decisions for optimal water saving. Also, the
    effect of disturbances to plants such as evapotranspiration, signifying water
    loss from plants and the surface of the soil, the changing and nonlinear dynamics
    of plants cannot be correctly manage by most of the commercial products. 7. Future
    research directions The essence of this review work is to explore the various
    efforts and progress that have been made to improve water use efficiency, water-saving,
    and above all, to achieve food security using the IoT- based monitoring and applied
    control systems. From the review, researchers and farmers can leverage on recent
    developmental evolution on the IoT for real-time monitoring and data collection
    for data-driven control, machine, and deep learning for intelligent prediction
    of agricultural processes such as yield, water consumption, and weather. Further
    investigation is needed on the use of normalized dimension vegetation index (NDVI),
    lea area index (LEA) as well as other technical indexes in deciding and planning
    irrigation scheduling for large irrigation farm area. Also, accurate model-based
    predictions can guide farmers to prepare for the activities and guide against
    unusual changes that can affect agricultural practices. Furthermore, different
    control algorithms in the context of irrigation systems have been discussed; researchers
    should focus on enhancing any of the model-based and adaptive controllers with
    real time monitoring for precision irrigation. The integration of evolutional
    algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony and Particle Swarm Optimization
    for parameters tuning of adaptive irrigation controllers, is important for the
    adaptation of nonlinear and changing dynamics of soil, plant and weather variables
    while ensuring optimal precision irrigation for enhancement of irrigation technology.
    In addition, the development of the digital and complex irrigation technology
    is really important to be explored, so that developed technology will provide
    a stable, suitable, and affordable system for ordinary farmers in improving the
    water use efficiency while minimizing water scarcity for agricultural activities.
    Though, the various types of monitoring and advanced control strategies for precision
    irrigation have been discussed in this review, and they might not have covered
    all the approaches in kinds of literature. Interested readers can refer to the
    cited references in the paper, from which more related articles could be accessed.
    8. Conclusion The global awareness on the effect of global warming and climate
    change on water scarcity and food security is on the increase, which has challenged
    researchers to brace up more efforts developing cutting edge strategies on real-time
    monitoring and control for precision agriculture that can mitigate the effect
    of this inevitable phenomenon. This review on the monitoring and control strategies
    for precision irrigation systems is based on the previous and relevant research
    work that has been done to help achieve water saving in agriculture. This review
    article has been able to give a clear picture of research trends in developing
    advanced control strategies for precision irrigation and to assess research opportunities
    in studies that can ensure water saving, improve crop yield and optimize the energy
    needed for irrigation. It is expected to generate new ideas and inspire readers
    on how current monitoring and advance control approaches can be enhanced towards
    achieving improved precision irrigation for food security and help achieve water
    saving on forestalling imminent water crises. Declaration of Competing Interest

  description: In many countries, irrigation water is one of the major contributors
    to water scarcity. In the present study, a novel optimized irrigation system which
    minimizes water consumption in irrigation is presented. The system is based on
    a predictive control algorithm, which foresees the water need of the crop, and
    regulates the time and amount of irrigation to maintain the soil moisture around
    an optimal level, while taking into account system constraints. The predictive
    feature of the algorithm requires a model of the soil moisture, which is obtained
    from the actual meteorological data of the Kingdom of Bahrain. The optimization
    problem is formulated as an Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) problem and
    implemented using MATLAB. The simulation experiments show that the novel system
    yields a reduction of water consumption around 8% and 16% compared with the PID
    and On-off controllers, respectively, while maintaining an optimal soil moisture
    level.

    Chapter © 2019 1 Introduction The increasing interest for the sweet water consumption
    in the world and the increase of desertic zones due to climate change, has caused
    a legitimate concern in the scientific world for the efficient use of the water
    resource in modern agriculture [1, 2]. It has been researched in the efficient
    use of the sweet water resource in the agriculture using predictive control methods,
    achieving greater efficiency and reducing significantly the water consumption
    [2, 3], with a limitated supply of water and uncertain meteorologic conditions
    achieve in maintaining soil humidity above the wilting of crops [4], with good
    estimations of the demand of water in crops and the local time it is achieved
    to optimize supply and demand with the objective of optimizing the performance
    of the crops [5]. It has been used a multiplatform application of a PC and a mobile
    module for the watering of strawberries, taking into account the agroclimatic
    conditions, soil information and information of the hydric system obtaining information
    of the watering time required and achieving a save of water between an 11% and
    33% [6]. A study was done about the hydric balance of several crops in dry area
    in Spain, finding that the (ETa) represented the biggest loss and the improve
    in the watering efficiency [7]. ETa and the unique coefficients of crops (Kc)
    has been investigated for the development phases of the coffee (Coffee arabica),
    through a superficial watering system, in the region of San Andrés, Cuba. It was
    obtained that the most demand of water is produced in the phase flowering-fructification,
    the ETa annual daily average was of 3.24 mm/d and the unique global coefficient
    of crop was of 0.86 [8]. It has been implemented an Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANN) to program the watering of strawberries using the humidity of the soil and
    its physical properties as supplies of the model. The system got a save of water
    of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. However, ANN requires great set of data
    for the training and are incapable of describing the physical dynamic of a system.
    This makes that its use is limited in the supporting tools of decisions in real
    time [9]. It was applied a diffuse logic model to program drip irrigation using
    ETa, humidity of the soil and the growth stage of the crops as entries to the
    mode [10]. It was applied a diffuse logic model using data of soil humidity, foliar
    moisture, and climatologic data as entries for the model and implement the decisions
    of watering programming. The system was able to maintain the soil moisture thresholds
    in the specified range [11]. It has been propose an efficient watering system
    based o ETa, using the diffuse logic with the purpose of avoiding the watering
    excess that affects the harvest, their results show that the diffuse model is
    a fast and accurate tool to calculate the ETa, as well as the net irrigation required
    [10]. It has been investigated about the water applied in the rice field, where
    it is recommended to install a drainage in the central line in the rice fields,
    a drainage installation eliminating excess water in the root zone in time [12].
    It were determined the periods of need of water to maintain the hydric balance
    in the strawberry plantations in the commune of San Pedro, through the agroclimatic
    variables and the needs of water by evapotranspiration for strawberries plantations
    in the commune use the correlation analysis, principal component analysis and
    k-means [13]. 2 Characteristics of the Zone of San Pedro 2.1 Irrigation The commune
    of San Pedro, located in the Metropolitan region of Chile, is the most important
    area of the country in the strawberry cultivation [14]. Affected by the water
    shortage of the last decades product of the aquifers over exploitation. The basin
    of the Yali estuarian is mainly located in the comunes of Santo Domingo and San
    Pedro. Being the last one, the commune with the greatest irrigated surface of
    e 4,800 hectare (ha) [15] from a total of 61,298 ha and of these 3,495 ha with
    system of micro watering, mainly thanks to the drip irrigation, according to the
    last Agricultural and Forestry Census 2007 [16]. The main source of water is of
    waterwheel and in second place of deep wells [17], since the commune lacks of
    water from the Andes Mountains that could provide water for irrigation through
    the rivers and water ways. 2.2 Evapotranspiration The evapotranspiration s the
    total transfer of water from the vegetation cover to the atmosphere, by the process
    of evaporation of the water in its different stages from the earth surface to
    the atmosphere and the transpiration of the vegetation cover by the water absorbed
    by its roots that transfer the water mainly through the stomata located in its
    leaves [18]. Below is shown Eq. 1 relating to Evapotranspiration [19]. $$\\begin{aligned}
    et_0 =\\frac{0,408 \\varDelta (R_n-G)+y \\frac{900}{T+273}u_2(e_s - e_a)}{\\varDelta
    +y(1+0,34 u_2)} \\end{aligned}$$ (1) where : \\(et_0\\): reference Evapotranspiration
    [mm/d], \\(R_n\\): net radiation on the surface of the crop \\([\\text {M}\\text
    {J}/({\\text {m}}^2 \\text {d})]\\), G: flux density of soil heat \\([\\text {M}\\text
    {J}/(\\text {m}^2 \\text {d})]\\), T: air average daily temperature at 2 m\\(\\text
    {high}\\ [{}^\\circ \\text {C}]\\), \\(u_2\\): wind speed at 2 m high [m/s], \\(e_s\\):
    saturation vapor pressure [kPa], \\(e_a\\): real steam pressure [kPa], \\(e_s
    - e_a\\): saturation vapor pressure deficit [kPa], \\(\\varDelta \\): vapor pressure
    curve of the slope \\([{k}{Pa}/{}^\\circ {\\text {C}}]\\), y: psychrometric constant
    \\([\\text {k}\\text {Pa}/{}^\\circ \\text {C}]\\). Evapotranspiration f the crop
    is obtained from: $$\\begin{aligned} et_c=K_c ~ et_0 \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where,
    \\(et_c\\): Evapotranspiration of the cultivation (mm/d), \\(K_c\\): Cultivation
    Coefficient, \\(et_0\\): Potential Evapotranspiration or of reference (mm/d).
    3 Transfer Function For measuring the hydric balance represented in Fig. 1, like
    [2, 3]: $$\\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\theta }(t)=ir(t)+rf(t)+cr(t)- et_c(t)-dp(t)-ro(t)
    \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\(\\dot{\\theta }\\): Soil moisture, ir(t): Irrigation,
    rf(t): Rains, cr(t): Capillary rise, \\(et_c(t)\\): Evapotranspiration of plants
    and soil, dp(t): Deep drainage, ro(t): Water loss in irrigation. Fig. 1. Components
    of hydric balance in irrigation systems. Full size image Considering, the Winter
    rains of Mediterranean climate, capillar rise by study zone lacking of wetlands
    or superficial groundwater; superficial spill that is minimized thanks to drip
    irrigation technology or tape that are despised in the model and the deep percolation
    in a watering system is clearly proportional to the moisture of the soil [20].
    $$\\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\theta }(t)=ir(t-\\tau )-et_c-c_1 \\theta \\end{aligned}$$
    (4) \\(et_c\\), is considered disturbance. Finally the hydric balance model is
    represented in Eq. 5. $$\\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\theta }(t)=ir(t-\\tau )-c_1 \\theta
    \\end{aligned}$$ (5) 3.1 The Transform of Laplace Applying the transform of Laplace
    results: $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\theta (s)}{ir(s)}=\\frac{e^{-\\tau s}}{(s+c_1)}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (6) 3.2 Characterization of the Model To characterize the response
    of a dynamic system, this must be submitted to its levels of design, which in
    this case correspond to the estimative study of the hydric balance defined in
    Eq. 5. For which the response to the step, is a good estimator of the behavior
    of the system in this stage. An entry signal of the step type allows to know the
    response of the system in the face of abrupt changes in its entry. So, it gives
    an idea of the time of the establishment of the signal, that is to say, how long
    does it take to the system in achieving its steady state. $$\\begin{aligned} \\text
    {Response to the step}\\rightarrow ir(s) = \\frac{1}{s}e^{Ts} \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) Is obtained, $$\\begin{aligned} \\theta (s)= \\frac{1}{s}e^{Ts} \\frac{e^{-\\tau
    s}}{(s+c_1)} \\end{aligned}$$ (8) To proceed to a first approach in the application
    of control strategies, the PID controller is the base alternative, which is possible
    to tune in through the Ziegler-Nichols method. In Table 1. Table 1. Calculation
    of tuning of Ziegler-Nichols. Full size table 4 Feedback Control Systems 4.1 PID
    Controllers According to Fig. 2 and performance data in Table 2. The PID controller
    gets a shorter Rise Time of 0:20:01, the P 0:23:54 and the PI is obtained at 0:26:38,
    the stabilization time or Settling Time the PI controller reaches with the shorter
    time of 4:39:13, then the P controller at 6:27:56 and the controller achieve stabilization
    at 10:17:28. Where it can be appreciated an output overrun related to the slogan
    or Overshoot, where PI controller with a 41.28%, the P controller obtains a 49.89%
    and the PID controller gets the biggest excess of 68.89%, analogously with a Peak
    PI = 28.4648, P = 29.9165 and PID = 33.7183 which occur Peak Time PI = 1:29:17,
    P = 1:33:36 and PID = 1:24:58. So, PI controller gets the best results with the
    lower stabilization time 4:39:13 and lower Overshoot of a 41.28%. Fig. 2. Response
    PID controller. Full size image Table 2. Summary of performance indicators. Full
    size table 4.2 PID Controller with Disturbances According to Fig. 3 and performance
    data in Table 3 in disturbances. The PID controller gets a lower Rise Time of
    0:19:26, the P 0:23:28 and gets the PI at 0:26:04, the stabilization time or Settling
    Time the controller P, PI and PID do not achieve stabilization in the evaluation
    period. The lower excess or Overshoot is obtained by the PI controller with a
    42.27%, the P controller gets a 50.64% and the PID controller gets the greatest
    excess of 69.73%, analogously with a Peak PI = 27.9688, P = 29.3660 and PID =
    33.1689 with Peak Time PI = 1:34:11, P = 1:30:00 and PID = 1:24:06. Similar results
    are obtained between the simulations with and without disturbances, except that
    the simulations with disturbances do not achieve a stabilization time of the system.
    The PI controller gets better results with the lower Overshoot of a 42.27%. Fig.

    Summary of performance indicators under disturbances. Full size table 4.3 Fuzzy
    Controller Basically, fuzzy controller was configured with nine specific rules,
    based on the following variable (data set): $$\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf A (i)=
    {\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} Irrigation \\\\ Evapotranspiration \\\\ Weather~statics
    \\\\ Anual~rain~statics \\\\ \\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$ (9) These
    rules are summarized in nine rules: $$\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf X (i)= {\\left\\{
    \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathrm {if~(input~is~} mf1 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~}
    mf1 )\\\\ \\mathrm {if~(input~is~} mf2 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~} mf1 )\\\\
    \\mathrm {if~(input~is~} mf3 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~} mf5 )\\\\ \\mathrm
    {if~(input~is~} mf4 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~} mf6 )\\\\ \\mathrm {if~(input~is~}
    mf5 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~} mf6 )\\\\ \\mathrm {if~(input~is~} mf6 )~\\mathrm
    {then~(output~is~} mf7 )\\\\ \\mathrm {if~(input~is~} mf7 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~}
    mf7 )\\\\ \\mathrm {if~(input~is~} mf8 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~} mf9 )\\\\
    \\mathrm {if~(input~is~} mf9 )~\\mathrm {then~(output~is~} mf9 )\\\\ \\end{array}\\right.
    } \\end{aligned}$$ (10) In Eq. 10 the rules set is represented by \\(\\mathbf
    H (i)=\\left\\{ mf1, mf2,...,mf9\\right\\} \\) where the \\(\\mathbf H (i)\\)
    are the summarized set of the input variables for each “required” point of these,
    shown in the the Eq. 9. The Fuzzy controller can not reach the set point but achieves
    the stability of the system, according to rule set applied in this case. Regarding
    Fig. 4 and performance data in Table 4 the fuzzy controller reaches the Rise Time
    at 16:07:58 and at 17:09:36 with disturbances, the stabilization time or Settling
    Time is reached at 21:54:09 and in a day at 21:11:14 for the fuzzy controller
    with disturbances. Fig. 4. Response fuzzy control with and without disturbances.
    Full size image Table 4. Performance indicators in fuzzy controller. Full size
    table 4.4 Neural Networks The Artificial Neural Networks was configured in a “feedfordward”
    architecture [21, 22], and trained with “back-propagation” algorithm where the
    input layer (f(x)) has three neurons to process the input variables these are:
    $$\\begin{aligned} f(x)= {\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} Irrigation \\\\ Anual\\;rain\\;statics
    \\\\ Weather\\;statics \\\\ \\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$ (11) On other
    hand hidden layer has ten neurons and the output layer has just one output. In
    the hidden layer (g(x)) ten neurons has the function to process the input variables.
    In the output layer just one layer represent the humidity % in the soil. The response
    of the controller by neural network shows an overshoot to achieve the stability
    of the system, corresponding to a conventional FeedForward neural network with
    a layer of ten neurons. According to Fig. 5 and performance data in Table 5 the
    controller of neural network achieves the Rise Time at 1:56:21 and at 1:59:14
    with disturbances, the stabilization time or Settling Time is reached at 3:45:22
    and in a day at 23:38:41 for the fuzzy controller with disturbances and a peak
    of 20.1548 without disturbances. Fig. 5. Response neural network with and without
    disturbances. Full size image Table 5. Indicators of neural network performance.

    and IAE performance measures respectively. The controller of neural network achieves
    the best adequation index or AI, instead the controller PI type achieves better
    results in all the indicators of error evaluation. Table 6. Performance measures.
    Full size table 5.1 Performance Evaluation In Table 7, is summarized a general
    performance evaluation for each controller according to information developed
    in this work, getting better results the neural network in Adequation Index, Settling
    Time, Overshoot and Stability and secondly the controller of the PI type for its
    low performance index at error proof and its low implementation cost [23]. Table
    7. Performance evaluation. Full size table 6 Conclusion In this work it was established
    that the use of different control tools, allows an improvement of the hydric balance
    in strawberry plantations. Where the results obtained, could be validated through
    the performance indices shown in Table 6. Highlighting the neural networks as
    the technique of best response when implemented in a simulation environment, getting
    a negligible error and with less response time than the rest of techniques. Given
    the characteristics of hydric balance in the cultivation of strawberries, stands
    for being a slow system, to which humidity of soil can be controlled fast and
    efficiently from the dynamic of the system, allowing an optimal control and improving
    productivity and quality of the fruit with the use of neural network controllers.
    This work can be implemented in different types of cultivations, where exist shortage
    of water, loss or potential decrease of it, at a national or international level.

    scale system 1. Introduction In industrial process planning/scheduling, which
    integrates continuous and batch operations, two types of problems can be found.
    The first one, which takes place in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), is to
    adapt the production process structure to the manufactured products. The second
    is to operate the production structure, i.e., to decide the value of the set points
    of the relevant controllers, the start time of the batch process units, the energy
    sources and raw products for each batch, some parameters of the batch production
    recipes, etc. In [1], the scheduling problems are classified and their industrial
    requirements are summarized; while in [2], a schematic review of the scheduling
    and control problem is given. The MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems), on the
    fourth level of the control pyramid (Fig. 1), are responsible for planning the
    production (deciding what to produce, how much, when and how), finding the best
    way to operate the plant and analysing and reporting the process performance [[3],
    [4], [5]]. Also, among other functions, the MES link the SCADA (Supervisory Control
    and Data Acquisition) system and the advanced control tools with the ERP (Enterprise
    Resource Planning) systems that constitute the highest level of the automation
    hierarchy. Download : Download high-res image (184KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Technological levels of the automation pyramid in an industrial
    environment. Unfortunately, the decisions on how to operate the production structure
    are not always automated and are taken by experts, who may have been trained using
    complex central control room simulators [6,7]. Some difficulties come from the
    uncertainties in the batching time, the variability of the raw material, the energy
    availability and the effect of the demands on the process environment. Other issues
    to be considered are the available storage capacity, the inertia of the process,
    or the difficulty to adapt to new situations. Thus, the use of automatic scheduling
    can improve this decision-making. Several methodologies, or a mix of some of them,
    have been used in scheduling and control: for instance, mathematical optimization,
    expert systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc., [[8], [9], [10], [11],
    [12], [13], [14]]. However, the high complexity and diversity of the scheduling
    problems, predictive or reactive [15], implies that there is no widespread modelling
    frame for them [16]. When scheduling employs an optimization model solved online
    [17], it becomes analogous to Model Predictive Control (MPC), that is, model based
    scheduling [18]. The most relevant properties of MPC that can be exploited to
    solve scheduling problems are: open formulation, which allows the use of different
    types of prediction models and cost functions; different algorithms for mathematical
    optimization; signal constraints in the controller design, etc. [[19], [20], [21],
    [22]]. Hybrid models with binary variables can also be included in the formulation
    of the MPC [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. Thus, many scheduling problems have been
    solved using MPC: industrial manufacturing [[27], [28], [29]]; energy management
    [30,31]; the scheduling of emergency vehicles [32] or supply chain management
    [33]. In addition, other authors have combined MPC and heuristics to solve other
    scheduling problems: transport scheduling [34], supply chains [35] [36], or the
    calculation of the irrigation periods of certain crops [37]. This paper proposes
    a general algorithm to calculate the dynamic scheduling of a production process
    with identical, concurrent and parallel batch process units that are included
    in a large system ([38] illustrates the fact that this problem is common in the
    batch process industry). The target is to calculate the waiting time intervals
    between consecutive cycles of each process unit. The algorithm complements MPC
    with expert knowledge of the process to restrict the values of the decision variables
    and establish the steady state system performance. The proposed model based scheduling
    is solved using a sequential optimization approach, although the simultaneous
    optimization approach is another alternative used to solve dynamic scheduling
    problems [[39], [40], [41]]. The scheduling algorithm is applied to the sugar
    industry, in particular, to the scheduling of the crystallization section, which
    usually includes identical discontinuous crystallizers working in parallel, whose
    cycle times are unknown and depend on the properties of the raw products and the
    available energy, while the raw products and energy demands depend on their cycle
    stage. It entails problems of product storage and energy and product availability
    and is, therefore, a key problem in industrial sugar production [[42], [43], [44]].
    Other authors have provided solutions to similar problems. In [45], a decentralized
    algorithm is proposed, in which a dynamic optimizer calculates the values of the
    external input signals of the whole system and the scheduling problem is solved
    using a static model. In [46,47], a hierarchical and distributed strategy with
    two levels is proposed, the highest level containing an eMPC (economic MPC) to
    coordinate the low level predictive controllers that work on each batch process
    unit. An antecedent to the algorithm presented in this article was proposed in
    [48,49]. Both turn to the MPC to solve a scheduling problem. The first is applied
    to a system similar to our study case and the second to a laboratory pilot plant.
    They estimate the planning actions with respect to the current time, while in
    our proposal, the waiting time intervals between two consecutive batches of the
    same process unit is calculated. Therefore, we can use the heuristic to efficiently
    constrain our decision variables. In addition, the first reference uses some empirical
    tables in the prediction model. However, our prediction model uses empirical functions
    and mass balances. From the point of view of the authors, the main contributions
    of the paper are: • A general MPC algorithm to solve the online dynamic scheduling
    of identical/parallel batch process units embedded in a large process that calculates
    the waiting time intervals between two consecutive batches of the same process
    unit. • The use of heuristics to constrain the values of the decision variables
    (waiting time intervals). The heuristic constraints are based on technological
    parameters and the boundary conditions or inputs to the system. Besides, the algorithm
    requires a prediction of the active time interval of the batch process unit that
    must be calculated from the process measurements. • The algorithm is implemented
    and tested in an industrial simulated process, the evaporation and crystallization
    stages of a sugar production process. Like any other MPC, the algorithm requires
    a prediction model of the system. Therefore, a reduced prediction grey-model of
    the process is developed and briefly shown. The remainder of the paper is organized
    as follows. First, the general problem to be solved is set out and the scheduling
    algorithm is formulated. After describing the industrial case study, in which
    the algorithm was tested, the algorithm parametrization and adjustment is outlined,
    emphasizing the internal prediction model of the batch crystallizer. Then, some
    simulation results are discussed, and the conclusions and further research are
    given in the final section. 2. Scheduling algorithm 2.1. Description and scope
    The objective of the algorithm is to find the changeover of the current scheduling
    of a batch production plant to a stationary one. The plant contains m equal batch
    process units, which operate in parallel and simultaneously, competing for raw
    products and energy resources. These units also share the stock of raw and processed
    products (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (312KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Scheme of the batch process for which the schedulling
    algorithm is developed. In particular, the batch process units have two states:
    idle and active, in which different stages can be considered. The batch size is
    fixed and the process batch units are not interrupted until batch completion.
    Thus, the control problem is to decide the waiting time intervals between consecutives
    cycles of each process unit in order to fulfil some target with respect to the
    performance of a larger system, in which they are embedded. The control objectives
    of the complete system can be very different: management of the storage tanks,
    operating the process in a more uniform way, reducing the energy demand, loss
    minimization, production cost minimization, profit maximization; etc. [50]. Thus,
    a cost function to represent one or more of them must be used. The proposed scheduling
    problem is solved using an MPC that finds the values of the control/decision variables
    (waiting time intervals) to minimize or maximize a cost function and optional
    operation constraints. As the decision variables are time interval values, a nonlinear
    programming (NLP) problem must be solved, instead of the integer programming problem
    that appears when the decision variables are the activation of the batch process
    units. The MPC uses a dynamic optimizer to solve the NLP problem using a sequential
    approach (Fig. 3). Thus, the controller requires a dynamic prediction model of
    the process, preferably as straightforward as possible: one which is sufficiently
    accurate, but which can be executed quickly and is computationally stable. The
    input signals to the model are the values of the decision variables and the current
    sampled values of some variables of the raw products and energy resources, hereinafter
    called boundary conditions (bc). In each iteration of the optimizer, the dynamic
    simulation runs from the current initial state of the system, hereinafter called
    initial conditions (ic), to the prediction horizon in order to evaluate the cost
    function and the operation constraints. Download : Download high-res image (306KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Controller overall scheme. Each sampling
    period, the controller recalculates the complete scheduling of the batch units
    to reach a stationary scheduling and the next calculated waiting time intervals
    are sent to the process. However, the sequential approach can be computationally
    demanding, so, as a security measure in real time applications, if a new scheduling
    is not computed, the latest estimated scheduling must be applied. This assumption
    implies that the scheduling is not the optimum, but the best possible solution.
    To impose a stationary scheduling and help to solve the optimization procedure,
    knowledge-based assumptions related to the theoretical ideal scheduling of the
    particular plant are formulated. These assumptions establish some constraints
    on the control variables. 2.2. Mathematical formulation Before presenting the
    calculation algorithm, the notation is outlined: • p is the number that identifies
    each batch process unit. p = 1, 2, 3, …, m. m is the number of batch units. •
    k is the cycle number of each process unit p, k = 1, 2, 3, … • , the batch prediction
    horizon, is the time, expressed in terms of number of cycles of each process unit,
    during which the evolution of the system is predicted. • , the batch control horizon,
    is the number of cycles of each batch unit in which the control signals (waiting
    time intervals) must be computed. Np must be greater than or equal to Nu, thus,
    the values of the waiting time intervals from remain constant throughout the rest
    of the prediction horizon. Np and Nu are controller tuning parameters. • , active
    time interval of any process unit. As the recipe of the batch unit does not change,
    depends on the technological parameters (tp) of the identical batch process units
    and the properties of the raw products and energy resources (bc). It must be estimated
    using an empiric or theoretical model function of the and values and is supposed
    to be constant during Np. • , waiting time interval for the cycle number k of
    the process unit number p. • , stationary waiting time interval, is the value
    of the waiting time interval since . • , ideal stationary waiting time interval.
    • , stationary cycle time interval, is the sum of and . • , ideal stationary cycle
    time interval, is the sum of and . • , stationary gap time interval, is the time
    interval between the startup of two successive batch process units in stationary
    state. It is also the ratio between and m. • , the ideal stationary gap time interval.
    This must be estimated using an empiric or theoretical model function of the and
    values. • , remaining cycle time of the current batch (k = 1) of the process unit
    number p. As the recipe of the batch unit does not change, this depends on the
    tp and bc values and the current state of the process unit ( ). It must be estimated
    using an empiric or theoretical model, similar to that used for . • , start time
    for the batch number k of the process unit number p. Fig. 4 shows an example of
    the intended scheduling for three process units (m = 3) and four cycles as the
    batch control horizon (Nu = 4). It illustrates the meaning of the , , values.
    The general algorithm is outlined below. Download : Download high-res image (308KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Proposed scheduling for m = 3 and
    Nu = 4. To facilitate the set up of the problem solution, the batch process units
    are arranged according to their values. The process unit with the lowest will
    be the first (p = 1) and the one with the highest will be the last (p=m). As mentioned
    above, four knowledge-based assumptions, implying an ideal stationary scheduling,
    are especially important in the algorithm. The first one is that the ideal stationary
    scheduling must be imposed since Nu, then the waiting time intervals remain unchanged
    from that cycle and their values are equal to the stationary waiting time interval.
    (1) The ideal stationary scheduling implies that all process units are perfectly
    sequenced in time. Thus, the start time of the cycle number Nu of the process
    unit number p + 1 is the start time of the cycle number Nu of the process unit
    number p plus the stationary gap time interval. (2) For the process unit number
    p, the start time of the cycle number Nu is the remaining cycle time of the current
    cycle plus the sum of the waiting time intervals of the Nu next cycles plus the
    sum of the active time interval of the Nu-1 next cycles. (3) Using (Eq. (3)) in
    (Eq. (2)), Eq. (4) is obtained: (4) Expanding (Eq. (4)) for p = 1, 2, 3, …, m-1:
    (5) Adding the first p-1 equations from (eq. 5), the result is: (6) Eq. (6) is
    also true for p = 1. Imposing in (Eq. (6)) that, for the first batch process unit
    (p = 1), the waiting time interval to start the batch number Nu is the stationary
    waiting time interval ( ), it follows that: (7) Besides, by definition, the stationary
    cycle time interval, is the sum of and , and the value of must be the m-th part
    of the stationary cycle time interval ( ): (8) (9) Then, using (Eq. (9)) in (Eq.
    (7)), Eq. (10) is obtained: (10) As a result, using (Eq. (1)) and (Eq. (10)),
    the waiting time intervals are clustered in a matrix (Fig. 5), in which the row
    indicates the number of the batch process unit (p) and the column the cycle number
    (k). This matrix can be fully evaluated using the optimizer results: and . To
    calculate these waiting time intervals, it is necessary to have generic models
    of the active time interval and the remaining cycle time of the current batch,
    models that depend on the technological parameters of the batch process units
    (tp) and the boundary conditions for the complete batch sub-process (bc) and the
    current state of the process unit p ( ): (11) Download : Download high-res image

    The second knowledge-based assumption concerns the value of the stationary waiting
    time interval. An ideal value of this time ( ) can be proposed to provide a constraint
    for the value. The ideal stationary gap time interval depends on the technological
    parameters of the batch process units (tp) and the boundary conditions for the
    complete batch sub-process (bc). It can be estimated using the following generic
    model: (12) Applying (Eq. (8)) and (Eq. (9)) with the ideal stationary values
    ( and ) and replacing and by (Eq. (11) and (12)), the ideal stationary waiting
    time interval can be computed: (13) The third knowledge-based assumption refers
    to the current cycles, that is, to the values. The worst-case scenario is when
    the values are the same, which implies that all batch process units are running
    at the same pace. In this situation, a good solution is to schedule the batch
    process units according to the ideal gap time interval ( ). Hence, for this worst-case
    scenario, the values of the first waiting time intervals of each process unit
    p ( will be . Then, an upper limit for the first waiting time interval of any
    process unit can be established and a value range for is given in (Eq. (14)),
    where Δu ε [0.1, 0.5], for one unit, is another tuning controller parameter to
    set the waiting time interval range and increase the optimizer freedom. (14) The
    last knowledge-based assumption is associated with the convergence of the series
    of waiting time intervals of each process unit towards the ideal stationary scheduling.
    It is expected that these sequences converge to the ideal stationary waiting time
    interval: . This convergence can be imposed if a linear decrease in the constraints
    on the waiting time interval values is assumed; then, the next bounds can be obtained:
    (15) Finally, the bounds of the stationary waiting time interval ( ) must be the
    bounds. Thus, applying p = 1 and k = Nu to (Eq. (15)), it can be concluded that:
    (16) Using the expressions (Eq. (14)) to (Eq. (16)), the values of the decision
    variables can be constrained. Thus, the algorithm implicitly guides the selection
    of the decision variables to the ideal stationary schedule. The optimization procedure
    is improved if the optimized signals are well conditioned. Thus, instead of the
    waiting time intervals ( and ), the control signals ( and ), whose value ranges
    are [0., 1.], are calculated. Thus, this normalization changes (Eq. (14)) to (Eq.
    (16)) to: (17) Briefly summarizing, the scheduling is calculated using (Eqs. (1),
    (10) and (17)). In these equations, and are the decision variables. , are time
    values that depend on the technological parameters of the batch process units
    and some values of the current state of the process. It must be remembered that
    estimators of and are needed (Eqs. (11) and (12)). and are controller tuning parameters.
    The stationary scheduling can be considered as a terminal constraint to deal with
    the stability problem of the MPC. Besides, the values of the control signals are
    limited between 0 and 1 and they are used to determine the waiting time intervals,
    while the heuristic expressions used to calculate these time intervals assure
    feasible values. It was mentioned in Section 2.1 that different cost functions
    can be selected for minimization or maximization. However, it is suitable that
    such functions should be normalized. Thus, it is simpler to propose a multi-criteria
    function as the weighted sum of some of them. Obviously, the NMPC needs a dynamic
    process model to predict the behaviour of the global system in an adequate time
    for the computer capacity, the optimization algorithm and the sampling period.
    Even though a prediction model and a cost function must be developed to solve
    each particular problem, the algorithm can be applied generally to batch processes
    with the referred characteristics: identical/parallel batch process units embedded
    in a large process. It must be pointed out that to facilitate finding an optimum
    solution and reduce the computation time, the SQP algorithms use the sequence
    of waiting time intervals calculated in the last optimization as an initial guess
    or starting point for the decision variables of the current optimization procedure.
    Finally, the control algorithm can be extended in two ways: • First, by calculating
    the value of other decision variables, , affecting the common active time interval
    ( ) and therefore the performance of the global system. • Second, selecting how
    many batch process units (m) might run in parallel according to the global boundary
    conditions. According to (Eq. (13)), this number will affect the value and, therefore,
    the waiting time intervals. Some heuristic calculation should be added, or the
    optimization problem should change to an MIP one. To increase the number of active
    units with respect to the current situation would not be a problem; however, to
    reduce this number could imply some changes in the algorithm. 3. Case study 3.1.
    Industrial sugar production process Two principal stages form the industrial sugar
    production process from beet sugar (Fig. 6), the so-called Beet End and Sugar
    End [51,52]. Syrup with high sucrose content is obtained at the Beet End. This
    syrup feeds the Sugar End, where the sucrose crystallizes by water evaporation
    under supersaturation conditions. Then, through a centrifugation process, the
    sugar crystals are separated from the honeys, which are restored to the Sugar
    End. Finally, the sugar is dried and stored for packing, distribution and sale.

    Fig. 6. Industrial Sugar Production Process. Sugar factories have boilers to produce
    high-pressure steam. Turbines are fed with this steam to produce electric power
    and reduced pressure steam to be used as an energy source for the evaporation
    section, which is included in the Beet End. Evaporation uses a multiple effect
    by making use of the steam produced in some evaporators as an energy source for
    other subsequent ones. As a result, steam is available at different pressures
    for different purposes in the factory. The Sugar End is the main consumer of some
    of them. The complete process is automated, but some critical sections are supervised
    and handled by highly qualified operators. One of the main challenges is the optimal
    and coordinated operation of the evaporation and crystallization sections, due
    to the strong interaction between them and, consequently, their power consumption
    [53,54]. 3.2. Case study overview A complete dynamic simulator of a subset of
    a sugar factory has been developed as a case study of the EU Network of Excellence
    Hycon2 [55]. It is oriented towards test scheduling strategies of hybrid, continuous
    and batch processes. The selected system is composed of the final effects of an
    evaporation section and the first stage of a Sugar End. The dynamic mathematical
    model is a first principles one and has been implemented using a general purpose
    object-oriented and equation based modelling language (EcosimPro Language) supported
    by EcosimPro/Proosis simulation platforms [56]. A library of model components
    were developed and used to build the complete model. A simpler version of the
    case study can be found in [57] and, in [58], a training simulator for control
    room operators of a complete Sugar End is outlined. The evaporation section (Fig.
    7) has three evaporators in which the syrup flows in series from one to the next,
    increasing the concentration of dissolved solids (Brix grade). The first one uses
    the steam that comes from the turbines. The second and third evaporators are fed
    by the vapour produced by the previous ones. The scheme is energy-efficient because
    it reuses the vapours. Besides, the vapours are consumed by other process units,
    while the main consumers are the batch vacuum pans of the Sugar End. The surplus
    steam is sent to a barometric condenser connected to the last evaporator. Download

    Evaporation section. The evaporation section has PID controllers to regulate the
    level of product in the evaporators and in the feed juice buffer tank, the pressure
    of the supply steam and the Brix of the produced syrup. The last one is a cascade
    control loop whose inner loop controls the pressure of the exit vapour. The set
    points of the controllers of the supply steam pressure and the Brix of the produced
    syrup are some of the key variables for the optimal process management, but in
    this case they remain constant. The Sugar End is divided into three stages in
    the industrial facilities; however, in the case study, only the first stage, which
    produces the commercial sugar, is considered in detail (Fig. 8). The others have
    been summarized in the block named sugar recovery section. The show case contains
    an array of discontinuous crystallizers, or batch vacuum pans, operating in parallel,
    in which the growth of the sugar crystals is carried out according to a recipe
    programmed into the control system. Download : Download high-res image (674KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Case study diagram. The feed syrup
    to the crystallizers, called standard liquor, is obtained in the melter by dissolving
    two recovered products (recovery sugar and rich honey) in the evaporation syrup.
    Later, it is stored in the standard liquor tank, whose product level is not controlled.
    The mother liquor, a product obtained from the pans, is discharged into the strike
    receiver, which is an agitated and thermally insulated tank. This tank feeds to
    another buffer tank called the distribution channel that supplies the mother liquor
    to a set of centrifuges. The centrifuges split the mother liquor into commercial
    sugar and two types of re-used honeys (rich and poor). This channel is necessary
    to adapt the different production rates of the pans and centrifuges. A PID controls
    the level of product in the strike receiver, acting on the flowrate of the mother
    liquor to the centrifuges. This controller is tuned to feed the centrifuges as
    uniformly as possible. The pans deserve special attention; the production of mother
    liquor batches is automated according to a recipe (Fig. 9). Every cycle starts
    by feeding standard liquor up to approximately half its capacity (charge stage).
    Hereafter, by means of evaporation, super-saturation conditions are obtained.
    At this moment, a sugar crystal seed is added (concentration stage). During the
    growth stage, the pan is fed with standard liquor as the water is evaporated and,
    at the same time, the supersaturation of the solution is controlled. This causes
    the progressive increase in the size of the sugar crystals. To avoid the thermal
    decomposition of the sugar, the vapour pressure must be controlled at a low value.
    The pan level is automatically increased as the Brix increases. When the maximum
    level of the product in the pan is reached, the pan begins a tightening stage
    followed by an unloading or discharge stage. The pan uses steam from the evaporation
    as its energy source. Download : Download high-res image (263KB) Download : Download

    (Fig. 10, in red). In addition, it nicely considers how the Brix and purity of
    the standard liquor and the set point of the steam pressure during the growth
    stage, influence the active time interval. Fig. 11 shows that this time interval
    decreases when the mentioned set point is increased. The same effect is observed
    if the Brix or purity of the standard liquor is increased. Download : Download

    of the pressure setpoint of the crystallizer steam chamber (SP_P) in the batch
    production cycle length. 3.3. Control/management problem The operation of the
    case study is complex because both sections (evaporation and Sugar End) interact
    in terms of matter and energy flows. Among other things, the flowrate and Brix
    of the evaporation syrup are strongly disturbed by the changing steam demands
    of the pans, and the pan scheduling depends on the flowrate and Brix of the evaporation
    syrup. As shown in Fig. 10, the variability of the flowrates of each cycle is
    such that it is necessary to coordinate the starting and unloading of each pan,
    so that the global steam and standard liquor demands are as homogeneous as possible
    and the strike receiver can assume the discharges of mother liquor. If the Sugar
    End demands vary abruptly, the evaporation performance will not be uniform and
    the turbine steam demand and the syrup production will therefore have strong fluctuations.
    The changing demands of standard liquor can provoke the overflow or emptying of
    the standard liquor tank. In addition, although the levels of the strike receiver
    and distribution channel are controlled, mother liquor unloads close to each other
    can provoke a non-homogenous feed to the centrifuges and strong fluctuations in
    the mentioned tank levels. In a real factory, specialized workers, the so-called
    “cooks”, among other things, decide the starting and unloading times of each batch.
    These decisions depend on the process boundary conditions (pressure of the exhausted
    steam from turbines, juice flowrate to the evaporation and Brix of the syrup to
    the Sugar End) and the initial process conditions (uncontrolled tank levels and
    current stage of each pan). Based on the above, the primary proposed control objective
    is to process all the juice that feeds the evaporation section. This means that
    the pans must be scheduled so that the level of the non-controlled tank, the standard
    liquor tank (LLS), must be kept between a minimum and maximum value, that is to
    say, there are no overflows or emptying of the tank. Besides, as the level of
    the strike receiver (LSR) is controlled by a soft tuned PID, it has been considered
    relevant to supervise the said level. This control objective can be achieved by
    minimizing the value of the cost function J (eq. 18), where Tp is the time in
    which each pan has completed Np batches (prediction horizon) and α is a tuning
    parameter to weight the influence of both levels. (18) In order to consider the
    problem in the framework of the previously detailed schedule algorithm, the decision
    variables will be the waiting time intervals of the idle state of each pan. The
    discharge of each crystallizer will happen automatically once the tightening stage
    is finished, so the waiting time intervals to unload will not be decision variables.
    A major issue, whose scope is beyond this paper, would be to consider the minimization
    of the steam demand from turbines, or the vapour losses through the barometric
    condenser, with constraints in the tank level values. In those cases, some set
    points should be added as decision varles: the pressure of the exhausted steam
    from turbines, the Brix of the syrup and the steam pressure of the growth stage
    of each batch. The proposed control problem does not have constraints on the output
    variables, so the solutions are always feasible. However, in other control problems
    with constraints in the output variables, as with the previously mentioned ones,
    using slack variables to relax the constrains it would be possible to find a feasible
    solution. 4. Controller implementation, tests and results 4.1. Controller implementation
    Let us remember that the scheduler has the structure shown in Fig. 3, i.e., a
    dynamic optimizer that solves an NLP problem using a sequential approach. The
    optimization procedure is implemented using SNOPT, Spare Nonlinear Optimizer [59],
    and this requires multiple executions of a reduced prediction model of the process
    that was also implemented in EcosimPro simulation platform. The optimized scheduling
    is sent to the real (simulated) process and will be used until a new scheduling
    can be computed, ideally in the next sample time. The reduced prediction model
    must be computationally efficient, so it is a mix of first principles and pseudo-empirical
    grey box models. In the case of the evaporation section, the reduced model is
    very similar to the case study model. The main differences are in the evaporator
    model component, which omits many details to eliminate some quick dynamics, and
    in the pipe model component to avoid algebraic loops. However, the main changes
    in the reduced model with regard to the complete case study model are in the Sugar
    End; specifically, in the pan model component, which is a pseudo-empirical grey
    box one with low computational load. It fits the mass and energy balances, avoiding
    the crystallization details and the recipe related events. Specifically, the pan
    model component is based on predefined patterns of the flowrates of the products
    and the steam demand (Fig. 10 in blue). Only the more significant stages of the
    batch production are considered: idle, charge, concentration, growth and discharge.
    The active time interval is the sum of charge, concentration, growth and unload
    time intervals ( . Just before starting the pan simulation, the time interval
    of the growth stage is calculated from the measurements of the Brix ( ) and purity
    ( ) of the standard liquor and the set point of the steam pressure during the
    growth stage ( ). The growth time interval function (Fig. 12 and Eq. (19)) is
    obtained by fitting simulation data of the complex pan model. The rest of the
    time intervals are assumed to be constant. This procedure is also used to calculate
    the active time interval ( ) needed by the scheduling algorithm. (19) Download

    Effect of the Brix and purity of the standard liquor in the growth time interval.
    Higher values of the first ones imply lower value of the growth time interval.
    To estimate the flowrates of each stage, the mass balances in the heating chamber
    and the mentioned time intervals are used. A very brief explanation is given.
    It is assumed that, at the end of the growth stage, the pan is completely full
    of mother liquor with a Brix default value. As the pan capacity is a known parameter,
    the unload flowrate ( during the unload stage is the resulting mother liquor mass
    divided by the unload time interval (Eq. (20)). The standard liquor flowrate has
    three values throughout the production of the batch. The first, during the charge
    stage ( , is constant and is a technological parameter; the second, during the
    concentration stage, is zero ( ; while the third, during the growth stage ( is
    calculated using a non-water balance (Eq. (21)). Finally, the steam demand is
    supposed constant during the concentration and growth stages and is zero during
    the remainder of the production cycle. This steam demand ( is the evaporated water
    flowrate multiplied by an empirical coefficient ( , the evaporated water is calculated
    using a water balance (Eq. (22)). (20) (21) (22) where, is the pan capacity and
    the desired Brix of the mother liquor, both technological parameters. is the density
    of the mother liquor that, by means of a known function, depends on . is the Brix
    of the standard liquor that feeds the pans which is a measured variable. Summarizing,
    according to Fig. 10, the pan reduced model of a complete batch is: (23) (24)
    (25) Really, the model is more complex, but its complete description is beyond
    the scope of this paper. More specifically, the initial state of each pan depends
    on its current level. The pan level and dimensions decide the mother liquor mass
    inside the pan, and, according to the pan recipe, the pan level imposes the mother
    liquor Brix. Thus, the initial state of the pan is known (mass and Brix) and the
    flowrate pan profiles can be estimated from this state. Now, the standard liquor
    flowrate during the growth stage ( must be calculated using an equation containing
    the influence of the current pan level The remaining cycle time is calculated
    using a procedure similar to that used to calculate the active time interval,
    but considering the current pan level and stage. This time function is also used
    by the scheduling algorithm to calculate the Other simplified pan models can be
    found in [48,60]; the use and integration of different models in the process industry
    is discussed in [61] and a review of the estimation techniques in the chemical
    process is made in [62]. Therefore, using a Sugar End scheduling and the initial
    and boundary conditions (obtained from the current state of the real process),
    the reduced model can be simulated, and the cost function and the constraint values
    can be evaluated. The Sugar End scheduling ) is calculated by the planner using
    the optimized control signals ( and ), the ideal stationary waiting time interval
    and the gap time values ( and ), as well as the , , and values in Eqs. (1), (9)
    and (17). According to (eq. 12), depend on the technological parameters of the
    pans and the boundary conditions to the whole process. For instance, in the case
    study, is calculated as the produced sugar mass in one cycle divided by the sugar
    mass flow to the evaporation section (Eq. (26)). (26) where, , and were previously
    defined ; and are the juice flowrate and its Brix, which are measured boundary
    conditions. is the density of the juice that, by means of a known function, depends
    on . , , and are calculated using the same expressions as in the reduced pan model,
    so they depend on the boundary and initial conditions. 4.2. Results Several experiments
    were made to test the scheduler’s performance. Each experiment begins with all
    process units in a nominal initial state, except the crystallizers that are in
    the idle stage. The set points of the pressure of the supply steam to the evaporation
    and Brix syrup remain constant during the experiment. In the first one (Fig. 13),
    the feed juice flow is maintained constant for 40 h and the controller performance
    is observed, depending on the Nu parameter. The other controller parameters are:
    • α=1 (the levels of both tanks bring the same in the cost function). • Prediction
    horizon (Np) = 7 cycles. • Δu = 0.3 • Sampling period = 1 hour • • Download :

    is referred to the web version of this article). The best response is obtained
    for Nu = 3, while the computing time is nearly half that for Nu = 4 (Table 1).
    In this case, the tank levels are maintained within the operating limits, the
    flow of mother liquor to the centrifuges remains almost constant, and the average
    value of the waiting time intervals of the three crystallizers converges to a
    value that depends on the boundary conditions of the complete system. Note that
    these times are initially zero, because the simulation starts with the three crystallizers
    in the waiting stage. Table 1. Experiment 1: Cost function and computing time

    (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader

    simulates the system over 50 h, considering the controller parameters of the first
    experiment and Nu = 3. In this case, three scenarios are considered, depending
    on the flow of the feed juice (Wi). In the first one, the flow remains constant.
    In the second one, the flow remains stable at its nominal value for 10 h and then
    increases linearly until 112% of its nominal value is reached. The last one is
    similar to the second, but with a decrease, until 88% of its nominal value is
    achieved. The level of the standard liquor tank remains between limits in all
    scenarios, the value of the average waiting time of the crystallizers remains
    constant in the first scenario and decreases and increases in the second and third
    scenarios, respectively. The flow of mother liquor feeding the centrifuges follows
    the shape of the flow of the feed juice with an eight-hour delay. Download : Download

    3: feed sugar juice changes. The last experiment shows that some of the difficulties
    to schedule the system are the large size and high residence time, which is due,
    among other factors, to the active time interval of a pan (about 2 h and a half).
    Besides, the only method considered to accelerate or decelerate the production
    rate is to change the value of the waiting time interval. Better solutions could
    probably be obtained if the set point of the steam pressure in the growth stage
    of the pans was manipulated in order to change the active time interval and the
    flowrate during the growth stage. 5. Conclusions A predictive control algorithm
    based on nonlinear dynamic models to automate the management of several identical
    batch process units competing for the same resources has been described. Specifically,
    the algorithm decides the waiting time intervals to activate each batch process
    unit. Expert knowledge is used to guide the system toward an ideal steady scheduling
    by limiting the values of the decision variables and imposing a steady state in
    which all process units are perfectly sequenced. So the algorithm gains some properties
    of stability and feasibility. The proposed algorithm does not allow increasing
    or decreasing the active time interval of each batch. However, in future, it could
    be extended to modify the active time interval of all batches, jointly changing
    some parameter of the batch recipe or some set points related to the properties
    of the products. In addition, the algorithm ensures that the m process units are
    operated at the same time, although a situation of limited raw products could
    imply long waiting time intervals and, consequently, none of the process units
    would be in an active state over a long period. These situations would seem to
    recommend a reduction, in the number of available process units; however, at the
    present time, the algorithm does not allow this type of control action. A heuristic
    calculation, based on the boundary condition and the initial state of the plant,
    could establish the suitable number of active batch process units. Also, this
    decision could be solved by raising an MIP (mixed-integer programming) problem.
    In any case, the number of active batch process units should be constant over
    the prediction horizon. The algorithm has been successfully tested in a realistic
    simulation of a reduced industrial process: the evaporation and crystallization
    stages of a sugar factory. In particular, the scheduling of three crystallizers
    has been solved, so that all feed juice was processed and an inventory control
    was maintained. Errors in the prediction models and process uncertainties are
    common problems in RTO, but these have not been considered explicitly. So the
    calculated scheduling might not be the optimum one for a real plant. However,
    as the result of the heuristic constraints, it would be stable and feasible. Modifier
    Adaptation methodologies could be used to tackle the model mismatch problem, adding
    some extra terms, called modifiers, to the cost function and constraints [63].
    Also, on-line identification techniques can be used to readjust the estimation
    of the growth time interval function after each cycle (Eq. (19)). Process uncertainties
    are not considered in this work either, so optimization under uncertainties techniques
    could be used to take them into account [64]. The control objective might be more
    ambitious. For example, minimizing the energy consumed per unit of mass of sugar
    produced, maintaining the previous inventory control. To solve this new problem,
    other aforementioned control variables should be added and it may even be necessary
    to modify the controller towards a hierarchical and decentralized architecture.
    Other future research work could be the study of optimization methods that guarantee
    the best solution, reducing the computational time. The algorithm’s main drawback
    is that it requires a reduced model of the process with low computational load
    but adequate precision. In particular, for the case study, an important effort
    was made to reduce the crystallizer model, developing a pseudo-empirical one (part
    of that model has also been used by the scheduler to calculate some necessary
    parameters). Other future work could be to improve the shape of the flowrates
    estimated by the reduced model in order to fulfill, not only the mass balances,
    but also the dynamic of the real process. Declaration of interests The authors

    Bahrain SECTION I. Introduction In the past, irrigation control was commonly performed
    by farmers, which relied on their experience to determine the times and duration
    of crop watering. Automated irrigation systems such as sprinkler, drip or subsurface
    drip, which are set to irrigate at specific times and for a specified amount of
    time, have made the irrigation process more efficient, since they require minimum
    intervention from the farmers. However, these type of open loop control systems
    does not take into account of weather and crop conditions and can lead to an under-or
    over-watering which can result in damage of the crop and waste of water. The use
    of sensors can provide quantitative data helpful for automating the irrigation
    process through closed-loop control, where feedback from one or more sensors is
    used to determine when water is needed and the amount of water required by the
    crop [1] [2]. Sensor data can be used to help make irrigation decisions in different
    ways. The simplest way to use sensor data for irrigation decisions is the on and
    off control scheme. For example, irrigation can be turned on and off based on
    whether a particular sensor reading is below or above a user-defined threshold
    [2]. In recent years, model-based irrigation control strategies have been presented
    in many papers, where complex models incorporating variables such as crop water
    demand, weather conditions, water saturation etc., are used to get a reliable
    estimation of water requirement [2] [5]. These more complex models might be used
    to estimate crop water use or evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather conditions
    and crop-specific factors. However, their application is still limited to the
    on and off control scheme. More advanced control strategies have been presented
    in explored by many researchers [3]. Some of the methods relies on complex models
    to get a reliable estimation of water requirement. In the research described in
    [6] and [7], Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed for closed-loop irrigation
    control systems in order to reduce the water consumption while maintaining an
    adequate crop watering. Predictive control in general describes an intuitive approach
    to control design, rather than a specific algorithm. The ideas that the algorithms
    belonging to the predictive control family have in common are the following [8]:
    explicit use of a model to predict the process output at future time instants;
    calculation of a control sequence minimising a certain objective function; receding
    horizon strategy, so that at each instant the horizon is displaced towards the
    future, which involves the application of the first control signal of the sequence
    calculated at each step. The work presented in [6] and [7], use the water balance
    approach to derive a model for the MPC framework. This type of model involves
    knowing the initial soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation, and
    the water capacity of the soil in order to estimate the soil moisture at a certain
    given time. In these papers, the core of the MPC algorithm is the minimization
    of a cost function based on the set point tracking error and the control signal,
    namely the irrigation values. In this paper, an approach similar to the ones described
    in [6] and [7] is used. Firstly, a dynamic model of the soil moisture, which was
    developed based on climatological data of the Kingdom of Bahrain, is described.
    Secondly, a predictive control strategy is proposed in order to minimize the use
    of water while implicitly keeping the soil moisture around an optimal value. However,
    this control strategy is based on EMPC, which focuses on minimizing an economic
    performance specification rather than on the trajectory tracking problem. The
    upholding of optimal soil moisture is achieved by appropriately setting minimum
    constraints in the optimization problem. The rest of this paper is organized as
    follows. Section II describe the process of deriving a model of the soil moisture
    dynamics starting from the water balance approach. Section III presents the EMPC
    approach and the formulation of the constrained optimization problem. In Section
    IV the results obtained by applying the EMCP control scheme are presented and
    compared with automated irrigation systems based on on-off control. Finally, Section
    V concludes the paper and includes recommendations for further work. SECTION II.
    Model Formulation The water-balance equation is one of the best way to describe
    the dynamics of soil moisture in an irrigation systems [12]: M(k+1)=M(k)+IR(k)+RAIN(k)+CR(k)−E
    T c (k)−DP(k)−RO(k) (1) View Source Where k denotes the current time, M is the
    soil water content (soil moisture), IR is the quantity of water used for irrigation,
    RAIN is the rainfall, CR is the capillary rise, E T c is the crop evapotranspiration,
    DP is the deep percolation and RO is the water runoff. This equation formalizes
    the idea that the change in soil moisture depends on the water inflows (irrigation,
    rainfall, capillary rise) minus the water losses (evaporation, plant transpiration,
    water runoff and deep percolation) [7]. Equation (1) can be further simplified
    as follows M(k+1)=M(k)+IR(k)−E T c (k)−DP(k) (2) View Source by assuming that
    there are no rainfall, capillary rise and water runoff. These assumptions are
    made taking into account the particular geographical and weather conditions of
    the Kingdom of Bahrain, characterized by flat terrain and extremely dry weather.
    The variable E T c describes the evaporation of water from the soil and from plant
    tissues to the atmosphere. Among the different ways to estimate E T c , the FAO
    Blaney-Criddle method has been proved to be reliable in different weather conditions
    [9], despite being one of the simpler methods. The FAO Blaney-Criddle method is
    used to calculate a reference value E T 0 according to the following equation:
    E T o =p⋅(0.457⋅ T mean +8.128) (3) View Source where p is the mean annual percentage
    of daytime and T mean is the mean daily temperature [°C]. The E T 0 is calculated
    based on a hypothetical extensive surface of green grass with a height of 80–150
    mm. When operating in non-standard conditions E T 0 is multiplied by a crop coefficient
    K c to calculate the actual ET for a particular crop or for environmental stresses
    such as the presence of pests and diseases, soil salinity, low soil fertility,
    and so on. This gives us: E T c = K c ⋅E T o (4) View Source The variable DP refers
    to the amount of water that penetrates below the crop root zone. This parameter
    depends on the texture of the soil, with coarse-textured soils having higher infiltration
    rates, and therefore higher DP, compared to fine-textured soils. DP is, in general,
    higher in humid and subhumid climates compared with arid and semiarid climates
    where the potential for DP is usually lower [10]. In this paper, we adopt a simplified
    method for estimating DP only as a function of soil moisture M [11]. This method
    is based on the assumption that a higher soil moisture will results in more water
    flowing below the root level due to differential pressure, and vice-versa. Under
    this assumption, we express DP as: DP(k)= K p ⋅M(k) (5) View Source where K p
    is an unknown parameter which depends on the texture of the soil. Substituting
    (4) and (5) in (2) we obtain: M(k+1)= K s ⋅M(k)+IR(k)− K c E T o (k) (6) View
    Source where K s =1− K p The mathematical model of the discrete-time system described
    by a linear difference equation such as (6) can be written in terms of a recursive
    formula as: x(k+1)=Ax(k)+Bu(k)+Fw(k) y(k)=Cx(k)+Du(k) (7) (8) View Source where
    x(k),u(k),w(k) and y(k) represents the state of the process, the input signal,
    the stochastic disturbance and the output variable. The matrices A,B,K,C and D
    are constant transition matrices which express the dynamics of the process. Defining
    the following variables: x(k)=M(k) u(k)=IR(k) w(k)=E T o (k) (9) (10) (11) View
    Source We can write (7) and (8) as: M(k+1)= [ K s ]M(k)+[1]IR(k)+[− K c ]E T 0
    (k) M(k)=[1]M(k) (12) (13) View Source The model structure expressed by (13) and
    (14) is adopted as a suitable model representing soil moisture dynamics in the
    root zone. The presence of the variable E T o introduces an element of uncertainty
    in the model. Given the random characteristic of natural phenomena such as temperature,
    E T o can be considered as a stochastic disturbance acting on the system. This
    model structure built on physical grounds, still has a number of parameters (
    K s and K c ) to be estimated from measured data. The system identification process
    described in [13] was used to derive the values of these parameters. SECTION III.
    Economic MPC The stochastic dynamical model of the process described by (12) and
    (13) is used to predict its likely possible future evolutions and choose the a
    “very good” control action through an Economic MPC approach [14]. A. EMPC Algoritm
    The core of the proposed EMPC controller is the optimization problem described
    as follows. At the time k and for the current measured (or estimated) state m(k)
    , solve a stochastic optimal control problem over a finite future horizon of N
    c steps (control horizon) Apply only the first step in the resulting optimal control
    moves At the time k+1 , get new state measurement and repeat the optimization
    starting from the starting from the (now) current state x(k+1) . In order to solve
    the optimization problem, we must compute the predicted values of the controlled
    variable as a function of the current state and the future control signals. The
    prediction is performed over an optimization window or prediction horizon N p

    The future control signals are given by: IR ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)=[IR(k/k)...IR(k+ N

    to a deterministic control problem by considering the disturbance E T o constant
    over the prediction horizon. This gives us the following vector of size N p :
    Using the defined vectors and the state space model described by (13) and (14)
    we can write: E T 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)=[E T 0 (k)...E T 0 (k)] (17) View Source

    B. Objective Function In comparison with traditional MCP scheme, in EMPC the set
    point tracking is not explicitly expressed. Instead, the controller indirectly
    optimize the system operation by minimizing a cost function [15]. In this paper,
    we define a cost function which indicate our control objectives, namely the reduction
    of water used for irrigation. The stage economic cost quantifies the amount of
    water used in each irrigation task l(k)=IR(k) (22) View Source Saving on the cost
    of pumping and the cost for the operation of the valves is not an objectives in
    this work and therefore it has not been accounted in the cost function. The objective
    function defined over the control horizon is: L(k)= ∑ i=0 N c −1 IR(k+i/k) (23)
    View Source C. Minimization Problem Using this discrete-time linear state space
    formulation (18)) to predict the future soil moisture, we may formulate an optimization
    problem that minimizes the irrigation water while keeping the soil moisture around
    the optimal value m opt as: min IR(k) ∑ i=0 N c −1 IR(k+i/k) Subject to the constraints:
    M ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)=ΘM(k)+Φ IR ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)+Ψ E T 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)) M ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)= M ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ opt (k) (24) (25) (26) View Source Where M ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    opt (k)=[ m opt ... m opt ] View Source We can notice that the objective function
    is a linear combination of the control parameters IR(k). Moreover, we can write
    the constraints (25) and (26) as: is a vector of size N p . Once this is done,
    we can use linear programming to find the value of IR(k) that minimizes the objective
    function subject to the constraints. Φ IR ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)= M ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ opt (k)−ΘM(k)−Ψ
    E T 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ (k)) (27) View Source SECTION IV. Simulation Results Various
    simulation tests were applied to gain some insight into the performance and efficiency
    of the EMPC approach. The first simulation example shows the outcome of an irrigation
    scheduling regime determined by a closed-loop irrigation scheme that using sensors
    to turn irrigation on and off based on whether a particular sensor reading is
    below or above user-defined thresholds. In this example, the sample rate is T
    s =1 hour. The soil moisture minimum and maximum thresholds are set at 0.3 and
    0.18 mm respectively. The outcome in Fig. 1 highlights some of the key disadvantages
    of this approach. These include over-watering and under-watering and poor tracking
    of the optimal soil moisture around 0.24 mm. Fig. 1. Soil moisture dynamics with
    on-off controller Show All With this approach, the total irrigation over the 48
    hours period is IR tot =1600mm . In the EMPC approach, the aim is to maintain
    an optimal soil moisture around 0.24 mm, which is achieved by setting the minimum
    threshold to this value, while minimizing the irrigation. The control and prediction
    horizon are set to N c = 3 and N p =5 , respectively. The resultant soil moisture
    for the EMPC controller is plotted in Fig. 2. With this approach, the total irrigation
    over the 48 hours period is below 1400 mm. In addition to a reduced water consumption,
    it can be observed the improved set-point tracking. Fig. 2. Soil moisture dynamics
    with EMPC controller Show All In Fig. 3 the cumulative error of the two irrigation
    methods is shown. Here, by error we mean the difference between the optimal soil
    moisture and the actual soil moisture. It can be observed that the EMPC controller
    has a better performance since the cumulative error is the lowest. Fig. 3. Cumulative
    error for on-off controller and EMPC Show All SECTION V. Conclusions The work
    presented in this paper shows the potential of the application of EMPC for irrigation
    scheduling. The EMPC controller is designed for keeping the soil moisture around
    an optimal value and includes output constraints. Simulations results showed that
    the EMPC algorithm leads to meaningful saving in water consumption approximately
    around 10-15%, while maintaining an optimal soil moisture level. Better results
    could be achieved by increasing the complexity of the soil moisture model. The
    quality of the model used in this paper is limited by quality of the data used
    in the system identification process. To improve the data several precautions
    could be taken, such as taking the measurements over differed operating conditions
    and estimate ETousing more complex approaches, such as the FAO Penman Montheith
    technique. Moreover, for a model closer to real operating conditions, sample data
    should be collected over a sparse area using sensors located at root depth. The
    slow dynamics of the irrigation system as well as the advancements in computational
    power suggests that the implementation of EMPC algorithm is feasible for real
    time control systems. Future work will focus on the hardware implementation of
    the proposed algorithm to evaluate the practicality of employing EMPC for the
    control of real irrigation system. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: The productivity and financial success of large-scale arable farming
    operations depends highly on how effectively resources are distributed among fields.
    Therefore, it is of interest to develop methods to determine (near optimal) resource
    inputs. In this paper we focus on computing the optimal irrigation policy for
    large-scale arable farming operations, where the number of irrigation machinery
    is much smaller than the number of fields that require irrigation inputs. We propose
    a model predictive control (MPC) framework that simultaneously computes the optimal
    division of irrigation over the fields and which irrigation machines should be
    allocated to which fields, such that the profit at the end of the season is maximized.
    The fact that the optimization of irrigation and allocation of irrigation machinery
    is done simultaneously makes our approach vastly different from strategies available
    in the literature. Another important novelty of our work is that we link short-Term
    effects of crop growth to long-Term effects on profit. The proposed framework
    has reasonable computation times when optimizing on a daily basis over many fields
    and irrigation machines and guarantees a feasible solution. The main principles
    of our approach are more widely applicable. Using simulations we demonstrate the
    robustness of the scheme with respect to changes in weather and benchmark it with
    respect to a heuristic approach.

    there have been several endeavours into optimal control methods that explicitly
    use crop growth models in order to compute the ‘optimal’ amount of water to irrigate
    crops, see, e.g., Cobbenhagen et al. (2018), Kalboussi et al. (2019) and for a
    model predictive control setting, see, e.g., Lozoya et al. (2014), Saleem et al.
    (2013), Schoonen et al. (2019). For illustrative purposes, we have included an
    example of the latter in the Appendix, which is based on previous work (Schoonen
    et al., 2019) by some of the authors of the present paper. On a larger scale,
    the control of irrigation networks between farms has been extensively studied
    in, e.g., Cantoni et al. (2007), Mareels et al. (2005), Negenborn et al. (2009).

    A model-based control using hybrid automata is proposed to describe soil, crop,
    and weather dynamics. The model was developed and validated with experimental
    data from a grass irrigation process. The proposed model can be used to develop
    robust and real-time control algorithms to improve irrigation systems. Abstract.
    Closed-loop control for precision irrigation represents an effective method to
    provide water savings in this resource-intensive activity. Typically, implementation
    of these systems uses an on-off control approach with soil moisture as the feedback
    variable. In these cases, no process modeling is required due to the simplicity
    of the implemented control algorithm. However, the amount of water consumed by
    irrigation globally presents an interesting application area for the control discipline.
    Therefore, to obtain greater water savings and to improve crop productivity through
    control theory, an irrigation model is required that integrates the three main
    elements in the irrigation process: soil, crop, and weather. This article proposes
    a hybrid automata model for a closed-loop irrigation system applied to a grass-covered
    area. The main measured variables used to represent the process dynamics are soil
    moisture, vegetation index, and evapotranspiration. The hybrid automata approach
    allows a complex system to be modeled as a finite state machine in which there
    is a specific linear model for each state. When certain conditions are met, the
    system transitions from one state to another, and the new behavior is represented
    by a different linear model. To develop the proposed model, experimental data
    were obtained from an irrigation process, the data were analyzed to produce a
    model using the hybrid automata approach, and finally the model was validated
    with a new set of measured data. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 5 Share

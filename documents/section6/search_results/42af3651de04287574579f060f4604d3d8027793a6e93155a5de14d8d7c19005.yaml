    Over the last 10 years, telecontrol systems have been incorporated into the majority
    of modern collective pressurized irrigation networks in Spain. This type of infrastructure
    provides many opportunities for irrigation management but actually, in Spain,
    is only used for standardized network operations. The Candasnos irrigation district
    (CID), located in northeastern Spain, is equipped with this system, and contains
    a variety of different pressurized systems. Telecontrol data and crop water requirements
    were used to analyze the evolution of irrigation performance (SIPI) of maize,
    alfalfa, and stone fruits. Irrigation guidelines for stone fruit were analyzed
    and compared with those of standard and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) irrigation
    strategies. Ten solid-set irrigation systems were monitored to determine on-farm
    irrigation patterns. The average SIPI of maize, alfalfa, and peach was 83, 107,
    and 123%, respectively. The average SIPI showed a high irrigation performance,
    but the spatial and temporal variability of SIPI showed possibilities for improvement.
    Deficit irrigation practices were conducted on peach trees but not adjusted to
    the recommended RDI strategy. The results of plot monitoring showed crop differences
    on irrigation time per event (1–1.5 h in maize and 2–3 h in alfalfa) and on time
    interval between irrigation (larger in alfalfa than in maize). The short and frequent
    irrigation timing for the corn crop could be a disadvantageous practice because
    it yielded high evaporation losses from crop-intercepted water. Two irrigation
    patterns were established at the CID: the first was characterized by structured
    irrigation schedules and the second was characterized by weekly changes in the
    irrigation schedule. The second pattern was more commonly employed in solid-set
    systems than in those with pivots. The analysis of telecontrol data following
    this methodology could be easily implemented in the daily routines of the district
    office to improve irrigation management at the plot level. Further, telecontrol
    data can be an important tool for promoting and facilitating regulated deficit
    irrigation strategies in stone fruits. Introduction In the last decade, national
    and regional policies have encouraged the modernization of traditional irrigated
    land in Spain. The National Irrigation Plan was approved by the Spanish Government
    in 2002. This National Irrigation Plan allocated 61% of its total funds to the
    modernization of irrigation systems and infrastructures until 2008 (Forteza Del
    Rey 2002). Current irrigation projects in Spain include the modernization of traditional
    irrigation systems and conversion to pressurized irrigation systems. In Spain,
    the modernization of irrigation networks has been accompanied by the installation
    of modern telecontrol irrigation systems and has offered new methods for the control
    and management of irrigation systems. Telecontrol irrigation systems have become
    increasingly popular in Spanish irrigation districts and have provided water savings
    of 30–60%, improved crop productivity, optimized the use and timing of fertilizer
    applications, and improved control of large irrigated land extensions (Damas et
    al. 2001). Control utilities have been rapidly incorporated in daily irrigation
    district management; however, real-time irrigation management utilities have not
    been widely employed. Most irrigated land in Spain is supervised by user associations,
    which include thousands of individual plots with an average surface area of 1
    ha (Damas et al. 2001). Telecontrol irrigation systems allow the centralized control
    of large regions of irrigated land, i.e., hundreds of control points and hydrants,
    thousands of hectares, and internode distances of several kilometres, without
    the need to extended electricity to each hydrant. Moreover, installation and maintenance
    costs are minimized in centralized telecontrol irrigation systems (Damas et al.
    2001). Moreover, telecontrol systems provide real-time water-use information on
    individual plots, allowing the analysis of irrigation performance and enabling
    personalized advising, which can improve wateruse at the plot level. However,
    the centralized control of different plots by user association agencies is rarely
    conducted in irrigation districts in Spain. Moreover, studies on the use of remote
    control and the supervision of on-farm irrigation management practices at the
    district level have not yet been conducted. Irrigation performance is usually
    analyzed by determining a specific set of indicators (Molden and Gates 1990; Malano
    and Burton 2000; Playán and Mateos 2006). To conduct important assessments, the
    indicators should be locally adapted to describe the idiosyncrasies of the irrigated
    area (Lorite et al. 2004a). Because of the availability of water-use information
    at the individual plot, farmer, or hydrant level, a meaningful assessment of irrigation
    performance can be conducted by determining the average performance indicators
    of the main crops in the area and assessing the variability among irrigation systems
    and farmers. If the average performance values are reasonable, then high variability
    among farmers indicates that irrigation management strategies can be improved
    (Fernandez et al. 2007). Telecontrol utilities offer continuous water-use data
    at the hydrant level that can be used for this purpose. Irrigation performance
    studies on seasonal on-farm water meter readings within irrigation districts have
    been performed for different irrigation schemes. For instance, Faci et al. (2000),
    Dechmi et al. (2003a, b), and Lecina et al. (2005) analyzed the irrigation performance
    of sprinkler (the first two papers) and (the last paper) surface-irrigated districts
    in the Ebro Valley. Lorite et al. (2004a, b) determined the variability among
    farmers and seasons in a sprinkler and drip-irrigated scheme in the Guadalquivir
    Valley. Fernandez et al. (2007) presented an on-farm irrigation performance analysis
    of three greenhouse irrigation schemes in southern Spain. In the present study,
    irrigation patterns were evaluated using continuous water-use data from the telecontrol
    irrigation system of the Candasnos irrigation district (CID) during 2009. Irrigation
    wateruse at the individual plot level was also evaluated and was compared with
    the crop irrigation requirements. Moreover, the potential uses of telecontrol
    data for the management of irrigation systems were explored. In addition, the
    current irrigation schedule at the CID and the variability among crops, irrigation
    systems, and farmers were analyzed. Irrigation performance indices throughout
    the crop cycle of the main crops, an aspect that has not been sufficiently studied
    in the literature, were also evaluated in the present study. The CID was selected
    because of its diverse irrigation systems (solid-set sprinkler irrigation, pivots,
    and drip irrigation), the availability of telecontrol data, and the variety of
    crops. The objectives of the present study were as follows: 1. Characterize the
    adequacy of irrigation application to crop irrigation requirements by analyzing
    the temporal variability of the SIPI; 2. Characterize the irrigation patterns
    of different crops and irrigation systems (solid set, center pivot, and drip irrigation)
    using telecontrol data; 3. Characterize on-farm block irrigation sequences of
    solid-set sprinkler-irrigated plots by monitoring the hydraulic blocks; and 4.
    Identify ways to improve water use in the district. Material and Methods Candasnos
    Irrigation District The CID belongs to the Riegos Del Alto Aragón irrigation scheme
    (Fig. 1). The CID is located in the municipality of Candasnos (Huesca Province
    in the region of Aragón), and Aragón is located in the Ebro River Valley of northeastern
    Spain. Aragón is an important agricultural production region and is equipped with
    modern irrigation systems. The main crops in Aragón are cereals, alfalfa, and
    fruit trees. The CID covers a total area of 6,400 ha, of which 5,745 ha are irrigated
    lands. Irrigation water comes from the Canal de Sastago, which diverts water to
    a reservoir with a storage capacity of 210 , 000 m 3 . The canal and reservoir
    are located 70 m above the highest topographical point of the irrigated land of
    the district. As a result, energy is not required to irrigate plots in the CID;
    the CID does not possess a pumping station. Sprinklers are the main irrigation
    system in the study region, and 73% of the irrigated area is sprinkler irrigated,
    7% of the area is irrigated by drip irrigation, and the remainder 20% was not
    equipped. Sprinkler irrigation systems in the study region are diverse, and a
    significant number of pivots (1,838 ha) and solid sets (2,344 ha) are employed.
    The quality of the irrigation water is high because it comes from melting ice
    in the Pyrenees mountains of northern Spain. Fig. 1. Location of Candasnos irrigation
    district: Distribution of pressurized irrigation systems (pivots, solid sets,
    and drip) and location of supervised plots Information about crop production for
    alfalfa and maize were provided by a local study based on farmer’s interviews
    [Centro de Investigación y Tecnología Agroalimentaria de Aragón (CITA) and Confederación
    Hidrográfica del Ebro (CHE), unpublished internal report]. A soil sampling campaign
    was performed during the winter of 2009 to characterize the soil physical properties
    related to irrigation (soil holding capacity and texture). A total of 80 sampling
    points were selected covering the whole CID, and the soil was collected to a depth
    of 1.2 m or to the limiting depth. Samples were collected every 0.3 m, and the
    stoniness (percentage of coarse fragments > 2 mm ), texture, field capacity, and
    wilting point of the soil were determined according to the methods of the Soil
    Survey Laboratory (Burt 2004). Volumetric stoniness, S (%), was determined for
    each soil sample from the weigh of fractions above and below 2 mm, soil bulk density,
    ρ b ( Mg m - 3 ), and the stone density. Soil bulk density and stone density were
    estimated as 1.40 and 2.65 Mg m - 3 , respectively, in agreement with previous
    works in the area (Playán et al. 2000). Seasonal Irrigation Performance Index
    of Corn, Alfalfa, and Stone Fruits ADOR software (Playán et al. 2007) is currently
    used to manage the irrigation district in CID, and water delivery to farmers is
    conducted according to a previous water order scheme. This type of scheme is commonly
    used in surface irrigation systems and pressurized irrigation systems to control
    energy costs. Fortunately, energy costs are not a problem in the CID because irrigation
    water does not have to be pumped. Nevertheless, an advanced water orders scheme
    is used in the study region because of the low reservoir capacity. Moreover, the
    water must be ordered to the Ebro River Basin Agency 2 days before the water is
    released into the district. To apply irrigation, farmers must fill out a water
    order form by telephone or directly in the district office, which includes the
    requested delivery date (a minimum of 2 days in advance), start time, and total
    irrigation time. The district files the water order and fits the order into the
    water delivery schedule. The ADOR network analysis module is used to determine
    if a water order can be physically delivered. Namely, the total water flow demand
    of the network in the CID is evaluated and it is verified that no overexploitation
    of the irrigation network occurs. During the order confirmation process, the parameters
    of a water order can be altered by the district managers. Finally, the district
    verifies the water order and records the actual date, start time, and volume of
    water applied to the field. The irrigation network was provided with a telecontrol
    system communicated by cable. The telecontrol system has been used by the district
    managers to perform the remote readings of the hydrant flow meters and to control
    incidences in the hydraulic network (breakdowns, opening, and closing of the hydraulic
    valves); however, the system has not been used to analyze the water management
    standards. In 2009, the CID telecontrol system was modernized, and the communication
    software was upgraded to a more user-friendly version. Since then, the telecontrol
    system remains underutilized by the district. The telecontrol system allows the
    water volume consumed by individual hydrants to be measured remotely; however,
    the district manager performs manual field readings of the water meters in the
    hydrants. Even if the hydrant is shared by several plots, the water consumed by
    each farmer can be adequately divided by the telecontrol data and the demand of
    the farmers. Currently, the telecontrol system is programmed to collect water
    volume data at each hydrant every 6 h. The irrigation network of the CID is composed
    of three manifolds (TPN1, TPN2, and TPNV) that act as independent networks. Each
    manifold has three or four irrigation control units that receive data from 18
    to 72 hydrants (field units or remote units). During the present study, a communication
    error was detected in an irrigation unit in TPN1, corresponding to 31 hydrants
    and 802 ha. The problem was not detected by the district manager, indicating that
    the telecontrol data were underutilized by the district. The area without data
    was excluded from the monthly analysis; however, this area was included in the
    seasonal analysis because the final volume of water was obtained from the hydrant
    water meters by the manager (manually read). The telecontrol data were used to
    calculate the volume of water applied to each plot throughout the crop cycle,
    and the results were compared with the net irrigation requirements (NIRs). The
    NIRs for each crop were considered equal for the entire irrigation district. The
    seasonal irrigation performance index (SIPI), [Eq. (1)] was used to analyze irrigation
    performance in the CID. The SIPI (Faci et al. 2000) was defined as the ratio of
    the NIR [Eq. (2)] to the volume of irrigation water supplied to the crops. The
    seasonal irrigation performance index is a simplification of the irrigation efficiency
    standard defined by Burt et al. (1997) and Clemmens and Burt (1997). Specifically,
    if a crop is water stressed, then the SIPI will be greater than 100%. Moreover,
    if the SIPI is greater than the application efficiency of the irrigation system,
    then the crop will be water stressed (Faci et al. 2000). The SIPI is commonly
    used as a seasonal parameter; however, in the present study, SIPI values were
    computed for short to seasonal crop periods to study the temporal variability
    of crop irrigation performance. In 2009, monthly SIPI values for corn were calculated
    throughout the irrigation season to study water-use in different phases of the
    crop cycle. For each plot of corn, the monthly cumulative SIPI was computed, and
    the results were spatially and temporally analyzed by geographic information system
    (GIS). To analyze the water-use patterns of alfalfa, the SIPI of each cut was
    independently computed. Because the irrigation interval after a cut is usually
    longer than the regular irrigation interval, telecontrol data were used to determine
    the date of alfalfa cuts. SIPI = NIRs Irrigation depth (1) Crop distribution in
    the CID varied from year to year, depending on the market demands. The crop cultivated
    in each plot of the CID during 2009 was obtained from the ADOR database. The crop
    distribution was spatially and numerically analyzed, and the reference evapotranspiration
    ( ET 0 ) was calculated on a daily basis by applying the Penman-Monteith (Smith
    1993) method to the 2009 meteorological data. The SIAR agrometeorological station
    located in the Candasnos municipality (SIAR Candasnos) was used for meteorological
    data. The SIAR network of agrometeorological stations was created in 1998 by the
    Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (MARM) (http://www.mapa.es/siar/Informacion.asp).
    This network covers most irrigated areas in Spain. Crop–water requirements for
    the 2009 irrigation season were computed from ET 0 estimates following the Penman-Monteith
    method and crop coefficients. Eq. (2) determined NIR; ET 0 and effective precipitation
    (EP) were computed from the SIAR-Candasnos meteorological data. Values of K c
    were estimated for corn using the thermal units methodology proposed by Martínez-Cob
    (2008). This methodology shows very good results compared with weighting lysimeters
    determination in the Ebro Valley region. For stone fruits, values of K c and K
    c RDI were established according to Martinez-Cob (CHE, unpublished internal report,
    2004) and Chalgaf (2008), respectively, for the same area of study. For alfalfa,
    the methodology of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States
    Irrigation and Draining Paper No. 56 (FAO 56) was used to establish K c values
    for each cut (Allen et al. 1998). Evett et al. (2000) illustrate that the FAO
    56 methodology applied for the alfalfa crop gives a good result by comparison
    with lysimeters studies in a semi arid area (Bushland, TX). For each alfalfa plot,
    the cutting dates, number of cuts, and irrigation dose were obtained by analyzing
    the telecontrol data. The FAO 56 methodology was also used to establish K c for
    winter cereals and other herbaceous crops. For all of the studied crops, the net
    irrigation requirement [Eq. (2)] was obtained as the difference between crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) and EP. Effective precipitation was calculated from the real precipitation
    according to the soil conservation service (SCS) method of the USDA (Cuenca 1989).
    Effective precipitation is approximately 75% of the precipitation recorded by
    the rain gauge (CHE, unpublished internal report, 2004). For corn, monthly cumulative
    net irrigation requirements were established for May, June, July, and August.
    For alfalfa, cumulative NIRs were obtained for each individual cut. Lastly, cumulative
    NIRs were established for each FAO phase of stone fruit. NIR = ( K c × ET 0 )
    - EP (2) The NIR was compared with the irrigation depth (ID) by determining the
    cumulated SIPI of different periods and crops. For stone fruits, the irrigation
    water supply, which was obtained from the telecontrol data, was compared with
    the standard NIRs [Eq. (2)] and with the net regulated deficit irrigation requirements
    (NRDIR)[Eq. (3)]. The NRDIR represents the minimum net irrigation requirement
    of fruit trees that maintains good vegetative development and does not affect
    the fruit quality or production of the orchard (Gelly et al. 2004). Cumulated
    SIPI values of the FAO crop phases for the two irrigation strategies (standard
    and regulated deficit) were calculated. NCDIR = ( K c × K RD × ET 0 ) - EP (3)
    where K R D = reduction coefficient of regulated deficit irrigation and is variable
    throughout the crop cycle (Chalghaf 2008). Characterization of Irrigation Patterns
    To identify differences between irrigation systems, the telecontrol data were
    also analyzed. Namely, for pivot irrigation systems, the total number of irrigation
    events, irrigation time per event, time interval between irrigations, seasonal
    irrigation depth, and differences in irrigation schedules throughout the crop
    season were evaluated. The irrigation time was calculated as the duration of continuous
    hydrant operation, and the time interval between irrigations was computed as the
    nonoperative hydrant time between two consecutive operations. The pivot rotation
    period was difficult to ascertain from the telecontrol data because most of the
    irrigation times represent several concatenated pivot cycles. For solid-set irrigation
    systems, the total number of irrigation events, irrigation time per event, time
    interval between irrigations, seasonal irrigation depth, and differences in irrigation
    schedules throughout the crop season were determined. Differences in irrigation
    schedules throughout the crop season were analyzed by comparing the irrigation
    time per event and the time between two consecutive irrigations in two different
    periods: from May to June and July to August. Because a significant number of
    hydrants were operated in 2009 (290), several solid-set (10), and pivot (15) hydrants
    were selected for further analysis. Pivots were selected to represent different
    crops, irrigation configurations, i.e., formation of a complete circle, semicircle,
    and three-fourths of a circle, and irrigated areas. In addition, 10 solid-set
    hydrants were selected to represent different types of crops and irrigated areas.
    The irrigation schedules of solid-set and center pivots for the same type of crop
    were compared. The telecontrol data for drip irrigation were analyzed to determine
    the total irrigation time, irrigation time per event, time interval between irrigations,
    seasonal irrigation depth, and differences in irrigation schedules throughout
    the crop season. Four drip irrigation hydrants were selected to represent differences
    on plot and hydrant sizes. The four plots were managed by different farmers to
    analyze different irrigation management. The telecontrol system of the CID provides
    data from hydrants that correspond to the farm level. Because the water flow of
    the hydrants was not enough to irrigate all the farm acreage at the same time
    with an adequate pressure, the irrigation system was divided in several irrigation
    blocks that irrigate sequentially. Because the telecontrol system rises to the
    hydrant level, the sequence of the irrigation blocks was unknown. Ten solid-set
    plots (eight corn plots and two alfalfa plots) were monitored to determine the
    block irrigation sequence. A pressure logger (Dixon PR300) was installed in the
    middle of the sprinkler riser in a representative block of each monitored plot,
    and data were recorded every 15 min. The monitored block was similar to the other
    hydraulic blocks within the same plots with respect to the irrigation schedule.
    Data collected from the pressure logger were used to analyze the duration and
    number of irrigations, characterize daily and nightly irrigation, and determine
    the irrigation pressure throughout the irrigation season at the block scale. In
    addition, the pressure, nozzle size of the sprinklers, and the spacing and duration
    of each irrigation event were used to calculate the irrigation depth. Results
    and Discussion Candasnos Irrigation District According to the 2009 ADOR database,
    the principal crops in the CID were corn (42.6%; 2,445 ha) and alfalfa (20%; 1,150
    ha). Table 1 presents the percent area, number of hydrants, and average seasonal
    irrigation depth of the crops during the 2009 irrigation season and SIPI. The
    third most common crop in the study region was stone fruits (7%), which corresponded
    to the total drip-irrigated area. Compared with neighboring irrigation districts,
    a large area of the CID was devoted to corn during the 2009 irrigation season
    because the energy cost of irrigation was nonexistent. In Spain and other developed
    countries, agriculture consumes large amounts of energy. For instance, in Spain,
    agricultural energy use accounts for 4.5% of the total energy use. In particular,
    the energy consumption of agricultural machinery and the application of irrigation
    accounts for approximately 70% of the total agricultural energy use [Instituto
    para la Diversificación y Ahorro de la Energía (IDAE) 2005]. Because the input
    costs for corn production increase by nearly 50% because of cost of pumping water,
    the CID obtains a larger net margin for cropping corn and other crops than the
    neighboring irrigation districts. Table 1. Summary of Telecontrol Data for 2009

    equipped with irrigation systems at the plot level. In Table 1, this area is referred
    to as no equipped. Alternatively, 2,344 ha were equipped with solid set, 1,838
    ha with center pivots, and 414 ha possessed drip irrigation systems. For most
    crops except winter cereals, the variability in the irrigation depth expressed
    as the variation coefficient in Table 1 between plots of the same crop was less
    than 30%. The extreme variability in the irrigation depth of wheat was because
    of the low number of wheat plots included in the study (three plots). Also, Lorite
    et al. (2004b) studied an irrigation district located in southern Spain and demonstrated
    that rainfed crops, such as wheat and barley, show high variability in the irrigation
    depth (67–130%). The variability in the CID was lower than that of neighboring
    districts such as the Montesnegros irrigation district, which presented variability
    values of 50% (Zapata et al. 2009), or the Loma de Quinto de Ebro irrigation district,
    which displayed variability values between 30 and 40% (Dechmi et al. 2003a). The
    variability between plots was indicative of different hydrant capacities, number
    of irrigating blocks, and farmer scheduling practices. The variability of irrigation
    depth for the same crop because of farmer scheduling indicated that irrigation
    water management practices in the CID can be improved substantially (Fernandez
    et al. 2007). The alfalfa yield in the district varies from 10 , 500 to 15 , 500
    kg ha - 1 with an average of 14 , 000 kg ha - 1 . The corn yield varies from 11
    , 000 to 14 , 500 kg ha - 1 with an average of 13 , 000 kg ha - 1 (CITA-CHE, unpublished
    data from the 2009 irrigation season). Soils in the CID showed spatial variability
    in the total available water (TAW) from a minimum of 42 mm (230 ha with a TAW
    between 42 and 60 mm) to a maximum of 275 mm (190 ha with TAW between 200 and
    275 mm), with an average of 148 mm. These values of TAW did not present significant
    limitations for pressurized irrigation systems, which provide an important control
    on applied irrigation dose. The three main textural classes in the CID were loam,
    silt-clay loam, and silt loam. All the soils were characterized by a low percentage
    of clay with respect to the percent silt, medium texture, and good infiltration.
    In general, soil texture did not affect sprinkler irrigation management. Seasonal
    Irrigation Performance Index for Corn, Alfalfa, and Stone Fruits For the 2009
    irrigation season (Table 1), SIPI values ranged from 79% (forage) to 131% (barley),
    and a crop seasonal average of 94% was observed in the CID. In general, the SIPI
    of stone fruits was greater than 100%, indicating that the application of deficit
    irrigation strategies is common in the CID. For winter cereals, the SIPI values
    were indicative of deficit irrigation practices. Alfalfa and corn presented average
    SIPI values of 107 and 83%, respectively, indicating that alfalfa was deficit
    irrigated and corn was adequately irrigated. These data suggest that farmers try
    to optimize water use by restricting application on drought-resistant crops (sunflower
    and alfalfa) and limiting water stress on drought sensitive crops (corn). The
    monthly evolution of the cumulative SIPI of corn in 2009 (Fig. 2) indicated that
    the proportion of corn plots with low SIPI values ( < 80 % ; overirrigated) increased
    from the beginning of the crop season ( May is 25.8 % of the area) to July (40.5%
    of the area) and then decreased to 26.3% of the total area at the end of the season.
    As previously discussed, telecontrol communication errors occurred on a remote
    unit of irrigation line, TPN1. As a result, data for 19.2% of corn-cropped area
    could not be obtained throughout the corn season, which was represented as no
    data in Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d). Nevertheless, data on the seasonal irrigation
    depth of the total irrigated area were available because they were manually collected
    by the district manager. Fig. 2 shows the seasonal analysis of the SIPI of the
    entire corn-cropped area. For corn, light and frequent irrigations were applied
    in the early stages of crop development to promote germination and to avoid the
    formation of a crust on the soil surface, which is common in the study area. Excess
    water applied in June and July (41% of the analyzed area presented a SIPI lower
    than 80%) was partially compensated by low irrigation levels in the final phases
    of plant growth. Namely, at the end of the irrigation season, 26% of the area
    presented a SIPI lower than 80%, and 56% of the area presented a SIPI between
    80 and 100%. Most of the over irrigated plots at the end of the season [dark colored
    plots in Fig. 2(e)] were attributed to persistent overirrigation throughout the
    crop season [dark colored plots in Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d)]. These plots
    would benefit from an advisory service on the basis of telecontrol data analysis.
    Fig. 2. Spatial distribution of SIPI classes along irrigation season for corn:
    data are presented accumulated until (a) May; (b) June; (c) July; (d) August;
    (e) whole season; table presents percentage of area devoted to each annual relative
    irrigation supply class For alfalfa, the average SIPI was 107%, indicating that
    general deficit irrigation was applied to this crop during the 2009 irrigation
    season. Table 2 presents the area of alfalfa according to the SIPI value. The
    analysis was performed for the entire season and each of the four individual cuts.
    The results indicated that 46.2% of the total area displayed a seasonal SIPI value
    greater than 100% (Table 2), suggesting that the supply of irrigation water was
    lower than the calculated irrigation requirements. Alternatively, 45.5% of the
    total area displayed a SIPI value between 80 and 100%, which is indicative of
    adequate irrigation management. Only 8.3% of the total area presented a SIPI value
    less than 80%, which is indicative of overirrigation. In general, the seasonal
    SIPI analysis revealed that the dose of applied irrigation was lower than the
    seasonal crop water requirements. Moreover, the SIPI values of individual cuts
    (Table 2) displayed an interesting pattern. Namely, for all of the individual
    cuts, the greatest proportion of alfalfa displayed SIPI values greater than 120%,
    accounting for 24% of the second cutting to 42% of the first cutting, which is
    indicative of deficit irrigation. The high percentage of area that presented deficit
    irrigation strategies for the alfalfa crop was surprising. The initial soil water
    content was not considered in the analysis and could introduce some noise, especially
    for the first and second alfalfa cuttings. In any case, a revision of alfalfa
    crop water requirements as proposed by FAO 56 to local conditions is suggested
    from these results. Table 2. SIPI Values of Alfalfa Computed for Four Individual

    No data 29.9 29.9 29.9 29.9 0.0 Although there are no available crop yield data
    associated with irrigation dose and schedule at farm level, the large variability
    of irrigation dose and the adequate average yield of the principal crops in the
    district indicate an important potential for improvement of wateruse. Fig. 3 shows
    the weekly evolution of the applied irrigation depth, NIRs, and NRDIR for four
    medium cycle peach plots. The studied plots were selected by their differences
    in size and management (different farmer). In the four plots, the amount of applied
    irrigation was lower than the standard NIR throughout almost all of the irrigation
    season. The two plots presented in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), which correspond to hydrants
    VH097 and VH100, respectively, indicated that deficit irrigation strategies were
    applied until harvest (beginning of August). However, after harvest, a standard
    irrigation strategy was applied. Alternatively, the two plots in Figs. 3(c) and
    3(d), which correspond to hydrants 1H141 and 1H139, indicated that deficit irrigation
    strategies were conducted throughout the entire irrigation season. Table 3 presents
    the SIPI of standard irrigation strategies, irrigation depth, and the SIPI of
    regulated deficit irrigation strategies for 16 hydrants used to irrigate medium
    cycle peaches. The data are presented according to the four FAO phases. The average
    difference between the standard NIR and the applied irrigation depth for medium
    maturing peaches was approximately 15–27%. However, for both standard and deficit
    irrigation strategies, extremely high SIPI values were observed during the initial
    crop development phase. Telecontrol data were analyzed from May onward, and most
    probably the orchards were irrigated in March and April (data not available);
    also, the initial soil water content was not considered in the analysis. Namely,
    hydrants 2H138, 1H059, 1H080, and VH058 corresponded to recently planted orchards;
    thus, the extremely high standard and regulated deficit SIPI values were attributed
    to low irrigation doses on young orchards. Except for VH097 and VH100 [Figs. 3(a)
    and 3(b), respectively], the remaining hydrants displayed standard SIPI values
    greater than 100%, which suggested that deficit irrigation strategies were performed
    on medium cycle peaches at the CID. Seasonal SIPI values of plots irrigated according
    to the controlled deficit irrigation (CDI) strategy were approximately 100% (except
    for VH097 and VH100) or higher, indicating that the total applied irrigation was
    similar or lower than the NRDIR. However, on the basis of the SIPI values of the
    four FAO phases, the current irrigation strategy was not in accordance with the
    CDI strategy. Specifically, irrigation water reductions remained constant throughout
    peach development (sustained deficit), and the CDI strategy recommends water reductions
    at specific phases of the crop cycle. According to Gelly et al. (2004), the recommended
    phases of CDI are pit hardening, stage II of fruit growth, and postharvest. When
    the same amount of water is applied, the CDI is superior to sustained deficit
    irrigation in peach production (Fereres and Soriano 2007). The CDI technique is
    on the basis of the diverse sensitivity of the plant to water stress during different
    phenological crop stages. Intermittent water deficits during specific periods
    can increase the efficiency of irrigation, which saves irrigation water and improves
    harvest quality (Chalmers et al. 1981; McCarthy et al. 2002; Loveys et al. 2004;
    Cameron et al. 2006). Again, telecontrol data continuous analysis can be an important
    tool for promoting and facilitating CDI strategies in stone fruits. Fig. 3. Weekly

    764 300 327   1,542 644 253 267 Note: The SIPI for each crop phase was computed
    with cumulated data. Within irrigated areas in Spain, Faci et al. (2000) found
    that the Almudevar irrigation district in the Ebro Basin (surface irrigation)
    presented an average SIPI of 70%, which is indicative of overirrigation. Alternatively,
    Stambouli (2008) found that an irrigated area within the Las Filadas gully watershed
    (Huesca, Spain) possessed an average SIPI of 97.2%, which is similar to the average
    SIPI of the present study and indicated that good irrigation management practices
    were conducted. However, sensible crops such as corn and rice were overirrigated
    (SIPI values of 77 and 68%, respectively), and resistant crops such as barley
    and sunflower (SIPI values of 111 and 172%, respectively) were deficit irrigated.
    In contrast, Dechmi et al. (2003a) studied another sprinklers irrigation district
    in the Ebro Valley region and found that the average SIPI value of the crops was
    127%, which was indicative of deficit irrigation. Lorite et al. (2004a, b) determined
    the annual relative irrigation supply (ARIS) ratio, annual volume of irrigation
    water inflow/annual volume of crop irrigation demand, of the Genil Cabra irrigation
    scheme (southern Spain) and demonstrated that the average ARIS of the total area
    was less than 1, from 0.45 in 1996–1997 to 0.64 in 1998–1999, indicating that
    irrigation applications did not meet the maximum ET demand. In general, average
    ARIS values for different irrigation areas around the world (Kloezen and Garcés
    1998; Molden et al. 1998; Burt and Styles 1999) are higher than those obtained
    by Lorite et al. (2004a). This discrepancy was attributed to crop variability,
    irrigation methods, socioeconomic conditions, and the definition of ARIS, which
    varies slightly from author to author. Characterization of Irrigation Patterns
    In the CID, 1,838 ha were irrigated by pivots. The minimum, maximum, and mean
    pivot sizes in the CID were 4, 80, and 22 ha, respectively; thus, high variability
    in pivot sizes was observed [variation coefficient (VC) = 63 % ]. Major crops
    irrigated by central pivots include corn, alfalfa, and double crops, which cover
    1,080, 573, and 64 ha, respectively. Fifteen representative pivots were selected
    to study the irrigation patterns of pivot irrigation systems in the CID. The studied
    pivots summarize the variability in crop, size, inflow rate, and shape of the
    district pivots. Table 4 presents the crop, hydrant denomination, irrigated area,
    pivot diameter, flow, irrigation time ( h ha - 1 event - 1 ), and interval between
    irrigation events of the selected pivots. The last two variables were computed
    for two periods: from May to June and July to August. For comparative purposes,
    the irrigation time was expressed in hour per hectare and event. Because the irrigation
    time and the water flow differs between pivot points, the irrigation time presented
    in Table 4 represents the average irrigation time per hectare at identical water
    flow rates. Table 4. Summary of Irrigation Scheduling for Representative Pivots:

    38.2 50 1,281 1.79 2.40 1.92 1.96 628 Note: Irrigation time and time between irrigation
    corresponds to the most common values for the time considered, excluding the occasional
    extremes. Differences in irrigation time per event among plots of the same crop
    were typically accompanied by differences in intervals between irrigation events.
    In general, the irrigation time per event was greater for alfalfa than for corn:
    from 1.27 to 15.63 h ha - 1 event - 1 for alfalfa and from 0.42 to 6.78 h ha -
    1 event - 1 for corn. Moreover, the time between irrigations was larger for alfalfa.
    Most of the pivots irrigated several concatenated cycles between July and August,
    as indicated by the high irrigation time per hectare and event (Table 4). In general,
    the irrigation time increased from May–June to July–August. For hydrant 2H148
    cropped with corn, the irrigation time and the interval between irrigations remain
    constant throughout the irrigation season, indicating that the farmer did not
    modify the irrigation schedule. For hydrants 2H106 and 2H094, the irrigation time
    remained constant throughout the crop cycle; however, the interval between irrigations
    decreased from May–June to July–August. Fig. 4 presents the change in the irrigation
    time in hours per hectare and event, and the change in the irrigation interval
    throughout the crop cycle. Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) correspond to hydrants 1H003 and
    VH017, respectively, cropped by alfalfa. Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) correspond to hydrants
    1H069 and 2H018, respectively, cropped by corn. Fig. 4. Evolution of irrigation
    time per hectare and event in hours and interval between irrigation in days during
    irrigation season for two alfalfa pivots: (a) 1H003; (b) VH017; and two corn pivots:
    (c) 1H069; (d) 2H018 Alfalfa pivot VH017 irrigated continuously from July to August
    and was only stopped to perform the cuttings [8.6 days in the cutting period,
    on average; see Fig. 4(b) and Table 4]. Pivot 1H069, which was cropped with corn,
    followed the same irrigation pattern [Fig. 4(c)]. In this case, the low hydrant
    flow related to the size of the plot forced the hydrant to irrigate almost continuously
    from July to August, which was the period of maximum irrigation requirements for
    corn. Even then, the irrigation dose (533 mm) was relatively low compared with
    the net water requirements for corn (648 mm). Alfalfa hydrant 1H003 [Fig. 4(a)]
    showed four large irrigation intervals, from 9 to 15 days, corresponding to the
    dates between cuts. The irrigation time also varied throughout the alfalfa season,
    indicating that the farmer frequently modified the irrigation schedule. Corn hydrant
    2H018 [Fig. 4(d)] presented an irrigation pattern consisting of light, i.e., 1–1.5
    h of irrigation per hectare and event, and frequent, i.e., an irrigation interval
    of 1.5–2.5 days, irrigations from the beginning of the season to the end of June.
    The light irrigation changed to continuous irrigation, i.e., 15–43 h of irrigation
    per hectare and event, between the beginning of July to the middle of August.
    With corn pivots, most farmers apply light and frequent irrigations until the
    end of June to avoid crust formation. Alternatively, from the middle of July to
    the middle of August, the pivot was operated almost continuously for 10–15 days
    depending on the relationship between the size of the pivot and the hydrant flow.
    From the middle of August to the middle of September, light and frequent irrigations
    were again applied [Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)]. Thus, the results indicated that the
    analysis of pivot irrigation cycles could be used to better understand irrigation
    management strategies with sprinkler irrigation systems. In future studies, pivot
    movement should be monitored by global positioning system (GPS) to establish pivot
    irrigation cycles. The solid set was the most common sprinkler irrigation system
    in the study region (Fig. 1). The mean area of solid-set plots was 7.5 ha, with
    high variability ( VC = 120 % ). The most common sprinkler layout in the CID was
    triangular. In this configuration, sprinklers are placed in a straight line at
    18-m intervals, and the distance between the lines is set to 18 m ( T 18 × 18
    ). In the majority of the plots, the sprinklers were equipped with 4.8 and 2.4
    mm diameter nozzles. Table 5 presents the telecontrol data analysis of eight of
    the 10 supervised plots; telecontrol data for the other two supervised plots,
    1H092 and 1H108, were not available during the season. Moreover, the seasonal
    irrigation time (hours), seasonal irrigation depth, average irrigation time, expressed
    in hours per hectare and event, and the mean time between two consecutive irrigations
    during two representative periods of corn development (May-June and July-August)
    are also presented in Table 5. For the analyzed crops (alfalfa and corn), the
    irrigation time increased during July and August, and the irrigation interval
    decreased with respect to the first period (May-June). Moreover, the irrigation
    depth of alfalfa was greater than that of corn. Namely, hydrants 2H043 and 1H062B,
    which were cropped by alfalfa, presented an irrigation depth of 1,350 and 867
    mm, respectively. In addition, the alfalfa plots presented the largest seasonal
    irrigation time of 1,924 and 1,957 hours. For hydrant 2H043, the irrigation depth
    was excessively large compared with the alfalfa irrigation requirements for the
    2009 irrigation season (843 mm). In most cases, time between irrigation in the
    second period was less than 1 day, which indicated that the capacity of the irrigation
    network to manage water in the presence of restrictions, such as wind, was relatively
    low. Fig. 5 presents the irrigation time and irrigation interval of four solid-set
    hydrants throughout the irrigation season. The upper region of Figs. 5(a) and
    5(b) correspond to alfalfa solid-set plots (hydrants 2H043 and 1H062B, respectively),
    and the lower portion of Figs. 5(c) and 5(d) correspond to corn solid-set plots
    (hydrants VH012 and 2H158, respectively). Hydrant 2H043 showed a nearly constant
    irrigation time of 1.8 h per hectare and event in the beginning of the crop season;
    however, the irrigation time of hydrant 2H043 increased to 2.2 h ha - 1 event
    - 1 in July and August. The relatively constant irrigation times were suddenly
    interrupted by abrupt applications of 10 or 18 h per hectare and event at the
    beginning of June and the middle of July. For alfalfa, the irrigation interval
    was nearly constant at 0.25 days and was only interrupted by 4-to 12-day intervals,
    which corresponded to the alfalfa cuts. A continuous pattern was also observed
    for corn (hydrant VH012), as shown in Fig. 5(c). Specifically, the irrigation
    time was nearly constant at 1.2 h per hectare and even throughout the entire corn
    cycle, except for the beginning of July and the beginning of August. During these
    time frames, the irrigation time increased to 12 or 25 h per hectare and event,
    respectively. The irrigation interval from the middle of June to the end of the
    corn irrigation season remained constant at 0.33 days. Nevertheless, on some dates,
    2-or 3-day intervals between irrigations were observed, probably after insecticide
    treatment. The results shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(c) revealed that the farmer did
    not frequently alter the irrigation schedule. Alternatively, Figs. 5(b) and 5(d)
    indicated that the farmer continuously modified the irrigation schedule throughout
    the crop cycle. For instance, as shown in Fig. 5(b), a continuous variation in
    the irrigation time per hectare was observed from the end of May to the beginning
    of August. Specifically, the irrigation time was increased by 2-to 6-h increments
    per hectare and event. Finally, two 14-and 12-h irrigations were performed in
    August. The irrigation interval presented a more consistent pattern than the irrigation
    time and was usually less than 1 day. However, 6-to 12-day intervals were also
    observed because of the alfalfa cuttings. Fig. 5(d) shows the variability in the
    irrigation pattern of short cycle corn. Significant variability in the irrigation
    time was observed until the end of August, in which the irrigation time increased
    from 1 to 7 h per hectare and event. From the end of August to the end of the
    corn irrigation season, the irrigation time remained constant at 1 h per hectare
    and event. Alternatively, from the beginning of July to the end of the season,
    the irrigation interval was equal to 0.5 days. Fig. 5. Evolution of irrigation
    time per hectare and event in hours and interval between irrigation in days during
    irrigation season for two alfalfa solid set hydrants: (a) 2H043; (b) 1H062B and

    time between irrigation corresponds to the most common values for the time considered,
    excluding the occasional extremes. Irrigation times of 10 or 25 h per hectare
    and event were obtained from the telecontrol data of the analyzed hydrants (Fig.
    5). This was a surprising result because soil cannot handle such high irrigation
    doses. The irrigation data obtained from the pressure transducer installed at
    the supervised plots clarified these extremely high irrigation times. Table 6
    presents the irrigation pressure and irrigation time obtained from the pressure
    transducer data. Hydrant 2H043 presented a constant irrigation time of 1.9 h per
    hydraulic block and event throughout the entire alfalfa cycle, without regard
    to the abrupt increase in irrigation time [Fig. 5(a)]. Thus, when the block sequential
    irrigation cycles were concatenated, the hydrant counter did not stop, and the
    irrigation time was accumulated by the telecontrol system. The irrigation time
    measured by the pressure transducer at the nozzle of one block was the same as
    the irrigation time of the telecontrol data; however, a series of irrigations
    (2 h) and cessations (22 h to irrigate the other 11 blocks) were observed. The
    discrepancy between the telecontrol and pressure transducer data of hydrant 2H043
    was also observed in the other analyzed hydrants (differences between Tables 5
    and 6). Moreover, the differences in the irrigation patterns between plots obtained
    from the telecontrol data analysis were significantly larger than that of the
    pressure transducer data. In addition, significant differences between the telecontrol
    and pressure transducer data were observed for hydrant 1H014. The pressure transducer
    showed a constant irrigation time of 1 h throughout the corn cycle (Table 6),
    whereas the telecontrol data showed an irrigation time of almost 3 h from May
    to June and 5 h from July to August (Table 5). Again, the concatenation of block
    sequential irrigation cycles showed a different irrigation pattern. Differences
    in irrigation management are important because short and frequent sprinkler irrigation,
    as shown in the 10 supervised plots, yield high evaporation losses from crop intercepted
    water (independent of irrigation time) (Wang et al. 2006; Mauch et al. 2008).
    However, short and frequent irrigation applications can be an alternative for
    problematic soils. The soils in the study region did not present significant water
    retention and runoff problems; thus, irrigation management could be improved by
    increasing the irrigation time per block and event. Table 6. Pressure Transducer

    and variation coefficient of irrigation pressure, average and variation coefficient
    of irrigation time per block, and event and percentage of daily irrigation time
    were presented. a Average (mm or %); variation coefficient in parentheses (%).
    The low variability of the pressure at the nozzle point (the variation coefficient
    was less than 5%) between irrigations indicated that the seasonal variation in
    the collective network demand did not affect the hydrodynamics of the individual
    plot network. Thus, the regulating valves at the hydrant points worked adequately.
    Nevertheless, significant differences in the irrigation pressure were observed
    between plots, and the pressure ranged from 243 to 438 kPa. The lowest irrigation
    pressures were at the lower limit of the suggested pressure of the current sprinkler
    layout ( T 18 × 18 ). Alternatively, the largest irrigation pressures were excessively
    high and self-defeating in windy areas. On-plot supervision provided the necessary
    data to determine if irrigation was conducted during the day or night. The results
    indicated that three-quarters of the irrigations in the monitored blocks of plots
    1H002 and 2H100 were applied during the day. Alternatively, in the blocks of hydrants
    2H158, 2H124, and VH012, three-quarters of the irrigations were applied at night.
    Preferences for daily or nightly irrigation indicated that the block irrigation
    sequence of the plots was not periodically modified. Irrigation schedules on the
    basis of nightly irrigation may be superior in the Ebro Valley region because
    the nighttime WDEL is one-half of the daytime losses (Playán et al. 2005). In
    hydrants 1H014, 2H043, 1H108, and 1H092, the irrigation time was equally divided
    between day and night. This type of irrigation pattern requires periodic changes
    in the irrigation schedule; however, according to Dechmi et al. (2004), it is
    more efficient than fixed block sequence irrigation. Table 7 presents the telecontrol
    data of four drip-irrigated plots. In general, the seasonal irrigation time was
    related to the continuous inflow rate of the hydrant, which was expressed in liters
    per second and hectare. The lowest seasonal irrigation time (1,026 h) corresponded
    to the highest continuous inflow rate ( 1.9 ls - 1 ha - 1 ), which was observed
    in hydrant VH100. The irrigation interval was always lower than 1 day; thus, the
    orchards were irrigated at least once per day. The irrigation time per hectare
    and event varied from 0.5 h to 4 h per hectare and event. Moreover, the average
    values presented in Table 7 did not show temporal variability in irrigation scheduling.
    Fig. 6 presents the temporal variability of the irrigation patterns of the four
    selected hydrants. Hydrants 1H141 and 1H139 [Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), respectively]
    presented greater variability in the irrigation time throughout the entire peach
    cycle than hydrants VH100 and VH097 [Figs. 6(c) and 6(d), respectively]. Namely,
    the irrigation schedule of hydrants 1H141 and 1H139 was changed almost weekly.
    For hydrants VH100 and VH097, the irrigation time increased more (VH097) or less
    (VH100) gradually with fruit development and decreased drastically at postharvest.
    However, the irrigation interval remained constant at less than 1 day, and slight
    variations were observed throughout the crop development process. Fig. 6. Evolution

    of Irrigation Patterns between Solid Sets and Pivots The principal difference
    in the irrigation scheduling patterns of solid-set and center pivots was the number
    of openings and closings of the hydrants (irrigation events). For solid sets,
    the number of irrigation events during a crop season increased from 35 to 45,
    whereas the number of events for pivots was reduced to 10–20. Consequently, the
    irrigation time per hectare and event was larger for pivots than for solid sets.
    The results of the on-farm irrigation analysis of the 10 solid sets revealed that
    the irrigation events should be obtained from the irrigation block sequence data.
    For pivots, telecontrol data analysis was biased because the pivot cycle times
    were not available and the complete irrigation sequence could not be established.
    The average applied irrigation depths at the CID were 808 and 793 mm for pivots
    and solid-set systems, respectively, and significant differences between systems
    were not observed. In contrast, the seasonal applied irrigation depth of alfalfa
    was significantly different among sprinkler irrigation systems. Namely, the solid-set
    system provided an average seasonal irrigation depth of 889 mm, with a standard
    deviation of 164 mm, and the pivot system provided an average irrigation depth
    of 793 mm, with a standard deviation of 120 mm. For corn, significant differences
    in the average irrigation depth between irrigation systems were not observed (819
    mm for solid sets and 818 mm for pivots). In any case, for both systems, the variability
    of the applied doses was high, with a standard deviation of 182 and 225 mm for
    solid sets and pivots, respectively. For alfalfa, the irrigation depth of pivot
    plots was lower than that of solid sets because of the greater efficiency of pivot
    systems. Pláyan et al. (2005) demonstrated that water losses in sprinkler irrigation
    systems (pivots and lineal moves) were two-thirds lower than that of solid-set
    systems. Dechmi et al. (2003b) studied the Loma de Quinto irrigation district
    of the Ebro Valley and found that the Christiansen coefficient of uniformity (CU)
    of center pivots (76%) was greater than that of solid sets (68%). However, in
    Loma de Quinto, solid-set designs were deficient for windy areas. Conclusions
    Variability in the irrigation depth among plots of the same crop was approximately
    25%. This variability was primarily attributed to differences in the irrigation
    schedule. The seasonal SIPI values of the crops at the CID indicated that the
    farmers try to optimize irrigation water use by restricting applications on drought
    resistant crops (SIPI values greater than 100% were observed for sunflowers and
    alfalfa) and limiting water stress in drought sensitive crops (the average SIPI
    value of corn was 83%). Irrigation was also restricted in drip-irrigated stone
    fruit orchards. The monthly change in the cumulative SIPI of corn indicated that
    the area of corn with low SIPI values ( < 80 % ) increased from the beginning
    of the crop season to July and then decreased at the end of the season. Frequent
    and light applications are often conducted at the early stages of crop development
    to avoid crusting problems and to promote corn germination. In general, overirrigated
    plots at the end of the season were attributed to persistent overirrigation throughout
    the growing season. Thus, overirrigated plots would benefit from an advisory service
    on the basis of telecontrol data analysis. For alfalfa, the average SIPI was 107%,
    which was indicative of a general deficit irrigation pattern. Moreover, the results
    suggested that deficit irrigation was repeated every cutting cycle. Namely, 82%
    of the alfalfa plots presented SIPI values greater than 80%. As previously discussed,
    SIPI values greater than the potential efficiency of the irrigation system are
    indicative of deficit irrigation. Thus, the alfalfa would benefit for a telecontrol
    data continuous analysis following the proposed methodology. Again, the telecontrol
    data can be an important tool for the improvement of irrigation water management
    in alfalfa. The SIPI values of stone fruits throughout the four FAO phases suggested
    that deficit irrigation strategies were performed on medium cycle peaches at the
    CID. However, the applied irrigation dose was continuously reduced throughout
    the crop cycle (sustained deficit), and the reductions were not applied at the
    recommended phases (regulated deficit); thus, the applied irrigation strategy
    was not on the basis of a regulated deficit strategy. The analysis of temporal
    variability of SIPI values is a valuable tool for the improvement of irrigation
    water management for corn, alfalfa, and stone fruit at plot level. Real-time SIPI
    analysis from telecontrol data as proposed in this research, complemented with
    the control of some on-farm block irrigation sequences, should be implemented
    in the daily routines of the district office to greatly improve the irrigation
    management at plot level. This methodology could be easily implemented in any
    telecontrolled irrigation network. However, the reliability and accuracy of the
    methodology to determine the crop water requirements of the main crops of the
    CID is a key factor in the estimation of SIPIs because the real values of the
    net irrigation requirements affect the SIPI values directly. Consideration of
    the NIR spatial variability along the CID also could improve the irrigation water
    management at plot level. This objective will require a characterization of the
    spatial distribution of crop water requirements. The general irrigation patterns
    of solid-set and center pivot systems indicated that the irrigation time per event
    for alfalfa was greater than that of corn. Furthermore, the short and frequent
    irrigation timing for corn (1–1.5 h per block and event) could yield high evaporation
    losses from crop intercepted water. In general, two different patterns in the
    irrigation times were observed at the CID. In the first irrigation pattern, short
    irrigations were applied until the middle of June. Subsequently, the irrigation
    time was increased until the middle of August and then decreased until the end
    of the crop season. This irrigation pattern was employed by farmers that did not
    frequently alter the irrigation schedule (low intervention). Alternatively, the
    second pattern was characterized by continuous changes in the irrigation time
    throughout the crop season. This type of pattern requires significant farmer intervention
    because the irrigation schedule is changed almost weekly. The second irrigation
    pattern was observed more often with solid-set systems than pivots; however, differences
    in the irrigation performance among the two irrigation patterns could not be established.
    Nevertheless, the analysis of telecontrol data is an important tool for the improvement
    of irrigation management in pressurized irrigation districts and can be used to
    promote and facilitate regulated deficit irrigation strategies on stone fruits.
    Telecontrol data can be a valuable tool to reduce variability of irrigation water
    management between plots. Notation The following symbols are used in this paper:

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Due in large measure to the prodigious research efforts
    of Rhoades and his colleagues at the George E. Brown, Jr., Salinity Laboratory
    over the past two decades, soil electrical conductivity (EC), measured using electrical
    resistivity and electromagnetic induction (EM), is among the most useful and easily
    obtained spatial properties of soil that influences crop productivity. As a result,
    soil EC has become one of the most frequently used measurements to characterize
    field variability for application to precision agriculture. The value of spatial
    measurements of soil EC to precision agriculture is widely acknowledged, but soil
    EC is still often misunderstood and misinterpreted. To help clarify misconceptions,
    a general overview of the application of soil EC to precision agriculture is presented.
    The following areas are discussed with particular emphasis on spatial EC measurements:
    a brief history of the measurement of soil salinity with EC, the basic theories
    and principles of the soil EC measurement and what it actually measures, an overview
    of the measurement of soil salinity with various EC measurement techniques and
    equipment (specifically, electrical resistivity with the Wenner array and EM),
    examples of spatial EC surveys and their interpretation, applications and value
    of spatial measurements of soil EC to precision agriculture, and current and future
    developments. Precision agriculture is an outgrowth of technological developments,
    such as the soil EC measurement, which facilitate a spatial understanding of soil–water–plant
    relationships. The future of precision agriculture rests on the reliability, reproducibility,
    and understanding of these technologies. Abbreviations EC electrical conductivity

    θw total volumetric water content The predominant mechanism causing the salt accumulation
    in irrigated agricultural soils is evapotranspiration. The salt contained in the
    irrigation water is left behind in the soil as the pure water passes back to the
    atmosphere through the processes of evaporation and plant transpiration. The effects
    of salinity are manifested in loss of stand, reduced rates of plant growth, reduced
    yields, and in severe cases, total crop failure (Rhoades and Loveday, 1990). Salinity
    limits water uptake by plants by reducing the osmotic potential and thus the total
    soil water potential. Salinity may also cause specific ion toxicity or upset the
    nutritional balance. In addition, the salt composition of the soil water influences
    the composition of cations on the exchange complex of soil particles, which influences
    soil permeability and tilth, depending on salinity level and exchangeable cation
    composition. Aside from decreasing crop yield and impacting soil hydraulics, salinity
    can detrimentally impact ground water, and in areas where tile drainage occurs,
    drainage water can become a disposal problem as demonstrated in the southern San
    Joaquin Valley of central California. From a global perspective, irrigated agriculture
    makes an essential contribution to the food needs of the world. While only 15%
    of the world''s farmland is irrigated, roughly 35 to 40% of the total supply of
    food and fiber comes from irrigated agriculture (Rhoades and Loveday, 1990). However,
    vast areas of irrigated land are threatened by salinization. Although accurate
    worldwide data are not available, it is estimated that roughly half of all existing
    irrigation systems (totaling about 250 million ha) are affected by salinity and
    waterlogging (Rhoades and Loveday, 1990). Salinity within irrigated soils clearly
    limits productivity in vast areas of the USA and other parts of the world. It
    is generally accepted that the extent of salt-affected soil is increasing. In
    spite of the fact that salinity buildup on irrigated lands is responsible for
    the declining resource base for agriculture, we do not know the exact extent to
    which soils in our country are salinized, the degree to which productivity is
    being reduced by salinity, the increasing or decreasing trend in soil salinity
    development, and the location of contributory sources of salt loading to ground
    and drainage waters. Suitable soil inventories do not exist and until recently,
    neither did practical techniques to monitor salinity or assess the impacts of
    changes in management on soil salinity and salt loading. A means of assessing
    soil salinity across the landscape is essential to the management of soil salinity.
    Because of the influence of soil salinity on crop productivity and the dynamic
    spatio-temporal nature of salinity, real-time measurement and monitoring of the
    spatial and temporal distribution of soil salinity is a crucial piece of information
    for precision agriculture applications on irrigated agricultural soils of the
    arid southwestern USA. Precision agriculture (or site-specific agriculture) utilizes
    rapidly evolving electronic information technologies to modify land management
    in a site-specific manner as conditions change spatially and temporally (van Schilfgaarde,
    1999). The intent of precision agriculture is to optimize crop production while
    minimizing detrimental environmental effects. First conceived in the mid-1980s,
    the technological pieces needed to bring precision agriculture into its own fell
    into place in the mid-1990s with the maturation of global positioning systems
    (GPS) and geographical information systems (GIS). As such, precision agriculture
    is a technologically driven system (van Schilfgaarde, 1999). The measurement of
    soil EC is among the technologies that have helped to bring precision agriculture
    from a concept to a potential tool for addressing the issue of agricultural sustainability.
    The determination of total solute concentration (i.e., salinity) through the measurement
    of electrical conductance has been well established for decades (U.S. Salinity
    Lab. Staff, 1954). Soil EC measurement is a means of easily quantifying and monitoring
    soil salinity in irrigated agricultural areas of arid-zone soils. Soil salinity
    refers to the presence of the major dissolved inorganic solutes in the aqueous
    phase consisting of soluble and readily dissolvable salts in soil, including charged
    species (e.g., Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl−, HCO−3, NO−3, SO2−4 and CO2−3), nonionic
    solutes, and ions that combine to form ion pairs. Soil salinity is quantified
    in terms of the total concentration of the soluble salts as measured by the EC
    of the solution in dS m−1 (U.S. Salinity Lab. Staff, 1954). For pure solutions,
    it is known that the EC of the pure solution σw is a function of the chemical
    composition as characterized by Eq. [1]: (1) where k is the cell constant accounting
    for electrode geometry, λ is the molar limiting ion conductivity (S m2 mol−1),
    M is the molar concentration (mol m−3), v is the absolute value of the ion charge,
    and i denotes the ion species in solution. Marion and Babcock (1976) were among
    the first to confirm the existence of a relationship between EC and molar concentrations
    of ions in the soil solution. The relationship of EC of soil water (ECw) to aggregate
    or individual ions in soil has also been confirmed by recent work of Kachanoski
    et al. (1992), Vanclooster et al. (1993), Wraith et al. (1993), Mallants et al.
    (1994), Ward et al. (1994), Heimovaara et al. (1995), Nissen et al. (1998), and
    Das et al. (1999) Operationally, soil EC is determined for an aqueous extract
    of a soil sample. Ideally, it would be desirable to determine the concentrations
    of individual solutes in soil water over the entire range of field water contents
    with a quick, easy measurement, but practical methods are not currently available
    to do so. Because of the time, labor, and cost of obtaining soil solution extracts,
    developments in soil salinity measurement over the past two decades have shifted
    to EC measurement of the bulk soil, referred to as the apparent soil electrical
    conductivity (ECa). The ECa measures conductance through not only the soil solution,
    but also through the solid soil particles and via exchangeable cations that exist
    at the solid–liquid interface of clay minerals. Apparent soil electrical conductivity
    has become one of the most reliable and frequently used measurements to characterize
    field variability for application to precision agriculture due to its ease of
    measurement and reliability (Rhoades et al., 1999b). The value of spatial measurements
    of ECa to precision agriculture is widely acknowledged, but ECa is still often
    misunderstood and misinterpreted. To help clarify misconceptions, a general overview
    of the application of ECa to precision agriculture is presented. It is the objective
    of this paper to describe the practical technology and methodology for real-time
    measurement of ECa, with particular emphasis on spatial ECa measurements applied
    to precision agriculture. The following areas are discussed: a brief history of
    the measurement of soil salinity with EC, the basic theories and principles of
    the soil EC measurement and what it actually measures, an overview of the measurement
    of soil salinity with various EC measurement techniques and equipment (specifically,
    electrical resistivity with the Wenner array and EM), examples of spatial EC surveys
    and their interpretation, applications, and value of spatial measurements of soil
    EC to precision agriculture, and current and future developments. BRIEF HISTORY
    OF THE MEASUREMENT OF SOIL SALINITY Historically, five methods have been used
    for determining soil salinity: (i) visual crop observations, (ii) the electrical
    conductance of soil solution extracts or extracts at higher-than-normal water
    contents, (iii) in situ measurement of electrical conductance with electrical
    resistivity using the Wenner array, (iv) noninvasive measurement of electrical
    conductance with EM, and most recently (v) in situ measurement of electrical conductance
    with time domain reflectometry. The first method, visual crop observation, is
    quick and economical, but it has the disadvantage that salinity development is
    detected after crop damage has occurred. For this reason, visual observation is
    the least desirable method for assessing soil salinity. However, on fields where
    long-term, field-scale patterns of soil salinity exist, visual observations from
    one year provide useful information for succeeding years. The second method, electrical
    conductance of the soil solution extract, gives a quantitative measure of soil
    salinity but requires considerable resources for field sampling and laboratory
    analysis, plus the volume of soil measurement is very small and ill-suited to
    characterize and map the extreme variability of salinity at field scales and larger
    (Corwin, 2002a). Customarily, soil salinity has been defined in terms of EC of
    the saturated soil paste extract (ECe). This is because it is impractical for
    routine purposes to extract soil water from samples at typical water contents;
    consequently, soil solution extracts must be made at higher-than-normal water
    contents. Unfortunately, the partitioning of solutes over the three soil phases
    (i.e., gas, liquid, and solid) is influenced by the soil/water ratio at which
    the extract is made so that the ratio needs to be standardized to obtain results
    that can be applied and interpreted universally. Commonly used extract ratios
    aside from a saturated soil paste are 1:1 (EC1:1), 1:2 (EC1:2), and 1:5 (EC1:5)
    soil/water mixtures. However, soil salinity can also be determined from the measurement
    of ECw Theoretically, ECw is the best index of soil salinity because this is the
    soil solution salinity actually experienced by the plant root. Nevertheless, ECw
    has not been widely used to express soil salinity for various reasons: (i) It
    varies over the irrigation cycle as the soil water content changes, so it is not
    single valued (Rhoades, 1978), and (ii) the methods for obtaining soil solution
    samples for routine ECw analysis are too labor, time, and cost intensive at typical
    field water contents to be practical for field-scale applications (Rhoades et
    al., 1999a). For disturbed soil samples, soil solution can be obtained in the
    laboratory by displacement, compaction, centrifugation, molecular adsorption,
    and vacuum or pressure extraction methods (Rhoades and Oster, 1986). For undisturbed
    soil samples, ECw can be determined either in the laboratory on a soil solution
    sample collected with a soil solution extractor (Fig. 1) or directly in the field
    using in situ, imbibing-type porous-matrix salinity sensors (Fig. 2). Figure 1
    Open in figure viewer Diagram of the basic suction cup extractor setup for sampling
    the soil solution. Taken from Corwin (2002a) Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Schematic
    of the porous-matrix salinity sensor. Taken from Corwin (2002b) There are serious
    doubts about the ability of soil solution extractors and porous-matrix salinity
    sensors (also known as soil salinity sensors) to provide representative soil water
    samples (England, 1974; Raulund-Rasmussen, 1989; Smith et al., 1990). Soil heterogeneity
    significantly affects chemical concentrations in the soil solution. Because of
    their small sphere of measurement, both solution extractors and salt sensors do
    not adequately integrate spatial variability (Amoozegar-Fard et al., 1982; Haines
    et al., 1982; Hart and Lowery, 1997); consequently, Biggar and Nielsen (1976)
    suggested that soil solution samples are “point samples” that can provide good
    qualitative, but not quantitative, estimates unless field-scale variability is
    adequately established. Furthermore, salinity sensors demonstrate a response-time
    lag that depends on diffusion of ions between the soil solution and solution in
    the porous ceramic cell, which is affected by (i) thickness of the ceramic conductivity
    cell, (ii) diffusion coefficients in soil and ceramic, and (iii) fraction of the
    ceramic surface in contact with soil (Wesseling and Oster, 1973). The salinity
    sensor is generally considered the least desirable method of measuring ECw because
    of its low sample volume, unstable calibration over time, and slow response (Corwin,
    2002b). Electrical resistivity (e.g., Wenner array) and EM are both well suited
    for precision agriculture applications because their volumes of measurement are
    large, which reduces the influence of local-scale variability. However, electrical
    resistivity is an invasive technique that requires good contact between the soil
    and four electrodes inserted into the soil; consequently, it produces less reliable
    measurements in dry or stony soils than the noninvasive EM measurement. The EM
    has become the first choice for measuring soil salinity in a geospatial context
    because (i) measurements can be taken as quickly as one can move from one location
    to the next, (ii) the large volume of soil measured reduces local-scale variability,
    and (iii) measurements in relatively dry or stony soils are possible because no
    contact is necessary between the soil and the EM sensor (Hendrickx et al., 1992).
    Nevertheless, electrical resistivity has a flexibility that has proven advantageous
    for field application, i.e., the depth and volume of measurement can be easily
    changed by changing the spacing between the electrodes. Even though the depth
    of penetration and volume of measurement by EM can be varied by raising the instrument
    above the soil surface, it is a complicated matter of determining the subsequent
    depth and volume of measurement, whereas in the case of the electrical resistivity
    method, it is a simple calculation to estimate the depth of penetration and the
    volume of measurement once the interelectrode spacing is adjusted. Both electrical
    resistivity and EM measure the ECa Electrical resistivity measures apparent resistivity.
    In homogeneous mediums, resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. Resistivity
    devices convert measurements of apparent resistivity into measurements of apparent
    conductivity. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was initially adapted for use in
    measuring water content. Later, Dalton et al. (1984) demonstrated the utility
    of TDR to also measure ECa The measurement of ECa with TDR is based on attenuation
    of applied signal voltage as it traverses the medium of interest with the relative
    magnitude of energy loss related to ECa (Wraith, 2002). The advantages of TDR
    for measuring ECa include (i) a relatively noninvasive nature because there is
    only minor interference with soil processes, (ii) an ability to measure both soil
    water content and ECa, (iii) an ability to detect small changes in ECa under representative
    soil conditions, (iv) the capability of obtaining continuous unattended measurements,
    and (v) no need for a calibration of soil water content measurements in many cases
    (Wraith, 2002). PRINCIPLES OF ECa MEASUREMENT Of all the aforementioned methods
    of measuring soil salinity, the measurement of ECa with electrical resistivity
    and EM is regarded as the most practical for establishing the spatial distribution
    of soil salinity at field scales and larger (Rhoades et al., 1999b). Measurement
    of ECa with electrical resistivity and EM has the greatest potential for application
    to precision agriculture because of its reliability, accuracy, large volume of
    measurement, and relative ease of obtaining the measurement. Apparent soil electrical
    conduction in sufficiently moist soils is primarily via salts contained in soil
    water occupying the larger pores; consequently, measurement of EC of bulk soil
    is closely related to soil salinity (Rhoades et al., 1999b). However, there is
    also a contribution by the solid phase to ECa in moist soils primarily via the
    exchangeable cations associated with clay minerals (Rhoades et al., 1999b). A
    third pathway exists through soil particles in direct and continuous contact with
    one another (Rhoades et al., 1999b). These three pathways of current flow contribute
    to the ECa (Fig. 3). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Soil electrical conductance
    pathways. 1 = liquid, 2 = solid–liquid, and 3 = solid. Modified from Rhoades et
    al. (1989) Rhoades et al. (1989) formulated an electrical conductance model that
    describes the three conductance pathways of ECa: (2) where θws and θwc are the
    volumetric soil water contents in the soil water pathway (cm3 cm−3) and in the
    continuous liquid pathway (cm3 cm−3), respectively; θss and θsc are the volumetric
    contents of the surface-conductance (cm3 cm−3) and indurated (cm3 cm−3) solid
    phases of the soil, respectively; ECws and ECwc are the specific ECs of the soil
    water pathway (dS m−1) and continuous liquid pathway (dS m−1); and ECss and ECsc
    are the ECs of the surface-conductance (dS m−1) and indurated (dS m−1) solid phases,
    respectively. Equation [2] was reformulated by Rhoades et al. (1989) into Eq.
    [3]: (3) where θw = θws + θwc = total volumetric water content (cm3 cm−3) and
    θsc · ECsc was assumed to be negligible. The following simplifying approximations
    are also known: (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) where PW is the percentage water on a gravimetric
    basis, ρb is the bulk density (Mg m−3), SP is the saturation percentage, ECw is
    average EC of the soil water assuming equilibrium (i.e., ECw = ECws = ECwc), and
    ECe is the EC of the saturation extract (dS m−1). By measuring soil ECe, SP, PW,
    and ρb and using Eq. [3] through [8], the ECa can be estimated. Very simply, Eq.
    [3] through [8] indicate that ECa is a function of the soil physical and chemical
    properties of (i) soil salinity, (ii) SP, (iii) water content, and (iv) bulk density.
    The SP and bulk density are both closely associated with clay content. Another
    factor influencing ECa is temperature. Electrolytic conductivity increases at
    a rate of approximately 1.9% per degree centigrade increase in temperature. Customarily,
    EC is expressed at a reference temperature of 25°C for purposes of comparison.
    The EC measured at a particular temperature t, ECt, can be adjusted to a reference
    EC at 25°C, EC25, using the below relation from Handbook 60 (U.S. Salinity Lab.
    Staff, 1954): (9) where ft is a temperature conversion factor. Approximations
    for the temperature conversion factor are available in polynomial form (Stogryn,
    1971; Wraith and Or, 1999) or other equations such as Eq. [10] by Sheets and Hendrickx
    (1995): (10) Traditionally, ECe has been the standard measure of salinity used
    in all salt-tolerance plant studies. As a result, a relation between ECa and ECe
    was needed to relate ECa back to ECe, which is in turn related to crop yield.
    Over the past two decades, research has been directed at developing reliable and
    efficient conversion techniques from ECa back to ECe (Williams and Baker, 1982;
    McNeill, 1980, 1986; McKenzie et al., 1989; Rhoades, 1992, 1996; Rhoades and Corwin,
    1990; Rhoades et al., 1989, 1990, 1991, 1999a; Slavich, 1990; Cook and Walker,
    1992; Diaz and Herrero, 1992; Yates et al., 1993; Lesch et al., 1992, 1995a, 1995b,
    1998). METHODS AND EQUIPMENT FOR GEOREFERENCED MEASUREMENT OF ECa Indirect methods
    for the determination of soil salinity depend on a measurement of ECa using electrical
    resistivity (i.e., Wenner array), EM, or TDR. Although TDR has been demonstrated
    to compare closely with other accepted methods of ECa measurement (Heimovaara
    et al., 1995; Mallants et al., 1996; Spaans and Baker, 1993; Reece, 1998), it
    is still not sufficiently simple, robust, or fast enough for the general needs
    of field-scale assessment of soil salinity (Rhoades et al., 1999a). Only electrical
    resistivity (specifically, the Wenner array) and EM have been adapted for the
    georeferenced measurement of ECa at field scales and larger (Rhoades et al., 1999a,
    1999b). Electrical Resistivity Electrical resistivity methods introduce an electrical
    current into the soil through current electrodes at the soil surface, and the
    difference in current flow potential is measured at potential electrodes that
    are placed in the vicinity of the current flow. These methods were developed in
    the second decade of the 1900s by Conrad Schlumberger in France and Frank Wenner
    in the United States for the evaluation of ground electrical resistivity (Burger,
    1992; Telford et al., 1990). The electrode configuration is referred to as a Wenner
    array when four electrodes are equidistantly spaced in a straight line at the
    soil surface, with the two outer electrodes serving as the current, or transmission,
    electrodes and the two inner electrodes serving as the potential, or receiving,
    electrodes (Fig. 4). The depth of penetration of the electrical current and the
    volume of measurement depend on the interelectrode spacing. The larger the spacing
    is, the deeper the measurement and larger the volume of measurement. The resistivity,
    ρ, measured with the Wenner array is (Burger, 1992): (11) where V is the voltage
    (V), a is the interelectrode spacing, i is the electrical current (A), and R is
    the measured resistance (ω). Because the ECa is the inverse of R, then Eq. [11]
    becomes: (12) Figure 4 Open in figure viewer Schematic of Wenner array electrodes.
    C1 and C2 represent the current electrodes, P1 and P2 represent the potential
    electrodes, and a represents the interelectrode spacing. Modified from Rhoades
    and Halvorson (1977) The volume of measurement with the Wenner array is roughly
    between the two inner potential electrodes from the soil surface to a depth of
    roughly the interelectrode spacing, a For a homogeneous soil, the soil volume
    measured is roughly πa3 Other electrode configurations are frequently used, and
    the equations for these configurations are discussed by Burger (1992), Dobrin
    (1960), and Telford et al. (1990) The basic equipment for measuring ECa with the
    Wenner array technique (Fig. 5) includes an electrical current source, a resistance
    meter, four metal electrodes, connecting wire, measuring tape, and a soil thermometer
    (Rhoades and Halvorson, 1977). The current source can be a hand-cranked generator
    or battery powered, which should measure from 0.1 to 1000 ω. The electrodes can
    be made from any noncorrosive conductive metal (e.g., stainless steel, copper,
    brass). The connecting wire should be flexible, well-insulated, multistranded,
    12- to 18-gauge wire. Detailed instructions concerning electrode construction
    and information concerning the resistivity meters can be found in Rhoades and
    Halvorson (1977) Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Equipment layout of the Wenner
    array technique. Taken from Rhoades and Oster (1986) By mounting the four electrodes
    to fix their interelectrode spacing, considerable time for a handheld measurement
    is saved (Fig. 6; Rhoades and Halvorson, 1977). An interelectrode spacing of 1
    to 1.5 m is particularly useful in instances where the Wenner array is used in
    conjunction with the EM-38 electromagnetic conductivity meter because the penetration
    depths of the EM-38 in the vertical and horizontal coil configurations are 0.75
    and 1.5 m, respectively. However, a Wenner array with a 1.5-m interelectrode spacing
    would result in a cumbersome 4.5-m span. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Electrodes
    mounted in a fixed array. The ECa for a discrete depth interval of soil, ECx,
    can be determined with the Wenner array by measuring the ECa of successive layers
    by increasing the interelectrode spacing from ai−1 to ai and using the following
    equation from Barnes (1952) for resistors in parallel: (13) where ai is the interelectrode
    spacing, which equals the depth of sampling and ai−1 is the previous interelectrode
    spacing, which equals the depth of previous sampling. A detailed discussion of
    the Wenner array electrical resistivity technique can be found in Corwin and Hendrickx
    (2002) A mobilized, tractor-mounted version of the fixed-electrode array (Fig.
    7) has been developed that georeferences the ECa measurement with a GPS (Carter
    et al., 1993; Rhoades, 1992, 1993). The fixed-electrode array is a particularly
    appealing approach for field applications because of the relative ease of measurement
    and the large volume of soil that can be measured. However, because of the large
    volume of measurement and the complex localized spatial variability of pore geometry,
    water content, and salinity, which influence the measurement of ECa, some error
    is introduced, making it difficult to calibrate ECa, as measured with this equipment,
    to ECw or ECe as determined for soil samples taken at the sites of the ECa measurements.
    The error is a consequence of the difference in volumes of measurement between
    the ECa measurement and the soil core sample used to determine the associated
    ECw or ECe The calibration problem is also of concern for EM. The mobile, fixed-electrode
    array equipment is particularly well suited for collecting detailed maps of the
    spatial variability of average root-zone soil EC at field scales and larger. Figure
    7 Open in figure viewer Mobile fixed-array equipment for the continuous measurement
    of apparent soil electrical conductivity. Veris Technologies1 has developed a
    commercial system for measuring ECa using the principles of the Wenner array.
    The Veris unit consists of six coulter electrodes. Coulter electrodes no. 2 and
    5 are the current electrodes. Two sets of electrode arrays enable simultaneous
    measurement of two soil depths: 0 to 0.3 m and 0 to 0.9 m. When connected to a
    GPS, a georeferenced map of ECa for precision agriculture applications is prepared.
    Electromagnetic Induction Apparent soil electrical conductivity can be measured
    remotely with EM. An EM transmitter coil located at one end of the instrument
    induces circular eddy-current loops in the soil (Fig. 8). The magnitude of these
    loops is directly proportional to the EC of the soil in the vicinity of that loop.
    Each current loop generates a secondary electromagnetic field that is proportional
    to the value of the current flowing within the loop. A fraction of the secondary
    induced electromagnetic field from each loop is intercepted by the receiver coil
    of the instrument, and the sum of these signals is amplified and formed into an
    output voltage, which is related to a depth-weighted bulk soil EC, ECa The receiver
    coil measures amplitude and phase of the secondary magnetic field. The amplitude
    and phase of the secondary field will differ from those of the primary field as
    a result of soil properties (e.g., clay content, water content, and salinity),
    spacing of the coils and their orientation, frequency, and distance from the soil
    surface (Hendrickx and Kachanoski, 2002). Figure 8 Open in figure viewer Principle
    of operation of the electromagnetic soil conductivity meter. The two most commonly
    used EM conductivity meters in soil science and in vadose zone hydrology are the
    Geonics2 EM-31 and EM-38. The EM-31 has an intercoil spacing of 3.66 m, which
    corresponds to a penetration depth of 3 and 6 m in the horizontal and vertical
    dipole orientations, respectively. The EM-38 has an intercoil spacing of 1 m,
    which results in a penetration depth of roughly 0.75 and 1.5 m in the horizontal
    and vertical dipole orientations, respectively (Fig. 9). The EM-38 has had considerably
    greater application for precision agriculture because the root zone extends roughly
    to 1.5 m. A detailed discussion of the equipment and its operation can be found
    in Hendrickx and Kachanoski (2002) Figure 9 Open in figure viewer Handheld Geonics
    EM-38 electromagnetic soil conductivity meter (top) lying in the horizontal orientation
    with its coils parallel to the soil surface and (bottom) lying in the vertical
    orientation with its coils perpendicular to the soil surface. The ECa measured
    by EM at ECa < 100 mS m−1 is given by (McNeill, 1980) (14) where ECa is measured
    in S m−1; Hp and Hs are the intensities of the primary and secondary magnetic
    fields at the receiver coil (A m−1), respectively; f is the frequency of the current
    (Hz); μ0 is the magnetic permeability of air (4π10−7 H m−1); and s is the intercoil
    spacing (m). Mobile EM equipment developed at the Salinity Laboratory (Carter
    et al., 1993; Rhoades, 1993) is available for the appraisal of soil salinity and
    other soil properties (e.g., water content and clay content) using an EM-38. The
    drawback of this early mobile EM equipment was that it produced a point ECa measurement
    for the vertical (EMv) and horizontal (EMh) coil configurations rather than a
    continuous-stream reading of ECa as with the mobile fixed-array equipment; consequently,
    all ECa maps were grid maps. The drawback relates to the inability of the EM-38
    meter to measure and record data simultaneously in each dipole orientation. The
    measurement of soil salinity with EM relies on both horizontal and vertical dipole
    measurements at each observation point to qualitatively evaluate the salinity
    distribution profile. However, data can be recorded continuously with the EM-38
    meter if surveys are conducted in one dipole orientation. This is commonly done
    in the Midwest where other towed units that have been developed. In these instances,
    the concern is not with mapping salinity, but usually with mapping clay, water
    content, or both. Recently, the mobile EM equipment developed at the Salinity
    Laboratory has been modified by the addition of a dual-dipole EM-38 unit (Fig.
    10). The dual-dipole EM-38 meter simultaneously records data in both dipole orientations
    at time intervals of just a few seconds between readings. A close-up of the sled
    that houses the dual-dipole EM-38 is provided in Fig. 11. The mobile EM equipment
    is suited for the detailed mapping of ECa and correlated soil properties at specified
    depth intervals through the root zone. The advantages of the mobile dual-dipole
    EM equipment over the mobile fixed-array resistivity equipment are that (i) the
    EM technique is noninvasive, so it can be used in dry or stony soils that would
    not be amenable to the invasive technique of the fixed-array approach due to the
    need for good electrode–soil contact; (ii) the EM technique provides information
    for the vertical profiling of ECa rather than just a single integrated ECa although
    the Veris unit does provide two depths; and (iii) stream tubes can be delineated
    (see Modeling Soil Salinity in a Geospatial Context section). A disadvantage of
    the EM approach would be that the ECa is a depth-weighted value that is nonlinear.
    This depth-weighted nonlinearity is shown in Fig. 12, which illustrates the cumulative
    relative contributions of all soil EC, R(z), for a homogeneously conductive material
    below a normalized depth of z based on Eq. [15] and [16] from McNeill (1980) for
    vertical and horizontal dipoles, respectively: (15) (16) Figure 10 Open in figure

    OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR A FIELD-SCALE ECa SURVEY FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE APPLICATIONS
    The standard operating procedure for field-scale ECa surveys applied to precision
    agriculture includes four steps: (i) an initial intensive ECa survey, (ii) a soil
    sample design based on the intensive ECa survey, (iii) a stochastic and/or deterministic
    calibration of ECa to soil sample–determined ECe, and (iv) a determination of
    the dominant soil properties influencing the ECa measurement at the site of interest.
    The following is a brief description of each step. Mobile ECa Survey and Soil
    Sample Design An initial intensive ECa survey with either mobile electrical resistivity
    or EM equipment is conducted and used to establish soil core sampling locations
    needed for calibration and understanding the dominant soil properties influencing
    ECa Depending on the level of detail desired, from 100 to several thousand spatial
    measurements of ECa are taken generally in regularly spaced traverses across the
    field of interest. The use of mobile EM equipment has one slight advantage over
    the use of mobile resistivity equipment, which is the ability to take measurements
    on dry and stony soils. Figures 13 and 14 show representative ECa surveys using
    mobile Wenner array and mobile EM-38 equipment, respectively. Figure 13 Open in
    figure viewer Detailed mobile Wenner apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)

    Water District. EMv, electromagnetic induction measurement in the vertical coil-mode
    configuration. Once a georeferenced, intensive ECa survey is conducted, the data
    can be used to establish the locations of the soil core sample sites that will
    be used for calibrating ECa to soil sample ECe To establish the locations where
    soil cores are to be taken, a software package (ESAP) developed by Lesch et al.
    (1995a)(1995b, 2000) is used. The ESAP software package identifies the optimal
    locations for soil sample sites from the ECa survey data. These sites are selected
    based on spatial statistics to reflect the observed spatial variability. Generally,
    6 to 20 sites are selected, depending on the level of variability of the ECa measurements
    for a site. The optimal locations of a minimal subset of ECa survey sites are
    identified to obtain soil samples for validation of the ECa measurements. This
    is done with a response-surface sampling design. The ECa measurements are subsequently
    transformed using an ECa-to-ECe calibration into predicted salinity data throughout
    the entire survey area using the sample soil salinity data in conjunction with
    spatially based statistical modeling techniques. Stochastic and/or Deterministic
    Calibration of ECa to ECe Soil salinity, as conventionally expressed in terms
    of ECe, can be inferred from ECa by two approaches: a deterministic and a stochastic
    approach (Rhoades et al., 1999b). The preferred approach will vary with the size
    of the area to be assessed, availability of equipment, and the specific objectives.
    In the deterministic approach, either theoretically or empirically determined
    models are used to convert ECa into salinity (ECe). Deterministic models are static;
    i.e., all model parameters are considered known, and no ECe data need to be determined.
    For example, Eq. [3], developed by Rhoades et al. (1989), is a deterministic approach.
    The deterministic approach is the preferred approach to use when significant,
    localized variations in soil type exist in the field. This approach typically
    requires knowledge of additional soil properties (e.g., soil water content, SP,
    bulk density, temperature, etc.). In the stochastic approach, statistical modeling
    techniques such as spatial regression or co-kriging are used to directly predict
    the soil salinity from ECa survey data. In this approach, the models are dynamic;
    i.e., the model parameters are estimated using soil sample data collected during
    the survey. This calibration is developed by acquiring soil salinity data (or
    other soil property data, such SP, texture, bulk density, etc.) from a small percentage
    of the sensor measurement sites and estimating an appropriate stochastic prediction
    model for each depth increment using the paired soil sample and ECa measurement
    data. Then, using the remaining sensor data in conjunction with the established
    model, the soil salinity levels (or other similarly calibrated properties) are
    predicted at all of the remaining nonsampled measurement locations. The stochastic
    and deterministic calibration approaches are described in detail by Lesch et al.
    (1995a)(1995b, 2000) and incorporated into the ESAP software (Lesch et al., 2000).
    Typically, when an ECa survey is performed, the ECa data are used to estimate
    the values of one or more soil variables influencing ECa For example, estimates
    of spatial soil salinity pattern, soil texture, or water-holding capacity may
    be desired. To facilitate this estimation process, the soil variables are calibrated
    to the ECa survey information with a stochastic approach. As mentioned in the
    previous section (Mobile ECa Survey and Soil Sample Design), ESAP optimizes the
    sample design by selecting sites that optimize estimation of a calibration or
    prediction model (i.e., an equation that can be used to predict the values of
    soil variables from the ECa survey data). The prediction model is an ordinary
    regression model. To use an ordinary regression model to predict the values of
    a spatial data set, ESAP addresses issues of spatial correlation and collinearity.
    Apparent soil electrical conductivity can be converted into estimated soil salinity
    (i.e., ECe) using a deterministic conversion algorithm. First, raw ECa data are
    converted into depth-specific ECa Next, these ECa data are converted into estimated
    soil salinity data using Eq. [3] through [8], originally developed by Rhoades
    et al. (1989) Determination of the Dominant Soil Properties Influencing the ECa
    Measurement The fact that ECa is a function of several soil properties (i.e.,
    soil salinity, texture, and water content) is often overlooked in the application
    of ECa measurements obtained with EM and electrical resistivity to precision agriculture.
    Precision agriculture studies relating ECa to crop yield have met with inconsistent
    results due to the fact that a combination of factors influence ECa measurements
    to varying degrees across units of management, thereby confounding interpretation.
    These factors include soil salinity, water content, SP, and bulk density. In areas
    of saline soils, salinity dominates the ECa measurements, and interpretations
    are often more straightforward. To use spatial measurements of ECa in a precision
    agriculture context, it is necessary to understand what factors are most significantly
    influencing the ECa measurements within the field of study. There are two approaches
    for determining the predominant factors influencing ECa measurement: (i) simple
    statistical correlation and (ii) wavelet analysis. Even though wavelet analysis
    is a powerful tool for determining the dominant complex interrelated factors influencing
    ECa measurement, it requires data on a regular grid or equal-spaced transect.
    Grid or equal-spaced transect sampling schemes are not as practical for determining
    spatial distributions of soil salinity from ECa measurements as the stochastic
    statistical approach developed by Lesch et al. (1995a)(1995b, 2000). Table 1 is
    a compilation of correlation data for six field study sites where ECa surveys
    were performed for the purpose of salinity appraisal. The table shows the variation
    in the influence of various soil properties on ECa for different field locations.
    In all cases, the surveys were performed as discussed in the above standard operating
    procedure. An intensive ECa survey was performed, followed by selection of 6 to
    20 sites for soil core sampling. An analysis was performed on the soil cores for
    various physicochemical properties (e.g., SP, salinity, and water content). A
    calibration and the correlations in Table 1 were determined using the ECa survey
    and soil sample data. The predicted correlation column corresponds to the correlation
    between the predicted ECa using Eq. [3] through [8] and the specified soil property
    (salinity, texture, and θw) while the observed correlation column corresponds
    to the correlation between the measured ECa and the specified soil property. The
    fact that the predicted correlations are in most cases the same as the observed
    correlations shows that the model by Rhoades et al. (1989) is fairly robust. Only
    in the case of the Coachella sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] field does
    the model appear to show some weakness. Even more convincing evidence of the robustness
    of the Rhoades et al. (1989) model is the high correlation between the predicted
    ECa, as reflected by ln(EC’a), and the observed ECa, as reflected by ln(EMavg),
    in Table 2 However, the observed correlations in Table 1 are the most significant
    because this column shows what soil properties are influencing the ECa reading
    most. Table 1. Means and ranges of the soil factors [electrical conductivity of

    The following is a discussion of the six ECa surveys presented in Table 1 Coachella
    Valley Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Field This is an example of a survey where
    the salinity represented by ln(ECe), the soil texture reflected by the SP, and
    the θw correlate with the EM data, which is represented as ln(EMavg), where EMavg
    is the geometric mean of the vertical and horizontal EM readings (i.e., EMh ·
    EMv). In this field, Eq. [3] through [8] correctly predict the correlations and
    correctly predict that salinity will correlate best with the averaged EM data.
    The reason why all three soil properties correlate well with the EM data is because
    all three soil properties are highly correlated with each other (Table 2). Coachella
    Valley Sorghum Field This field is an example of where only salinity correlates
    well with the EM data. Equations [3] through [8] correctly predict this condition
    even though the calculated correlation between the ln(EMavg) and the ln(EC’a),
    where ECa is calculated from Eq. [3] through [8], is less than ideal (r = 0.85).
    Note from Table 2 that neither the soil texture nor θw correlate much at all with
    salinity, with r = −0.10 and r = 0.28, respectively. It is this lack of correlation
    with salinity and because the texture and water content exhibit minimal sample
    variation (i.e., sample range for SP is 51.0–61.1%; sample range for θw is 0.33–0.41
    cm3 cm−3) that they correlate so poorly with the EM data, with r = −0.20 and r
    = 0.25, respectively (Table 1). Broadview Water District (Quarter Sections 16–2
    and 16–3) These combined quarter sections display large variability in soil texture
    (SP ranges from 33.2–85.0%) and water content (θw ranges from 0.21–0.39 cm3 cm−3)
    sample data, with relatively minimal salinity variation (80% of the samples fell
    below the mean value of 3.65 dS m−1). Equations [3] through [8] correctly predict
    that both the texture and EM and water content and EM correlation levels will
    be higher than the salinity and EM correlation level (Table 1). Equations [3]
    through [8] tend to slightly overestimate the influence of salinity and underestimate
    the texture and water content influences (Table 1). Fresno Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum
    L.) Field Equations [3] through [8] correctly predict a negative correlation between
    EM data and water content and also correctly predict the order of the degree of
    correlation between the EM data and each soil property although the influence
    of soil water content again appears to be underestimated (Table 1). Coachella
    Valley–Kohl Ranch Field This field displays excellent agreement between predicted
    and observed EM–soil property correlations (Table 1). Salinity correlates very
    well, water content correlates fairly well, and soil texture exhibits weak negative
    correlation, indicating that the dominant soil properties influencing the EM reading
    are salinity and water content. In addition, two secondary properties, sodium
    adsorption ratio and B, were measured. The fact that these correlated quite well
    with the EM data suggests the close association of these properties with salinity
    in this particular field because the EM reading does not directly measure sodium
    adsorption ratio or B. Broadview Water District (Quarter Section 10–2) Equations
    [3] through [8] do an excellent job of predicting both the sign and magnitude
    of each EM–soil property correlation (Table 1). The dominant soil property influencing
    the EM reading is salinity. From this discussion of six typical ECa surveys for
    agricultural soils in the arid Southwest, what is known about the interrelationship
    of soil properties influencing the ECa measurement? First, Eq. [3] through [8]
    describe how various soil properties (salinity, texture, and water content) interact
    to influence the ECa signal data and highlight the fact that this interaction
    can be quite complex. However, there appears to be consistent, high positive correlation
    between the EC’a (i.e., the calculated ECa using Eq. [3]–[8]) and EM data (see
    Table 2), implying that Eq. [3] represents a reasonable model. Therefore, we can
    get a good idea of how well EM survey data will correlate with a specific soil
    property by determining how well this same soil property correlates with EC’a
    data. Second, it is clear that the innercorrelation structure of the various primary
    soil properties (ECe, SP, and θw) determines how well each property ultimately
    correlates with the ECa signal data. However, the variability of each soil property
    also influences the final correlation estimates because increased variability
    in any given soil property directly translates into increased variation in the
    ECa data. Obviously, one may encounter many diverse types of innercorrelation
    structures and/or different degrees of specific soil property variation, as shown
    in Tables 1 and 2 Thus, the ultimate correlation between the ECa signal data and
    any specific soil property may be quite different from field to field. For example,
    this effect is clearly evident in the ln(EMavg) and SP correlation estimates shown
    in Table 1 where the observed estimates range from −0.33 to 0.84. Finally, with
    respect to ECe data, the best scenario for the prediction of salinity from ECa
    signal data occurs when the (ECe, SP, and θw) cross-correlation estimates are
    all positive and high (i.e., near 1) and/or the SP and θw variation is minimal.
    However, in all of the scenarios shown here, Eq. [3] can be successfully used
    to explain why certain soil properties correlate well with ECa signal data in
    some survey scenarios but not in others. MODELING SOIL SALINITY IN A GEOSPATIAL
    CONTEXT Spatial measurements of ECa are not only of value to precision agriculture
    from the perspective of real-time inventories of soil salinity, but they''re also
    of value in forecasting spatio-temporal changes in salinity status based on existing
    conditions and subsequent imposed scenarios. Assessment encompasses both real-time
    measurements and model predictions. The ability to assess, both in real time and
    in a prognostication mode, the spatial distribution and fate of a nonpoint source
    (NPS) pollutant, such as soil salinity, is a key concern in maintaining the delicate
    balance between crop productivity and the detrimental environmental impacts of
    NPS pollutants. This balance is a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture (Corwin
    et al., 1999a). It is through real-time measurements that a continued inventory
    of a constituent (e.g., salinity) can be maintained to determine the extent of
    the problem and to evaluate changes, whether for better or worse, that gauge the
    effect of ameliorative actions (Corwin et al., 1999a). Model predictions set the
    stage for posing what if scenarios that serve a preventative role by suggesting
    management actions that will alter the occurrence of detrimental conditions before
    they manifest (Corwin et al., 1999a). A key aspect of precision agriculture is
    minimizing detrimental environmental impacts. Landscape-scale solute transport
    modeling can serve as a crucial component of precision agriculture by providing
    feedback concerning solute loading to ground water or drainage tile systems. Soil
    and ground water quality affected by salinity depend on spatially distributed
    properties that influence salt transport. The phenomenon of salt transport through
    the vadose zone (i.e., the zone extending from the soil surface to the ground
    water table) is affected by the temporal variation in irrigation water quality
    and the spatial variability of plant water uptake and soil chemical and physical
    properties. Coupling a GIS to a salt transport model potentially offers a means
    of dealing with the complex spatial heterogeneity of soils, which influences the
    intricate biological, chemical, and physical processes of transient-state salt
    transport in the vadose zone (Corwin, 1996). Modeling the movement and accumulation
    of salinity is a spatial problem well suited for the integration of a salt transport
    model with GIS (Corwin, 1996). A GIS serves as a spatial database to organize,
    manipulate, and display the complex spatial data used by a deterministic model
    to describe the regional-scale distribution of soil salinity and salt loading
    to ground water. Coupling of the spatial data–handling capabilities of a GIS with
    a one-dimensional salt transport model offers the advantage of utilizing the full
    information content of spatially distributed data to analyze solute movement on
    a field scale in three dimensions (Corwin, 1996). As a visualization and analysis
    tool, GIS is capable of manipulating both spatially referenced input and output
    parameters of the model. The basic components of a NPS pollutant model (NPS pollutants,
    such as salinity and pesticides, are spread over a wide area, as opposed to point
    source pollutants, which are located at a specific site or point, such as a toxic
    spill) are model, GIS, and data (Corwin et al., 1997). These components depend
    on the advanced information technologies of a GPS, GIS, geostatistics, remote
    sensing, solute transport modeling, neural networks, transfer functions, fuzzy
    logic, hierarchical theory, and uncertainty analysis (Corwin et al., 1999a). Published
    work by Corwin and his colleagues (Corwin and Rhoades, 1988; Corwin et al., 1989,
    1995, 1996, 1999b) reflects the current trend in the application of GIS-based
    models to simulate the transport of NPS pollutants in the vadose zone at field,
    basin, and regional scales (Corwin, 1996; Corwin et al., 1997, 1999a). These models
    are specifically designed to account for the spatio-temporal variability of the
    properties and conditions influencing soil salinity accumulation and transport.
    Two different GIS-based approaches are described for predicting the areal distribution
    of salinity. The first approach couples a regression model of salinity development
    to a GIS of soil salinity development factors (i.e., permeability, leaching fraction,
    and ground water EC) for the Wellton–Mohawk Irrigation District near Yuma, AZ,
    over the study period 1968–1973 (Corwin and Rhoades, 1988; Corwin et al., 1989).
    The regression model predicts the composite salinity of the root zone (i.e., top
    60 cm.). Areas of low, medium, and high salinization potential are delineated
    for the entire 44 000-ha irrigation district. Measured salinity data verified
    that 86% of the predicted salinity categories was accurately predicted. The second
    approach loosely coupled the one-dimensional, transient-state solute transport
    model, TETrans, to the GIS ARC/INFO (Corwin et al., 1999b). Slightly less than
    2400 ha of the Broadview Water District located on the west side of central California''s
    San Joaquin Valley was used as the test site to evaluate the integrated GIS–transport
    model over the study period 1991–1996 (Corwin et al., 1999b). The unique aspect
    of the Corwin et al. (1999b) approach to landscape-scale modeling of a NPS pollutant
    (i.e., salinity) in the vadose zone is the delineation of stream tubes from ECa
    measurements taken on a grid with the mobile EM-38 equipment developed by Carter
    et al. (1993) and Rhoades (1993) Stream tubes are noninteractive volumes of soil
    whose physicochemical properties influencing solute transport are relatively homogenous
    so that solute transport within the column of soil defined by the stream tube
    can be simulated with a one-dimensional solute transport model. Corwin et al.
    (1999b) first proposed the use of an intensive EM survey measuring ECa as a means
    of delineating stream tubes. For field sites where ECa is closely correlated with
    soil salinity, stream tubes can be delineated based on EMh and EMv measurements
    of ECa From the geometric mean of EMh and EMv (i.e., EMh · EMv), quantiles can
    be defined. The ratio of EMh to EMv (i.e., EMh/EMv) is determined, and within
    each quantile, the points are selected where the low and high EMh/EMv ratios exist.
    These points serve as the centroids of the Thiessen polygons delineating the stream
    tubes throughout the area of study. A GIS is used to define the spatial location
    of the stream tubes with their associated solute transport property attributes.
    TETrans uses the GIS as a spatial database from which to draw its input data.
    Simulations are presented over a 5-yr period, 1991–1996. Display maps show spatial
    distributions of soil salinity profiles to a depth of 1.2 m, irrigation efficiencies,
    drainage amounts, and salt loading to ground water over the 2396-ha study area.
    These maps provide a potential precision agriculture tool for making irrigation
    management decisions to minimize the environmental impact of salinity on soil
    and ground water. The first approach is best suited for areas where steady-state
    conditions are approximated while the second approach can be used under transient-state
    conditions. SUMMARY As the world''s population continues to grow, humankind is
    faced with the onerous task of meeting the world''s food demand. This can only
    be accomplished with sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture requires
    a delicate balance between crop production, natural resource use, environmental
    impacts, and economics. The goal of sustainable agriculture is to optimize food
    production while maintaining economic stability, minimizing the use of natural
    resources and minimizing impacts on the environment. Precision agriculture stands
    as one of the potential means of attaining sustainable agriculture. The future
    of precision agriculture rests on the reliability, reproducibility, and understanding
    of the technological developments on which it is based. Assessing the impact of
    salinity at regional and localized scales is a key component to achieving sustainable
    agriculture. Assessment involves the determination of change in salinity over
    time, which can be measured in real time or predicted with a model. Real-time
    measurements reflect activities of the past, whereas model predictions are glimpses
    into the future based on a simplified set of assumptions. Both means of assessment
    are valuable; however, the advantage of prediction is that it can be used to alter
    the occurrence of detrimental conditions before they develop. Forecasting information
    from model simulations is used in decision-making strategies designed to sustain
    agriculture. This information permits an alteration in the management strategy
    before the development of levels of soil salinity that detrimentally impact either
    agricultural productivity of the soil or quality of the ground water. The ability
    to locate the sources of soil salinity within irrigated landscapes and to model
    the migration of salt through the vadose zone to obtain an estimate of salt loading
    to drainage and ground water is an essential tool in precision agriculture to
    combat degradation of our soil and water resources. This information is valuable
    for selecting alternate crops or alternate irrigation management practices to
    maintain crop productivity while minimizing the environmental impacts of salinity.
    The need for a means of measuring soil salinity in the root zone in a quick, reliable,
    and cost-effective manner resulted in the development of mobile electrical resistivity
    and EM techniques to measure ECa However, the measurement of ECa is complicated
    by the influence of several soil properties aside from soil salinity, including
    soil texture, temperature, and water content. For this reason, it is necessary
    to determine the dominant soil properties influencing the ECa measurement at each
    field of interest to interpret what information is being conveyed by a map of
    ECa From a precision agriculture perspective, when maps of ECa are properly understood,
    they (i) provide a graphic inventory of the scope of the soil salinity problem,
    (ii) provide useful spatial information concerning soil texture and water content,
    (iii) provide information for crop selection, (iv) identify potential areas in
    need of improved irrigation and drainage management, and (v) provide a means of
    monitoring spatio-temporal changes in soil properties that potentially influence
    crop production. Because precision agriculture is an outgrowth of technological
    developments such as the ECa measurement, the future of precision agriculture
    rests on a complete understanding of these technologies. The fruition of the precision
    agriculture application of ECa maps will likely come from future plant indicator
    approaches where combinations of data inputs including airborne spectral imagery,
    ECa measurements with mobile EM, and plant and soil sampling based on response-surface
    sample design strategies are manipulated, organized, and displayed with GIS, image
    analysis, and spatial statistical analysis to create maps of soil salinity, soil
    texture and available water. Acknowledgments The authors thank Dr. Newell Kitchen

    The concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT
    and its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    Bluetooth Low Energy SECTION I. Introduction The population of the world will
    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    Abstract Energy and water balance parameters were measured in two commercial vineyards
    in the semiarid region of the São Francisco river basin, Brazil. Actual evapotranspiration
    (ET) was acquired with the Bowen ratio surface energy balance method. The ratio
    of the latent heat flux to the available energy, or evaporative fraction (EF),
    was 81% on average for two growing cycles in wine grape and 88% for two growing
    seasons in table grape. Energy partitioning in this last vineyard was higher due
    to microsprinkler irrigation conditions and greater soil cover promoted by the
    overhead horizontal trellis systems. The accumulated ET from pruning to harvest
    in wine grape was 438 and 517 mm for the first and second growing cycles, respectively.
    Table grape consumed less water than wine grape (393 and 352 mm for the first
    and second growing seasons, respectively) due to shorter crop stages. Beneficial
    transpiration (T) was 89 and 81% of total ET for wine and table grape, respectively.
    Brazilian semiarid climate allows 2.5 production cycles per year for vineyards.
    The yield was in average of 6183 kg ha−1 for two cycles of wine grape and 11,200
    kg ha−1 for one short growing season of table grape, corresponding to a bio-physical
    water productivity per unit ET of 1.06 kg m−3 (or 1.02 L wine m−3) and 3.18 kg
    m−3, respectively. Table grape showed a significantly higher economic water productivity
    (US$ 6.51 m−3) than wine grape (US$ 0.93 m−3). These values are much favorable
    than for staple crops. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    ratioEvaporative fraction 1. Introduction Irrigated crops in the semiarid region
    of São Francisco river basin in Brazil consist mainly of fruit crops, such as
    grapes, mangos, bananas and guavas. The average rainfall in this region is 570
    mm year−1, and the rainy period is concentrated from January to April. The reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) is around 1600 mm year−1. The monthly average air temperature
    varies between 24 and 30 °C only. Under such high evaporative atmospheric demand
    and low and irregular rainfall, irrigation becomes necessary for commercial agriculture.
    The vineyards growing under these permanently warm conditions exhibit an agronomic
    behaviour being different from the temperate climates. While in these last climates,
    a typical winter season induces dormancy in grapes, the continuous physiological
    processes in the semiarid region of Brazil are accelerated and the propagation
    is very fast allowing the first production after 1.5 years. With proper irrigation
    and cultural management practices, the farmers in São Francisco valley can produce
    grapes and wine in any time of the year, allowing on average 2.5 production cycles
    per year and the harvests in periods with higher prices, although for seedless
    table grapes, the rainy period is avoided due to the direct damage to the fruits
    and the high occurrence of diseases. Crop water productivity (CPW) – or its equivalent
    water use efficiency for irrigated crops – represents the fresh fruit or wine
    production per unit of water applied or consumed. It is preferred to analyse CPW
    in terms of consumptive use because it includes also non-irrigation sources of
    water, such as rainfall, seepage and soil moisture changes. The amount of applied
    water is partitioned into evapotranspiration and deep percolation. Actual evapotranspiration
    (ET) represents the water that is vapourized and not longer available to downstream
    users of a river basin. Percolated water can be recycled, and should therefore
    not be ascribed to the production of a certain irrigated crop. The term “water
    productivity” reflects the link between production of an intended good and its
    resource input (Molden and Satkhivadivel, 1999, Kijne et al., 2003, Bos et al.,
    2005, Molden et al., 2007), having a more general basis than the term “water use
    efficiency”, and makes it suitable to compare the economic performance with other
    water use sectors. It is deemed necessary to study the energy and water balances
    of vineyards for understanding and predicting CPW (Bastiaanssen et al., in press).
    As wine and table grapes are cultivated in different trellis and irrigation systems
    in the São Francisco river basin, it is important to quantify various grape water
    parameters under these differences, being ET the most important of them. ET from
    vineyards can be obtained accurately using weighing lysimeters (Evans et al.,
    1993, Williams et al., 2003, Williams and Ayars, 2005b), eddy correlation techniques
    (Oliver and Sene, 1992, Sene, 1994, Trambouze et al., 1998, Ortega-Farias et al.,
    2007) and the Bowen ratio energy balance method (Heilman et al., 1994, Heilman
    et al., 1996, Rana et al., 2004, Yunusa et al., 2004). These studies reveal a
    significant variation in water consumption due to different irrigation strategies
    and cultural practices. While certain farmers prefer the production of high quantities
    of berries, others like a high quality product introducing significant water stress
    levels by partial root zone drying and deficit irrigation. The extrapolation of
    field measurements to irrigation schemes, regions and river basins are, therefore,
    cumbersome (Williams and Ayars, 2005b). With simultaneous measurements of ET and
    ETo, it is possible to determine the crop coefficient (kc) that normalizes ET
    for climatic influences. This coefficient reflects the canopy development and
    vineyard water status as the crop stages progress (Snyder et al., 1989). As Brazil
    is a developing country on fast track with a growing export of fresh fruits and
    wines, on-farm water management in vineyards is the cornerstone for a productive
    use of scarce water resources at the basin scale. The objective of this study
    was the determination of water parameters related to ET such as crop coefficients,
    evaporative fraction, soil evaporation and canopy transpiration, bulk surface
    and canopy resistances and crop water productivity for wine and table grapes growing
    under different trellis and irrigation systems. Upscaling of these data sets is
    a good bio-physical basis for appraising the options for increasing total CPW
    at the regional scale. 2. Vineyards investigated 2.1. Wine grapes with drip irrigation
    and vertical trellis The wine grape investigated stands at Vitivinícola Santa
    Maria farm near the town of Lagoa Grande in Pernambuco state (latitude 09°02′S;
    longitude 40°11′W). The cultivar is Petite Syrah, and the vineyard was 11 years
    old during the field investigation in 2002. The plants are spaced at 1.20 m ×
    3.50 m, trained vertically to a bilateral cordon and spur pruned. The cordon wire
    was at a height of 1.6 m with no foliage wires (a sprawl type canopy developed).
    There was no cover crop between the rows, and they are oriented in a north–south
    direction. The shoots are allowed to grow freely over the wires. Vertical trellis
    systems in wine grape are preferred instead the overhead horizontal because it
    makes easier the mechanical practices. The daily drip irrigated area of 4.13 ha
    was bordered on all sides by other wine grapes. There was one drip emitter between
    two plants in the rows at a discharge rate of 4 L h−1, suspended on the wire.
    Although it is common in many wine production areas not to irrigate vines at budbreak,
    or shortly thereafter, the irrigation manager started the irrigation soon after
    pruning with a fixed and large amount of water without quantifying the water demand.
    The soil is sandy with a water retention capacity that increases with depth, presenting
    a cracked rock layer below 0.60 m evidenced by the time of installing the tensiometers.
    Because the vineyard was pruned two times in 2002, the study involved two growing
    cycles during this year. The duration of the first growing cycle (GC1) was 132
    days, elapsing from 7 February to 19 June 2002, while the second growing cycle
    (GC2) comprised 136 days, from 8 July to 22 November 2002. Grapes were picked
    to produce wine from both periods. The Bowen ratio surface energy balance method
    was used to measure the partition of net available energy into sensible and latent
    heat fluxes. The sensors were installed at the centre of the plot. The gradients
    of air temperature and vapour pressure above the crop were calculated by using
    wet and dry thermocouples of cupper/constantan at 0.5 and 1.5 m above the canopy.
    The surface albedo (α = RR/RG) was measured through incident (RG) and reflected
    (RR) global solar radiation acquired with pyranometers faced up and down (model
    Eppley, Rhod Island, USA). The net radiation (Rn) was measured at 1 m over the
    canopy with two net radiometers (model NR-Lite, Kipp & Zonnen, Delft, The Netherlands),
    each one installed above a row of plants. The soil heat flux (G) was obtained
    with four heat flux plates (HFT3-L, REBS, Radiation and Energy Balance Systems,
    Seattle, WA and Hukseflux, Delft, The Netherlands) at 0.02 m soil depth and 0.50
    m from the plants. Two plates were burried at the west and the other two at the
    east side of two rows of plants. Wind speed was measured with anemometers (03101,
    R.M., Young wind Sentry, Michigan, USA) at two levels, i.e. 1.0 and 2.0 m above
    the canopy. Air temperature and relative humidity at 0.5 m above the canopy were
    obtained with a probe from Vaisala (model HMP 35A, Helsinki, Finland), inside
    the shelter at the first level of the thermocouples. Soil moisture profiles were
    weekly monitored with tensiometers located between the drip emitters and the vine
    trunks. The sampling depths were 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 m considered to represent the
    effective root zone for vineyards in local soil and cultural conditions (Bassoi
    et al., 2003). Tensions were converted into soil moisture by using laboratory
    measurements of soil water retention curves. Applied water by irrigation was obtained
    by simple weekly readings of water meters attached to the drip pipes. 2.2. Table
    grapes with microsprinkler irrigation and overhead horizontal trellis The table
    grape plot is located at Vale das Uvas farm near the town of Petrolina, Pernambuco
    state (latitude 09°18′S; longitude 40°22′W). The cultivar is the Superior Seedless
    and the vineyard was only 2 years old at the start of the measurement campaign.
    The plants are spaced at 3.5 m × 4.0 m, with the rows oriented in the usual north–south
    direction. The vineyard has an overhead horizontal trellis system at 1.80 m height.
    The cover crop consists of a mixture of legumes and grasses, and was incorporated
    into the soil after budbreak. The plot investigated is 5.13 ha, surrounded by
    other table grapes. The grapes were daily microsprinkler irrigated, with one in-line
    microsprinkler between two vines on the ground at a discharge rate of 44 L h−1
    which wetted 70% of the soil surface. As in wine grape, the farmer started the
    irrigation soon after pruning with large amount of water, thereby promoting high
    rates of direct soil evaporation and cover crop transpiration at initial stages.
    The soil is also sandy throughout the vertical profile, but its water retention
    capacity does not increase with depth. Water holding capacity is higher in the
    upper soil layer (0–20 cm) due to high organic matter content. The measurements
    involved two growing seasons (GS1 and GS2), during the same period but in different
    years: both from 8 July to 7 October, in 2002 and in 2003. The duration of the
    growing seasons were 90 days only, being extremely short as compared to vineyards
    in California and Australia among others. The grapes were brought to the export
    market at the end of GS2 in 2003. The crop was left resting between the two seasons
    to avoid possible direct damage in fruits and high incidence of fungi diseases
    due to rainfall. The plants were not girdled nor sprayed with gibberellic acid
    and the leaves were not removed from fruit zone. At the stage of vegetative growth,
    non-fruitful shoots and lateral shoots growing in the fruiting zone were removed
    and at fruit growth stage, the berries were protected with a white cover from
    direct solar radiation. The same method, measurement procedures and equipment''s
    manufacturers as for wine grapes were set up for table grapes with few differences.
    Two net radiometers were installed, with one instrument at 1 m over the canopy
    and the other at 1 m above the ground surface to measure intercepted radiation
    by the canopy. Two heat flux plates (model HFT3-L, REBS, Radiation and Energy
    Balance Systems, Seattle, WA) were used, one at the east and the other at the
    west side of two rows of plants. Air temperature and relative humidity near the
    leaves was measured by a probe (SKH 2013, Sky instruments LTD, Llandrindod Wells,
    UK) installed in the arm of the datalogger''s shelter at 0.5 m bellow the trellis
    system and only one level anemometer was installed at 1.0 m above the canopy.
    Soil moisture profiles and applied water by irrigation were weekly monitored with
    tensiometers located between the emitters and the vine trunks along two rows at
    same soil depths as for wine grapes and with water meters in microsprinkler pipes.
    3. Methodology The energy balance equation of a vineyard can be expressed by means
    of bulk energy and heat fluxes: (1) where Rn is the net radiation, λEv the latent
    heat flux from the vineyard, Hv the sensible heat flux from the vineyard and G
    is the soil heat flux. λEv was obtained by a partitioning parameter: (2) where
    β is the Bowen ratio: (3) and γ (kPa °C−1) is the psychrometric constant, ΔT (°C)
    the temperature gradient measured by the dry thermocouples and Δe (kPa) is the
    vapour pressure gradient measured by the difference between dry and wet thermocouples
    over the height interval above the canopy surface. The actual evapotranspiration
    (ET) was derived from the latent heat of vaporization (λ), density of water and
    λEv. As a first approximation, an ET of 1 mm day−1 is equivalent to λEv of 28
    W m−2. With measured values of Rn and G and estimations of λEv, the sensible heat
    flux from the vineyards (Hv) was obtained as a residual in Eq. (1). The ETo was
    calculated in this study following FAO-56 standardized guidelines (Allen et al.,
    1998), using weather data from an automatic agrometeorological station near the
    table grape plot (at a distance of 200 m), also equipped with a pluviometer to
    measure rainfall. The crop coefficient (Kc) was obtained as ET/ETo. For the further
    separation of ET into transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (E), the dual crop
    coefficient approach of FAO-56 was used with the basal crop coefficients (Kcb)
    and soil evaporation coefficients Ke (Ke = Kc − Kcb): (4) (5) Initial and end
    values of Kcb were derived from the values at the lower envelope of daily measured
    Kc at these stages when foliage development is minimal. The mid-stage Kcb values
    have been taken from Allen et al. (1998). Tabulated values for mid-stage Kcb are
    0.80 for table grape and 0.65 for wine grape which were adjusted for the our specific
    weather conditions: (6) where u2 and RHmin are, respectively, the averaged wind
    speed and minimum relative humidity at the agrometeorological station (at a height
    of 2 m) and hv (m) is the mean plant height for the mid-stage periods. One key
    parameter in ET processes is the aerodynamic resistance (ra) that describes the
    turbulence of the atmosphere, and is related to the roughness of the land surface.
    The surface roughness parameters of the vineyards were estimated from the flux
    profile relationships. The atmospheric surface-layer similarity theory was used
    (Stull, 1988, Monteith and Unsworth, 1990) applying universal integrated stability
    functions of temperature (Ψh) and momentum (Ψm) for relating fluxes to atmospheric
    state profiles and surface properties (Businger et al., 1971). The friction velocity,
    u* (m s−1), which is a velocity scale related to mechanically generated turbulence,
    was calculated from two-level (z1, z2) wind speed measurements (u1, u2): (7) The
    aerodynamic resistance, ra (s m−1), between the surface roughness and the canopy
    level from where atmospheric state variables are measured was calculated as: (8)
    The surface roughness length for moment transfer (z0m) that together the roughness
    length for heat and vapour transfer (z0h = 0.1 z0m) controls u* and ra was obtained
    from: (9) In Eqs. (7), (8), (9), u1 and u2 are the wind speed values at heights
    z1 and z2 (2.6 and 3.6 m for wine grapes and 2.8 and 3.8 m for table grapes),
    d is the zero plane displacement height (2/3 of the mean canopy height), k is
    the von Karman''s constant (0.41) and L is the Obukhov length, which was obtained
    by an iterative numerical method starting with a value of 106 m. The wind speed
    in table grapes was measured only at 2.8 m. The values at 3.8 m, necessary for
    solving u* in Eq. (7), were estimated by means of Hv and field measurements of
    ΔT considering initially neutral conditions solving ra in the following equation:
    (10) where ρa and cp are the air density and air specific heat at constant pressure.
    The first values for u* were then calculated by Eq. (8) using the height levels
    of 3.8 and 2.8 m. The resulted values of u* were used in Eq. (7) to obtain the
    wind speed at 3.8 m (u2). These calculations were performed first without using
    the stability correction terms Ψh and Ψm. The latent heat flux from the canopy
    (λEc) was acquired from transpiration fluxes (T). The continuous measurement of
    net radiation over and under the canopy made it possible to obtain the energy
    available to the soil surface (Rns) for table grape, as well to derive the amount
    absorbed by the canopy (Rnc = Rn − Rns). With known values of λEv, λEc and ra,
    the bulk surface (rs) and canopy (rc) resistances were estimated inverting the
    general Penman–Monteith equation (Farah, 2001): (11) where λEv,c is the latent
    heat flux from the vineyard (subscript ‘v’) or from the canopy (subscript ‘c’);
    sa (kPa °C−1) is the slope of the saturated vapour pressure curve, AE is the available
    energy ((Rn − G) or (Rn – Rns)), ρa (kg m−3) is the moist air density, cp (J kg−1
    K−1) is the air specific heat at constant pressure, VPD (kPa) is the vapour pressure
    deficit and γ (kPa °C−1) is the psychrometric constant and rs,c (s m−1) is the
    bulk surface (subscript ‘s’) or canopy (subscript ‘c’) resistance to water vapour
    transport. The leaf area index (LAI) was derived for table grape with the values
    of intercepted radiation (Teixeira and Lima Filho, 1997) and consideration of
    the inversion of Beer''s law: (12) Crop water productivity (CWP) is commonly expressed
    in yield per unit of applied water, including rainfall and irrigation (Peacock
    et al., 1977, Araujo et al., 1995, Srinivas et al., 1999). In this study, it was
    calculated as: (13) where the subscripts ET and T denote the water fluxes by evapotranspiration
    and transpiration, respectively; the subscript IRR denote the amount of water
    supplied by irrigation and Yact is the actual yield of wine or fruits. Following
    Droogers et al. (2000) and Bos et al. (2005), the economic indicators used were
    the standard gross value of production (wine and grapes) over the irrigation supply
    (CPW$_IRR) and over evapotranspiration (CPW$_ET) and transpiration (CPW$_T). 4.
    Results and discussion 4.1. Soil moisture and weather conditions The values of
    soil moisture (SM) are shown in Fig. 1. SM at 20 cm depth showed more variations
    with time, than at deeper soil layers in both vineyards. This is an expected result
    because of the dynamics of infiltration and subsequent depletion by root water
    uptake and soil evaporation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Soil
    moisture (SM) at different depths (20, 40 and 60 cm), during the growing cycles
    of 2002 of wine grape and for the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003 of table grape.
    The maximum values of SM in the wine grape were found at 60 cm depth pinpointing
    that moisture assembles in the lower root zone and is not easily drained away.
    This could be related to the increasing retention properties and reduced permeability
    at this soil depth. For table grape, the values are over against that maximal
    at 20 cm, which reveals typical free drainage conditions. SM varied during most
    days between 0.19 and 0.29 cm3 cm−3 in both vineyards, which is similar to the
    range those from Ortega-Farias et al. (2007) in Chile. A regular soil moisture
    trend line reflects a constant supply and removal of irrigation water. Water excess
    can arise if supply exceeds removal by root water uptake, what in wine grape,
    could adversely affect the production and quality of wine. This excess not only
    enhances the loss of scarce water resources but also valuable nutrients can be
    leached out from the root zone. July and October are the coldest and the warmest
    months of the year, respectively. The difference between the values of air temperature
    (Ta) near the canopies and at the routine agrometeorological station was small
    (see Fig. 2a and b). The seasonal average near-canopy Ta in wine grape was with
    26.5 °C, slightly higher than the 25.2 °C for table grape. The lower values in
    the last vineyard can be ascribed to the higher soil cover caused by the overhead
    trellis system and microsprinkler irrigation. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Daily values of weather variables during the study period in 2002 and
    2003 from agrometeorological station (station) and near the canopies of wine grape
    (wine) and table grape (table): (a and b) mean air temperature (Ta); (c and d)
    wind speed (W); (e and f) vapour pressure deficit (VPD); (g and h) incident global
    solar radiation (RG), reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and rainfall. The higher
    values of wind speed (W) in the study region normally happen during the driest
    period, between August and October, with longer term values reaching 3.0 m s−1
    in September. The lowest values occur during the rainy period with monthly average
    of 1.6 m s−1. The daily variations of W over the vineyards and at agrometeorological
    station are depicted in Fig. 2c and d. During 2002 and 2003, averaged daily values
    were above 0.8 m s−1 and lower than 3.0 m s−1 for both vineyards. The above-canopy
    wind speed measurements accounted for 80% of those from the station, which can
    be ascribed to differences in surface roughness. The high values of Ta together
    with the dryness of the air induce high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) conditions
    outside the rainy period. The monthly averaged relative humidity in the region
    ranges from 55 to 70%. The 24 h averaged values of VPD for the study period are
    plotted in Fig. 2e and f. Moister air near the canopy can be attributed to irrigation
    that raises the air humidity. This effect was greater in microsprinkler irrigation
    system of table grape than for the drip irrigation in wine grape. According to
    Fig. 2g and h, global solar radiation (RG) decreased in the first half of the
    year of 2002 and increased during the second halves of the years 2002 and 2003.
    ETo followed RG. Higher values of RG in the second half of 2002 established a
    slightly higher value for Ta and ETo, in comparison with the same period in 2003.
    ETo was 4.4 and 5.0 mm day−1 on average for the first and second halves of 2002,
    while it was 4.1 mm day−1 during the second half of 2003. The total rainfall during
    the first half of 2002 was 41.4 mm, and in the second half of the same year, it
    was 49.3 mm. It rained only 17.3 mm during the growing season of table grape in
    2003. 4.2. Energy partitioning The values of the components of the energy balances
    – and the latent heat flux from the vineyard (λEv) in particular – varied according
    to RG. The diurnal variation of these components for the period of measurements
    is depicted in Fig. 3. Maximum midday λEv were around 400–500 W m−2 for both vineyards.

    components during the growing cycles of wine grape in 2002 and for the growing
    seasons of 2002 and 2003 for table grape: net radiation (Rn); latent heat flux
    from the vineyard (λEv); sensible heat flux from the vineyard (Hv) and soil heat
    flux (G). The fluxes had a very smooth behaviour during daytime hours, with an
    exception for G in wine grape, which presented midmorning and midafternoon peaks
    and lower values at midday due to the canopy architecture, what is in agreement
    with Heilman et al. (1994). Daily averages of energy balances components for wine
    grape in 2002 are presented in Table 1. Rn was on average 46% of RG for both growing
    cycles. A fraction of approximately 50% is in agreement with earlier crop science
    radiation studies (e.g. Makkink, 1957, Oliver and Sene, 1992). Table 1. Daily

    accounted for 18% of Rn for both growing cycles of wine grape, being a modest
    heat flux. During the first cycle, the daily averaged G was negative because heat
    was released from the warm soil body. The opposite situation occurred during the
    second cycle. The largest portion of Rn was converted into λEv, which represented
    around 83 and 78% of Rn in the first and second growing cycles, respectively,
    corresponding to an evaporative fraction (EF = λEv/(Rn − G)) around 81%. Daily
    averages of energy balance components for table grape in 2002 and 2003 are presented
    in Table 2. Rn represented a fraction of 55% of RG, being higher than for wine
    grape; the overhead trellis and microsprinkler irrigation system promote lower
    both, albedo and longwave emission, increasing Rn. The measured albedo in wine
    grape in the actual study varied between 0.19 and 0.24. These values are higher
    than for microsprinkler irrigated table grape (0.18–0.23) reported by Azevedo
    et al. (1997). Table 2. Daily averages of the energy balance components for table

    conditions predominated above the table grape, with Hv representing around 12%
    of Rn. The averaged G was negative during both seasons, accounted for only 1%
    of Rn. The largest portion of Rn was also partitioned into λEv which representing
    91 and 87% of Rn in 2002 and 2003, respectively, corresponding to a mean EF of
    88%. Higher values of energy partition as λEv are explained by moister both, microclimatic
    and soil conditions in table grape than in wine grape. According to Scott et al.
    (2003), evaporative fraction also reflects the moisture conditions in the root
    zone. High EF values reveal that the crop is not water stressed, and that the
    soil is wet, what is confirmed from Fig. 1. Differences in the partition of the
    energy balance with different trellis and training systems in vineyards were also

    and Rana et al. (2004). 4.3. Evapotranspiration, transpiration and soil evaporation
    For the first growing cycle of wine grape (GC1), the average 24-h λEv of 8.00
    MJ m−2 day−1corresponded to an ET of 3.3 mm day−1. This value is similar to Heilman
    et al. (1996) in Texas (3.6 mm day−1) who also used a Bowen ratio system for measuring
    ET. During the second growing cycle (GC2), the average 24-h λEv increased to 9.30
    MJ m−2 day−1 being equivalent to 3.8 mm day−1. The accumulated ET values were
    438 and 517 mm, respectively, for GC1 and GC2, showing the seasonal effects (Table
    3). Table 3. Water use parameters for wine and table grapes: reference evapotranspiration

    MJ m−2 day−1 for table grape represented ET of 4.4 mm day−1 in 2002 and 3.9 mm
    day−1 in 2003, respectively. Higher daily ET values than in wine grape are due
    to the microsprinkler irrigation system, high soil cover and the transpiration
    from the cover crop of legumes and grasses at initial stages. Consequently, the
    crop coefficients are higher and resistance values are lower than for wine grape
    (Table 3). As the growing period of table grape is around 90 days only, the seasonal
    crop water consumption is with a mean value of 372 mm lower than for wine grape
    (478 mm). A review of international literature about water use in vineyards showed
    that the average ET rate from nine international field experiments is 3.0 mm day−1
    (Oliver and Sene, 1992, Evans et al., 1993, Heilman et al., 1996, Yunusa et al.,
    1997, Yunusa et al., 2004, Trambouze et al., 1998, Williams et al., 2003, Rana
    et al., 2004, Williams and Ayars, 2005a). The mean values of daily water consumption
    obtained in our study are, in general, greater than those from literature, however,
    Williams and Ayars (2005a) reported similar daily values of ET for cv. Thompson
    Seedless in Sao Joaquin Valley of California, when there was neither gibberellic
    acid (GA3) application nor trunk girdling, comparing with our 3-years-old Superior
    Seedless. On the other hand, as the growing seasons in our study area are shorter,
    the seasonal water consumption is lower. A recent water balance study in vineyards
    in South Africa (Roux, 2007) showed that the average value of seasonal ET for
    wine grape is 621 mm and for table grape is in the range from 519 to 827 mm. The
    length of the growing seasons in South Africa is between 6 and 8 months with only
    one harvest per year. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) can be corrected for climatic
    influences by normalizing it with ETo, producing the crop coefficients (Kc). The
    Kc values can be variable with the crop properties and stress conditions caused
    by water deficit and salinity. Under pristine conditions, maximum values can be
    taken, and they are often published in tables (e.g. Snyder et al., 1989, Consoli
    et al., 2006). The behaviour of daily Kc is demonstrated in Fig. 4. Note that
    our actual growing conditions also include few non-pristine environmental circumstances.
    The Kc values at the initial and the end stages are highly related to the cover
    crop and irrigation. For wine grape, the mean weekly values in the first growing
    cycle were in the range from 0.65 to 0.82, while for the second they were from
    0.63 to 0.87. For table grape, the mean weekly averaged Kc values for both growing
    seasons varied between 0.77 and 0.91. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    4. Seasonal variation of crop coefficients in vineyards during the growing cycles
    of 2002 of wine grape and for the growing seasons of table grape in 2002 and 2003:
    crop coefficients based on evapotranspiration (Kc), transpiration (Kcb) and soil
    evaporation (Ke). The seasonal trend of crop coefficients Kcb and Ke are also
    depicted in Fig. 4. After multiplying these coefficients by ETo, the transpiration
    (T) and soil evaporation (E) were obtained. On average, 89–90% of the total ET
    was used for T and 10–11% for E in wine grape. For table grape, 79–83% of ET was
    used for T and 17–19% for E (Table 3). Thus, microsprinklers have a higher portion
    of non-beneficial evaporation than drip systems. 4.4. Intercepted radiation, leaf
    area index and resistances Data availability of Rn above and under the canopy
    for table grape allowed the calculation of intercepted net radiation (Rni) and
    the estimation of leaf area index (LAI) for the two growing seasons following
    Eq. (12). The mean values of LAI were 0.70 during the first growing season and
    1.60 for the second (Table 3) pinpointing a situation of a young maturing vineyard.
    The last value of LAI is close to that found by Rana et al. (2004) for table grapes
    in Italy and by Yunusa et al. (2004) for mature Sultana grapes, growing in a T-trellis
    system in Australia. Klaasse et al. (2007) reported LAI values between 2.5 and
    3.0 for the table grapes and around 1.0 for wine grapes, in Hex River Valley,
    West Cape Province (South Africa). According to Katerji et al. (1994), LAI for
    vineyards in rows with a dominant vertical plant structure present value around
    0.70–0.80. There were no measurements of Rni to allow LAI estimations in wine
    grapes in the actual study. The seasonal variations of aerodynamic resistance
    (ra) and the surface (rs) and canopy (rc) resistances are shown in Fig. 5. Averaged
    values are found in Table 3. In wine grape, the values of ra stayed in the range
    from 78 to 170 s m−1, while for table grape, the range was from 30 to 160 s m−1.
    The lower ra values in the last vineyard can be related to the aerodynamic smoother
    horizontal trellis systems. A higher LAI and soil cover cause a shelter effect
    (e.g. Verhoef et al., 1997). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Seasonal
    trends of calculated aerodynamic (ra), surface (rs) and canopy resistances (rc),
    during the growing cycles of wine grape and for the growing seasons of table grape
    in 2002 and 2003. The rs values in wine grape were between 35 and 240 s m−1. For
    table grape, the range was from 10 to 140 s m−1. Heilman et al. (1994) found maximum
    values of rs of 50 and 75 s m−1. The canopy resistance (rc) for table grape in
    both years stayed between 20 and 182 s m−1. Assuming that the stomatal resistance
    (rst) can be roughly estimated by (0.5 × LAI × rs) as reported in several handbooks
    (Allen et al., 1998), the mean values of rst become 22 and 66 s m−1, for the first
    and second growing seasons, respectively (Table 3). Winkel and Rambal (1990) described
    the stomatal response of different French vineyards. The minimum rst was 73 s
    m−1 for Carignane, 93 s m−1 for Merlot and 114 s m−1 for Shiraz. According to
    them, the main reason for these differences could be attributed to different conditions
    of VPD, soil cover, soil moisture and evaporative demand. Ben-Asher et al. (2006)
    measured recently the rst of grapes under saline irrigation conditions in Israel,
    and they showed minimum values of 135 s m−1. The low values of rs, rc and rst
    in irrigated vineyards of semiarid conditions in Brazil are due to wet conditions
    for both, soil and air near the canopies. The magnitude of the differences between
    rs and rc in table grapes comparing the two growing seasons can be explained because
    for the younger vineyard in 2002, the lower intercepted radiation promoted the
    soil component to represent a relative large fraction of rs (Fig. 5). The accumulated
    values of ETo and ET; T and E; together with the mean values of Kc, Kcb and Ke;
    ra and rs are shown in Table 3. For table grape, the averaged values of LAI and
    rc are also presented. The different magnitudes of grape water parameters between
    the two vineyards are due to differences in crop stages, age and varieties, trellis
    and irrigation systems, soil cover and cultural management. 4.5. Crop water productivity
    Only a few studies relate yields of grapes and wine to ET that is the true consumptive
    use of vineyards. Organizations responsible for irrigation management are interested
    in yield per unit applied irrigation water (CWPIRR), as it is their duty to enhance
    yield through irrigation processes. The drawback is that not all irrigation water
    is used for generating crop production. Large portion of applied irrigation water
    turns into percolation losses (Table 4). The values of percolation were computed
    as the differences between rainfall, irrigation and ET, and there are no corrections
    made for soil storage changes. It is worrisome to note that the percolation rates
    had the same magnitude as ET. Table 4. Duration of growing seasons (d), market

    m−3) 0.80 1.28 7.82 A summary of all crop water productivity parameters for both
    vineyards is presented in Table 4. Wine yield values (3300–6600 L ha−1) are inside
    in what is expected to be normal practices in this region. The differences in
    yield of bottled wine between the first (3376 L ha−1) and the second growing cycles
    (6514 L ha−1) pinpoint seasonal effects. The first cycle was cloudier and duration
    of the days during the stages of flower and maturation of fruits were shorter
    than the in the second cycle. Although the productivity for one cycle of wine
    grape is lower than in regions where the climate is temperate, the total production
    of two cycles in 1 year is in good agreement with for instance South Africa (Roux,
    2007). Whereas the first cycle yielded an economical water productivity of 0.35,
    0.70 and US$ 0.80 m−3 based on irrigation, ET and T, respectively, these values
    for the second growing cycle increased to US$ 0.62, US$ 1.15 and US$ 1.28 m−3.
    The yield in 2002 for table grape was not marketable. Only the growing season
    in 2003 was analyzed for productivity purposes. The yield of fresh table grapes
    (11,200 kg ha−1) is in agreement with the public perception in the São Francisco
    river basin. At a double cycle, the yield could increase to 22.4 tonnes ha−1.
    The CWPET values for marketable table grape (3.18 kg m−3) were found to be lower
    than previous table grape studies with drip and furrow irrigation (Yunusa et al.,
    1997). Klaasse et al. (2007) reported a value of CWPET of 3.7 kg m−3 in South
    Africa. The economic water productivity performance for table grape was US$ 2.77,
    US$ 6.51 and US$ 7.82 m−3, for CWP$_IRR, CWP$_ET and CWP$_T, respectively. At
    an attractive market price of US$ 4.5 kg−1, the gross margin of production is
    in order of magnitude higher than for wine grape, however, the overall production
    costs for table grape are significantly higher; hence the differences in net income
    between table and wine grapes tend to be skimmed off. The difference between CWP$_ET
    and CWP$_T is higher for table grape than for wine grape, showing the better performance
    of drip system in comparison with microsprinkler irrigation. Sakthivadivel et
    al. (1999) compared standardized value of production per unit of water consumed
    of various crops, including vineyards from the Sarigol and Alasehim irrigation
    schemes in Turkey. They reported economic water productivity of raisin grapes
    is with US$ 0.39 m−3 (Sarigol) and US$ 0.47 m−3 (Alasehim) lower than for table
    and wine grapes. A gross return of several dollars per cubic meter of water depleted
    in vineyards of the semiarid region of São Francisco river basin is extremely
    high, and among the highest values of all crops in irrigated agriculture. 5. Conclusions
    Albedo, evaporative fractions, beneficial/non-beneficial water consumption, aerodynamic
    resistance, bulk surface resistance and canopy resistance were derived from the
    field data set and compared with the international literature. The results allowed
    expressing water consumption from vineyards in more specific bio-physical parameters,
    rather than in crop coefficients that lump together other crop water parameters.
    The seasonal evapotranspiration of table grape was less (352–393 mm) than for
    wine grape (438–517 mm). Water fluxes of grape crop in this semiarid region are
    essentially driven by solar radiation. The partitioning of available energy into
    latent heat flux in the two vineyards studied was found extremely constant throughout
    the crop stages due to a systematic over-irrigation that induces a continuous
    deep percolation flux. Microsprinklers increase the moisture content in soil and
    lower atmosphere, which turns the fraction of non-beneficial ET to 18%, comparing
    to 10% in drip systems. The water productivity of vineyards is extremely high,
    both bio-physically with values exceeding 3 kg harvestable fresh product per unit
    of water depleted, as well as economically. The economic water productivity based
    on evapotranspiration (CWP$_ET) exceed US$ 1 m−3 (for wine grape), up to US$ 6.51
    m−3 (for table grape). It is interesting to note that the economic return of South
    African wine grapes and table grapes shows the opposite behaviour, with high values
    of CWP$_ET for wine grapes. The crop water productivity analysis reveals that
    water is wisely used and creates a boost for the rural economy. Indeed, the Brazilian
    towns of Petrolina, PE and Juazeiro, BA, in low-middle São Francisco river basin,
    have tripled in terms of exports and job creation, and this is a good example
    of converting marginal savannah land into a booming rural development; however,
    the irrigation management requires full attention as significant percolation adversely
    affects environments in terms of rising water tables and return flow of polluted
    water to the river. Acknowledgements The research herein was supported by CAPES

    adopts advanced technology and the corresponding principles to increase the amount
    of production and economic returns, often also with the goal to reduce the impact
    on the environment. One of the key elements of smart farming is the farm management
    information systems (FMISs) that supports the automation of data acquisition and
    processing, monitoring, planning, decision making, documenting, and managing the
    farm operations. An increased number of FMISs now adopt internet of things (IoT)
    technology to further optimize the targeted business goals. Obviously IoT systems
    in agriculture typically have different functional and quality requirements such
    as choice of communication protocols, the data processing capacity, the security
    level, safety level, and time performance. For developing an IoT-based FMIS, it
    is important to design the proper architecture that meets the corresponding requirements.
    To guide the architect in designing the IoT based farm management information
    system that meets the business objectives a systematic approach is provided. To
    this end a design-driven research approach is adopted in which feature-driven
    domain analysis is used to model the various smart farming requirements. Further,
    based on a FMIS and IoT reference architectures the steps and the modeling approaches
    for designing IoT-based FMIS architectures are described. The approach is illustrated
    using two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart wheat production
    in Konya, and the other for smart green houses in Antalya. Similar content being

    Internet of Things (IoT), Applications and Challenges: A Comprehensive Review
    Article 28 May 2020 Introduction Smart farming represents the application of modern
    information and communication technologies (ICT) into agriculture to increase
    the amount of production and economic returns, often also with the goal to reduce
    the impact on the environment (Rains and Thomas 2009). Similar terms are used
    for the same purpose such as precision agriculture, site-specific farming, site-specific
    crop management, prescription farming, and satellite farming (Adamchuk et al.
    2004; Zhang et al. 2002). Smart farming builds on advanced technology such as
    cloud computing, remote sensing, data-driven farming, big data analytics and internet
    of things (IoT). Several important benefits of smart farming have been provided
    in the literature including optimizing production efficiency, optimizing quality
    of the crop, minimizing environmental impact, minimizing risk, conservation of
    resources, reducing cost, increasing profit, and better management decisions (Sørensen
    et al. 2010, 2011; Rains and Thomas 2009; Zhang et al. 2002). One of the key elements
    of the smart farming is the farm management information system (FMIS). Although
    initially FMISs started as simple record keeping systems, modern FMISs are sophisticated
    systems with advanced modules supporting a comprehensive set of farming operations
    (Fountas et al. 2015). With the introduction of IoT, FMIS and smart farming in
    general have gained a new momentum. The IoT helps in smart and automated information
    gathering and merging. It helps as well as in monitoring sensor data coming from
    different machines, animals, plants, other farms and greenhouses and other systems
    such as unmanned air and land vehicles. In this way, the decision making and planning
    in the agricultural domain can be further supported which can lead to even more
    effective and efficient farming. With the help of the IoT, farming practices such
    as yield monitoring, cultivar selection, pest management, irrigation, etc. can
    be applied more precisely. Crop yield can be monitored and precise crop maps which
    show high and low production areas can be obtained readily (Rains and Thomas 2009).
    For developing an IoT-based FMIS it is important to design the proper IoT architecture
    which represents the overall gross level structure of the system. IoT based farm
    management information systems typically have different functional requirements
    such as the type of crop, the type of sensors, communication protocols, and the
    data processing capacity. Besides of functional requirements also quality requirements
    such as security level, safety level, time performance, and overall cost of development
    and operation are also different for different applications. The different requirements
    typically require changing the IoT architecture. In the literature, several reference
    architectures for FMISs and IoT have been proposed that can be reused to derive
    the IoT application architecture. Deriving the proper architecture however is
    far from trivial and this can impede the success of the IoT system. The objective
    of this study is to contribute to the current state-of-the-art of FMISs by enhancing
    the current architecture design approaches for IoT-based FMIS. Hereby, the study
    aims to provide an architecture design method for designing IoT-based FMISs. The
    approach presented adopts a feature-driven domain analysis approach to model the
    different smart farming requirements. Further, based on FMIS and IoT reference
    architectures the steps and the modeling approaches for designing the IoT-based
    FMIS architecture are described. The approach is illustrated using two case studies
    on smart farming in Turkey, one for developing IoT-based FMIS for smart wheat
    production in Konya, and the other for smart green houses in Antalya. Background
    and related work Internet of things (IoT) Until recent time, the internet was
    primarily used for interconnecting computers any time and any place but this required
    human interaction and monitoring. The IoT is a new paradigm that adds a dimension
    to the current information and communications technologies (ICTs), whereby the
    dimension “Anything communication” is added to the communication capabilities.
    The IoT enables anytime, anyplace connectivity for anything, by linking the objects
    of the real world with the virtual world. In the IoT world physical things and
    virtual things, all interact with each other in the same space and time. Since
    the IoT is the result of technological progress in many fields such as wireless
    sensor networks, machine-to-machine communication, mobile computing, ubiquitous
    computing, and embedded systems, the term “IoT” might have different meanings.
    Many definitions of IoT can be found in the literature, but the IoT is defined
    by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as “the network of physical
    objects or ‘things’ embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network
    connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data”. Here
    “thing” is defined as: an object of the physical world (physical things) or the
    information world (virtual things), which is capable of being identified and integrated
    into communication networks (ITU 2005). McEwen and Cassimally (2014) formulate
    the IoT with a simple equation as: “Physical Object + Controller, Sensor, and
    Actuators + Internet = IoT”. The IoT is the result of technological progress in
    many parallel and often overlapping fields, including those of embedded systems,
    ubiquitous and pervasive computing, mobile telephony, telemetry and machine-to-machine
    communication, wireless sensor networks, mobile computing, and computer networking.
    What is important is that IoT adds a dimension to the current ICTs, which already
    provide “any time” and “any place” communication. Various reference architectures
    have been provided for the IoT. In general, IoT architecture is represented as
    a layered architecture. In this case a “layer” simply represents a grouping of
    modules that offers a cohesive set of services. Based on the literature (Al-Fuqaha
    et al. 2015; Pandya and Champaneria 2015; Gazis et al. 2015; Palattella et al.
    2013; Sheng et al. 2013) the reference architecture is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1
    IoT reference architecture Full size image The reference architecture includes
    the following layers: device, network, session, application, business, management
    and security. The device layer consists of sensors and physical devices. This
    layer identifies and collects data and specific information generated by sensors
    and physical devices. The data gathered is passed to the network layer. In essence
    the device layer bridges the gap between the physical world and the digital world.
    The network layer provides functionality for networking connectivity and transport
    capabilities. This layer is also called transport layer. This layer securely transmits
    data gathered from sensors to the session layer. The transmission medium can be
    wired or wireless. The session layer is responsible for service management and
    consists of functionality for setting up and taking down of the association between
    the IoT connection points. Several session layer standards and protocols are offered
    by different organizations. Although most of these standards and protocols use
    the transmission control protocol (TCP) or the user datagram protocol (UDP) for
    transport, they have different architectures and characteristics for various purposes.
    The application layer contains the IoT services and manages the system using the
    data from the session layer. The implemented IoT application can be, for example,
    smart farming, smart city, and smart home. The business layer defines business
    logic and workflows. This layer is responsible for the management of all IoT systems,
    services and applications within the domain. The business models are defined in
    this layer based on the data gathered from the application layer. The data is
    analyzed to build the required business models and define the strategies. The
    security layer is a side-car layer relating to the other five layers and provides
    the security functionality. Similarly, the management layer is a side-car layer
    supporting capabilities such as device management, local network topology management,
    and traffic and congestion management (Köksal and Tekinerdogan 2017; Khan et al.
    2012). Architecture design Software architecture for a program or computing system
    consists of the structure or structures of that system, which comprise elements,
    the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among
    them (Venters et al. 2018; Tekinerdogan 2014; Bass et al. 2012; Clements et al.
    2010). Software architecture forms one of the key artifacts in the entire software
    development life cycle since it embodies the earliest design decisions and includes
    the gross-level components that directly impact the subsequent analysis, design
    and implementation (Apel et al. 2013). It is generally accepted that software
    architecture design plays a fundamental role in coping with the inherent difficulties
    of the development of large-scale and complex software. Research on architecture
    design in the last two decades has resulted in different useful techniques and
    approaches. Architectural drivers define the concerns of the stakeholders. A stakeholder
    is defined as an individual, team, or organization with interests in, or concerns
    relative to, a system. Each of the stakeholders’ concerns impacts the early design
    decisions that the architect makes. A common practice is to model different “architectural
    views” for describing the design according to the stakeholders’ concerns (Tekinerdogan
    2014; Demirli and Tekinerdogan 2011; Clements et al. 2010). An architectural view
    is a representation of a set of system elements and relations associated with
    them to support a particular concern (Clements et al. 2010). Having multiple views
    helps to separate the concerns and as such support the modeling, understanding,
    communication and analysis of the software architecture for different stakeholders.
    Architectural views conform to viewpoints that represent the conventions for constructing
    and using such a representation. An architectural framework organizes and structures
    the proposed viewpoints. A recent software architecture framework approach is
    the so-called Views and Beyond (V&B) approach (Clements et al. 2010). The approach
    distinguishes three different categories of viewpoints or styles including module,
    component-and-connector, and allocation styles: “Module” view category that is
    used for documenting a system’s principal units of implementation. “Component
    and Connector” category that is used for documenting the system’s units of execution.
    “Deployment View” category that is used to document the relationships between
    a system’s software and its development and execution environments. A software
    architecture that addresses the concerns of specific stakeholders is here referred
    to as “concrete architecture”. A concrete architecture defines the boundaries
    and constraints for the implementation and is used to analyze risks, balance trade-offs,
    plan the implementation project and allocate tasks (Tekinerdogan 2014). Concrete
    architectures can be viewed as specific implementations of “reference architectures”,
    which are generic designs. In turn, a reference architecture is derived from the
    knowledge and experiences accumulated in designing concrete architectures in the
    past (Cloutier et al. 2010; Angelov et al. 2012). The concrete architectures differ
    from one case to the next depending on the requirements of the stakeholders involved.
    Reference architectures can be used descriptively to “capture the essence of existing
    architectures” or prescriptively to guide the development of new ones (Cloutier
    et al. 2010). Related work Several studies discuss the adoption of internet technologies
    to support FMIS (Kruize et al. 2016; Fountas et al. 2015; Kaloxylos et al. 2012;
    Steinberger et al. 2009; Nikkilä et al. 2010; Sørensen et al. 2010; Wolfert et
    al. 2010; Seelan et al. 2003; Murakami et al. 2007). These studies have focused
    on different issues including the adoption of service-oriented architectures for
    FMIS (Murakami et al. 2007; Steinberger et al. 2009; Wolfert et al. 2010), the
    development of data exchange standards for supporting interoperability over the
    internet (Schmitz et al. 2009), and the adoption and implementation of geographic
    information systems (GIS) (Seelan et al. 2003). The main focus of these studies
    is integration and operation of an FMIS over the internet. The integration and
    adoption of IoT in the FMIS is not explicitly considered. In (Murakami et al.
    2007), a distributed service-oriented reference architecture is proposed for the
    development of information systems for precision agriculture. This web-based approach
    is focused on communication between software on a service bus. In (Schmitz et
    al. 2009), the so-called AgroXML is proposed as a standardized language based
    on extensible markup language (XML) to be used for data exchange in FMIS. In Nikkilä
    et al. (2010), a web-based approach is defined to implement connectivity requirements
    arising from the internet and the management of GIS data. In (Sørensen et al.
    2010), a new model for FMIS is proposed to provide better information handling
    focusing on internal data connection, external information collection, plan generation,
    and report generation in FMIS. In Kaloxylos et al.(2012), an architecture is proposed
    to provide support and integration of different stakeholders and services, and
    interworking with the external services. There are some studies in the literature
    related to web-based architectures (Steinberger et al. 2009; Chaudhary et al.
    2004). These studies present architectures to enhance the effectiveness of web-based
    decision support system on which data can be requested for further use via a web
    portal and a web service interface. Instead of full FMIS most architecture academic
    research on FMIS is restricted to individual component of an FMIS such as predicting
    crop yield, implementing a special sensor, and the usability of an FMIS. There
    are only few studies that explicitly discuss FMIS architectures in a comprehensive
    manner (Nikkilä et al. 2010). For example, in (Linseisen 2001), FMIS architecture
    is discussed by focusing on an information system gathering and storing high accuracy
    GPS data. In Beck (2001), an architecture, based on implementing object databases
    such as common object request broker architecture (CORBA) middleware and Java
    languages is proposed to provide easier development, maintenance, and easier integration
    of information systems. Advances in the functionality of academic and commercial
    FMIS are presented in (Fountas et al. 2015). This study investigates commercial
    and academic FMIS packages and performs a cluster analysis on them. The authors
    indicate that commercial packages tend to target daily farm office tasks such
    as budgeting, finance, recordkeeping, machinery management, and documentation.
    On the other hand, academic FMISs deal with compliance to standards, automated
    data capture, and interoperability issues. There are also studies that discuss
    traditional on-site FMIS software. However, these studies mainly focus on the
    improvement of information integration of traditional FMIS and do not take IoT
    technologies into account. For example, Verdouw et al. (2016), propose an architecture
    to improve the standardization and integration of data, application, and process.
    A service-oriented architecture (SOA) based solution is proposed to improve the
    information integration implementing business process management (BMP). Related
    to IoT is the research on wireless sensor networks which is reviewed in Jawad
    et al. (2017) and Aqeel-Ur-Rehman et al. (2014). These studies primarily focused
    on comparing sensors and communication technologies such as ZigBee, Bluetooth,
    Wifi, Sigfox, Wibree, long range radio and GPRS. Although these protocols might
    increase the number of possibilities to communicate data in IoT, these studies
    do not directly offer design solutions for FMIS. This paper has focused on applying
    IoT for FMIS in particular. However, IoT has also been applied in different application
    domains. The application of IoT in agriculture has been reviewed in Verdouw et
    al. (2016). This review showed that the IoT concept captured the attention of
    the scientific community in 2010 and since then number of studies has continuously
    increased. In total 168 papers and books were reviewed in the paper. The identified
    top topics of these studies include food supply chains, arable farming, general
    agriculture, greenhouse horticulture, and livestock farming, and open-air horticulture
    including orchards. On the other hand, it is stated that IoT applications mostly
    focus on basic functionalities, including tracking, tracing, monitoring, and event
    management. It is concluded that although IoT is receiving an increasing level
    of attention, it is still in its infancy in the agriculture and food domain which
    is suffering from lack seamless integration and advanced solutions. Case studies
    and problem statement In this section, the problem statement is presented that
    is illustrated using two case studies of smart farming in Turkey. The case studies
    have been selected based on their relevance and their difference with respect
    to the functional and quality requirements. The case studies include the development
    of IoT-based FMIS for wheat production and tomato production in Turkey. In the
    following, first the details of each case study are presented, and subsequently
    the problem statement is described. Case study: wheat production Turkey has 23.9
    million hectares of cultivated farms. Grain production occupies 49% of this area.
    Wheat production constitutes 67% of the total grain production (Turkish Land Crop
    Office 2017). Turkey’s wheat production is about 20 million tons yearly (Turkish
    Ministry of Agriculture 2018). As such, wheat production is one of the most important
    agriculture businesses in Turkey. One of the key regions of wheat production in
    Turkey is the region of Konya which is far from costal area and located on a major
    plain near the middle of Turkey. Konya has a terrestrial climate, and big arable
    farms. Konya is the region in Turkey with the largest wheat production. It produces
    3 million tons of wheat yearly. Case study: tomato production in greenhouses The
    second case study is of tomato production in greenhouses in Antalya. Tomato production
    in the world is 170 million tons yearly and almost 12 million tons of this production
    is produced in Turkey. Turkey exports tomatoes and tomato products to many countries.
    The total export is about 600 000 tons. Tomato is produced both in open fields
    and in greenhouses. About 51% of greenhouse production in Turkey is tomato. Antalya
    is located in the south of Turkey just north of the Mediterranean coast. The typical
    Mediterranean climate of the region is suitable for vegetable and fruit production.
    Currently, specialty greenhouse farming is very common in Antalya. Some 80% of
    glass greenhouses and 50% of plastic greenhouses of Turkey are in Antalya. Problem
    description Generally, wheat and tomato are produced with traditional farming
    practices in Konya and Antalya regions. A general observation from governmental
    reports is that a small part of the farmers in these regions use traditional FMIS
    (Turkish Ministry of Agriculture 2018). Even with the use of FMISs several problems
    in the agricultural sector could still be identified. Inefficient crop production
    To meet the growing population in Turkey it is important to increase the crop
    production, which requires a more effective and efficient crop production. According
    to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TSI), Turkey is one of the top 10 wheat
    producers in the world. But this production is not sufficient for Turkey’s growing
    internal demand. In order to compensate the need, Turkey imports more than 4 million
    tons of wheat each year. From the efficiency point (tons/hectare) of view improvements
    are required and possible. Turkey’s average wheat yield is about 2.6 tons/ha.
    Inefficient usage of soil Turkey has 2.2 million farmers, and 23.9 million hectares
    cultivated farms but 17% of arable farms are fallow (Turkish Ministry of Agriculture
    2018). One of the reasons for this is due to lack of insight and support regarding
    decision making on crop production, soil fertilization, and pesticide management.
    Increase in cost of farming inputs In the last years the cost of fertilizers,
    fuel and pesticides have dramatically increased, but the usage of these inputs
    has not been effectively monitored. This has adversely affected farming and greenhouse
    production profit. As a result of this, the number of farmers in these domains
    have decreased and the overall production has declined. To solve these problems,
    better monitoring and management of inputs is required to decrease the overall
    costs. These problems can, to some extent, be tackled by focusing on improved
    business and logistics processes, by applying total quality and smart farming
    principles, and appropriate sensing and effector technologies. Yet, these solutions
    remain limited compared to the adoption of IoT that provides further optimization
    by enabling the integration of various technologies such as (wireless) sensor
    networks, mobile computing, cloud network, data analytics, and decision support
    systems. To cope with these problems IoT can be considered a feasible solution
    (Dlodlo and Kalezhi 2015; Ma et al. 2011). IoT enables the use of sensors to measure
    the required parameters (e.g. soil quality), support the decision-making process
    using services such as data analytics, and use actuators to execute the proper
    action at the right time and right place. This is for example the case for the
    wheat and tomato production that has been described in the previous sections.
    With the introduction of IoT several benefits are envisioned. Firstly, determining
    the variability in yield potential might allow optimizing production at each site.
    With the help of smart farming practices such as site-specific soil nutrition
    management, quality of the soil can be improved. Also, pest management allows
    mapping pest populations and obtaining site-specific application maps reducing
    pesticide usage and minimizing environmental impact. Managing farming practices
    and obtaining profit maps can help reducing the risk in agriculture. Better irrigation,
    fertilization practices, and pest management strategies save resources. Crop production
    problems can be solved more precisely and in less time with smart farming. Further,
    long term data can be collected and analyzed, leading to better strategic management
    decisions. Saving input materials and resources enables reducing labor requirements
    and cost. Finally, reducing cost and improving quality will increase profits obtained.
    So far with the existing FMIS these goals could not be fully realized or are only
    achieved to a limited extent. Although IoT promises to be very worthwhile, it
    is not easy to develop an IoT-based FMIS. In the literature, various different
    reference architectures have been proposed for both IoT and FMIS. Recently, the
    two concepts are further integrated leading to an IoT based FMIS architecture.
    Unfortunately, deriving a concrete application architecture for the specific farming
    situation is far from trivial. This is because the existing architectures are
    usually represented as reference architectures that are too abstract and do not
    consider further details that are required to derive the application architecture.
    To derive the concrete architecture for a particular context, the different features
    of FMIS and IoT should be selected. This includes for example the different management
    functionality, the security protocols, the device communication protocols, and
    the cloud services. For each of these many different selections can be made and
    the combination of these leads to a broad design space. Obviously, given a description
    for the smart farming system many different architecture alternatives can be identified.
    Since the architecture has a direct systemic impact on the overall IoT based smart
    farming it is important to derive the proper architecture to meet the overall
    smart farming requirements of the stakeholders. For guiding the architect in deriving
    the customized concrete architecture a systematic approach is necessary. FMIS
    development method In Fig. 2, the proposed development approach for deriving an
    IoT-based FMIS application architecture is shown. The approach consists of two
    basic activities including Domain Engineering and FMIS Development. In essence,
    the approach is based on the product line engineering process as described in
    the literature (Tüzün et al. 2015; Capilla et al. 2014; Apel et al. 2013). Fig.
    2 FMIS development approach Full size image The Domain Engineering activity focuses
    on developing and preparing the development artefacts (e.g. design and code) for
    the FMIS. The first step includes the development of an IoT FMIS family feature
    model that defines the common and variant features of the different FMISs. The
    subsequent step focuses on developing the reference architecture for IoT based
    FMIS. The final step in the domain engineering activity aims to develop the reusable
    components that will be necessary to develop the FMIS based on the reference architecture.
    The following sections elaborate on the development of the family feature model
    and then present the corresponding reference architecture. The FMIS development
    activity focuses on a specific IoT-based FMIS. The FMIS will be developed based
    on reuse of the artefacts in the domain engineering activity. The first step in
    the application engineering includes the selection of the features of the application.
    Further, the features will include both features for the IoT and the FMIS. These
    will be usually different for different FMISs in different contexts. Based on
    the selected features the specific FMIS application architecture will be developed
    starting from the reference architecture of the domain engineering activity. The
    final step includes the implementation of the FMIS. In this final step, the components
    developed earlier in the domain engineering activity will be reused. Very often
    a simulation system can be developed for FMIS to validate the system before deciding
    on the large-scale investment. Family feature model The first step of the domain
    engineering activity of the proposed approach in Fig. 2 is the development of
    a family feature diagram for IoT-based FMIS. A feature diagram is a tree that
    is used to model the commonalities and differences within a specific domain or
    system. The feature diagram includes a root node representing the domain or system
    that features the essential characteristics or externally visible properties of
    the system (Tekinerdogan et al. 2012). Features may have sub-features which can
    lead to a hierarchical tree. Features can be mandatory or variant. Variant features
    are usually represented as optional or alternative features. Optional features
    can be selected or not, whereby alternative features require the selection of
    one of the defined features. A feature configuration is a set of features which
    describes a member of a communication protocol. A feature constraint further restricts
    the possible selection of features to define configurations. The domain analysis
    consists of two basic activities including domain scoping and domain modeling.
    In the scoping process, the domain scope is defined and the set of knowledge sources
    are selected. In the domain modeling process the feature diagram is provided.
    During the domain scoping process for the IoT based FMIS, not only scientific
    papers but also websites and white papers of the important vendors and stakeholders
    in the IoT and smart farming domains have been considered. The selected list of
    important sources that were considered for IoT are shown in Appendix 1, the list
    of sources for smart farming are shown in Appendix 2. It is not claimed that the
    set of sources is comprehensive but an analysis of these selected studies shows
    a convergence and agreement on the concepts. In the following section the feature
    diagram for IoT is described first followed by a description of the feature diagram
    for smart farming. Feature model for IoT Based on the primary studies given in
    Appendix 1, the top-level feature diagram of the IoT as given in Fig. 3 is obtained.
    In essence, the top-level figure diagram presents the design features and as such
    includes the mandatory features for the layers of the earlier defined IoT reference
    architecture in Fig. 1. The feature diagram states that all the layers are mandatory
    for setting up an IoT system. Fig. 3 Top level feature diagram of IoT Full size
    image For each of the layers a detailed feature diagram that represents the commonalities
    and variability for the corresponding layer can be derived. Among the IoT layers
    it appears that the decisive layer is the session layer that includes the protocols
    for initiating the connection and the further communication session. Figure 4
    shows the feature diagram that was derived from the domain analysis to the IoT
    session layer communication protocols. Fig. 4 Feature diagram of session level
    communication protocols of IoT Full size image The top-level mandatory features
    in the feature diagram are protocol type, source-target, transport type and architecture.
    The protocol type feature defines the protocols that were identified from the
    selected primary studies. These identified protocols are the following: Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT): One of the most popular protocols to collect
    device data and communicate with servers (OASIS 2011). Extensible Messaging and
    Presence Protocol (XMPP): is based on exchanges of XML messages in real time that
    is defined to connect devices to servers (IETF 2011). Advanced Message Queuing
    Protocol (AMQP): A queuing system designed to connect servers to each other (OASIS
    2011). Data Distribution Service (DDS): A fast data bus for integrating devices
    and systems (OMG 2015). The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): A specialized
    web-based protocol to be used in constrained nodes and constrained networks (IETF
    2011). As given in Fig. 4, there are three types of source-target relations available
    in session layer protocols: Device-to-Device (D2D), Device-to-Server (D2S), and
    Server-to-Server (S2S). In some studies, these features are also called Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M), Machine-to-Cloud (M2C), and Cloud-to-Cloud (C2C) respectively. Session
    layer protocols are closely related to the network layer. For all communication
    protocols, the transport layer could be either the user datagram protocol (UDP)
    or transmission control protocol (TCP). Some protocols like DDS, support both
    UDP and TCP. The addressing scheme (unicast, broadcast, or multicast) might be
    important depending on the application requirements. The selection of network
    layer protocol is important since using TCP and/or UDP changes the characteristics
    of the communication from performance and security perspectives. The layer below
    the network layer, that is the device layer includes the IoT devices that have
    a direct connection with the physical devices. The physical devices have different
    functionality and transmission range. If low power devices and networks will be
    used, adoption of TCP in the network layer is generally less feasible, and likewise
    the UDP protocol is used instead. On the other hand, TCP is required for supporting
    security and the common security protocols of (SSL/TLS) are not available using
    UDP. The architecture of the session layer protocols can be either publish-subscribe
    or request-reply. In publish-subscribe architecture, participants (e.g. sensors)
    send data to a topic on which several subscribers (e.g. cloud software) that are
    registered to this topic might read data. In this architecture publishers and
    subscribers do not need to know each other, and do not need to be operating at
    the same time, i.e. this communication type provides time and space uncoupling.
    This type of communication is well suited for data that must flow from one producer
    to many consumers. On the other hand, for the request-reply architecture, senders
    and receivers do need to know each other. The requester sends a request message
    and waits for the response. When the replier (e.g. sensor) receives the request,
    it responds with a reply message. The session layer protocols of IoT generally
    use publish-subscribe architecture except in the case of CoAP in which a request-reply
    pattern is adopted. There are many criteria to select the right IoT session layer
    protocol depending on the application requirement. Further information on the
    selection of the proper IoT session layer protocol is provided in (Köksal and
    Tekinerdogan 2017). Feature model for farm management information systems For
    IoT based smart farming the other important domain is of smart farming itself.
    Similar to the IoT domain again a domain analysis process has been applied in
    which relevant primary studies on smart farming were searched and based on these
    selected studies a feature diagram was derived representing the common and variant
    features. The selected primary studies are listed in Appendix 2. Based on the
    literature the following sub-domains for smart farming could be identified: (1)
    Global Positioning Systems (GPS), (2) Geographical Information Systems (GIS),
    (3) Sensors, (4) Variable Rate Technology (VRT), (5) Yield Monitoring (YM), (6)
    Yield Mapping (YMAP), and (7) Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS). FMIS
    software is a core part of the smart farming. FMISs are used to collect and process
    data used to manage all farming operations. The top-level feature diagram for
    FMIS is given in Fig. 5. The right part of the feature diagram has been derived
    from the FMIS functions as defined in (Fountas et al. 2015). The left part focuses
    on the IoT related functionality of FMIS including collection of data, processing
    data, visualization of data, communication with external systems, and system management.
    This paper will further focus on the IoT FMIS aspects. Fig. 5 Top level feature
    diagram of FMIS Full size image The data acquisition feature defines the gathering
    of data from sensors and other systems used in smart farming such as tractors,
    agribots and unmanned vehicles. It includes functions for processing the gathered
    data whereby useful information is extracted using data mining, machine learning,
    and image processing. The data visualization feature defines the displaying of
    processed data in different forms. Apart from classical tables, reports, and monitoring
    tools, dedicated visualization maps are essential for smart farming applications.
    Maps such as yield maps, soil maps, lighting maps, and profit maps are displayed
    for different purposes. The system management feature defines the management of
    data acquisition, processing, visualization, and external system communication
    features of FMIS. The quality related functions such as reliability, scalability,
    extensibility, and security are considered in this feature. Finally, the “communication
    with external systems” feature defines the communication with external systems,
    such as a weather forecast system. Each of these features are shown in a different
    color in Fig. 5 to refer to these in later sections. Feature model for IoT based
    FMIS In principle, IoT and FMIS are independent concepts and as such these have
    been modeled separately in the previous sub-sections. In principle the features
    from the IoT feature diagram and the features from the FMIS feature diagram could
    have been selected. Alternatively, the notion of an IoT based FMIS can be considered
    as the integration of both concepts that needs to be separately considered. To
    this end, Fig. 6 shows the integrated family feature diagram derived from the
    feature models for IoT and FMIS. The focus was on FMIS as the dominant decomposition
    and the IoT features were integrated in the separate leaves of the FMIS feature
    tree. In the figure for different type of features different fill patterns have
    been used. The detailed feature diagram given in Fig. 6 can in principle be further
    extended with respect to specific project requirements. For the context of this
    paper though, the provided feature models are sufficient to illustrate the approach.
    Fig. 6 Family feature diagram of FMIS software Full size image In IoT based FMIS,
    data acquisition consists of IoT data acquisition and conventional data acquisition
    to support legacy systems. IoT data acquisition contains 5 alternative IoT session
    layer protocols as discussed earlier namely MQTT, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, and CoAP. Depending
    on the application one or more protocols for IoT communication can be selected
    for the FMIS. In the earlier section the criteria for this have been described.
    A traditional data acquisition feature consists of ISOBUS and controller area
    network (CAN) protocols. As stated before, other (legacy or non-IoT) protocols
    can be added to the feature diagram. Data processing features mainly depend on
    the application type and include Image/Video processing, data mining, data logging,
    and decision-support features. One or more features might be used at the same
    time. Depending on the application requirements these features can be extended
    to use different processing features. Data visualization consists of monitoring
    and mapping functions. Monitoring consists of environment monitoring and yield
    monitoring functions. Mapping includes yield, soil-type, and light mapping features.
    System management includes sensor control, actuator control, system control features
    such as device identification, node discovery, and directory and naming services.
    Sensor control consists of several sub-features such as soil sensing, light sensing,
    weather sensing, and water sensing. Also, system control includes vehicle control
    and UAV/Drone control features. Finally, external services feature contains externally
    communicated systems such as weather forecast, finance services, and other external
    systems. Reference architecture for FMIS Once the family feature models for IoT
    based FMISs have been developed, the next step is the development of the reference
    architecture for the potential systems. In fact, in the literature several reference
    architectures have already been proposed for FMISs (Nikkilä et al. 2010; Sørensen
    et al. 2010, 2011; Beck 2001; Fountas et al. 2006) However, in general these reference
    architectures are either at a conceptual level and/or do not consider IoT aspects
    explicitly. Hence, in this section, the reference architecture for IoT based FMIS
    will be introduced. For this, selected viewpoints of the Views and Beyond architecture
    framework (Clements et al. 2010) will be used including the decomposition viewpoint,
    layered viewpoint and deployment viewpoint. Decomposition view The decomposition
    view is used to show how system responsibilities are partitioned across modules
    and how these modules are decomposed into sub-modules. Usually, the features in
    the feature diagram are realized by one or more modules in the decomposition view.
    The decomposition view of the architecture depicts the overall structure of the
    architecture which is reasonably decomposed into modular implementation units.
    It is regarded as a fundamental view of the architecture since it serves as an
    input for other views (e.g. work allocation view) and helps to communicate and
    define the structure of the software. The proposed reference decomposition view
    for the IoT based FMIS is given in Fig. 7. The modules in the decomposition view
    are colored to make the link with the earlier defined features in the feature
    diagrams of FMIS. In essence, the decomposition view includes the modules for
    data acquisition, data processing, data visualization, system management, and
    modules for communication with external services. The decomposition view includes
    all the possible modules for the various IoT based FMIS applications. Note that
    in this case for each feature in the earlier feature diagram, one module has been
    defined in the decomposition view. Further the lower level functionalities such
    as node discovery, and directory and name services, have not been depicted. The
    following section explains the configuration of a specific decomposition view
    from this reference decomposition view. Fig. 7 IoT based FMIS—decomposition view
    Full size image Layered view The layered view is similar to decomposition view
    since it reflects the division of software into units. The difference is that
    in a layered view, modules are structured into layers, which interact based on
    a strict ordering relation. This means that if layer A is allowed to use layer
    B, layer A’s implementation can use any public facilities of Layer B. However,
    layer B cannot use any facilities of layer A. Figure 8 shows the layered view
    for the IoT-based FMIS. Here the dominant decomposition is taken from the IoT
    layered view as it was given in Fig. 1, and likewise it includes the same layers
    of the IoT reference architecture. The specific details are primarily in the higher-level
    layers including the business layer, the application layer and the data acquisition
    layer. The FMIS business layer includes all required farm management operations
    logic and workflows such as Fertility Management, Nutrient Management, Pest Management,
    Weed Management, and Irrigation Management. The FMIS application layer includes
    FMIS Data Processing, Data Visualization, System Management, and Communication
    with External Systems. The FMIS Data Acquisition Layer is for data adaptation
    between the IoT session layer and FMIS, i.e. this layer provides the connection
    with the session layer protocols of the IoT. As such, this layer includes the
    IoT session layer interfaces such as MQTT interface, and XMPP interface. To support
    non-IoT systems, the module conventional interface also takes place in this layer.
    Fig. 8 IoT based FMIS—layered view Full size image Deployment view The earlier
    defined views (decomposition, layered) focus on modeling the software modules
    of the IoT-based FMIS. The deployment view elaborates on these views and is used
    to show the allocation of the identified software modules to the hardware of a
    computing platform. The deployment view of an IoT based FMIS is given in Fig.
    9. The data processing module is deployed on the Central Cloud Server and Client
    (Farmer) nodes. The other nodes are dedicated to sensors, actuators, and cameras.
    The main sensors in the UAV/Drone and Satellite are cameras. Vehicles can have
    their own sensors, actuators, and cameras. Hence, these items can be assigned
    to different nodes. Fig. 9 IoT based FMIS—deployment view Full size image Case
    study evaluation Case study protocol The primary objective of the case studies
    is to evaluate the impact of the developed architecture design method for IoT
    based FMIS. To evaluate the above research questions, the case study research
    protocol as defined by Runeson and Höst (2008) has been applied. Based on this
    the indicated five steps have been followed: (1) case study design (2) preparation
    for data collection (3) execution with data collection on the studied case (4)
    analysis of collected data (5) reporting. Table 1 shows the case study design
    elements. The case study research has been applied both for a retrospective case
    and prospective case. The retrospective case included a system which was developed
    before and for which there was already an existing architecture with required
    design documents. The prospective case includes the system that is planned to
    be developed. Table 1 Case study design Full size table The goal for the retrospective
    study was to compare the earlier result with the result that is produced by proposed
    method. In this way it was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.
    For the prospective case study, the aim was to evaluate both the effectiveness
    and the practicality of the approach. The research questions were defined accordingly
    as it is shown in the table. For the adopted background and sources in the case
    study research, official design documents have been used and interviews were held
    with project managers and system architects. For the retrospective case study,
    the requirements and design documents were available, whereas for the prospective
    case study only the requirements document was available. For both case studies
    project managers and system architects were interviewed. The project manager had
    more than 20 years of experience in farm management system. The two system architects
    had more than 15 years of experience in designing farm management systems. For
    both case studies a qualitative data analysis approach has been used. For the
    retrospective case study, indirect data analysis has been used by analyzing the
    requirements documents, applying the method and comparing the results of the method
    with the existing architecture. For the prospective case study, a direct and indirect
    data analysis approaches were used. For the direct data analysis, semi-structured
    interviews were conducted, in which a list of predefined set of questions were
    asked to the project manager and software architects. The predefined questions
    are listed in Table 2. The questions included a 5-point Likert scale (strongly
    disagree to strongly agree) for the possible answers. In addition, explanation
    was asked for each question. Note that although Likert scales are used for the
    evaluation of the approach, it is not aimed to be quantitative but primarily qualitative.
    The interview questions with Likert scales as such were used as supporting instruments
    to the open semi-structured interview that were held with the stakeholders. Table
    2 Questionnaire for the Interview Full size table The interview was organized
    as follows: 1. First a meeting was scheduled with the project manager and system
    architects for the initial interview. The goal of this interview was to capture
    the initial thoughts and experience on IoT adoption. 2. In the second step a short
    presentation was provided about the goal of the developed method. Also, the operation
    of the method as well as the final outcome was shortly explained. 3. In the third
    step the method was applied both for the retrospective case (wheat production)
    and prospective case (tomato production in greenhouses). 4. In the fourth step,
    the researchers analyzed the architecture design that resulted from the application
    of the method to the retrospective case and the prospective case. 5. In the fifth
    step, the researchers held a post interview with the subjects with the purpose
    of identifying the impact of the method and its practicality. 6. In the sixth
    step, the researchers collectively assessed data from the initial interview, report
    delivered by the method, and the post interview. The assessment was carried out
    separately and later was discussed together to derive the lessons learned. The
    following subsection discusses the results of the above process after the first
    two steps. Subsequently the evaluation in step 4, 5 and 6 are described. FMIS
    architecture design As stated before, the application architecture is derived
    from the family feature model and the reference architecture. As described earlier
    the FMIS development method includes the development of the application feature
    model and the application architecture. Retrospective case study: smart wheat
    production Figure 10 shows the feature model for smart wheat production that is
    derived after the analysis of the existing case study. This application feature
    model is obtained by reusing the feature model for FMIS given in Fig. 6 and selecting
    the features that are needed for this case study. As shown in the figure, for
    this case study, MQTT session layer protocol of IoT is chosen. The main reasons
    were because open source implementations of MQTT could be used. MQTT supports
    TCP and device-to-server communication which were considered necessary in the
    given context. Likewise, the MQTT feature of the IoT Data Acquisition will be
    used. Also, in order to support conventional data acquisition with tractors used
    in wheat production ISOBUS and CAN communications will be supported. Almost all
    data processing and data visualization features are required for smart wheat production.
    So almost all of these features remained in the feature diagram of Smart Wheat
    Production. For this retrospective case study, the FMIS will be integrated with
    the external weather forecast system only. Fig. 10 Application feature diagram
    of the FMIS software for Iot based smart wheat production—retrospective case study
    Full size image Decomposition view Based on the selected features as defined in
    Fig. 10, the application architecture can now be derived. As discussed before,
    the architecture of a system is usually described using multiple different architecture
    views. For each of the required architectural views it is necessary to develop
    the application arhiteture view. Figure 11 shows the decomposition view of the
    Smart Wheat Production that is obtained using the reference decomposition view
    given in Fig. 7. As explained above, MQTT, ISOBUS, and CAN data acquisition modules
    will be used to support IoT communications. All the sub-features of the system
    management feature of the family feature model will be used, except the light
    sensing feature. The light sensing feature is used to obtain light maps in the
    greenhouses. Yield monitoring, yield mapping, and soil type mapping modules will
    be used to implement data visualization features. All data processing modules
    namely image/video processing, data mining, decision support, and data logging
    modules will be implemented. Finally, a single external communication interface:
    external weather forcast interface module will be implemented. Fig. 11 IoT based
    FMIS—decomposition view for an IoT based smart wheat production—retrospective
    case study Full size image Layered view Figure 12 shows the layered view of smart
    wheat production. Similar to the other views, this view is also customized from
    the reference layered view diagram which is given in Fig. 8. Here the modules
    of the decomposition view are distributed over the layers in the layered view.
    The modules MQTT interface and conventional interface are allocated to the FMIS-data
    acquisition layer. The FMIS-application layer includes the modules data processing,
    data visualization, system management and communication with external system.
    The FMIS-business layer include fertility management, nutrient management, pest
    management, weed management, and irrigation management. It was assumed that the
    other layers and the modules in these layers are similar as defined in the reference
    architecture. Fig. 12 IoT based FMIS—application layered view for an IoT based
    smart wheat production—retrospective case study Full size image Deployment view
    The deployment view of the smart wheat production case study is given in Fig.
    13. The required software modules given in the decomposition view are deployed
    to a central cloud server and client (farmer). Since there is no satellite to
    be used it is omitted for this case. A subset of the features from the ground
    sensors actuators, and cameras, on-the-go sensors, actuators will be used. These
    will be deployed on vehicle, tractor or UAV/Drone nodes. Fig. 13 IoT based FMIS—deployment
    view of Iot based smart wheat production—retrospective case study Full size image
    Prospective case study: IoT based smart tomato production in greenhouses Similar
    to the retrospective case study the steps of the approach have been applied to
    derive the FMIS architecture. Due to space limitations the description of the
    steps will not be repeated and the specific diagrams will not be shown. It should
    be noted that unlike the retrospective case study, for the prospective case study
    there was no ready defined architecture. This did not have an impact on the application
    of the method but for the evaluation the comparison with existing architecture
    could naturally not be done. Result of the evaluation for the retrospective case
    study The previous subsection has shown the application of the approach. As defined
    in the case study protocol the effectiveness and practicality of the approach
    has been analyzed. The results of the interview showed that for all the asked
    questions a score of 4 or 5 were provided. Based on these results the effectiveness
    and practicality of the approach will be elaborated on. Effectiveness of the approach
    For assessing the effectiveness of the approach, the resulting application architecture
    was analyzed and post-interviews were carried out. For the retrospective study
    the application architecture was described in different document formats including
    MS PowerPoint and MS Visio. Further some detailed design documents could be accessed.
    The available architecture was not based on a well-defined viewpoint approach
    and no systematic approach was used. Nevertheless, it was possible to analyze
    the existing application architecture and compare it with the application architecture
    that was derived using the presented approach. For the comparison three relations
    were identified including (1) convergence (2) deviation (3) absence. The convergence
    relation implies that similar architecture elements could be identified in both
    the architecture designs. Deviation implies that the resulting application architecture
    had additional elements that were not defined in the existing architecture. Finally,
    absence defines that the resulting application architecture had missing elements
    that were defined in the existing architecture. Overall the result of the analysis
    showed that the resulting application architecture was quite similar to the existing
    architecture. In general, the convergence was very high. Several deviation and
    absence relations could be identified though. With respect to deviation in the
    resulting application architecture the modules UAV/Drone Control and External
    Weather Forecast Interface were not defined in the existing architecture. On the
    other hand, also some absence relations could be identified. For example, the
    resulting application architecture did not have the module Finance Interface Module,
    Farmer Data Module, and Simulation Module that were explicitly defined in the
    existing application architecture. This became also apparent in the post-interviews.
    In the interview, the questions 2, 3, 4 and 5 relate directly to the effectiveness
    of the approach. The architects provided a score of at least 4 for all these questions
    indicating that the approach is largely effective for the corresponding case.
    Practicality of the approach The practicality of the method was assessed though
    questions 6 to 9 of the questionnaire. The architects gave at least a score of
    4 for all these questions indicating that they were quite satisfied with the practicality
    of the method. Further it was stated that the architecture design could now be
    more quickly designed. Another interesting issue that was explicitly mentioned
    was the fact that the method helped to support communication about the design
    decisions early on. For the question “Will you use the method again?” the answers
    were positive again and both architects indicated that they would use this method
    for the subsequent project. The architects also had some suggestions for improvement
    including the need for allowing specific delta modules when deriving the application
    architecture. Result of the evaluation for the prospective case study Similar
    to the results of the retrospective study, the answers to the provided questions
    were positive and received a score of 4 or higher. In the following the effectiveness
    and practicality of the proposed approach is discussed for the prospective case
    study. Effectiveness of the approach For the retrospective case study, the resulting
    architecture was compared with the existing architecture to assess the effectiveness
    of the approach. For this prospective case study, the results could not be compared
    with an existing application architecture since only requirements document was
    provided and the application architecture had still to be designed. The requirements
    document was used to identify the required application feature diagram. Based
    on this the application architecture was derived. The effectiveness of the application
    architecture and the overall approach was based on the results of the interview.
    The scores for the questions 2 to 5 related to effectiveness were at least 4.
    This indicated that the approach was effective for the given case. The architects
    noted that the application could be easily derived based on the defined requirements.
    Practicality of the approach For assessing the practicality of the approach, the
    results of questions 6 to 10 were considered. Again, it appeared that these had
    all a score with at least 4. Similar to the retrospective case study the approach
    was found practical and easy to use. Similar statements as in the retrospective
    case study were made. The explicitly mentioned identified benefits included the
    reduction of effort to design the architecture, discuss the design decisions,
    and the surprisingly shorter learning curve than expected. Discussion The introduction
    of the IoT has led to the notion of IoT-based FMIS to support the smart farming
    goals. This paper aimed to integrate the IoT systems with the FMIS to align both
    systems and create additional value that cannot be achieved if these are considered
    separately. This integration effort leads to the enhancement of the current FMIS
    with new modules that support the smart farming operations based on IoT. In the
    presented approach these required new modules have been explicitly defined in
    addition to the traditional FMIS modules. The overall approach as such provides
    an integrated view of the overall system to better support the architecture of
    IoT-based FMIS. The method that was discussed can be adopted for deriving an IoT
    based FMIS architecture for multiple different systems. Hence, the focus is on
    the whole product family of IoT based FMISs rather than on a single system. The
    notion of product families or product line engineering and the corresponding systematic
    reuse is discussed in detail in the product line engineering community (Clements
    2006). The presented method is inspired and customizes the product line engineering
    approach in which reference models are developed and applications are developed
    by reusing these reference models. The reference feature diagram that was shown
    aims to target and integrate the domains of IoT and FMIS. The focus in this paper
    was primarily to illustrate the overall method. The feature diagrams as well as
    the reference architecture design could be easily extended. The architectures
    for IoT and FMIS were discussed separately and the integration of both for supporting
    IoT based FMISs was illustrated. The architecture can be extended in two ways.
    First of all, the different views could be further refined to provide an even
    more comprehensive result. This would require for example to further detail the
    modules that are needed in the decomposition view. Secondly, the architecture
    representations could be extended with other architecture views. Three architecture
    views were chosen including decomposition view, layered view and deployment view.
    If needed other architecture views in the architecture documentation process could
    be used as well. The complete versions of the feature diagrams as well the detailed
    implemented architecture designs have not been shown due to confidentiality issues.
    The reference architecture is designed in such a way that it is generic enough
    to derive different concrete architectures. Nevertheless, as is the case for all
    reference models, the reference architecture does not provide all the details.
    Likewise, a system which requires very dedicated features that were not anticipated
    would not be covered by the reference architecture. Furthermore, the focus has
    been on illustrating the reference architecture and the approach for deriving
    a concrete architecture. This appeared to be useful and practical. However, it
    is not claimed that the reference architecture is complete, and likewise further
    research can be used to refine and enhance the reference architecture. For example,
    the device layer and the related functionality have not been discussed in detail
    in this article. This could though be easily added without loss of generality
    and applicability of the proposed approach. Although, the approach has been shown
    for two important case studies in the smart agri-food sector, the method can be
    also applied for the development of other FMISs. The paper did not focus on the
    implementation of these systems. The reason for this is because of confidentiality
    and the goal to prescribe the system-to-be in the prospective case study. For
    the prospective case study, it is decided to develop first a simulation system
    to evaluate the outcome of the method. This is considered as part of future work.
    This paper provided both the reference architecture for IoT-based FMIS and the
    overall approach to derive a concrete architecture. The idea of systematic guidelines
    for deriving a concrete architecture could also be used for enhancing the use
    of existing IoT-based reference architectures. Although the proposed method has
    illustrated the development of IoT based FMISs, the method could even be used
    for developing traditional FMISs. In that case the IoT architecture part would
    be omitted and just the development of reference models for FMIS would be considered.
    This paper describes a domain-driven approach to design IoT-based FMIS and support
    the architect in deriving a concrete IoT-based FMIS architecture. Several other
    important issues need to be considered to realize effective smart farming. Important
    aspects include the acceptability of the provided IoT technology by the relevant
    stakeholders including the end-users, development of cost-effective transition
    strategies, and farm management and agricultural economics. Detailed discussion
    on economics and profitability of IoT solutions in the agriculture domain have
    been addressed by multiple studies including (Griffin and Lowenberg-DeBoer 2005;
    Griffin et al. 2018; Wolfert et al. 2017; Lowenberg-DeBoer et al. 2000; Schimmelpfennig
    2016; Kutter et al. 2011). Adopting IoT-based FMIS is not trivial and usually
    requires large economic investments. To justify these up-front investments the
    return-on-investment both with respect to cost and quality should be defined.
    Further, IoT-based FMIS potentially requires changes to farm equipment or totally
    new farm equipment. Hence, it is important to analyze the acceptability and adoption
    scenarios, and provide clear transition strategies for the efficient introduction,
    usage and maintenance of smart farming. Due to space limitations and the concrete
    scope of the paper this is not further discussed. A systematic case study research
    has been applied to validate the proposed approach. Each empirical study usually
    has to deal with a few potential threats to validity. In the following these are
    discussed for the presented case study research, and the mitigation strategy for
    each threat is described. Construct validity refers to what extent the operational
    measures that are studied really represent what the researchers have in mind and
    what is investigated according to the research questions (Yin 2009). Table 3 shows
    various identified threats to construction validity together with the counter
    measures. Table 3 Threats to construct validity and applied counter measures in
    case studies Full size table Internal Validity relates to a causal relationship
    between treatment and the outcome. The retrospective case study relied on existing
    design documentation and related literature. There could be missing information
    in both cases that would affect the outcome. To mitigate this threat several iterations
    were done to derive both the application feature model and the application architecture.
    In the prospective case, the lack of proper requirements documentation could have
    an impact on the derived decisions. To mitigate this threat, this has been discussed
    with the interviewed persons in detail and several iterations were adopted. External
    Validity concerns the ability to generalize the results of the study. In the evaluation,
    both a retrospective and prospective case study were adopted derived from different
    application domains. This was done to support triangulation and likewise extend
    the external validity. The approach was considered effective for both case studies
    but due to the small number of participants a stronger statement could not be
    provided. In the future work a repetition of this study with multiple other case
    studies with an increased number of participants would further justify the claims
    of this paper and also support the quantitative evaluation. Conclusion Farm management
    information systems are being increasingly applied in many farming systems. Several
    architectures for FMISs have been proposed in the literature but these are usually
    abstract, and it is not trivial to derive the application FMIS architecture for
    the corresponding context of the farm system. This paper has provided an architecture
    design method for deriving application architectures for FMISs. For this, reference
    architectures for IoT and FMIS were adopted, and a novel IoT based FMIS has been
    defined. The architecture design method has been provided for deriving the customized
    application FMIS architecture. To support the design of the application architecture
    a domain driven approach has been adopted whereby a family feature diagram was
    defined representing the common and variant features of IoT based farm management
    information systems. The approach was illustrated using a systematic case study
    approach. Both retrospective and prospective case studies were implemented including
    IoT based wheat production and IoT based tomato FMIS. The case study research
    showed that the approach was both effective and practical. It appeared that both
    the reference architecture that was provided as well as the corresponding method
    appeared to be very useful in deriving the customized application FMIS architecture.
    Since in general developing IoT systems is not trivial adopting a systematic approach
    appears to be useful in not only the final results but also the intermediate steps
    that support the communication between the stakeholders and the overall guidance
    of the design decisions. The contribution of this paper can be useful for both
    researchers who do research on IoT based FMISs as well as practitioners who aim
    to architect different FMISs. The future work will apply the approach for other
    farm management systems. Further focus will be on the architecture design and
    integration of multiple different FMISs. References Adamchuk, V. I., Hummel, J.

    rights and content Abstract Crop water parameters, including actual evapotranspiration,
    transpiration, soil evaporation, crop coefficients, evaporative fractions, aerodynamic
    resistances, surface resistances and percolation fluxes were estimated in a commercial
    mango orchard during two growing seasons in Northeast Brazil. The actual evapotranspiration
    (Ea) was obtained by the eddy covariance (EC) technique, while for the reference
    evapotranspiration (E0); the FAO Penman–Monteith equation was applied. The energy
    balance closure showed a gap of 12%. For water productivity analysis the Ea was
    then computed with the Bowen ratio determined from the eddy covariance fluxes.
    The mean accumulated Ea for the two seasons was 1419 mm year−1, which corresponded
    to a daily average rate of 3.7 mm day−1. The mean values of the crop coefficients
    based on evapotranspiration (Kc) and based on transpiration (Kcb) were 0.91 and
    0.73, respectively. The single layer Kc was fitted with a degree days function.
    Twenty percent of evapotranspiration originated from direct soil evaporation.
    The evaporative fraction was 0.83 on average. The average relative water supply
    was 1.1, revealing that, in general, irrigation water supply was in good harmony
    with the crop water requirements. The resulting evapotranspiration deficit was
    73–95 mm per season only. The mean aerodynamic resistance (ra) was 37 s m−1 and
    the bulk surface resistance (rs) was 135 s m−1. The mean unit yield was 45 tonne
    ha−1 being equivalent to a crop water productivity of 3.2 kg m−3 when based on
    Ea with an economic counterpart of US$ 3.27 m−3. The drawback of this highly productive
    use of water resources is an unavoidable percolation flux of approximately 300
    mm per growing season that is detrimental to the downstream environment and water
    users. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Mango orchardEnergy

    1. Introduction Fruit crops in the semi-arid region of the São Francisco River
    basin in Brazil constitute an important activity for the livelihoods of rural
    communities. Mango is important for export markets. Its fruit has the advantage
    of being juicy and relatively large in size, besides being a rich nutrient source.
    The global large mango players are India (50%), China (9%), Mexico (6%), Thailand
    (5%), Philippines (5%) and Pakistan (4%). Brazil has 2.5% of the world production,
    and after Mexico is the second largest mango producing country in the Americas.
    Mango is a perennial crop with a high leaf area index and a relative deep rooting
    depth from 100 to 150 cm. The trees basically require a frost-free climate and
    grow most favourably in warm climates (25–35 °C), in almost any well-drained soil
    whether sandy, loam or clay. Experience indicates that the water use of fruit
    crops varies considerably; it is unknown how much variability exists from orchard
    to orchard. Differences in cultivation practices or the method used in calculating
    evapotranspiration are of fundamental importance for extrapolation of research
    results to other regions (Williams and Ayars, 2005). The relationship between
    irrigation, evapotranspiration, yield and percolation is essential for applying
    and maintaining good water management practices. The agro-hydrological processes
    in a mango orchard are only rarely described in the international literature.
    Despite the economical and nutritious importance of its fruits, little research
    has been attributed to the crop water productivity (CWP). The index CPW can have
    a variety of definitions. The most common are: the fresh fruit productivity in
    terms of actual evapotranspiration or actual transpiration and in terms of the
    volume of applied irrigation water (Molden et al., 2003). It can also be expressed
    in terms of monetary value per unit of water (Bos et al., 2005). Ea measurements
    by energy balance techniques in tropical fruits, vineyards and vegetables have
    been made in grapes (Heilman et al., 1996), mango orchard (Azevedo et al., 2003),
    garlic (Vilalolobos et al., 2004), grapes (Yunusa and Walker, 2004), pecans (Sammis
    et al., 2004), citrus (Rana et al., 2005), peach (Paço et al., 2006), olives (Testi
    et al., 2006) and grapes (Teixeira et al., 2007). Irrigation of mango orchards
    can be associated with environmental problems. Molle et al. (1999) reported that
    mango orchards in Thailand are receiving 20 pesticide treatments and 5 fertilizer
    applications per season. Despite growing attention in irrigated orchards to leaking
    root zones, in general during the last decades, knowledge on evapotranspiration–percolation
    relationships is nevertheless limited. Thus the environmental impact of non-consumed
    irrigation water requires more attention. This paper addresses Ea measurements
    which, in conjunction with soil moisture storage changes, and rainfall, allow
    the isolation of percolation fluxes (instead of deriving Ea from percolation estimates,
    we assess percolation from Ea estimates). The general objective of this study
    was to find useful recommendations for a rational and strategic water management
    in irrigated mango orchards. The specific objectives of this study are • The evaluation
    of the performance of the eddy covariance technique for measuring actual evapotranspiration
    for tropical fruits. • Assessment of daily and seasonal mango evapotranspiration
    and related crop water parameters for two complete growing seasons having different
    rainfall regimes. • Determination of the field scale water balance for irrigation
    performance and environmental analysis. • Quantifying water productivity indicators
    at field scale that can be used in subsequent up scaling studies. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Measurement site This study was carried out from 2003 to 2005,
    in a mango orchard located in the semi-arid region of the São Francisco River
    basin, Northeast Brazil. This area in Pernambuco State has a mean total annual
    precipitation of 570 mm and a corresponding mean pan evaporation of 2700 mm at
    a mean air temperature of 26.5 °C. The orchard is located in Fruitfort farm, Petrolina,
    latitude 09°22′S, longitude 40°34′W, Pernambuco state, Brazil. The cv. is Tommy
    Atkins, 18 years old (in 2003), spaced in a regular square pattern at 10 m × 10
    m, with an average height of 5.5 m, mean leaf area index (LAI) of 5.6 and daily
    micro-sprinkler irrigation of an area of 11.92 ha (see Fig. 1 for a location view),
    with one in-line micro sprinkler between two trees on the ground at a discharge
    rate of 44 L h−1 which wetted 70% of the soil surface. The irrigation requirements
    were calculated based on reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients adapted
    from published values for citrus, according to different crop stages. The orchard
    is bordered on all sides by other mango crops with similar height. The sensors
    were installed at the centre of the plot. There is no cover crop. The sandy soil
    is classified as Latossoil Red-Yellow with low retention capacity. The groundwater
    depth is approximately 2.5 m, and the farm is located 5.5 km away from the São
    Francisco River. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location of the experimental

    A mango growth cycle extends from November to October. The fruit trees undergo
    vegetative growth between November and January, followed by branch development
    from January to May. The mango trees in the region flower typically in May to
    July, with fruit initiation in June and July. Fruit growth occurs in July and
    August. Fruit maturation typically occurs during August and September. The fruits
    are then picked during September and October. Healthy trees require little pruning.
    Besides irrigating the crop with a water depth of approximately 900 mm, farmers
    spray pesticides on a weekly basis for crop protection. Fertilizers are applied
    through the micro-sprinkler irrigation system. Mango trees require regular applications
    of nitrogen fertilizer to promote healthy growth flushes and flower production,
    and the NPK application depends on soil and leaf analysis. Heck et al. (2003)
    reported a fertilizer application in the same region of Pernambuco of 2.5 tonne
    ha−1 of dolomite lime and 20 L per tree of goat manure. The study comprised two
    growing seasons. The duration of the first period was 390 days, from 01 October
    2003 (Day 274) to 24 October 2004 (Day 298). The measurements continued into a
    second period of 370 days, elapsing from 25 November 2004 (Day 299) to 29 November
    2005 (Day 302). 2.2. Orchard energy balance During the experiments, all components
    of the energy balance were acquired by both, the Bowen ratio and eddy covariance
    methods (Fig. 1), but only eddy covariance measurements were used for the partition
    of the heat fluxes in this paper. The eddy covariance system determined the sensible
    (H) and latent heat fluxes (λE) using a three-axis sonic anemometer (Model CSAT3,
    Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) and a krypton hygrometer (Model KH20, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT, USA), respectively, connected to a datalogger (model CR10X,
    Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). The sensors were installed at a height of
    8.5 m (thus 3 m above the crown of the mango tree) with a horizontal separation
    of 0.15 m and with a sampling frequency of 16 Hz. Corrections to the λE due to
    sensible and latent flux (Webb et al., 1980), oxygen absorption (Tanner et al.,
    1993) and frequency losses (Moore, 1986) were applied using software developed
    by Van Dijk et al. (2004). The fluxes were computed for 30 min periods and later
    summed to give daily totals. The net radiation (Rn) was acquired with one net
    radiometer (model NR-Lite, Kipp & Zonnen, Delft, The Netherlands) above a row
    of plants at a height of 7.5 m. Previous experiments with fruit crops have shown
    that no big differences arise by using one sensor or two above and between rows
    for determination of Rn at this height (Teixeira et al., 2007). The soil heat
    flux (G) was measured with two heat flux plates (model HFT3-L, REBS, Radiation
    and Energy Balance Systems, Seattle, WA, USA) at 2 cm soil depth and below the
    projected tree crown at 100 cm from the trunk. Flux plates were buried one at
    the west and the other at the east side a row of trees. The values of G were obtained
    as the average of the two measurements. Rn and G were measured at each 5 s interval
    and 10 min averages were stored on another datalogger (the same model used for
    eddy covariance measurements). Missing data for λE from krypton hygrometer during
    the rainy periods were estimated by the relationship between (H + λE) and the
    available energy (Rn + G). After gap filling, the complete energy and water balances
    for entire growing seasons could be derived. The tower did not have problems of
    fetch in any direction, as the plot of 11.92 ha was inside a big farm with around
    140 ha of mango orchards, southeast is the predominant wind direction. Because
    of the lack of energy closure, a hybrid combination of radiation and flux measurements
    was deployed in this study. This combination method using eddy covariance measurements
    and the Bowen ratio of the fluxes (β = H/λE), the latent heat flux (λE) was derived
    using the following equation: (1) The actual evapotranspiration (Ea) was calculated
    transforming the λE into millimetres of water. The calculation of Ea at a daily
    time scale was obtained by summation of all 30 min values for 24 h periods. 2.3.
    Evapotranspiration and crop coefficients The reference evapotranspiration (E0)
    was calculated from Allen et al. (1998) using climatic data from an agro-meteorological
    station in the vicinity of the orchard (500 m). Half hourly measurements of average
    air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, net radiation over grass and soil
    heat flux were used. The crop coefficient (Kc) was expressed as Ea/E0. The upper
    envelope of the Kc values was used to derive potential evapotranspiration (Ep).
    For the evaluation of actual transpiration (Ta) and soil evaporation (Es), Kc
    was separated into two components: Kcb (basal coefficient) and Ke (soil evaporation
    component), respectively, using daily fluctuations of Kc. Minimum values of this
    last coefficient were used to fit a curve for obtaining daily Kcb values, while
    Ke was considered as the difference between Kc and Kcb. Hence (2) (3) 2.4. Additional
    measurements The soil moisture was monitored weekly in the orchard with tensiometers
    at depths of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 cm. These depths are considered to be
    inside the effective root zone for mango trees under local conditions. Suctions
    were converted into soil moisture by using measured soil water retention curves.
    Microclimatic data of air temperature and relative humidity were used together
    with Rn, λE and G to estimate the bulk surface resistance to water vapour transport
    (rs) applying the Penman–Monteith equation: (4) where Δ (kPa °C−1) is the slope
    of the saturated vapour pressure curve, ρa (kg m−3) is the air density, cp (J
    kg−1 K−1) is the air specific heat at constant pressure, D (kPa) is the vapour
    pressure deficit and γ (kPa °C−1) is the psychrometric constant. The value of
    rs is obtained from model inversion of this equation using 30 min data. The 30
    min data values of rs were averaged. The aerodynamic resistance ra (s m−1) was
    estimated using flux profile relationships. In this method the atmospheric surface
    layer similarity theory was used, applying the universal functions suggested by
    Businger et al. (1971) and the integrated stability functions of temperature (Ψh)
    and momentum (Ψm). 2.5. Soil water balance and storage change The combined percolation
    and drainage term can be obtained from the remaining soil water balance terms
    as the difference between inputs (precipitation P, irrigation I and change in
    moisture storage, ΔW) and outputs (Ea). Since sub-surface drainage systems were
    absent, and flow to surface drains is negligible, the combined percolation/drainage
    flux can essentially be considered to represent deep percolation DP: (5) The changes
    in soil water storage (ΔW) are positive when water is added to the root zone,
    otherwise it is negative: (6) The water storage W in the root zone is derived
    from the layer-wise soil moisture values (θi). At moment t, the storage across
    the depth (δzi) of the six sensors (i = 1, …, 6) can be computed as (7) 2.6. Irrigation
    performance and crop water productivity Following Bastiaanssen et al. (2001) the
    irrigation performance indicators applied in this study were the relative water
    supply (RWS), crop water deficit (CWD) and crop water productivity (CWP) based
    on irrigation (I), actual evapotranspiration (Ea), actual transpiration (Ta) and
    actual crop yield (Ya): (8) (9) (10) where P is the precipitation; VI the water
    applied through irrigation; and are water fluxes by actual evapotranspiration
    and actual transpiration, respectively; and Ya is the actual yield of fruits.
    Increases in economic water productivity may indicate a shift towards higher valued
    crops, increase in yields or a saving in water input (Bos et al., 2005). As economic
    indicators, the indexes used were the standard gross value of production (fruits)
    over the irrigation supply (CWP$I) and over actual evapotranspiration or actual
    transpiration ( ). 3. Results 3.1. Weather conditions and soil moisture Fig. 2
    shows the daily averaged weather variables during the two growing seasons studied.
    Air temperature (T) reached the maximum value in November and December with approximately
    30 °C, while the minimum values occurred during June (22 °C). The relative humidity
    (RH) presented the inverse behaviour. The values for vapour pressure deficit (D),
    calculated for each half hour and averaged for 24 h – which expresses the inverse
    of RH – presented the same temporal behaviour as air temperature through the growing
    seasons. Wind speed (WS) at 3 m above a standardized grass field presented maximum
    values from July to November (3.6 m s−1) and the minimum values from January to
    April (0.8 m s−1). The wind speed over the rough mango trees were around 12% greater
    than over grass due to the height of the anemometer above the orchard. Values
    of global radiation (RG) were as expected in the southern hemisphere: lower from
    April to July and higher from August to January, when they started to decline
    again. Reference evapotranspiration (E0) followed the oscillation of RG. Precipitation
    was concentrated between January and April. The year 2004 was unusually wet. The
    accumulated rainfall for the first growing season was 887 mm, for the second it
    was only 384 mm, while the longer term annual average is 570 mm. Download : Download

    radiation (RG), reference evapotranspiration (E0) and precipitation (P). The values
    of layer-wise soil water content (θ) from 20 to 120 cm depth are presented in
    Fig. 3. The near-surface moisture content values were from 0.04 to 0.12 cm3 cm−3
    only, which creates a visually dry soil surface. Underneath the dry surface layer,
    the soil was wet with measured θ values peaking at 0.38 cm3 cm−3. These levels
    can be interpreted as representing the soil porosity when the volumetric soil
    water content reaches its maximum in sandy soil. The highest moisture values occurred
    at the end of February in 2004 and are related to the preceding storm events.
    After this period, soil moisture was approximately constant throughout the seasons.
    The values at 120 cm were most often lower than at 60 and 100 cm, which reveal
    typical downward percolation conditions. The magnitude of the percolation needs
    to be investigated from the soil water balance. As the effective root zone of
    mango crop is 120 cm, it can be concluded from the θ values that the mango orchard
    was not stressed by water shortage during most of the days. Download : Download

    and second (b) growing seasons of mango orchard. 3.2. Energy balance closure Despite
    eddy covariance being among the most advanced “in situ” measurement technologies
    that directly provide λE, it is widely known to have problems. The λE data quality
    from this system has been verified by studying the energy balance closure: fluxes
    (λE + H) and available energy (Rn − G) were compared for the whole period of measurements
    (2003–2005) at a daily time scale (Fig. 4). Since the main objective of the research
    is irrigation management and water productivities, we are less interested in studying
    hourly energy balance closures, daily total values are sufficient. The energy
    balance ratio, i.e. the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy was
    88%. The RMSE for 24 h values was 1.7 MJ m−2 day−1, evidence of the good quality
    of the dataset. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Relationship between
    latent heat (λE) plus sensible heat (H) fluxes and available energy (Rn − G) for
    the eddy covariance system. A closure error of 10–30% seems to occur frequently
    with eddy covariance-based latent heat flux estimates. A summary paper of 22 flux
    sites indicated a general lack of closure, with a mean imbalance in the order
    of 20% (Wilson et al., 2002). Available energy (Rn − G) systematically exceeding
    measured fluxes (λE + H) were also published by Twine et al. (2000), Paço et al.
    (2006) and Testi et al. (2006). The lack of energy balance closure can also be
    associated with measurement errors in Rn and G, but not completely explained by
    this uncertainty, because eddy covariance systems have their own sources of error
    (Twine et al., 2000). Further to systematic biases in the instrumentation, the
    general hypothesis is that lack of energy balance closure can be explained by
    sampling errors related to different footprints, neglected energy sinks, loss
    of low and/or high frequency contributions to the turbulent heat flux and advection
    of scalars (e.g. Paw et al., 2000). To circumvent this common problem, several
    agro-meteorological studies have found a practical solution to force the closure
    of the surface energy balance. Simmons et al. (2007) also used the residual method
    to obtain Ea by measuring H with a sonic anemometer and the available energy in
    a flood-irrigated pecan orchard, while Chehbouni et al. (2006) used eddy covariance
    measurements and the ratio H/λE over irrigated wheat in the Yaqui Valley in northwest
    Mexico. It was decided to analyse the results combining the ratio H/λE with the
    measured available energy (e.g. Twine et al., 2000). Whilst the lack of energy
    balance closure underestimates λE, forcing the closure by this combination method
    we assume this underestimation to be corrected (e.g. Hoedjes et al., 2002). The
    authors have a preference for the combination method because: • it directly produces
    evaporative fraction, being a key expression for energy partitioning; • it ensures
    a closed energy balance; • it mainly utilizes highly advanced eddy covariance
    systems; • it has a good consistency with the theoretically best λE measurements.
    All the energy balance and Ea data discussed hereafter are based on the combination
    method with H/λE from eddy covariance measurements. 3.3. Partition into sensible
    and latent heat fluxes Fig. 5a and b shows the diurnal trend in the fluxes of
    individual components of the energy balance for the mango orchard. The latent
    heat flux (λE) was always in excess of the sensible heat flux (H) during daylight
    hours. The H was – in turn – higher than the soil heat flux (G). At night the
    results from eddy covariance (EC) showed zero latent heat flux. Download : Download

    the growing seasons of 2003–2004 (a) and 2004–2005 (b) for mango orchard: net
    radiation (Rn); latent heat flux (λE); sensible heat flux (H) and soil heat flux
    (G). Daily averages of energy balances are given in Table 1. Unstable atmospheric
    conditions predominated above the orchard, with the sensible heat flux (H) accounting
    for 11% and 15% of Rn during the first and second growing seasons, respectively.
    The significant leaf area index of mango crop (LAI ∼5 to 6) caused solar radiation
    to hardly penetrate through the canopy. As a consequence, the soil heat flux (G)
    at daily scale was small and negative with 24 h averaged values of 3% and 2% of
    Rn in the first and second growing seasons, respectively. Negative values for
    G could be the result of conditions with a large LAI in conjunction with frequent
    micro sprinkler irrigation that keeps the soil thermal conductivity high. Table

    values were taken at 30 and 28 days intervals for GS1 and GS2, respectively. The
    largest part of Rn was used as latent heat flux (λE). λE represented on average
    89% of Rn during the first growing season and 80% for the second one. The corresponding
    evaporative fractions (EF = λE/Rn − G) were 0.86 and 0.79. During an earlier mango
    energy balance study during 1998, the EF was found to be 0.73 in August, 0.86
    in September, 0.78 in October and 0.80 during November (Lopes et al., 2001), similar
    to our results. The values of EF remained rather constant during the growing seasons,
    which reflect a constant supply of irrigation water. An average EF of 0.83 is
    according to Scott et al. (2003) equivalent to a degree of soil moisture saturation
    in the root zone of 67%, which at a maximum moisture value of 0.38 cm3 cm−3 suggests
    average soil moisture in the root zone of 0.25 cm3 cm−3. The latter can be confirmed
    from the soil moisture measurements (see Fig. 3). Testi et al. (2004) studied
    the partition of energy balance in a young olive orchard, under different soil
    water conditions. They also concluded that the amount of Rn used as λE and H depends
    on soil water content. The rainy period elapsed from January to April and after
    that, farmers refrain from irrigation, inducing a drop of evaporative fraction
    to a value around 0.70 during the branch development stages. 3.4. Evapotranspiration
    Despite the first growing season having an above average rainfall; the difference
    in potential evapotranspiration (Ep) is mainly caused by cloud cover and solar
    radiation (RG). Outside the short rainy season, RG can be abundant. The Ep in
    the first growing season was with 1565 mm, more than for the second season (1441
    mm). As a consequence of the higher potential evapotranspiration, and the wetter
    soil due to rainfall (the 80–120 cm depth layers are systematically wetter in
    the first growing season), actual ET in 2003–4 was 1492 mm and higher than the
    1346 mm measured in 2004–05. The average ETa over the two seasons was 1419 mm
    with an average daily value rate of 3.7 mm day−1. Fig. 6 shows the seasonal trend
    of daily values of actual evapotranspiration (Ea) in mango orchard. The values
    followed the atmospheric demand in both growing seasons, being higher from October
    (2003) to March (2004), and from August to November (2004) in the first season,
    while in the second season, the peak values were from January to April and from
    August to November, both in 2005. Maximum daily values of Ea for the first season
    were 6.3 mm day−1. During the second season the maximum values were 5.1 mm day−1.
    The minimum values were around 0.6 mm day−1. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. Daily variation for actual evapotranspiration, during the growing seasons
    of 2003–2004 (a) and 2004–2005 (b) for mango orchard, by the combination eddy
    covariance–Bowen ratio method. Azevedo et al. (2003) showed averaged daily values
    of mango orchard Ea of 4.4 mm day−1 for the crop stages from flowering to fruit
    maturation using both, Bowen ratio and soil water balance methods. It should be
    noted that the study of Azevedo reflects drip irrigation, while our study used
    micro sprinklers. The mean crop heights are similar for both studies (around 5
    m) and the trees were spaced 8.0 m × 5.0 m in the previous study, while in the
    present field, trees stand in a regular square pattern at 10 m × 10 m. The mango
    orchard LAI in the first study was approximately 12–15 while the larger spacing
    in our study yields values of 5.2, 6.0 and 5.6, being another reason for the lower
    Ea. Lopes et al. (2001) evaluating Ea using the Bowen ratio method for 6-year-old,
    drip-irrigated mango trees, found values in the range of 3.1–6.2 mm day−1 in Petrolina,
    Brazil. Annual mango Ea in South Africa was found by Mostert and Wantenaar (1994)
    to be 1197 mm. The winter Ea was 2.2 mm day−1 on average, while the summer Ea
    was with 4.4 mm day−1 exactly double. Molle et al. (1999) reported on an annual
    mango plot water consumption of 1630 mm in a raised bed system, including crop
    consumptive use and evaporation from pounding water. With regard to other orchards,
    the Ea results for mango were greater than for citrus (Paço et al., 2006) and
    lower than for peach (Rana et al., 2005). Rana et al. (2005) using eddy covariance
    measurement systems in a citrus orchard under Mediterranean conditions (Southern
    Italy) found values ranging from 3.0 to 8.0 mm day−1. Paço et al. (2006) using
    the same method in a peach orchard in Portugal found Ea values ranging from 1.4
    to 3.6 mm day−1 in 1998 and from 2.1 to 3.3 mm day−1 in 1999 with mean values
    of 2.5 and 2.6 mm day−1, respectively. The eddy covariance system was also used
    by Sammis et al. (2004) to study water consumption of flood-irrigated pecans in
    USA; they found an averaged total Ea of 1420 mm for 2001 and 2002 that was similar
    to the total Ea of mango orchard in first growing season in the present study.
    3.5. Crop coefficients The 20-day interval averaged Kc data for the dry growing
    season (2004–2005) were fitted with a polynomial function expressed in degree
    days (basal T = 10 °C) rather than in calendar days, for incorporation of temperature
    effects on the growing stages of mango trees (Fig. 7). The period before the pruning
    date was included because the farmers also applied large amounts of water during
    post-harvest periods, which must be included for the final water productivity
    analysis. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. The seasonal variation of
    averaged daily crop coefficients (mean Kc), as a function of degree days, DD (basal
    T = 10 °C), during the growing season of 2004–2005 of mango orchard, by the combination
    method of eddy covariance measurements with Bowen ratio. The values of Ea largely
    followed the E0. During the rainy periods at the start of the year, Ea rates exceeded
    E0, resulting in daily Kc values exceeding 1 (Fig. 8). Soil evaporation plays
    a role in these high Kc values, as can be seen by the high values of the crop
    coefficient based on soil evaporation (Ke). This effect was more pronounced in
    2004, when unusually strong storms occurred. The highest daily values of Kc were
    from the end of January to end of March for both seasons reaching peak Kc values
    of 1.40. This time of both years (2004 and 2005) was the rainy period when the
    crop was at the branch development and flowering stages. The minimum values occurred
    when the crop was in a transition stage from previous post-harvest to vegetative
    growth, coinciding with periods without rain. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 8. Seasonal variation of daily crop coefficients in mango orchard for the
    first (a) and second (b) growing seasons: crop coefficients based on evapotranspiration
    (Kc), transpiration (Kcb) and soil evaporation (Ke). For both seasons, higher
    Kc values were found than by Azevedo et al. (2003) who reported Kc values around
    0.71 during the crop stages studied. They also fitted a polynomial curve, but
    with Kc values as a function of the days after flowering (DAF). The higher Kc
    values in our study have the same reasons as mentioned for Ea, but in addition
    it should be noticed that they used a conventional agro-meteorological station
    in contrast with our automatic weather station data to calculate E0. The maximum
    Kc values found for citrus by Rana et al. (2005) were around 1.20, a little lower
    than the results for mango orchard during our study, while Sammis et al. (2004)
    and Paço et al. (2006) found much lower values in the range of 0.20–1.10 for pecan
    and from 0.40 to 0.60 for peach orchards, respectively. The minimum Kc values
    for 20-day periods were considered to represent the basal coefficients (Kcb) and
    a curve was fitted (Fig. 8). The maximum daily values of Kcb were 0.85 and 0.75
    for the first and second growing seasons, respectively. The minimum values for
    initial stages were 0.46 during the first season. During the second season, minimum
    initial Kcb values were 0.41. The basal crop coefficients during the harvest season
    were 0.67 and 0.36 for the first and second years, respectively. This trend was
    also observed in the Kc analysis. With the difference between Kc and Kcb the resulted
    Ke values showed that soil evaporation contributed about 20% to the total mango
    orchard Ea. With values of Kcb, Ke and E0, the actual transpiration (Ta) and soil
    evaporation (Es) could be determined (see Table 2). Ta for both seasons followed
    the fluctuations in Ea. Table 2. Summary of water-use variables for mango orchard

    A more in-depth physical explanation of mango Ea can be obtained if the aerodynamic
    (ra) and bulk surface (rs) resistances are derived. Fig. 9 shows the seasonal
    variation in ra and rs for the growing seasons of 2003–2004 (a) and 2004–2005
    (b) calculated from λE measurements. The highest values of ra coincided with the
    lowest values of rs and they occurred during the rainy periods. The relatively
    low ra values of approximately 35 s m−1 can be directly ascribed to the tall trees
    with 5.5 m averaged height. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Seasonal
    trends of surface (rs) and aerodynamic (ra) resistances for the first (a) and
    the second (b) growing seasons of mango orchard. The seasonal behaviour of rs
    followed the dryness of the lower part of the atmosphere with some peaks associated
    with high values of vapour pressure deficit (D) in both seasons. The value of
    rs were on average 135 s m−1, which explains that the mango Ea is lower than for
    grass as the reference crop (for which rs is assumed to be 70 s m−1). These relatively
    high rs values can be ascribed to absence of a ground cover crop and the relatively
    dry air. Yet rs can also vary with soil water content and soil hydraulic conductivity
    close to the roots. The increase of rs with high values of water vapour deficit
    (D) has been reported by Testi et al. (2006) in olive orchard in Spain. According
    to Rana et al. (2005), rs is not a constant, they confirm that it varies depending
    on D, but also depends on the available energy to the crop. Alves and Pereira
    (2000) used the so-called climatic resistance that is directly proportional to
    D for lettuce crop, to explain variations in λE. If there is sufficient soil moisture
    to avoid water stress, conditions of high D together with low values of aerodynamic
    resistances (ra) promote high rates of Ea, which make the values of rs lower and
    this is the case of irrigated mango orchards growing in the semi-arid conditions
    of São Francisco River basin. The main reasons for differences in orchard water
    variables between our study and some others cited above can be attributed to different
    species, varieties, climate, soil type, irrigation systems and frequency of irrigation,
    cultural management, methods of determination of evapotranspiration and also the
    plant density that affect the soil cover. 3.7. Soil water balance Irrigated soils
    in the central São Francisco River basin have experienced declines in productivity,
    which may be a reflection of changes in soil chemical properties due to management
    (Heck et al., 2003). The water flow in the unsaturated zone needs to be properly
    understood for assessing sustainability. The monthly soil water balance for the
    mango orchard is presented in Table 3, while the seasonal variation is presented
    in Fig. 10. Table 3. Monthly soil water balance of irrigated mango trees during

    full-size image Fig. 10. Soil water balance into the root zone for the first (a)
    and second (b) growing seasons in mango orchard: precipitation (P); irrigation
    (I); deep percolation (DP); capillary rise (CR) and actual evapotranspiration
    (Ea). The percolation flow can be as high as 50 mm per week (or 200 mm month−1)
    following periods of rain storms. This flow can be regarded as happening at a
    depth of 140 cm below natural ground surface. The largest fluctuations in percolation
    are found during the rainy season (see Fig. 10b). The highly permeable soils have
    a great drainage capacity that ensures that soil moisture is not rising and that
    excessive moisture percolates downwards. This is in agreement with the general
    soil water requirements of mango orchard; hence it has been a good choice to cultivate
    this fruit crop in the soils and climate of Petrolina-PE. The latter is confirmed
    from the soil moisture changes. Table 3 shows that the changes across a month
    are 30 mm at maximum. The soil water balance as defined in Eq. (5) could be computed
    only for the period in which soil moisture of the layers and Ea were measured.
    The percolation flows are rather conserved during the irrigation season and outside
    the rainy season. During dry periods, the measurements suggest that capillary
    rise provided extra water to the root zone. This last process can be established
    only if the 120 cm deep moisture layer is wetter that the 100 cm layer. This indeed
    sometimes occurred, especially after the end of the rainy period during the first
    growing season, when the time without irrigation during this period was longer
    than in the second season (see Fig. 3, Fig. 10). Seasonal percolation could be
    computed as being around 300 mm, considering the rate of 0.8 mm day−1, from the
    data during the second growing season (Table 3), and a mean duration for the two
    seasons of 380 days. This is a substantial return flow of the irrigation system
    that to a large degree is manageable. Irrigation conservation could reduce the
    percolation. An example of stress induced soil water content is described in Nadler
    et al. (2006). The limited distance of 5.5 km from the river ensures that most
    return flow is drained to the São Francisco. The significant percolation flow
    transports the solutes down to the groundwater. Both groundwater quality and the
    soil health need to be controlled. 3.8. Irrigation performance and crop water
    productivity Knowledge of the water balance allows the evaluation of irrigation
    performance and water productivity. Irrigation performance has been introduced
    to describe the hydrological behaviour of irrigation systems by means of simple
    understandable ratios, which involve agro-meteorological data, water delivered
    and water consumed (Bos et al., 2005). The crop water productivity indicators
    are summarized in Table 4, Table 5 according to the crop stages and growing seasons.
    The water indicator RWS found for the mango orchard showed the presence of a gap
    between crop water demands and supply for some crop stages, which was more pronounced
    during the first growing season. The main reason could be due to irrigation management
    during the rainy period. The farmer stopped the irrigation at crop stages between
    branch development and flowering which coincided with the rainy period for both
    seasons. The time without irrigation in the first season was longer than during
    the second. For the first season the values of RWS were in the range from 0.41
    to 1.45 and for second they were in the range from 0.86 to 1.21. The indicator
    CWD showed some deficit during branch development-flowering stages, having totals
    of 73–95 mm for the first and second growing seasons, respectively, evidence of
    a very low water shortage, that agrees with the finding of a constant wetted root
    zone. Table 4. Actual (Ea) and potential (Ep) evapotranspiration, crop water deficit

    covariance measurements yielded mean RWS of 1.13 and 1.05 for the first and second
    growing seasons. In general RWS greater than one could be taken as an advantage
    from the point of view of securing the crop water requirements as well as groundwater
    recharge. These numbers imply that approximately 10% more irrigation water was
    supplied than was necessary to meet the crop water requirements. This is according
    to best practice as some of the irrigation water will unavoidably leak away from
    the orchard. The optimum value for relative water supply would be 0.80, because
    CWP increases with water stress. This case study showed that for the period vegetative
    growth–branch development of mango growing seasons, more water should be saved
    from reduced supplies, while care should be taken after the rainy period where
    more water should be given as the water quickly percolates away. A reduction of
    irrigation water in April to July will also reduce the drainage effluents and
    prevent nutrients and chemical leaching away from the root zone. Table 4 shows
    that the second growing season had a very constant and ideal RWS value around
    1.0. The irrigation was less during the rainy season and much higher during the
    dry season from July to October. During the first growing season, irrigation management
    could have been much better: there was over-irrigation during branch development
    and under-irrigation during flowering. It is interesting to study the impact of
    water stress during flowering on the final fruit yield. Mango yields vary with
    the cultivar and the age of the tree. A well-managed orchard may yield 200–300
    fruits per tree. Old trees in Java are known to produce 1000–1500 fruits per tree.
    In Puerto Rico, mango yield varies among 29–67 tonne ha−1 (Morton, 1987). The
    average mango yield in Florida is 30 tonne ha−1. The statistical average mango
    yield in Petrolina during 1998 was 20.8 tonne ha−1. The mango yields in our investigation
    ( ) were 41.6 and 48.4 tonne ha−1 for the first and second growing season, respectively.
    This difference between the two growing seasons can likely be ascribed to the
    water stress during flowering in the first growing season. According to the growing
    seasons, the values were 4.76 and 4.30 kg m−3 and the , values were 2.79 and 3.60
    kg m−3. When the crop water productivity was analyzed based on actual transpiration
    only following plant physiological mechanisms, values were 3.57 and 5.38 kg m−3.
    This type of bio-physical water productivities are generally higher than for arable
    crops (essentially from 0.5 to 1.5 kg m−3 for wheat and rice; see Zwart and Bastiaassen,
    2004) but comparable to grapes ( is 3.8 kg m−3; Teixeira et al., 2007) that both
    contain a high moisture content of the fresh product (approximately 75–80%). The
    monetary component of crop water productivity (CWP$) was also computed per unit
    irrigation ( ), actual evapotranspiration ( ) and actual transpiration ( ). The
    was 4.86 and 4.39 US$ m−3 for the first and second growing seasons, respectively.
    In relation to the values were 2.85 and 3.68 US$ m−3. For transpiration, the was
    3.65 and 5.50 US$ m−3 (see Table 5). An economic water productivity of 3–4 US$
    m−3 per unit of water depleted is almost a factor 20 more than for irrigated staple
    crops. The agricultural water usage in the semi-arid region of São Francisco river
    basin is thus highly productive, besides also providing jobs in the agri-business,
    which is a stimulus for rural development of the region. 4. Conclusions Because
    of the importance of the water management in fruit crops, daily and seasonal water-use
    patterns of a large commercial mango orchard were collected. The results presented
    in this paper are important for irrigation management, water allocation, water
    savings and environmental sustainability of irrigated mango orchards. Despite
    the aerodynamically rough surface with the crowns of mango trees exceeding 5 m,
    the actual ET of the mango orchard is less than for grass as a reference crop
    (kc = 0.91). The underlying reason is the presence of a relatively large bulk
    surface resistance (135 s m−1) due to presence of older leaves, shadow in the
    crown, distance between trees for mechanical access and the absence of a ground
    cover crop. In the commercial farm investigated, soil moisture, evaporative fraction,
    crop water deficit and relative water supply were kept at ideal levels, especially
    considering the values for the entire growing seasons. The drawback of a wet light
    textured soil is the capacity to percolate excessive water resources. The annual
    percolation flow was 300 mm, and this is a threat to groundwater contamination
    and soil salinity build up, if drainage is not given proper attention. The bio-physical
    and economical water productivities of mango are very high. An economic water
    productivity of US$ 2.90–3.70 m−3 is an order of magnitude better than for staple
    crops. Hence from a scarce water resources point of view, water allocation to
    irrigated mango orchards is desirable. Although this water usage is highly productive,
    the environmental consequences must be considered keeping irrigated horticulture
    in pace with sustainability requirements. The challenge is to find a balance between
    water productivity and environmental pollution. Acknowledgements The research

    and content Highlights • The wine grape industry in south Mediterranean Europe.
    • Advances in the understanding of grapevine responses to water stress and heat.
    • Agronomic strategies in modern viticulture in dry areas. • Sustainable water
    use in the vineyard and winery. • Water use indicators in wine production. Abstract
    Water is now considered the most important but vulnerable resource in the Mediterranean
    region. Nevertheless, irrigation expanded fast in the region (e.g. South Portugal
    and Spain) to mitigate environmental stress and to guarantee stable grape yield
    and quality. Sustainable wine production depends on sustainable water use in the
    wine’s supply chain, from the vine to the bottle. Better understanding of grapevine
    stress physiology (e.g. water relations, temperature regulation, water use efficiency),
    more robust crop monitoring/phenotyping and implementation of best water management
    practices will help to mitigate climate effects and will enable significant water
    savings in the vineyard and winery. In this paper, we focused on the major vulnerabilities
    and opportunities of South European Mediterranean viticulture (e.g. in Portugal
    and Spain) and present a multi-level strategy (from plant to the consumer) to
    overcome region’s weaknesses and support strategies for adaptation to water scarcity,
    promote sustainable water use and minimize the environmental impact of the sector.

    industry in south Mediterranean Europe World’s wine production sites are located
    in a wide geographical and climatic range, often in mid-latitude regions characterized
    by climate variability and stressful environments, such as the Mediterranean region
    (Fraga et al., 2013, Lionello et al., 2014). The European Union (EU-28), is the
    world’s leader in wine production with about 50% of world’s vine-growing area
    and about 60% of total volume of production (USDA, 2014). France, Italy, Spain,
    Germany and Portugal are the five leading EU wine producers and altogether they
    represent 90% of EU production (USDA, 2014). Spain has the largest vineyard area
    in the world (950,541 ha in 2014) with an increasing irrigated area (36% of the
    total, in 2014) (MAGRAMA, 2014) (Fig. 1). Portugal is the EU’s 5th largest wine
    producer with a total of 6.7 Mhl in 2013 and it has a cultivated area estimated
    to be about 224,000 ha (IVV, 2015). In 2010, the irrigated area was estimated
    in 15% of the total area of vineyards (INE, 2010). However, irrigation continued
    expanding in the recent years in Portugal, in particular in the Alentejo region,
    and presently, the percentage of irrigated vines should be higher and around 20%.
    Mediterranean fresh water resources are under high pressure due to fast-growing
    population, increased water scarcity, extreme climate variability and intensive
    water use in agriculture, industry and tourism activities (Lange et al., 2005,
    Costa et al., 2007, EEA, 2012a, EEA, 2012b, Lereboullet et al., 2013a, Lereboullet
    et al., 2013b, Blum, 2014). Water is now considered by EU experts as the most
    important but vulnerable resource in the Mediterranean region (EU-ERANETMED, 2014).
    In addition, climate scenarios for South Mediterranean Europe are not favourable
    for agriculture. The predicted lower precipitation, higher air and soil temperatures,
    more frequent and longer extreme climate events (e.g. heat waves, extreme drought)
    (IPCC, 2013) will negatively affect viticulture in the region (Chaves et al.,
    2010, Rogiers and Clarke, 2013, Teskey et al., 2014, Lionello et al., 2014). Download

    y Rendimientos de cultivos en España, ESYRCE, Spanish Agriculture Ministry 2014.
    In Europe, irrigation of vineyards is below 10% of the total area, but the tendency
    towards irrigation is increasing to mitigate the effects of climate change and
    more stressful environment. Irrigation has therefore expanded in dry regions of
    France, Spain, Portugal and Italy (Intrigliolo and Castel, 2008, Seguin, 2010,
    USDA, 2013, Fraga et al., 2013, Barisan et al., 2014, De Leo et al., 2015). Meanwhile,
    agriculture in South Mediterranean Europe is increasingly subjected to more restrictive
    legislation at both EU and individual country levels namely in terms of water
    use regulation and water conservation. Next we present some of the major constrains
    and opportunities experienced by South European wine industry, focusing on Spain
    and Portugal. 1.1. Constraints (environment and socio-economic) An important vulnerability
    of rainfed agriculture in the Mediterranean is the combination of high air temperature
    and water deficit coupled to marked inter-annual and intra-annual climate variability
    and scarce water resources (Costa et al., 2007, Lopes et al., 2014, Rogiers and
    Clarke, 2013, Valverde et al., 2015). In the case of Vitis vinifera, Mediterranean
    climate may limit yield and berry quality because most of the berry growth and
    ripening period occurs under conditions of high air temperature and soil water
    deficit (Medrano et al., 2003, Chaves et al., 2007, Chaves et al., 2010, Lereboullet
    et al., 2013a,b; 2014). In rainfed Mediterranean viticulture, water stress can
    be particularly severe during summer mainly if previous winter and spring seasons
    are dry. This situation is often reported for the Mediterranean zones of the Iberian
    Peninsula (e.g. Alentejo wine region in years 2003 and 2005). Moreover, Mediterranean
    viticulture is increasingly exposed to climate extremes (e.g. maximum temperatures
    and heat waves) (EASAC, 2013, Fraga et al., 2013, Hannah et al., 2013, Lereboullet
    et al., 2013a,b; Lionello et al., 2014). Not only extreme air temperatures but
    also high soil temperatures can be potentially negative for berry and leaf/canopy
    physiology. In fact, soil temperature (Ts) in Southern European countries can
    easily reach values above 50 °C along the day (Fig. 2). High soil temperature
    not only influences root activity and root growth but may also negatively impacts
    leaf/canopy photosynthesis, as well as diurnal and nocturnal stomatal conductance
    (Rogiers and Clarke, 2013). Temperature determines berry composition and quality
    by influencing the ripening process, berry biochemistry and synthesis/degradation
    of certain compounds such as anthocyanins or polyphenols (Mori et al., 2007, Teixeira
    et al., 2013, Zarrouk et al., 2015). High berry temperatures (>35 °C) may inhibit
    anthocyanins synthesis and induce their degradation (Bergqvist et al., 2001, Spayd
    et al., 2002). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Visible (on the left)
    and false colored IR thermal image (on the right) from two rows and the inter
    row (3m wide) of 12 year-old vines of the variety Aragonez (Syn. Tempranillo),
    in a commercial vineyard, in Reguengos de Monsaraz, southern Portugal (38°23′55.00″N,
    7°32′46.00″W). Measurements were done at around 14.30 h on 24 July 2014, by using
    a Flir ThermaCAM B20, 240 × 320 pixels (ϵ = 0.96) under the following environmental
    conditions: Tair = 28.3 °C, Air RH = 40%, VPD = 2.8 KPa; Wind speed = 2.8 ms−1;
    Global radiation = 800 Wm−2. Temperature of selected area 1 (A1) (Tc sunlit side)
    = 27.4 ± 1.1 °C, Temperature of selected area 2 (A2) (Tc shadow side) = 26.8 ±
    1.1 °C, Temperature of selected area 3 (A3) (soil surface) = 37.1 ± 2.5 °C. Portugal
    is relatively well endowed in terms of water resources. However, these resources
    are unevenly distributed with marked difference between the rainy and cooler North
    and central Atlantic regions of the country and the dry and warmer South, inland
    regions (e.g. Alentejo). The same occurs with Spain which presents large differences
    in terms of water reserves and precipitation between the Atlantic and Northern
    regions and the southern Mediterranean regions. In Portugal, irrigated viticulture
    expanded mostly in the southern part of the country (Península de Setúbal, Alentejo,
    Algarve) but now other wine regions (e.g. Tejo, Douro Superior) are also now being
    punctually irrigated to face more stressful summer conditions (Fraga et al., 2013,
    Lopes et al., 2014). Spanish vineyards have been traditionally dry-farmed because
    irrigation was forbidden by law until 1996. Nowadays, irrigation is still not
    permitted in most of the “Denominaciones de Origen (DO)”, and just like in Portugal,
    irrigation is only allowed under specific circumstances and after the technical
    allowance from Regional wine Commissions. However, vineyards in areas out of the
    DO control can be irrigated without any restriction. Although irrigation has increased
    dramatically in Spanish viticulture (Fig. 1), there are still authors questioning
    whether this is an environmentally sustainable trend in semi-arid areas such as
    regions of central and southern Spain (Intrigliolo and Castel, 2008, Romero et
    al., 2010, Medrano et al., 2015). Ground water resources in the Mediterranean
    also deserve more attention. Indeed, they contribute to 20–100% of the water used
    in European irrigated farms, depending on the region and country. Besides the
    ongoing climate change is expected to limit recharge of aquifers due to reduced
    precipitation and to increased water abstraction to support larger irrigation
    needs and to minimize the problem of lower quality surface waters (Costa et al.,
    2007, Goderniaux et al., 2009, Stigter, 2012, Baudron et al., 2014, Carreira et
    al., 2014). Also, in most of the EU countries, groundwater users pay no tariff
    to water authorities and only few countries (France, Netherlands, Denmark, England
    and Wales) do charge a water abstraction fee (OECD, 2010). Vulnerability and adaptive
    capacity of the Mediterranean viticulture is also linked to socio-economical aspects
    (Strano et al., 2013, Lereboullet et al., 2012). For example, the small size of
    most of the companies results in limited budgets and restricted innovation with
    limited capacity to accommodate new legislation requirements for environment or
    new market trends related to quality (ECOPROWINE, 2014). In addition, fluctuations
    in the wine markets poses a limitation to Mediterranean viticulture and affect
    mostly smaller companies. Another limitation is the lack of information and perception
    of risks by growers and managers of smaller companies which restrict changes in
    terms of adoption of novel agronomic strategies or technologies to mitigate climate
    change and respond to changes in consumer demand and to more restrictive legislation
    on water use. The lack of labour force can also be a problem in certain Mediterranean
    wine regions and therefore the use of emigrant labour force became common in Spain,
    Portugal or France following the trends observed in other intensive production
    agricultural systems (greenhouse horticulture) (FAO, 2013, Costa et al., 2014).
    Lack of statistical information concerning water use and management in the Mediterranean
    hinders proper policy decision on aquifer management, irrigation, pollution emissions
    from either surface or subsurface (Albiac, 2005; EEA, 2012a). In fact, we may
    still find data collections and assessments with large data gaps, lack of harmonization
    in estimation and data quality assurance methodologies (EEA, 2012a). 1.2. Opportunities
    Regarding the opportunities for Mediterranean viticulture, the large historical
    and cultural relevance of the crop and related activities is particularly visible
    in Spain and Portugal, where the crop is being cultivated for centuries. This
    results in a large cultural tradition, available empirical knowledge, variety
    selection and large diversity of autochthonous varieties (Tapia et al., 2007,
    Gonçalves and Martins, 2015, Fraga et al., 2015). Portugal has a large genetic
    variability which has been stored in a network of both commercial and public vineyards.
    Recent set of actions were taken by the Portuguese Association for Grapevine Diversity
    (PORVID) to safeguard such genetic heritage and organize Portuguese biodiversity.
    A prospection and conservation project has been carried out with the principal
    objective of building a full-diversity in vivo library of the Portuguese grapevine
    heritage (Martins, 2011, Gonçalves and Martins, 2015). Similarly over the last
    few years, many regions of Spain have developed several projects focused on the
    prospection, characterisation and conservation of autochthonous varieties. The
    “Instituto Madrileño de Desarrolo Agrario” (IMIDRA) takes care of the official
    ampelographic collection of grapevines in Spain, and coordinates most of these
    projects. The production of premium and super-premium wines give an Iberian viticulture
    a competitive advantage over other worldwide competitors. The multiplicity of
    genotypes and “terroirs” makes the Iberia Peninsula a unique region for wine production
    and has generated a large number of high quality vintage wines that had won several
    accolades worldwide. The multiple South European Mediterranean “terroirs” (e.g.
    Vinhos Verdes, Douro, Dão, Alentejo, Rias Baixas, Rioja, Ribera de Duero, Balearic
    Islands) and specific varieties (e.g. the Touriga Nacional, or the “Tempranillo”)
    make it possible to create unique monovarietal wines or novel blends with particular
    tastes and aromas, which gives major competitive advantage to the Mediterranean
    wine sector. Wine industry is one of the most innovative sub sectors of the EU
    agribusiness and there is a strong commitment of the EU translated into major
    investments in research and technology with a clear focus on sustainable viticulture.
    This is the case of major EU financed projects related to the wine sector such
    as EU-INNOVINE or ECOPROWINE. Additionally, cooperation between the Universities
    and private companies is also being promoted by EU projects. In parallel, Portuguese
    and Spanish authorities are promoting the image of Iberian wines abroad which
    permitted to increase exports and guarantee higher financial income for both countries
    (USDA, 2013, MAGRAMA, 2014, IVV, 2015). Finally, the increase in multiple and
    more demanding export markets is putting pressure on Portuguese and Spanish wine
    industry forcing local vineyards and wineries to a higher commitment on more environmentally
    sustainable practices, similarly to what is occurring in other important wine
    regions worldwide (Sinha and Akoorie, 2010, Berghoef and Dodds, 2011, CWSA, 2011,
    Retallack, 2012, Retallack, 2013, Fusi et al., 2014, Gerling, 2015, De Leo et
    al., 2015, Radke et al., 2015) or to other horticultural commodities (Torrellas
    et al., 2013, FAO, 2013). 2. Advances in the understanding of grapevine responses
    to heat stress and drought 2.1. Stomata, leaf temperature and water use efficiency
    Tolerance/resistance to drought and heat stress involves combination of several
    traits and mechanisms that can be morpho-anatomical, physiological and hydraulic
    (Chaves et al., 2010, Carvalho et al., 2015). Understanding the physiology and
    biochemistry related to stomatal regulation and their response to abiotic stress
    (e.g. drought) is crucial to understand plant responses to the environment and
    to improve plant water relations and WUE (Roelfsema and Kollist, 2013, Tsegay
    et al., 2014). Besides, stomatal regulation in grapevine varies with the genotype
    (Costa et al., 2012, Tomás et al., 2014a) and identically, we find large intra-specific
    variability for intrinsic WUE (Bota et al., 2001, Gaudillère et al., 2002, Koundouras
    et al., 2008, Rogiers et al., 2011, Tomás et al., 2012). Improved WUE can result
    in water savings at both plant and crop levels, but scaling-up from single leaves
    to crop is not a straightforward process (Medrano et al., 2015). In fact, previous
    research showed that improvements in leaf-level WUE may not always translate into
    higher crop WUE or higher yield (Condon et al., 2004). Actually, WUE is a complex
    multi-trait phenotype related with stomatal control and also with leaf structure,
    leaf biochemistry and leaf diffusive properties (e.g. mesophyll conductance) (Tomás
    et al., 2014b, Gago et al., 2015). Differences in WUE behaviour between grapevine
    genotypes/varieties depend on other traits such as hydraulic and hormones as reported
    for model and crops species (Matzner and Comstock, 2001, Pantin et al., 2013,
    Torres-Ruiz et al., 2014). In parallel with studies on WUE, a better comprehension
    of how plants regulate their leaf/canopy temperature in relation to stomatal behavior
    is equally relevant to improve adaptation/resistance to longer periods of heat
    and drought stress. Grapevine is considered a drought resistant species due to
    an efficient control of stomatal aperture in response to soil and air water deficits
    (Chaves et al., 2010, Costa et al., 2012). This behavior can be a protective strategy
    against excessive water loss and xylem cavitation (Chaves et al., 2010, Lovisolo
    et al., 2010) but such stomatal phenotype can also result in reduced evaporative
    cooling and consequent abnormal increase of leaf temperature (Tleaf) under extreme
    conditions (high air temperatures and soil water deficits). In fact, under typical
    South Europe Mediterranean conditions (e.g. Alentejo Portuguese wine region, South
    Portugal), canopy temperatures can easily reach values largely above the range
    considered optimum for grapevine photosynthesis (25–30 °C) (Costa et al., unpublished
    results). Extended periods of supra-optimal temperatures can give rise to damage
    in the photosynthetic apparatus with negative effects on WUE (Sinclair et al.,
    1975, Tambussi et al., 2007). According to Sinclair et al. (1975) this may occur
    via: (1) an increase in transpiration due to the exponential increase in saturated
    water vapor density inside the leaf that increases water vapor gradient between
    the leaf and the outside air; (2) an increase in leaf respiration rates as Tleaf
    increases, with negative effect on net CO2 assimilation. Tambussi et al. (2007)
    states that for cereal crops a potential gain in instantaneous WUE (WUEinstantaneous
    = AN/E) at leaf level may be less marked when the decrease in stomatal conductance
    to water vapour is linked to higher Tleaf and thus increased transpiration per
    stomatal conductance unit (Condon et al., 2002). Tambussi et al. (2007) also states
    that an increased Tleaf could induce penalties in yield and eventually in WUEyield
    in situations where the evaporative cooling effect of transpiration is important
    (Reynolds et al., 2001). Therefore, higher Tleaf and boundary layer effect may
    pose limitations to the ‘scaling-up’ of WUE from leaf to crop level. For instance,
    it has been pointed out that modern irrigation systems in which mild to moderate
    water stress is applied (improving WUE by partial stomatal closing) could have
    a lower effect than expected in crops with dense canopies (Kang and Zhang, 2004).
    This can partly apply to the case of V. vinifera. Finally, high Tleaf can result
    in accelerated leaf senescence with accelerated leaf abscission, which in the
    case of grapevines grown in hot climates could end in quality and yield losses
    due to over-exposure of berries to light. Therefore, breeding and selection of
    grapevine for typical Mediterranean semi-arid conditions should focus on a compromise
    between high WUE and leaf cooling (Chaves et al., 2010, Costa et al., 2012). 2.2.
    Morpho-hydraulics and water transport Leaf hydraulics is a key component of plants
    adaptation strategy in response to the environment. Recent studies in grapevine
    showed that hydraulic conductivity of leaves (Kleaf) and of stem (Kstem) contributes
    to variation among varieties regarding their response to soil water deficit and
    the recovery response to drought (Schultz and Stoll, 2010, Coupel-Ledru et al.,
    2014, Hochberg et al., 2015, Martorell et al., 2015). The observed intra-specific
    variation in Kleaf can reflect differences in leaf morpho-anatomy (Nardini et
    al., 2012) and in water pathways through the outside xylem to the water evaporation
    sites. Contrary to water transport systems, leaf vein systems show great variation
    in arrangement, density, vascular bundle features and xylem conduits within the
    bundles (Sack and Scoffoni, 2012). In grapevine, leaf water movement suggested
    to be influenced by mesophyll architecture which contributes to water flux in
    the mesophyll and water evaporation at the cell wall surface (Tomás, 2012; Flexas
    et al., 2013). On the other hand, Martorell et al. (2015) found in two V. vinifera
    cultivars (Tempranillo and Grenache) that leaf vulnerability at 50 % and 80% loss
    of Kleaf (P50 and P80) as well as the maximum Kleaf decreased seasonally by more
    than 20%. However, Kleaf plasticity along leaf lifespan was different between
    the two cvs. Only the cv Tempranillo showed an increase of Kleaf at −2 MPa in
    the months of June and July, while osmotic potential at full turgor was lower
    in Tempranillo than in Grenache. They showed as well that leaf resistance to hydraulic
    dysfunction is cultivar dependent and also a seasonal plastic trait that can be
    mediated by osmotic adjustment (Martorell, 2014, Martorell et al., 2015). Regarding
    root traits, root hydraulics and morphology are two determinant traits influencing
    grapevine water relations. Higher hydraulic conductivity correlates well with
    higher drought tolerance of grapevine rootstocks (Schultz, 2003, Zufferey et al.,
    2011, Serra et al., 2014). Vigorous rootstocks showed larger hydraulic conductivity
    of fine roots, which is partly attributed to aquaporin expression and activity
    (Gambetta et al., 2013). Root system morphology (root distribution and depth)
    depends on the interaction between the rootstock genotype and the surrounding
    environment (soil texture, bulk density and salinity, water and nitrogen availability,
    planting density and climatic conditions) (Koundouras, 2008). Grapevine roots
    have larger xylem vessels than those of stems, which causes them to be more prone
    to xylem cavitation (Lovisolo et al., 2008). It has been suggested that the adjusting
    capacity of roots to supply water relative to shoot transpiration demand is a
    major means for woody perennial plants to tolerate drought and it is often expressed
    as changes in leaf to root area ratio (Alsina et al., 2011). Different combinations
    of xylem vulnerability to cavitation with stomatal kinetics results in multiple
    degrees of isohydry/anisohydry in various plant species/cultivars (Tombesi et
    al., 2014). These authors suggest that V. vinifera near-isohydric and anisohydric
    genotypes differ in terms of xylem vulnerability to cavitation as well as in terms
    of petiole hydraulic conductivity, and that coordination of these traits results
    in different stomatal responses under water stress conditions. More recent findings
    on roots point out to the contribution of root-associated bacterial microbiome
    to grapevine adaptation to water stress by via increased root biomass and improved
    water absorption capacity (Rolli et al., 2014). This alternative way to promote
    drought resistance in grapevine demands more research to better comprehend the
    effects of soil microbiology on grapevine performance against stress. 2.3. Hormones
    and metabolites Contrary to hydraulic signals, the role of biochemical signals
    in stomatal regulation is well described (Schroeder et al., 2001, Pantin et al.,
    2013, Carvalho et al., 2015). Chemical signals with origin in roots are particularly
    important for grapevine adaptation to water especially at the early stages of
    stress (Schachtman and Goodger, 2008, Dodd, 2009, Tsegay et al., 2014, Tardieu
    et al., 2015). Cultivar-specific differences in stomatal control in response to
    drought have been attributed to differences in abscisic acid signaling and perception
    machinery (Soar et al., 2006, Perrone et al., 2012) and/or as a consequence of
    different patterns of aquaporins expression and/or activation (Vandeleur et al.,
    2009, Perrone et al., 2012, Pou et al., 2013). More recent studies point out the
    relevance of certain metabolites (e.g. polyols) in the adaptation to drought in
    grapevine. The impact of polyols on grape berry composition and plant response
    to water deficit was described for the variety Tempranillo grown in greenhouse
    and field conditions (Conde et al., 2015). Both sorbitol and mannitol limited
    size reduction of berry cells under drought (Conde et al., 2015). The authors
    suggested that grapevine cultivars which accumulate polyols as a tolerance mechanism
    to drought stress might have adaptive advantages under unfavourable growing conditions
    as they would require less water along the season to sustain yield and berry quality
    (Conde et al., 2015). It was also suggested that synthesis, transport and accumulation
    of sugar alcohols may work as bioindicators of plant health and acclimation and
    can be used as potential biomarkers in crop breeding (Merchant and Richter, 2011;
    Conde et al., 2015). 2.4. Stress-recovery responses An important component of
    the studies on plant stress responses is the analysis and comprehension of the
    efficacy and related underlying mechanisms involved in recovery from water stress
    following rehydration (Flexas et al., 2009, Bondada and Shutthanandan, 2012, Pou
    et al., 2012). Fast and efficient recovery from water stress is a key characteristic
    of the species/genotype adaptation to changing soil and air meteorological conditions
    (Perrone et al., 2012, Torres-Ruiz et al., 2014). This is highly relevant to understand
    grapevine capacity to overcome/recover from water stress after a rainfall event
    and when subjected to deficit irrigation in which successive cycles of water stress/recovery
    are imposed to vines (Pou et al., 2008, Lopes et al., 2014). Plant’s carbon balance
    during water stress and recovery cycles depends on the velocity and degree of
    photosynthetic recovery as well as on the degree and velocity of the photosynthetic
    decline during water depletion (Flexas et al., 2006). Plants subjected to severe
    water stress recover only 40–60% of their maximum photosynthesis rate during the
    first day after re-watering and maximum photosynthesis rates are often not recovered
    (Gallé and Feller, 2007; Pou et al., 2008). The severity of the previous water
    stress was shown to have a major influence on the velocity and extent of photosynthesis
    recovery in different species (Miyashita et al., 2005) including grapevine (Gómez-del-Campo
    et al., 2007, Pou et al., 2008, Flexas et al., 2009). Recovery of photosynthetic
    capacity after drought depends on restored xylem function although few data on
    grapevine exist to elucidate this type of coordination (Martorell, 2014). Knipfer
    et al. (2014) showed that responses to drought and recovery capacity involved
    the maintenance/recovery of xylem transport capacity in coordination with root
    pressure as well as leaf gas exchange responses. More research at molecular level
    on water stress recovery in grapevine is needed to explain grapevines’ genetical
    variability on hydraulic and leaf gas exchange traits in response to drought stress
    (Perrone et al., 2012, Coupel-Ledru et al., 2014). 3. Agronomic strategies in
    modern viticulture in dry areas 3.1. Water saving strategies Irrigation is one
    of the most effective tools to manipulate berry yield and quality in dry areas
    (Costa et al., 2007, Romero et al., 2010, Forbes et al., 2009, Flexas et al.,
    2009). Deficit irrigation (DI) based on the application of water below the water
    losses by the crop, has been largely pointed out as a reliable technique to improve
    water savings and productivity in grapevine (Santos et al., 2003, Chaves et al.,
    2007, Medrano et al., 2003, Medrano et al., 2015) (Table 1). The strategy involves
    soil drying and re-wetting cycles with varying frequencies and intensities during
    the growing cycle and is deliberately used to enhance crop WUE (Dodd et al., 2009).
    A specific case of deficit irrigation is partial root drying (PRD). Typically,
    in the PRD strategy one part of the root zone is irrigated at a time, with the
    wet and dry parts of the root system being periodically alternated to increase
    ABA signalling transiently and/or prevent excessive soil drying diminishing the
    transport of chemical signals to the shoot (Kang and Zhang, 2004, Dodd, 2009).
    PRD resulted in higher WUE, water savings and improved berry quality in grapevine
    (Santos et al., 2003, Souza et al., 2005). However, the PRD strategy involves
    more complex management and higher installation costs (e.g. double amount of irrigation
    tubes), making it less adequate for commercial use. Besides literature presents
    contrasting results for PRD, as function of the soil characteristics and genotype
    (Santos et al., 2003, Romero et al., 2012). Table 1. Non-exhaustive list of water

    (Skewes, 1998, COTR-ATEVA, 2009, CWSA, 2011, CWSA, 2012, CRCV, 2015, Retallack,
    2012, Retallack, 2013, SUSTAVINO, 2012, WATERWIKI, 2015, Radke et al., 2015).
    Although the general effects of deficit irrigation are well described in literature
    (Chaves et al., 2007, Dodd, 2009), it is still not fully covered how different
    genotypes perform in response to mild to severe water stress in combination with
    particular soil and atmospheric conditions. Genotypic heterogeneity of V. vinifera
    species forces growers and farm managers to look more carefully to the water use
    traits of the cultivars growing in their farms in order to tune water irrigation
    volumes in the different plots of the vineyard. In addition, the interaction between
    genotype and the rootstock and their compatibility is a highly relevant issue
    with major consequences for plant hydraulics and water transport, and thus, for
    stress resistance (Gökbayrak et al., 2007, Serra et al., 2014). The water reuse
    option can be considered as a cost-effective solution for Mediterranean agriculture.
    Water reuse reduces the need to develop new water resources and provides an adaptive
    solution to climate change and it has the advantage of valorising the social and
    environmental value of water by enhancing water resources availability and minimising
    wastewater outflow with additional environmental benefits (Lazarova et al., 2001,
    MED-EUWI, 2007, Raso, 2013). In many of the arid and semi-arid regions of the
    Mediterranean, recycled wastewater is being used as an affordable alternative
    resource for agricultural, industrial and urban non-potable purposes (Lazarova
    et al., 2001, Angelakis and Gikas, 2014). In countries like Australia and Israel,
    the use of recycled water is proving to be a viable alternate source of water
    for irrigation of crops (Angelakis and Gikas, 2014). The potential benefit can
    even be larger in case the wastewater treatment facilities are also expanded and
    optimized. In Spain, 408 hm3/year are reused (13% of total available water) of
    which 79% are for agricultural irrigation (320 hm3/year) (Raso, 2013). Waste water
    use might be employed to mitigate drought stress, but the short and mid-term detrimental
    effects of salt stress should be quantified. Non-conventional waters are source
    of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorous which may potentially modify
    berry composition and plant’s WUE (Bell and Henschke, 2005). Implementing effluent
    reuse projects results in extra applied loads of nutrients that must be carefully
    accounted for, due to the potential harmful effects on environment and/or plant
    performance (Paranychianakis et al., 2006). Together with environmental risks,
    the risks for human health must be also be studied and demand strict guidance
    and quality control (MED-EUWI, 2007). The use of recycled water needs to be better
    studied in viticulture (SARDI, 2009). 3.2. Canopy and soil management It has been
    shown that warming conditions results in an advance of phenological stages with
    flowering and veraison occurring earlier with respect to the baseline and in a
    shorter inter-phase time (Palliotti et al., 2014). There are also situations in
    which occurs a decoupling between anthocyanins and sugars accumulation. Grape
    ripening is generally accelerated as per increment of sugar accumulation into
    the berries which in turn can lead to higher alcohol content in the wine if harvest
    is not anticipated. Moreover, elevated temperatures are also known to induce negative
    effects on wine colour as a consequence of thermal decoupling of berry anthocyanins
    and sugars accumulation (Sadras and Moran 2012). There is an increasing number
    of domestic and foreign consumers preferring wines with moderate alcohol content.
    For wine making, significant benefits were described from comprehensive approaches
    to control shoot vigour through the use of different methods of winter pruning
    and canopy management such as shoot trimming or thinning (Smart, 1985). Shoot
    thinning is one of the most widely applied practices in vigorous vineyards to
    reduce canopy density, optimize sunlight interception, photosynthetic capacity,
    and fruit microclimate and ultimately improve fruit yield and wine quality. Soil
    management strategies (tillage vs non-tillage) can also induce changes in the
    canopy microclimate via indirect effects of water and nutrients competition on
    vine vegetative growth (Monteiro and Lopes, 2007). The aims of soil surface management
    in a typical Mediterranean vineyard are multiple encompassing improved weed management
    and soil conservation, the reduction of soil resource availability to control
    vine vigour and thus influencing berry composition and in wine quality (Monteiro
    and Lopes, 2007, Lopes et al., 2011, Guerra and Steenwerth, 2012). In Mediterranean
    conditions the most widely used soil management practices are soil cultivation
    in the inter-row combined with herbicides in the row or other control strategies
    more recommended in biological/organic vineyards. Living green ground covers (grass
    cover, sown or natural) are also used but not so often because of the concern
    of excessive water and nutrients competition between the swards and vines (Prichard,
    1998, Celette et al., 2008, Lopes et al., 2004, Lopes et al., 2011). Indeed when
    using cover crops in semi-arid areas, favourable effects can be counterbalanced
    by excessive water competition (Medrano et al., 2014, Lopes et al., 2011) especially
    if winter and spring periods are dry and/or irrigation water is scarce. The dual
    strategies involving soil tillage and the use of cover crops is still matter of
    debate and solutions are greatly linked to the concept of “terroir” (Pou et al.,
    2011, Lopes et al., 2014, Medrano et al., 2014). The effects of cover crops on
    grapevine vigour, yield and berry composition depend on the “terroir”, being either
    (i) beneficial to control vegetative growth and increase berry colour in the case
    of vigorous genotypes/varieties combined with high spring rainfall or (ii) detrimental,
    in case of low vigour genotypes/varieties and/or of semi-arid and/or extreme environments
    because they can result in an excessive reduction in vigour and yield (Pou et
    al., 2011). Since the impact of the competition between swards and vines changes
    along the season, extended trials are needed (Peterson et al., 2012) to assess
    the consequences of such type of management approach on vine longevity and in
    a specific ‘terroir’. 3.3. Selection of rootstocks and varieties resistant to
    drought and heat stress Among the possible adaptive agronomic measures to use
    in modern viticulture under the ongoing climate change conditions is the selection
    and cultivation of the best adapted rootstocks and varieties based on differences
    in temperature requirements for their cultivation (Jones et al., 2005) and WUE
    characteristics (Costa et al., 2012, Chaves et al., 2010, Tomás et al., 2014a).
    The right combination of variety/rootstock for a certain environment can determine
    drought and heat tolerance. Rootstocks influence vigour and drought tolerance
    via differences in root growth, root hydraulic capacity and also stomatal behaviour
    (Tandonnet et al., 2010, Cookson and Ollat, 2013, Pavloušek, 2013, Serra et al.,
    2014). Different rootstocks show varying capacities to extract soil water and
    transfer it to the scion (Soar et al., 2006), which can be attributed to different
    efficiency on water transport due to variable xylem vessels anatomy (De Herralde
    et al., 2006). Different rootstock genotypes show also different root traits (e.g.
    density and depth); deep and bushy root system permit larger uptake of water and
    nutrient and a more adequate response to drought and heat stress (Paranychianakis
    et al., 2006, Koundouras et al., 2008, Pavloušek, 2013, Tramontini et al., 2013).
    On the other hand, roots have large carbon requirements (e.g. high respiration
    represents 70–80% of the total carbon losses (Serra et al., 2014)). Therefore,
    genotypes with more efficient root systems would be a comparative advantage for
    dry regions and thinner soils as they would enable a more effective exploitation
    of soil resources with smaller carbon losses. 3.4. Precise plant monitoring and
    phenotyping Modern Precision Viticulture involves the use of technologies in which
    imaging, artificial vision and robotization/automation have a central role and
    can help to decrease costs and improve input use efficiency such as of water,
    fertilizers, biocides and energy. Precision Viticulture is based on technologies
    that are able to detect spatial heterogeneity of vineyards either due to intrinsic
    factors (soil and crop management) and/or external variables (climate) and that
    ultimately will determine inter-annual and intra-vineyard variability with regards
    to yield and quality output (Mazzeto et al., 2010, Matese et al., 2015, Jones
    and Grant, 2015). Manual ground-based and aerial manned and unmanned remote sensing
    measurements are being progressively implemented in modern viticulture not only
    in research but also in commercial vineyards to monitor plant stress and or to
    assess canopy and/or berry traits (Costa et al., 2010, Grant et al., 2007, Grant,
    2012, Fuentes et al., 2014, Fernández et al., 2013, Fernández et al., 2014, Jones
    and Grant, 2015). These new approaches combine the use of different types of detectors
    and spectral wavelengths ranging from visible (red, green, blue) (RGB) and infrared
    thermal imaging to multispectral and tomography measurements (Diago et al., 2012,
    Fuentes et al., 2012, Costa et al., 2013, Jones and Grant, 2015, Rustioni et al.,
    2014). Robots and unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been recently applied in
    precision viticulture (Baluja et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012, Gago et al., 2015). UAVs offer advantages relatively to ground based
    measurements. UAVs have high flexibility of use, low operational costs and a very
    high spatial resolution, that can be down to 1 cm (Matese et al., 2015, Gago et
    al., 2015). However, the legislation regulating their use in certain EU countries
    demands still clarification for a broader use in agriculture (Costa et al., 2013).
    Satellite imaging has also been used in grapevine studies namely to assess water
    stress (Consoli and Barbagallo, 2012) and intra-variability in vigour and leaf
    expansion (Matese et al., 2015, Jones and Grant, 2015) Soil monitoring is another
    relevant aspect of remote sensing. Assessment of soil water in field conditions
    must be accurate especially over large and heterogeneous surfaces. Electrical
    Resistivity Tomography meets these requirements for applications in plant sciences,
    agriculture and ecology (Brillante et al., 2014). Also the combined use of aerial
    and ground based thermal imaging permits to monitor soil water in vineyards (Soliman
    et al., 2013). These authors found that spatial patterns of soil moisture correlated
    better with thermal inertia data than with measured surface temperature and suggested
    to use it as a potential indicator for vineyard irrigation management. Optimizing
    the use of thermal and vegetation indexes as means to gather more robust information
    on crop water stress is another important component of crop monitoring based on
    thermography. Regarding plant phenotyping, since grapevine is a perennial field
    crop, acquisition of phenotypic data is almost restricted to the field and is
    usually carried out by visual estimation. This is time consuming and can be affected
    by subjectivity. Consequently, fully and/or partially automated phenotyping is
    needed to increase the number of samples monitored to manage grapevine repositories,
    to enable genetic research of novel phenotypic characteristics and ultimately
    to increase efficiency in grapevine phenotypying and breeding (Kicherer et al.,
    2015). Moreover, the available high-throughput phenotyping platforms can contribute
    to improve grapevine phenotyping and breeding (Kicherer et al., 2015). Phenotyping
    canopy traits can be simpler to perform by imaging than fruits and roots. Recent
    results in grapevine showed that visible RGB images permit to assess bunch compactness
    (Cubero et al., 2015) and a high-throughput image interpretation tool to acquire
    the number, diameter and volume of grapevine berries (Berry Analysis Tool—BAT)
    has been recently developed (Kicherer et al., 2013). Finally, cheaper and more
    user friendly technologies for crop monitoring and phenotyping are on demand.
    As an example, Fuentes et al. (2014) have recently proposed an inexpensive but
    robust automated computational method to obtain leaf area index and canopy vigour
    parameters from grapevines based on RGB imaging and video analysis with MATLAB.
    4. Sustainable water use 4.1. Sustainability standards and water use indicators
    The wine industry, just like any other intensive agribusiness activity or sector’s
    of industry has an environmental impact that must be obligatorily taken into account.
    Although wine production is one of the most innovative and competitive industries
    at global scale, the environmental issues remain overall poorly perceived (Barber
    et al., 2009, Marshall et al., 2005, Christ and Burritt, 2013). Therefore a more
    objective quantification of its environmental impact is crucial particularly in
    terms of water use. Water performance metrics involves a precise quantification
    of water inputs and outputs in the vineyard and winery making it easier to assess
    their environmental and economical performance (CWSA, 2011). Performance metrics
    also contributes to predict future water needs and expenses which is particularly
    relevant under unfavourable scenarios (stressful environments, water scarcity)
    and stricter environmental rules (CWSA, 2011). Unfortunately, numerous indexes
    available to classify “sustainability” of the wine sector shows that there are
    differences among countries which makes it more difficult to classify companies
    because of the differences in index composition and in the trait of sustainability
    under observation (Santini et al., 2013). In California, the use of metrics permitted
    the use of natural resources (water, energy) and helped to optimize vineyard operations,
    reduce costs and increase sustainability (CWSA, 2011) (Table 1). In New Zealand,
    vineyards and wineries can report water use per vineyard and per winery annually
    to the Sustainable Winegrowing New Zealand and this information will be used to
    establish benchmarks for members (www.nzwine.com). Australia in turn has been
    promoting for a long time, water use benchmarking of vineyards (Skewes, 1998,
    Walker and Boland, 2004) and in Portugal, the same approach was was carried out
    for Alentejo’s wine region (COTR-ATEVA, 2009). Skewes (1998) suggests a set of
    potential indicators for water use such as: (1) Yield (ton/ha); (2) Crop WUE (ton/water
    use); (3) Return per water applied; (4) Cost of water per tonne of fruit; (5)
    Irrigation efficiency; (6) Yield per volume of drainage (Ton/m3 of water) or (7)
    Cost of drainage per tonne of fruit (Euros/ton). In addition, the relationship
    of these water use indicators with major berry/wine quality attributes (e.g. sugar
    content, colour, flavour and aroma components) should be also considered in future
    audits. Benchmarking approaches would help to improve efficiency by setting a
    standard and a reference (Table 1) . However, we may have also to consider that
    some small farms and businesses are not willing to present their own results nor
    being evaluated by their counterparts. The use of more objective parameters and
    performance metrics are also needed for South European Mediterranean regions such
    as in Portugal and Spain. 4.2. Water foot print (WFP) and Life cycle analysis
    (LCA) The strong and growing trend towards industry certification in terms of
    environmental sustainability is being translated into concepts such as ecological
    footprint (Hoekstra et al., 2011, Ene et al., 2013, Lamastra et al., 2014). The
    concept of water footprint (WFP) emerged as a basic, theoretical, consumption-based
    indicator of water use and looks at both direct and indirect water use by a consumer
    or producer (Hoekstra et al., 2011). It is calculated by the volume of fresh water
    used to produce the product, measured over the various steps of the production
    chain (Hoekstra et al., 2011). For food crops, the WFP concept includes all the
    fresh water consumed per unit of product (e.g. per litre of wine), namely to grow
    the crop, the water used in post-harvest processing and also the polluted water
    produced (volume of freshwater required to assimilate the pollutants load). The
    WFP is being used to indicate the impacts of water use by production systems and
    there have been an increasing number of governments/companies recognising that
    reducing WFP is part of the country/corporation environmental strategy (Hoekstra
    and Mekonen, 2012, Herath et al., 2013). An important recent development is the
    fact that the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the
    International Standard ISO 14046, “Environmental management—Water footprint—Principles,
    requirements and guidelines”, which aims at providing decision makers in industry,
    government and non-governmental organizations with the means to estimate the potential
    impact of water use and pollution, based on a life-cycle assessment (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso14046_briefing_note.pdf).
    This has enlarged the set of indicators related to environment sustainability
    and water use and protection that ISO makes available for the industry. However,
    there are some authors arguing on the effectiveness of WFP as neither WFP is as
    accurate as a hydrological based approach nor a helpful indicator of water use
    and water management in agriculture (Perry, 2014). Therefore, the classical WFP
    requires more refinement for food groups, especially in the case of grapes and
    wine. In fact WFP should incorporate large regional/temporal variation for agricultural
    products due to the variable environmental context (Hoekstra et al., 2011, Maes
    et al., 2009, Berger and Finkbeiner, 2011, Vanham and Bidoglio, 2013), different
    agronomic strategies (e.g. irrigation vs non irrigated) or different growth and
    water use performance of genotypes which generates variation in evapotranspiration.
    This seems not to be sufficiently accounted in the classical calculations of WFP.
    Moreover, generalized values for WFP for a certain commodity can hide differences
    between regions and may mislead consumers and authorities (Maes et al., 2009,
    Perry, 2014). In addition, the classic WFP estimation has also limitations in
    the assessment of relevant water issues such as water quality and water pollution.
    Together with the WFP, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology provides a
    possible framework to evaluate environmental impacts of products and production
    systems across their entire lifespan and can be applied to durable, disposable
    or edible goods including food products (Notarnicola et al., 2012, Gazulla et
    al., 2010, Arzoumanidis et al., 2013, Arzoumanidis et al., 2014, Torrellas et
    al., 2013). The LCA is a standardized method which is in accordance to the ISO
    rules (ISO 14040:2006 and ISO14044:2006) (ISO, 2006, Barjoveanu et al., 2010,
    Finnveden et al., 2009, Teodosiu et al., 2012). There are still few literature
    studies on the environmental effects of wine production on a complete lifecycle
    perspective (Gazulla et al., 2010, Benedetto, 2013). These studies have shown
    that the major bottlenecks and environmental impacts in wine production refer
    to the viticulture phase and also to glass production for bottles. In fact, the
    largest percentage of water use in the wine supply chain relates to the cultivation
    phase whereas a minor percentage resides in the vinification and production of
    packaging materials (Ene et al., 2013). To guarantee a wider use of LCA information,
    there is a need to simplify LCA methodology and determination (Torrellas et al.,
    2013). This is especially true if we consider the characteristics of the wine
    sector in the Mediterranean characterised by a large number of small- and medium-sized
    Enterprises (SMEs) with limited knowledge or resources to implement the conventional
    full LCAs (Arzoumanidis et al., 2014). A simplified LCA tool is now available
    online, the eVerdEE tool (http://www.ecosmes.net/everdee/login2 (accessed on 10
    July 2014)) that allows its users to directly fill it in and obtain results with
    regard to the environmental performance of a product. This tool can be accessed
    for free, after registration (Arzoumanidis et al., 2014). 4.3. Legislation and
    statistics for sustainable water use Legislation and statistics on water use and
    management are essential to guarantee the optimal use of scarce resources. Five
    major categories of tools can help to implement and guarantee a proper management
    of water at regional and national levels: regulatory, enforcement, economic, participative
    and integrated (Medellín-Azuara et al., 2013) (See Table 2). In the case of EU,
    the main policy objectives in relation to water use and water stress were set
    out in the 6th Environment Action Programme (EAP) (1600/2002/EC) and the Water
    Framework Directive (WFD,2000/60/EC) whose major aim is to ensure the sustainable
    use of water resources. The more recent policy document is the ‘Blueprint to safeguard
    Europe’s water resources’ (COM/2012/0673) which aims at ensuring that good quality
    water of sufficient quantity, is available for all legitimate uses (EUROSTAT,
    2015). The “Blueprint” is a new strategy to reinforce water management in the
    EU and is closely related to the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular, to the roadmap
    for resource efficiency (EU Commission, 2014a, EU Commission, 2014b, EUROSTAT,
    2015). Concerning this topic, the EU Commission had already issued in 2007 a Communication
    on Water Scarcity and Droughts, establishing five pillars: (1) put right price
    tag on water, (2) promote more efficient water related technologies and practices,
    (3) improve drought risk management, (4) enhancing a water-saving culture and
    (5) improve knowledge and statistical data collection (EEA, 2012a, EEA, 2012b).
    However, EU’s architecture can be problematic for down-scaling water policies
    to national, regional and local levels, resulting in not common objectives among
    different EU members (Villarejo and Lopez, 2014). In Portugal, an implementation
    program for legislation on water issues has been put to effect (“Plano Português
    para Uso Eficiente de Água”) and Spain, in turn, put in place the so called “Plan
    Nacional del Agua”. Table 2. Indicative list of resources and policy tools to
    govern water management and water conservation. Resources and measures Description
    of the tools Water statistics • Water statistics are crucial to report obligations
    to international organizations (UNSD/UNEP, Eurostat/OECD) and to support EU and
    national management of environmental and socio–economic conditions for a more
    sustainable development Empty Cell • Robust water statistics will support a more
    correct use and implementation of different measures (regulatory, enforcement,
    economic, participative) Regulatory measures • Contains the instruments to conserve
    overexploited basins/aquifers by implementing prohibitions, reserves and regulations
    Enforcement measures • Involves enforcement regulations to control and manage
    the use of water and water discharge Empty Cell • Implementation based on field
    inspections, quality monitoring, auditing, sanctions for misconduct Economic measures
    • Use economic instruments (incentives) to implement novel water policies and
    regulations following the principle of “water user pays” and “polluter pays” Empty
    Cell • Use incentives that may include lower taxes for growers/wineries showing
    higher water use efficiency and more sustainable practices. The use of incentives
    to promote efficiency should be considered by both regional and central governments
    Empty Cell • Water pricing/charges applied on a volumetric basis Participative
    and integrative measures • It is a policy tool to promote community participation
    in planning, policy development and water management. It involves participation
    of water user associations, technical committees for water resources, representatives
    of different sectors (e.g. tourism, agribusiness, national and regional water
    management authorities). Empty Cell • Involves awareness-raising by stakeholders
    and dissemination of information/statistics concerning water. Sources: (EEA, 2012a,
    EEA, 2012b, EU Commission, 2014a, EU Commission, 2014b, D’Amore, 2005, Medellin-Azuara
    et al., 2013, Radke et al., 2015). Accurate statistics and estimation of water
    use and irrigation demands is a key requirement for precise water management (Maton
    et al., 2005) and a large scale overview on European water use can contribute
    to developing more correct water management policies and strategies. However,
    there is still a significant lack of water related statistical information for
    policy decision on aspects such as aquifer recharge, water abstraction by farmers,
    irrigation pollution emissions from either surface or subsurface water and soils
    (Albiac et al., 2005, EEA, 2012a, EEA, 2012b, Ferreira et al., 2015). In fact,
    Portugal lacks up-to-date statistics related to water and there is large discontinuity
    of data related to water uses and water masses (Ferreira et al., 2015). Unfortunately,
    the problem of scarcity, non homogeneous and disaggregated statistical data seems
    to be experienced by other Southern European countries as well (Albiac et al.,
    2005, EEA, 2012a, EEA, 2012b). 5. Consumer perspectives and marketing Consumer
    awareness of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking remains low and the concepts
    such as “sustainable product” or “sustainable processes” are confounded with vague
    terms e.g. “organic” and “green” (Zucca et al., 2009). However, the perception
    on the assessment of environmental and economic sustainability of wine’s supply
    chain by stakeholders is increasing and becoming a concern for growers, entrepreneurs,
    consumers and public decision makers (Point et al., 2012, Strano et al., 2013,
    Dawson et al., 2011, Fountain and Tompkins, 2011, Pullman et al., 2010, Radke
    et al., 2015). The wine industry should develop appropriate marketing strategies
    to help consumers to identify and distinguish between sustainable and non sustainable
    products (Zuca et al., 2009) and avoid any type of marketing practices that may
    mislead consumers about firm environmental performance or benefits of a certain
    product or service (so called “greenwashing”) (Delmas and Cuerel Burbano, 2011).
    This has the negative effect on consumers and investors’ confidence in environmentally
    friendly firms and products (Delmas and Cuerel Burbano, 2011) and jeopardizes
    efforts of stakeholders to build up a true and effective sustainability concept.
    In a recent transnational study, wineries have also complained about the lack
    of information existing among relevant organizations, producers and consumers
    in terms of environmental sustainability (Szolnoki, 2013). This requires increased
    cooperation between organizations/associations to optimize the flow of information
    in the wine supply chain (Christ and Burritt, 2013, Broome and Warner, 2008, Santini
    et al., 2013). 6. Final considerations Future scenarios for the Mediterranean
    viticulture encompasses approaches at different levels (from plant physiology
    to consumer behaviour) to guarantee a more economically and environmentally sustainable
    wine production. The sustainable use of water is of outmost importance and must
    be guaranteed at the vineyard, winery and regional levels (Table 1). Therefore,
    future strategies to optimize the environmental performance of the wine sector
    in the Mediterranean must be focused on water. This starts in the breeding for
    improved plant adaptation to heat and drought stress and ends in strategies to
    save water in the vinery and winery (Table 1). Robust water use statistics at
    both EU and national levels are needed. Also the correct use of indicators (WFP,
    LCA, ISO norms) coupled to effective water policies will help make the Mediterranean
    wine industry more efficient in terms of water use minimizing its environmental
    impact (Table 2). Improved crop performance under more stressful conditions of
    water by controlling grapevine water relations and canopy temperature should take
    place in parallel with optimized deficit irrigation and water reuse. Soil maintenance
    influencing soil and plant water relations as well as soil fertility and temperature
    will have impact on plant performance and berry quality. Nowadays, a large set
    of technologies is available for ground and aerial sensing but novel technologies
    must be better integrated and properly validated for different genotypes and for
    different strategies of plant and soil management. Low cost but effective remote
    sensing technologies would help to generalise their use by an increasing number
    of small companies and growers. Water statistics and improved performance metrics
    at the vineyard and winery are required to optimize water use along the supply
    chain. Proper audit programs to water use should be promoted by authorities, association
    or organizations related to wine supply chain. Consumer perception on wine industry
    impact on the environment tends to increase and requires novel approaches to operate
    in the wine supply chain. New concepts have been emerging in the modern viticulture
    namely the ecological footprint (water, carbon, social) and “vinecology”, which
    emphasises the need to integrate ecological and viticultural practices to guarantee
    nature conservation, landscape protection and diversity (Viers et al., 2013).
    In addition, wine tourism is now an important complement of wine production worldwide
    (Barber et al., 2009, Barber et al., 2010) including Portugal and Spain (Radke
    et al., 2015, Gómez and Molina, 2011). Landscape scenery and the environmental
    attractiveness have become major components of the wine tourism and must be also
    protected (Bruwer and Alant, 2009, Leddy, 2013, Dawson et al., 2011, Fountain
    and Tompkins, 2011). Therefore, tourism can be an extra trigger for farm and winery
    managers to implement best management practices in the vineyard and winery, and
    ultimately contribute to minimize the environmental impact of the wine industry.

    \ for water, the Chinese government has determined\nto promote water-saving irrigation\
    \ (WSI) followed by a range of institutional arrangements and\npolicy goals. Three\

    the design-bid funding mechanism mobilizing local governments by competitive grants\
    \ program,\nand the bottom-up participation mechanism transferring more irrigation\
    \ management responsibilities\nto end-users.\nAlthough the WSI management has\
    \ achieved notable improvements by the\ncombination of different mechanisms, conﬂicts\
    \ among different policy goals, uneven distribution of\nﬁnancial resources, and\
    \ insufﬁcient participation from water users caused the difﬁculty in aligning\n\
    stakeholders’ incentives. Approaches are needed to enable sustainable management\
    \ by coordinating\nincentives from different stakeholders in the management, as\
    \ well as incorporating end water users\nto assist decision-making.\nKeywords:\

    Shiyang River Basin\n1. Introduction\nChina encompasses almost 20% of the world’s\
    \ population with only 6% of the world’s fresh\nwater [1], leaving it with much\
    \ less water available per capita than most other countries. Over the past\nfew\
    \ decades, expanding agricultural production, increasing industrial output and\
    \ growing population\nwith more water-intensive lifestyles have all exacerbated\
    \ the scarcity of China’s available water\nresources [2]. Faced with growing competition\
    \ from urban and industrial sectors, the agricultural sector\nis likely to experience\
    \ serious water scarcity problems in the near future. These problems are aggravated\n\
    by the low economic output per cubic meter of water. Furthermore, socioeconomic\
    \ development\nwill require more food production [3], leading to the further demand\
    \ for water in agriculture.\nIn the meantime, the agricultural sector still consumes\
    \ the largest proportion of the county’s water\n(62.4% in 2016) [1], but with\
    \ a low level of water use efﬁciency. Speciﬁcally, the ratio of the volume of\n\
    water used productively by crops to the total quantity of water supplied was 0.55\
    \ in 2016, far behind\nthe developed world of 0.7–0.8 [1,3]. Thus, in response\
    \ to the increased competition for water, there is\ngreat potential for water-saving\
    \ irrigation (WSI) to achieve sustainable water use while maintaining\nagriculture\
    \ development in China.\nTo address the above concerns, various WSI technologies\
    \ have been developed to save water\nuse in agriculture from the supply of irrigation\
    \ water to its ﬁnal use on crops. Wang et al. [4] made\none of the earliest attempts\
    \ to summarize the various technologies, and divided them into two\ncategories:\
    \ engineering measures, such as canal lining, drip irrigation, and intermittent\
    \ irrigation;\nand agronomic practices, such as water-matched production, biological\
    \ water-saving technology,\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339; doi:10.3390/su9122339\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n2 of 17\nand\
    \ soil moisture conservation.\nWang et al. [5], on the other hand, divided WSI\
    \ technologies\ninto\nthree\ncategories:\ntraditional\ntechnologies,\nsuch\nas\n\
    border\nirrigation\nand\nfurrow\nirrigation;\nhousehold-based technologies, such\
    \ as using plastic sheeting and surface pipe;\nand community-based technologies,\
    \ such as drip irrigation, using underground pipe and canal lining.\nOther studies\
    \ have investigated the implementation of these technologies, their adoption,\
    \ real impacts,\nand the problems encountered in carrying them out.\nFor instance,\
    \ Deng et al. [6] discussed\nvarious biological mechanisms of the WSI technology\
    \ in the arid and semiarid areas of China;\nChai et al. [7] analyzed the implementation\
    \ of WSI technologies in China and its social, economic,\nand environmental impacts.\n\
    Zou et al. [8], Ingman et al. [9], Tang et al. [10], Feike et al. [11],\nKhor\
    \ et al. [12], and Mamitimin et al. [13] investigated the factors inﬂuencing the\
    \ adoption of some\nof the widely-implemented WSI technologies. Undoubtedly, the\
    \ practices of WSI technology are of\nbroad interest, with much learned from these,\
    \ and other, studies.\nNonetheless, the extent of WSI technology use remains low\
    \ in China [4–7].\nTo facilitate\na more successful adoption of WSI technologies,\
    \ a set of policies have been pioneered by the\nChinese government to foster management\
    \ change. However, the administrative multi-level and\nmulti-sector structure\
    \ limits the effectiveness of these policies [5]. Additionally, ﬁnancial shortfalls\n\
    from the local governments [14,15] and insufﬁcient participation of farmers [16]\
    \ also affect the\nimplementation and success of WSI policies [17,18]. As a response,\
    \ WSI management has been\nreformed to intensify the connection among macro-level\
    \ water-saving policies, meso-level policy\nimplementation, and micro-level irrigation\
    \ water users. For instance, the central government has\nissued policies to mobilize\
    \ local governments by providing special funds to ﬁll the ﬁscal gap for WSI\n\
    investment [19,20]; Water User Associations (WUAs) have been promoted to take\
    \ on the irrigation\nmanagement responsibilities in rural China [21]. In the changing\
    \ policy environment in China, it is\nessential to conduct more detailed and empirical\
    \ assessment of the performance of WSI strategies taken\nby the government and\
    \ farmers. Unfortunately, there have been relatively few studies focusing on the\n\
    status of the WSI management system. There is almost no systematic information\
    \ on management\nmechanisms of the WSI, its experience and lessons, although they\
    \ are urgently needed.\nThis study aims to enrich the current understanding of\
    \ the on-going WSI management policies,\nthe mechanisms of how WSI policies have\
    \ been implemented, and the challenges that the management\nsystem is currently\
    \ facing, thus providing information for further sustainable WSI management.\n\
    To this end, we have collected data and information on the way that agricultural\
    \ water has been\nmanaged and the effectiveness of different management measures.\
    \ A case study, carried out in the\nShiyang River Basin, has also been analyzed\
    \ in this paper to illustrate the consequences of the WSI\nmanagement reform in\
    \ practice. The research method used in this paper includes an extensive and\n\
    critical review of academic literature on the technologies, institutions, policies,\
    \ strategies, and progress\ninvolved in WSI. For the case study, we organized\
    \ site interviews and focus group discussions\nwith a variety of stakeholders\
    \ from June 2016 to August 2017 to collect information on local water\nmanagement\
    \ regulations, government plans, and other relevant information on the studied\
    \ area.\nThe remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 provides an overview\nof China’s WSI management policies and its implementation;\
    \ in Section 3, we give a more detailed\ndiscussion of the WSI management by providing\
    \ empirical evidence for their implementation in the\nShiyang River Basin; and\
    \ Section 4 summarizes the ﬁndings and concludes the paper.\n2. Overview of Water-Saving\
    \ Irrigation Management\n2.1. Institutional Arrangements\nThe administrative structure\
    \ of China’s agricultural water management has grown into a vast\nand complex\
    \ bureaucracy with overlapping competences and responsibilities [22,23]. China’s\
    \ political\nadministration structure consists of ﬁve hierarchical levels: centre,\
    \ province, prefecture, county,\nand township [24]. According to China’s Water\
    \ Law [25], the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR)\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n\
    3 of 17\nhas the primary responsibility for agricultural water management at the\
    \ central level. The role\nof the MWR is to develop and enforce water government\
    \ laws and regulations, and to supervise\nwater-saving investments by providing\
    \ technical guidance. In addition to the MWR, other central\nauthorities in China\
    \ are also involved in the management of the agricultural water management\nby\
    \ law [25], including the Ministry of Agriculture which is responsible for developing\
    \ local water\nallocation schemes and extending water-saving technology, the Ministry\
    \ of Environmental Protection\nwhich plays a crucial role in water pollution prevention\
    \ and control, the Ministry of Geology and\nMining which provides the information\
    \ about the groundwater level with respect to groundwater\npumping permits, and\
    \ the State Price Bureau which assists in setting irrigation water price guidelines\n\
    at the provincial level.\nBelow the central government, many subnational water\
    \ management authorities also inﬂuence the\nimplementation of the WSI. The Water\
    \ Resources Bureaus at the provincial level, and the Water Affair\nBureaus at\
    \ the prefectural and county level take most responsibilities for executing WSI\
    \ policies [26,27].\nThose bureaus all link vertically to the MWR to implement\
    \ the decisions by a higher-level authority.\nHorizontally, the heads of local\
    \ bureaus are appointed by local leaders of their own jurisdiction,\nand thus\
    \ water management rules and policies were frequently carried out as inﬂuenced\
    \ by local\ninterest [5]. To deal with potential water use conﬂicts among different\
    \ jurisdictions, water resources\nmanagement opted for river basin authority that\
    \ manage the whole basin’s water across administrative\nboundaries [23,25]. Each\
    \ of China’s seven major river basins, such as the Yellow River Basin, has a\n\
    National River Basin Conservation Commission, working on behalf of the MWR to\
    \ manage the basin’s\nwater resources. For some of the important basins that lie\
    \ within the same province, but across\ndifferent prefectural levels, such as\
    \ the Shiyang River Basin in Gansu Province, a Provincial River\nBasin Conservation\
    \ Bureau has been set up to exert managerial responsibilities empowered by the\n\
    provincial Water Resources Bureau. The key tasks of the river basin authority\
    \ are to set an annual\nquota for water delivery, constructing WSI conveyance\
    \ structures, and providing more reliable timely\nirrigation water deliveries\
    \ of the river basin under their charge [25,26].\nMost of the large and mid-sized\
    \ Irrigation Districts (IDs) have specially set-up bureaus which are\nresponsible\
    \ for agricultural water conservancy facilities and agricultural water allocation\
    \ [28]. The ID\nmanagement bureau is a professional agricultural management organization\
    \ and their leaders report\nto local water Resources/Affair Bureaus. Under the\
    \ ID management bureau, the irrigation stations at\ntownship level are directly\
    \ responsible for allocating agricultural water, maintaining irrigation facilities,\n\
    and collecting irrigation water fees. Each village has coordinators with executive\
    \ responsibility given\nby irrigation stations. Small IDs will be managed directly\
    \ by a collection of village farmers, with the\nmanagers of the small IDs being\
    \ either village leaders or informally chosen leaders by consensus.\n2.2. Water-Saving\
    \ Irrigation Policies\nAgricultural water management has been changed from supply-side\
    \ management to demand-side\nmanagement since the revision of China’s water law\
    \ in 2002 [29]. Historically, projects focusing on\nexploiting more water to meet\
    \ the increasing water requirements have been given the highest priority.\nVarious\
    \ surface water and groundwater exploiting projects were built to support the\
    \ expanding of\nirrigation areas and the growing of water-intensive crops. However,\
    \ the cost of exploiting new water\nresources is increasing especially where the\
    \ groundwater table has fallen signiﬁcantly, and massive\nreliance on irrigation\
    \ has also produced adverse ecological outcomes [30]. It has become clear that\
    \ a\nsupply-side approach is insufﬁcient to deal with the growing water demands\
    \ [30,31]. Gradually, the\nmanagement objective has shifted to stem the excessive\
    \ rising demand by the more efﬁcient use of\nirrigation water.\nThe 11th Five-Year\
    \ Plan (2006–2010) [32] set out a series of policy goals for the WSI management.\n\
    These included (a) shifting from supply-side to demand-side management and quota\
    \ control;\n(b) adopting a more uniﬁed river basin management system and integrating\
    \ it with regional\ndevelopment; (c) establishing a preliminary system of water\
    \ rights trading; (d) developing the WSI\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n4 of 17\n\
    to improve the water use efﬁciency to achieve a zero growth of agricultural water\
    \ consumption;\nand (e) increasing the average agricultural water-use efﬁciency\
    \ from 0.45 in 2005 to 0.50 by 2010.\nThe 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015) [33]\
    \ emphasized the following water-saving management goals:\n(a) implementing the\
    \ strictest water resources management system with volume control and quota\n\
    management, and perfecting the water allocation scheme; (b) reforming the water\
    \ price system;\n(c) promoting WSI techniques and adding 5 × 107 mu (1 mu = 666.7\
    \ m2) of high-efﬁciency WSI area;\nand (d) increasing the average irrigation water-use\
    \ coefﬁcient to 0.53 by 2015. The current 13th Five Year\nPlan (2016–2020) [34]\
    \ also has plans for water resource management, which includes: (a) continuing\n\
    to implement the strictest water resources management system; (b) limiting the\
    \ production scale,\nwhich should be based on local water resource conditions;\
    \ (c) increasing the average irrigation\nwater-use efﬁciency to 0.55 by 2020 and\
    \ 0.60 by 2030, respectively; and (d) reforming agricultural water\nprice and\
    \ promoting the practice of the WSI.\n2.3. Three Management Mechanisms for Agricultural\
    \ Water Saving\nTo\nimplement\nnational\nWSI\npolicies,\nthe\ntraditional\nmanagement\n\
    mechanism\nis\na\ntop-down\nmechanism,\nwhich\nincludes\ndirect\ncontrol\nand\n\
    economic\ninstruments\n[35,36]\nwith\nresponsibilities\nassigned\nover\na\nrange\n\
    of\nvertically—and\nhorizontally-interlinked\ngovernment authorities.\nHowever,\
    \ a lack of coordination inherent in China’s administrative\nstructure hampered\
    \ the effectiveness of policy delivery [37,38]. In recent years, the central government\n\
    has delivered WSI policies with greater reliance on task-speciﬁc governance. Instead\
    \ of using a\nchain-of-command sense, the central government realizes WSI goals\
    \ using the application model.\nSpecial funds have been designed at the central-level\
    \ and reached to the basic-level directly [14,17,37],\nwhich bypasses the conventional\
    \ hierarchy.\nNonetheless, a lack of alignment and connection\nbetween the government\
    \ and end-users of irrigation water led to the high cost and low efﬁciency in\n\
    implementing WSI policies. These concerns have encouraged participatory irrigation\
    \ management\nreform by introducing the Water User Associations (WUAs). The WUAs\
    \ have been considered\nas a bottom-up organizational form of water governance\
    \ aiming at enhancing better irrigation\nperformance [16,19,39,40]. Below, we\
    \ present the three management mechanisms: top-down regulation,\ndesign-bid funding,\
    \ and bottom-up participation.\n2.3.1. Top-Down Regulation\nThe top-down bureaucratic\
    \ system empowers the central government to have more control over\ndecision-making\
    \ than lower-level governments. In the case of the WSI, this mechanism includes\
    \ direct\ncontrol and economic instruments [36], aiming at allocating water resources\
    \ and increasing farmers’\nawareness of their irrigation costs.\nThe direct control\
    \ relies on mandatory measures, such as reducing the area of irrigated farmland,\n\
    restricting the cultivation of high water-consuming crops and introducing a water\
    \ consumption\npermit system.\nThe permit system, which was introduced to China’s\
    \ water law in 2002 [25],\nstipulates that river basin management authorities\
    \ and local bureaus should set their irrigation\nquotas among different administrative\
    \ regions. All water users should obtain their allocated water\nwith permits from\
    \ the water management authorities and should not exceed the allocated amount.\n\
    The approved abstraction permit is formulated according to river basin’ water\
    \ allocation plans issued\nby the upper-level water administrative department\
    \ or the river basin management authorities [41].\nPermits for IDs are the amount\
    \ of water that can be used for crop production. The implementation of,\nand emphasis\
    \ on, the quota management in the agricultural sector began only in recent years\
    \ and\nremains in the pilot phase [41,42]. In some of the pilot areas, water use\
    \ permits have also been assigned\nto individual farmers and vary annually by\
    \ water supply and crop type [31]. Farmers deposit money\nfor the allocated amount\
    \ according to the permit, and the irrigation stops once the allowed volume\n\
    is acquired [30]. By the establishment of a permit system, individual farmers\
    \ have de facto rights to\nagricultural water through their ownership of a permit.\
    \ In theory, this kind of water right can be traded,\nSustainability 2017, 9,\
    \ 2339\n5 of 17\nbut farmers hardly ever sell their water to others because of\
    \ the high transaction cost in ﬁnding trading\npartners and the ﬂat trading price\
    \ determined by the IDs [30,31,42]. Mandatory measures negatively\naffected farmers’\
    \ agricultural income, resulting in a low support rate of the policy enforcement\
    \ [43,44].\nEconomic measures made based on market signals have also been introduced.\
    \ The water price\nreform is the major part of economic instruments in China’s\
    \ WSI policies [5,22]. The ﬁrst-time water\npricing regulation was made in the\
    \ early 1980s when the state council determined to build a water fee\naccounting\
    \ system [22]. Since then, the pricing policy, which prescribed that agricultural\
    \ water should\nbe treated as market goods to adequately cover the water supply\
    \ cost, has been reformed. In 2016,\na comprehensive agricultural water pricing\
    \ reform was initiated to gradually increase the water price\nto guarantee the\
    \ operation cost of irrigation projects, adjust pricing strategies to encourage\
    \ saving and\npunish wasting, and invest in water-saving infrastructure and facilities\
    \ to lower the cost of the water\nsupply [45]. The water price reform has caused\
    \ an increase in the price of water to address the nation’s\nwater crisis. However,\
    \ China’s farmlands are highly fragmented and small-scale in nature [6,20],\n\
    and infrastructure for monitoring ﬂows at the individual user level is still unfeasible\
    \ due to high cost.\nThus, water fees are usually collected above the household\
    \ level. That is, individual households pay a\nproportion of the total collected\
    \ water fee based on the size of their irrigated land and regardless of the\n\
    actual amount of water they have consumed [28]. Further, farmers’ water demand\
    \ is relatively inelastic\nunder the current water pricing system [46], and raising\
    \ the price will not likely decrease irrigation\nwater use by a signiﬁcant amount\
    \ [11,12]. Only a tremendous increase in water price would lead to a\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ reduction in farmers’ water demand [47,48]. However, such a high increase in\
    \ the water\nprice occasionally conﬂicts with other policy goals, such as raising\
    \ rural incomes and maintaining\nfood security. All these difﬁculties impede the\
    \ progress of water price reform.\n2.3.2. Design-Bid Funding\nIn contrast to the\
    \ central government’s strong determination of promoting the WSI,\nlocal governments\
    \ have responded slowly because of the institutional barriers inherent to China’s\n\
    administrative structure. Recently, a signiﬁcant trend in management reform has\
    \ been the direct\nallocation of WSI funds in grant programs [37,49–57]. The grant\
    \ programs are designed by the\ncentral government with speciﬁc water-saving outcomes\
    \ [20,52]. Local governments bid for the WSI\nprogram in order to obtain additional\
    \ beneﬁts other than general operating funds [20]. Thus, we\nrefer to the designing\
    \ and bidding of grants program as “design-bid funding” mechanism for\nthe WSI\
    \ management. One of the major factors driving the design-bid mechanism is the\
    \ ﬁscal\ndeﬁcits of local governments [17,18,38]. Since China’s revenue-sharing\
    \ reform in 1994, the central\ngovernment has increased its ability in collecting\
    \ taxes by the recentralization ﬁscal control [49] and,\nthus, decreased the revenue\
    \ for local government. Further, the complete elimination of agricultural\ntax\
    \ in 2006 continued moving ﬁscal control away from local governments and shifted\
    \ it to the\ncentral government [17]. Consequently, the provision of public services,\
    \ such as WSI promotion,\nhas increasingly depended on the funds provided by central\
    \ governments’ ﬁscal transfers [14,15].\nThe afﬂuent central government also has\
    \ the capacity and will to invest in the WSI by designing\nspecial funds, and\
    \ asks local governments to apply for the funds by the competition with other\
    \ local\ngovernments [20,56]. This design-bid mechanism in the WSI management\
    \ is quite different from the\ntop-down regulation, as local governments have\
    \ the autonomy to decide whether they would like to\napply for the funds or not.\
    \ Meanwhile, this mechanism also provides the central government with an\neffective\
    \ controlling power by a task-centred mode of mobilization [50].\nThe design-bid\
    \ mechanism also makes a full use of the bureaucracy system while reducing\nthe\
    \ vertical and horizontal administrative barriers [54].\nThe central government\
    \ addresses the\nnation’s growing water shortages by designing competition funds\
    \ for the investment in village-level\nirrigation systems. To offset the shrinking\
    \ revenues, local governments will do the best to win the\nbid by setting up a\
    \ team from different departments and integrating the information from these\n\
    departments [17,37]. Additionally, getting the funds will also rebound to local\
    \ ofﬁcials’ credit [52–55].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n6 of 17\nThus, the\
    \ design-bid mechanism realizes the water-saving goal through the coordination\
    \ between the\ncentral and local governments. In local government’s pursuit of\
    \ external funds, vertical hierarchical\ninstitutions and horizontal departmental\
    \ arrangements will be broken up and recombined for a\nshort-term [50]. Additionally,\
    \ the status of the WSI development will be synthesized and submitted\nto the\
    \ upper-level government [56]. Consequently, local ofﬁcers have the incentive\
    \ to discover the\npotential water using problems within their jurisdiction during\
    \ the application process [37,50,56].\nThe competition for funds from the design-bid\
    \ mechanism play an increasing role in water\nconservation engineering and demonstration\
    \ work [57]. However, the mechanism also faces with\nstriking deﬁciencies in application\
    \ and implementation. During the application, the central government\nwill provide\
    \ guidelines with speciﬁc objectives and strict rules on realizing the objectives\
    \ [52].\nLow-level governments have little voice in the formation of guidelines,\
    \ such as the promotion of\ndrip irrigation among smallholders, and a lack of\
    \ understanding of the farming practice led to a\nwasteful use of funds [51].\
    \ Moreover, WSI funds were frequently allocated to highly-advanced\nwater-saving\
    \ technologies, such as automatic irrigation. The advanced technologies are usually\n\
    favoured by large-scale operation farmers or enterprises because a considerable\
    \ labour input can be\nsaved together with saving water [53]. Those entities also\
    \ have the power to lobby authorities and\nobtain ﬁnancial support [56]. The government,\
    \ on the other hand, is eager to create “highlights” in\nthe shortest possible\
    \ time, requiring that the project pilot units must have strength. This, in turn,\n\
    means that the priority will be given to those with larger operation scales, and\
    \ that little attention\nhas been paid to smallholders who will contribute a more\
    \ signiﬁcant potential for water savings\nthrough water management [22]. Lastly,\
    \ each of the funds has its speciﬁc objectives to the view of\nhigher authorities,\
    \ but all local affairs involve synthesis [37]. Thus, local governments always\
    \ combine\ndifferent funds into one area [57], leading to the uneven distribution\
    \ of ﬁscal resources and widening\ndevelopment gap among regions.\n2.3.3. Bottom-Up\
    \ Participation\nBoth the top-down mechanism and design-bid mechanism are nested\
    \ in the authority system\nwhich excludes water users from the decision-making\
    \ process. The Water User Associations (WUAs),\nas a public participatory organization,\
    \ are considered as an effective entity for democratic\ndecision-making at the\
    \ lowest level [16]. The potential advantages of WUAs include better facilitating\n\
    water-related affairs, such as water fees’ collection and water delivery, improvement\
    \ in resolving\nwater use conﬂict such as opportunistic behaviour prevention,\
    \ and lower costs of operation and\nmaintenance of the irrigation system [16,40,43,58].\
    \ Since the mid-1990s, by introducing the WUAs,\nthe participatory irrigation\
    \ management reform has become the mainstream in China [43]. In 2005,\nthe central\
    \ government announced that the WUAs were a way for the effective water management\
    \ [59]\nand determined to introduce the WUA over much of the country. However,\
    \ in its implementation,\nincreasing the number of WUAs or irrigated areas covered\
    \ by WUA-based management has become\nthe priority objective, and led to a rapid\
    \ growth of the WUAs numbers [60]. By the end of 2014, 834,000\nWUAs had been\
    \ established and commanded 284 million mu farmlands, which comprised 29.2% of\n\
    the country’s effectively irrigated area [61]. With the establishment of WUAs,\
    \ irrigation management\nresponsibilities have been transferred from the government\
    \ agencies to local water users to manage\nthe agricultural water more effectively\
    \ in a decentralization way. However, the performance of the\nWUAs varies considerably\
    \ in water-saving [60,62–64].\nThe bottom-up WUAs formalized by the World Bank\
    \ [40], and replicated in China with little\nattention to local context, resulted\
    \ in a low success rate [39,40]. In China, the village is the lowest-level\nadministration\
    \ unit, and the leaders of village include both village committee head elected\
    \ by\nvillage members and party secretary selected from above by the party organization.\
    \ Since WUA\nhas the identical administrative boundaries with the village rather\
    \ than the established based on\nhydrological boundaries, the WUA board is usually\
    \ comprised of the village leadership [58,64].\nAccording to data from a large-scale\
    \ survey during 2012 and 2016, it is estimated that 61% of the\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 2339\n7 of 17\ninvestigated WUA board was promoted by village leaders\
    \ and that only 14% were elected through the\ndemocratic voting process [65].\
    \ The establishment of the WUAs can be considered as the provision\nof professional\
    \ personnel for the responsibility of water-related coordination at the village\
    \ level.\nAlthough participation by villagers has played only a minor role, it\
    \ was found that the WUAs help\nincrease the water use efﬁciency, as well as reduce\
    \ water use conﬂicts [66,67].\n3. Lessons from the Practice: The Case of the Shiyang\
    \ River Basin\n3.1. The Case Study Area\nThe Shiyang River Basin (SRB) is an inland\
    \ river basin located in Northwest China, where water\nshortages are most severe,\
    \ and the management measures are changed rapidly and dramatically.\nThe basin\
    \ (Figure 1), surrounded by the Baddan Jaran Desert and the Tenggli Desert, has\
    \ an area of\nabout 41,600 km2 and annual runoff of 1.56 billion m3. Due to the\
    \ low precipitation and intensive\nevaporation, irrigation plays a critical role\
    \ in local socio-economic development, and water conﬂict is\nquite serious among\
    \ different sections. The upper stream of the SRB is the Qilian Mountain Range.\n\
    Runoff, mostly formed from precipitation and snowmelt, provides surface water\
    \ and groundwater\nfor the whole basin. In the SRB, increasing grain production\
    \ to meet the demands of the growing\npopulation and alleviating poverty used\
    \ to be given the highest priority. The government statistics\nshow the irrigated\
    \ area increased by 30%, grain output increased by 45%, and the total amount of\n\
    water use increased by 75% from the 1950s to 2003 [68]. Many dams have been built\
    \ in the upper\nstream and middle stream to ensure sufﬁcient water supply on their\
    \ own account, causing the surface\nwater ﬂowing to the lower Minqin oasis to\
    \ reduce rapidly from over 500 million m3 in the 1950s to\n98 million m3 in 2003\
    \ [68]. In response to the increasing water demand and decreasing spring ﬂow,\n\
    those downstream greatly expanded their number of tubewells to pump groundwater\
    \ for the expanded\nirrigation demand. In Minqin County alone, the number of tubewells\
    \ peaked at 14,000, accounting for\nabout 1/3 of Gansu Province’s total amount\
    \ [69]. The severe water conﬂict among different reaches\ncaused the serious overexploitation\
    \ of groundwater and a continuous decline in the groundwater\ntable [70].\nSustainability\

    \ basin management institution,\nthe Shiyang River Basin Management Bureau (SRMB)\
    \ was set up in Wuwei in November 2001.\nThe SRMB takes on the primary responsibility\
    \ for the development of water resources (both surface\nwater and groundwater\
    \ resources) in the SRB for all purposes and is responsible for the implementation,\n\
    operation, and maintenance of large-scale water projects. Furthermore, a comprehensive\
    \ water\nmanagement plan (CWMP) was formulated and approved by the Ministry of\
    \ Water Resources in\n2006 [71]. The CWMP was mostly implemented in Wuwei municipality,\
    \ which occupied almost 80%\nof the basin’s water use and 70% of the basin’s area.\
    \ According to the plan, water consumption\nwithin the basin needed to be reduced\
    \ from the peaked 2.88 billion m3 in 2003 to 2.13 billion m3 in\n2010 and 1.97\
    \ billion m3 by 2020. Another important goal was to prevent further desertiﬁcation\
    \ and\nsalinization in Minqin County by reallocating surface water among different\
    \ reaches of the basin and\nlimiting groundwater exploitation of these regions.\
    \ It was required that surface water ﬂowing to the\ndownstream Minqin oasis shall\
    \ increase from 98 million m3 in 2003 to 250 million m3 in 2010 and\n290 million\
    \ m3 by 2020; groundwater exploitation in the Minqin basin needed to decrease\
    \ groundwater\nexploitation from 517 million m3 in 2003 to 86 million m3 by 2020;\
    \ the middle basin needed to decrease\ngroundwater exploitation from 972 million\
    \ m3 to 822 million m3; the whole basin needed to lessen its\ngroundwater exploitation\
    \ from 747 million m3 to 418 million m3 during this period.\nThe Gansu government\
    \ recently made an evaluation of CWMP in the SRB. According to the ofﬁcial\nevaluation\
    \ report, positive results have been achieved after the implementation of CWMP;\
    \ all the\nplanned objectives were realized ahead of schedule in 2014, long before\
    \ 2020, and the environment\nstarted to be managed in a sustainable way by integrating\
    \ the ecological restoration with advancing\nsocial and economic progress.\nIn\
    \ all these efforts, a series of water-saving policies have been\nimplemented\
    \ to encourage farmers and local leaders to adopt water-saving practices, including\
    \ water\nconsumption permits, raising water prices, investing in WSI infrastructure,\
    \ and establishing WUAs.\nDuring the eight years of the CWMP’s implementation\
    \ (from 2007 to 2015), the ofﬁcial evaluation report\nshows that the average agricultural\
    \ water-use coefﬁcient increased from 0.53 to 0.58; water used for\nirrigation\
    \ reduced from 1.71 billion m3 to 1.39 billion m3, and for per acre irrigated\
    \ land, reduced from\n626.72 m3 to 430.25 billion m3. Thus, it is of importance\
    \ to examine the effectiveness of water-saving\npolicies and the lessons that\
    \ need to be learned from the SRB case.\n3.2. Quota Control and Economic Incentives\n\
    To reduce the agricultural water consumption, measures relying on direct control\
    \ have been\nwidely implemented.\nThe most important measures have been water\
    \ consumption permits\nand reducing irrigated areas, along with the closure of\
    \ tubewells.\nIn Wuwei municipality,\nthose included closing 3318 tubewells and\
    \ limiting the water exploitation in the remaining tubewells,\nreducing 663 thousand\
    \ mu of irrigated area, and forbidding planting high water-consuming crops,\n\
    such as onions (which would consume more than 1000 m3 per mu), corn (which would\
    \ consume\nmore than 800 m3 per mu), and wheat (which has a low economic output\
    \ per cubic meter of water).\nWater consumption permits were granted to individual\
    \ households, which were identiﬁed by the\nnumber of people in the household and\
    \ the type of crops planted. For example, in Minqin County,\nthe permit stipulated\
    \ that each person can develop no more than 2.5 mu of irrigation farmland and\
    \ the\nwater available for the farmland was 415 m3 per mu (300 m3 groundwater\
    \ and 115 m3 surface water).\nFor families having farmland more than 2.5 mu per\
    \ capita, they could obtain additional water use\nby transforming land use to\
    \ greenhouses or planning horticultural crops. For example, goji and\ngrape could\
    \ obtain 250 m3 of water use permit per mu. Another essential tool for water use\
    \ control\nwas the Integrated Circuit card (IC card) technology, with which the\
    \ consumption permit could be\nmonitored by the electronic system installed in\
    \ the tubewell. The IC card was usually held by a\nperson from the WUA board.\
    \ A farmer was allowed to purchase water tickets up to 415 m3 per mu\nbefore irrigation,\
    \ and the allowed volume of water pumped by a tubewell would be the amount\nof\
    \ irrigation farmland multiplied by the allowed permit. The IC card holder coordinated\
    \ water\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n9 of 17\ndeliveries to his members. Farmers,\
    \ together with the cardholder, supervised each other’s water use\ntime during\
    \ the irrigation period, which guaranteed that irrigation water would be equally\
    \ allocated.\nHowever, measures relying on direct control aroused complains. For\
    \ instance, our interviewed farmers\nfrom the middle reaches were forbidden to\
    \ do double cropping because their water supply had been\nreduced to ensure the\
    \ water use in lower reaches, and farmers from the lower reaches believed that\n\
    reducing the irrigated area lowered their potential incomes.\nThe water price\
    \ has increased dramatically in the past ten years (from 2007 to 2017) in the\
    \ SRB.\nThe government of the middle reaches has increased its surface water fee\
    \ for every cubic meter\nfrom 0.08 Yuan to 0.2 Yuan, while water fee in the lower\
    \ reaches has been adjusted from 0.1 Yuan to\n0.24 Yuan. Water fees collected\
    \ in irrigation areas with groundwater only, or by mixing groundwater\nwith surface\
    \ water, would be charged by the two-part tariff system. The tariffs were divided\
    \ into\nthe basic part and the volumetric part. The basic part was a ﬁxed fee,\
    \ irrelevant from the level\nof consumption, which was 2 Yuan per mu. The volumetric\
    \ part was charged depending on the\nvolume of water consumed, which was 0.174\
    \ Yuan per cubic of water. Moreover, water price also\ndiffers by the cropping\
    \ practices and the consumed amount. Water for greenhouses and drip irrigation\n\
    would not only be exempted from the basic water fee, but also obtain a 20% and\
    \ 50% discount for\nsurface water fees and groundwater fees, respectively. For\
    \ crops with high water consumption or\nlow economic beneﬁt, the irrigation fee\
    \ would be risen by 50% for groundwater and 30% for surface\nwater, respectively.\
    \ In the case of water consumed exceeding the permit, the beyond amount would\n\
    be charged at a higher rate, which is 150% for 0–30%, 200% for 31–50%, and 300%\
    \ for more than 50%\nin excess of the allocated amount. If the water consumed\
    \ was less than 90% of the allocated amount,\na 10% discount would be given to\
    \ the total irrigation fee. Other economic measures included:\nthe government-subsidized\
    \ 5000 Yuan per mu for greenhouse construction, 1300 Yuan per mu for\nwine grapes\
    \ production in the lower reaches, and 300 Yuan per mu for growing fruit trees\
    \ in the upper\nand middle reaches. Ofﬁcials said those measures have encouraged\
    \ local farmers to use water more\nefﬁciently and plant water-saving crops on\
    \ agricultural land. The statistics from local government also\nshowed the economic\
    \ output per cubic meter of irrigation water has increased from 1.93 Yuan in 2009\n\
    to 9.33 Yuan in 2015.\nThe government believed that the water permit system, together\
    \ with price reform, should provide\nconditions for the establishment of a water\
    \ market. In practice, water permit trading did exist between\nthe WUAs within\
    \ the same ID, but traded less frequently (136 times comprising 9.44 million m3\
    \ of\nwater in 2015 and 70 times comprising 1.00 million m3 of water in 2016).\
    \ For farmers, they hardly sold\ntheir water to others within the WUA due to a\
    \ lack of heterogeneity within the village, for example,\nthe same plantation\
    \ structure and same period for irrigation water distribution. At the national\
    \ level,\nlegislation and the necessary regulatory framework were still not ready\
    \ to support the development\nof a water market. Moreover, those top-down regulations\
    \ encouraged the cultivation shift from\ntraditional grain crops to cash crops\
    \ in the SRB, which substantially increased the beneﬁt from every\ncubic meter\
    \ of water use. Thus, farmers’ average income was still doubled with the reduced\
    \ water\nresources and increased water price. However, these successful experiences\
    \ are limited in the SRB,\nwhere water scarcity is among the most critical issues\
    \ on the government agenda. A higher water price\nwill stimulate the planting\
    \ of crops with higher revenues, which may hurt the nation’s food security\ngoal\
    \ of achieving 95% self-sufﬁciency for all major grains in the short run. Hence,\
    \ it is impossible for\nthe policy-makers to increase water prices without hurting\
    \ rural incomes [47] while maintaining food\nsecurity [5]. Even with subsidy strategies\
    \ to compensate famers’ lost income because of increasing\nwater prices, as in\
    \ a pilot area of Taocheng District [72,73], there is still a signiﬁcant shift\
    \ in plantation\nstructure from the traditional grain crops to the water-saving\
    \ and high-value crops [74,75].\n3.3. Specially-Allocated Funds\nThe comprehensive\
    \ water management plan (CWMP) issued in 2006 itself is a major fund\napproved\
    \ by the central government. The water crisis in the SRB was so severe that the\
    \ central\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n10 of 17\ngovernment decided to intervene\
    \ and provide funds for water management directly. The fund\nallocated to the\
    \ SRB did not follow a standardized design-bid mechanism, and the central government\n\
    played an active role in mobilizing basic level units. Designing funds for only\
    \ one application\nmight be the case when they caught pervasive attention from\
    \ the central government. CWMP was\nspecially designed for the SRB by MWR with\
    \ a total investment of 4.948 billion Yuan. The plan used\na “matching funds”\
    \ method, which required that the central government subsidize a major part of\n\
    the investment; the provincial government provided a certain amount of matching\
    \ funds; basic-level\ndepartments also needed to give assurances to invest when\
    \ applying for the project. In the case\nof CWMP, 4.284 billion Yuan (86.6%) were\
    \ from the central government, and 0.666 billion Yuan (13.4%)\nwere from the local\
    \ governments; 3.98 billion Yuan, accounting for 80.3% of the total investment,\n\
    were primarily arranged for the WSI improvement project, such as water conveyance\
    \ work and\nsubsidies for WSI techniques. According to the government report,\
    \ the main achievements made from\nthe investment included, 824 km irrigation\
    \ canal was reconstructed with concrete for preventing canal\nseepage; 117,300\
    \ ha of irrigated land was upgraded to use pipe or drip irrigation; drought-resistant\n\
    crop varieties, including Chinese medicinal herbs, fruit trees, cotton, and sunﬂowers\
    \ were widely\nplanted; and the number of greenhouses was considerably extended\
    \ by governments’ subsidies.\nOther funds also have been invested in SRB to promote\
    \ the WSI together with the CWMP fund.\nOne typical example is the on-going Sino-Israel\
    \ Financial Cooperation (SIFC) program in the\nmiddle reaches.\nThe central government\
    \ fully funded the project by providing approximately\n3000 Yuan/mu state loans\
    \ to support the demonstration of high-tech technologies. The SIFC program\nwas\
    \ designed by the National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Finance\
    \ in\n2012 with the purpose of introducing Israel’s high-tech WSI technologies\
    \ and promoting China’s\nWSI development. The program stipulated that all counties\
    \ from China’s northwest provinces,\nincluding Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia,\
    \ and Qinghai, were eligible to apply for the fund.\nOur investigated government\
    \ in SRB applied and did not obtain the fund until 2016. According to\nthe government’s\
    \ plan, 39,600 mu farmlands in the SRB would be equipped with highly automatic\n\
    drip irrigation systems imported from Israel. The drip tape was freely provided\
    \ in the initial stage,\nand local farmers needed to purchase it afterward. Training\
    \ courses were conducted by technicians\nfrom companies, and representatives of\
    \ farm members were trained on how to use the equipment.\nWith the automated irrigation\
    \ system, one person could control the irrigation and fertilization for\napproximate\
    \ 3000 mu. The program also helped reduce one-third of the irrigation water, 10%\
    \ of\nthe fertilizer, and ensured quality consistency of the crops. Nevertheless,\
    \ the machine increased\nfarmers’ electronic costs, which would offset the saved\
    \ fertilizer expense.\nThe two design-bid cases mentioned above represent the\
    \ category of engineering funds and\ndemonstration funds, respectively, which\
    \ are frequently designed for the WSI. In the ﬁrst case,\ndespite great achievements\
    \ having been made, our investigation found that some funds were\nnot sufﬁciently\
    \ used, and even caused adverse consequences because the departmental ideas or\n\
    expert opinions did not always connect the practice with scientiﬁc knowledge.\n\
    For example,\nto increase the canal water-use coefﬁcient, an irrigation canal\
    \ had been reconstructed with concrete\nto prevent seepage. These measures may\
    \ cause the death of trees and shrubs around the canal\nbecause of the reducing\
    \ seepage.\nIn lower reaches of the SRB, the dying plants are a critical\ncomponent\
    \ of the shelterbelt landscape, which protects the farmland against shifting sand.\
    \ Thus, the\nenforced WSI measures could have been more effectively implemented\
    \ by considering indigenous\nknowledge and the local context. The second case\
    \ shows the WSI demonstration program is usually\nof high-tech with large investment.\
    \ Outside the program, villagers will hardly adopt the automatic\nirrigation technology\
    \ without lavish government support. The replacement of irrigation pipe will\n\
    be quite burdensome after the project is implemented. If some farmers are not\
    \ willing to buy new\npipes after the SIFC program, the high-value equipment will\
    \ be abandoned. Moreover, farmers\nhave only been trained for how to use the machine.\
    \ If some parts of the machine do not work,\nthey are unable to ﬁx it in time.\
    \ This kind of problem has crippled many other similar projects\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 2339\n11 of 17\nbecause of the deﬁciency of after-funding services.\
    \ Thus, overemphasizing the highly-advanced\ntechnology might be far beyond China’s\
    \ current small holder’s stage and raises the problem of\nsustainability and replicability.\
    \ Moreover, the funded villages in the SIFC program have always been\nlinked to\
    \ other funds, such as the fund for farmland leveling, which will provide the\
    \ infrastructure\nconditions for the SIFC program. Our investigation indicates\
    \ that the Matthew effect occurs during\nthe implementation of WSI funding polices.\
    \ Villages with the experience of implementing funding\nprogrammes will be given\
    \ the priority for new funding programs. The phenomena of “fund linked to\nfunding”\
    \ may cause a project-made income disparity among villages.\n3.4. The Development\
    \ of WUAs\nIn the SRB, the WUAs have been widely established since the early 2000s\
    \ upon the requirement\nof local governments. The government statistics in 2014\
    \ showed that the WUAs were developed in\n77.6% of the villages in Wuwei municipality,\
    \ in which 874 WUAs accommodated 2517 managers,\n308,000 households, and 2.37\
    \ million mu of irrigated farmland. The primary duties of the WUA were\nto help\
    \ the collection of irrigation fees, to resolve water conﬂicts among households,\
    \ to purchase water\nfrom water supplier, and to allocate agricultural water at\
    \ the village level.\nThe WUA board in SRB, supposedly elected by villagers, was\
    \ composed of one director and two\ndeputy leaders according to the local government’s\
    \ requirements. During our investigation in more\nthan 30 villages, none of the\
    \ board members were elected following the procedures in establishing the\nWUAs\
    \ and the directors of the board were normally the current or previous leaders\
    \ of the villages.\nMoreover, the director usually took all the responsibility\
    \ for agricultural water management, and the\ndeputy leaders only assisted water\
    \ allocation during the busy irrigation period.\nThe funding\nsources of the WUAs\
    \ included two parts: a ﬁxed part, which is 3000–4000 Yuan provided by the\ncounty\
    \ government, and a proﬁt-sharing part, which is decided by the total water fees\
    \ collected\nfrom famers, total irrigation area, and the director’s performance.\
    \ Those two parts would amount from\n12,000 Yuan to 16,000 Yuan, and the director\
    \ would receive around 70% of the total. In our interviews,\nthe directors, also\
    \ as village leaders, were quite glad to take the duties of agricultural water\n\
    management. This was because they were required to stay in the village as the\
    \ village leader,\nwhich enabled them to have enough time to take the responsibility\
    \ as well as receive additional\nremuneration beyond their regular salaries. WUAs\
    \ had successes in ﬁlling the vacancy for a specialized\nwater manager at the\
    \ village level. For example, the duty of taking care of the irrigation infrastructure,\n\
    which used to be ignored in rural management, has been assigned to the directors\
    \ of WUAs; both our\ninterviewed government ofﬁcials and villagers believed that\
    \ water has been more efﬁciently allocated\nto individual farmers because they\
    \ know whom to turn to if they have problems with the allocation;\naccording to\
    \ the government documents, the rate of water fee collection increased from less\
    \ than 60%\nto over 90% and the number of water conﬂicts decreased from over 10\
    \ cases per village to nearly\nzero after the establishment of WUAs. Although\
    \ water management has been improved in general,\nthe implementation of WSI policies\
    \ was carried out without consultation with, or participation of,\nfarmers. Water\
    \ use permits were pre-determined by the government and WUAs deliver government\n\
    orders from the top. Our interviewed farmers attended WUA meetings mostly because\
    \ they cared\nabout the ofﬁcial decisions of the irrigation quota, fees, and time,\
    \ rather than participating in water\nuse decisions.\nThe failure of public participation\
    \ in WUAs of the SRB, just as in other places in China,\ncomes with the question:\
    \ Are farmers able, or are willing to, participate in WUAs? China has a\ncentralized\
    \ tradition, and the government shall take all responsibilities. It is the government’s\
    \ intention,\ninstead of the farmers’, to establish the WUAs. It is the government\
    \ ofﬁcials’ and experts’ decision,\nrather than the farmers’, of how to make use\
    \ of the water resources. The purpose of empowering\nWUAs is only to make it easy\
    \ to complete ofﬁcial tasks, such as allocating water use permits,\npromoting\
    \ WSI techniques, and collecting water fees. The performance evaluation on WUAs\
    \ is\nbased on how well the government’s tasks have been complemented, which has\
    \ nothing to do with\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n12 of 17\nfarmer’s participation.\
    \ The formation of the WUAs becomes an effective tool for the government\nmonitoring\
    \ and controlling water use at the village level [76], rather than an open platform\
    \ for farmers\ndefending their own interest. The WUAs fail to represent the interest\
    \ of their members, and the\ninformation exchanged between the government and\
    \ non-state beneﬁciaries remains to be a one-way\nand top-down manner. Under the\
    \ intense controlling power from the elite ofﬁcials, the WUAs,\nas well as their\
    \ members, normally have little autonomous power. On the other hand, farmers are\n\
    reluctant to win them with more responsibilities and rights in water management.\
    \ Our interviewed\nfarmers expressed their inclination of relying on the authorities\
    \ for irrigation management rather\nthan self-governance. Invariably, famers do\
    \ not believe that their advisory participation, such as\nallocating spare water\
    \ to the trees and shrubs around the canal after its lining, will be considered\
    \ by\npolicy-makers. A lack of political participation consciousness makes it\
    \ difﬁcult to encourage farmers\nto take the extra responsibilities and costs\
    \ in realizing effective self-governance. There is also a lack of\nincentive for\
    \ participation. Farmers have more access to off-farm employment and have depended\
    \ less\non irrigation than before. According to the government’s statistics, over\
    \ 60% of the prime working\nage farmers migrated out of their village for off-farm\
    \ employment, and the proportion of farmers’\nnon-farm income increased from 26%\
    \ in 2007 to 43% in 2015 [68,77]. This situation makes famers have\nless interest\
    \ in running the public affairs of the village.\n3.5. Discussion and Future Directions\n\
    The ecological crisis in the SRB used to be severe due to the exhaustive exploitation\
    \ and\nnon-sustainable use of water for irrigation. In the context of the national\
    \ WSI policies by which to stem\nthe rising demand for irrigation water, the water\
    \ management reform in the SRB is of both success\nand failure in the WSI. WSI\
    \ policies have been implemented by the combination of all these three\nmanagement\
    \ mechanisms, which involves top-down regulations through the administrative hierarchy,\n\
    design-bid funding for local governments’ competition, and bottom-up participation\
    \ by irrigation\nwater users. The effectiveness of the WSI management will be\
    \ determined by the performance of all\nrelevant stakeholders, including the central\
    \ government, local governments, village level organization,\nand famers. Different\
    \ WSI management mechanisms are on target for different stakeholders to convey\n\
    incentives for behavioural change.\nThe SRB was one of the important grain producing\
    \ regions in China before 2006. The inaction\nof the CWMP indicated that the central\
    \ government relaxed the food security and agriculture\ndevelopment requirement\
    \ in this area, with reducing agricultural water use being given the\nhighest\
    \ priority. Under the top-down mechanism, local ofﬁcials’ performance in the SRB\
    \ was greatly\nevaluated by their fulﬁlment of water-saving duties. Mandatory\
    \ WSI regulations, such as quota\ncontrol and price adjustment orders, were enforced\
    \ effectively by local governments. However,\nthis was sometimes at the expense\
    \ of agricultural production and famers’ income, which was\nalso the central government’s\
    \ concern. Although most farmers had changed their plantation to\nwater-saving\
    \ and high-value crops, they were still inclined to increase irrigation water\
    \ use and\nexpand their irrigation areas. As a result, some farmers managed to\
    \ have access to more water by\nstealing water and colluding with local ofﬁcials\
    \ in charge of water use, which was reported by the\nlocal media. Moreover, there\
    \ was a very large implementation gap of the top-down mechanism\nwhen comparing\
    \ the SRB with other regions.\nThis was mainly because the WSI has not been\n\
    considered as a priority for most local governments, compared with other policy\
    \ goals, such as\nensuring food security and poverty reduction. Under the design-bid\
    \ mechanism, the vertical level\nand horizontal scale of the institution had been\
    \ restructured to adapt the task-centred mode of\nmanagement. Local governments\
    \ had been motivated and had the decision-making power in carrying\nout and organizing\
    \ the grants program.\nAt the same time, the central government gained an\neffective\
    \ mobilizing power in the design and allocation of special funds, other than relied\
    \ solely\non the bureaucratic system. For non-state stakeholders, they played\
    \ no role in drawing up the plan,\nand they were largely excluded from decision-making\
    \ processes. More often than not, a lack of\nSustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n13\
    \ of 17\ncommunication between government and water-users obstructed the “quality”\
    \ of WSI decisions.\nUnder the bottom-up mechanism, the WUAs had been established\
    \ to promote the WSI theoretically\nbased on the participation of farmers. As\
    \ an individual was chosen to be accountable for the WSI\nmanagement at the village\
    \ level, governments increased their controlling power over ensuring the\nimplementation\
    \ of WSI decisions. In contrast with the traditional form of leader-run management,\n\
    directors in the WUAs were paid a bonus based on their performance, thus faced\
    \ with better incentives.\nFor farmers, fewer efforts had been made to encourage\
    \ their participation in the management.\nAs demonstrated above, the managerial\
    \ incentives created by the management mechanism reform\nled to the consolidation\
    \ of government authority. However, too much government control and the\nnear-absence\
    \ of famers’ participation affect the ability to deliver high quality WSI policies\
    \ and to\nimprove the implementation and compliance. The current management mechanisms\
    \ tend inevitably to\ndevolve into “trade-off of money and water-saving”, where\
    \ all relevant stakeholders attempt to pledge\neconomic interests instead of pledging\
    \ the consensus of public interest. The WSI management is faced\nwith the risk\
    \ of frangibility in the case that an external disturbance occurs, such as the\
    \ government’s\nbudget reduction, climate change, and free-riding chances. Clearly,\
    \ if policy-makers want to better\nsolve China’s water crises in water-scarce\
    \ areas, additional policies will be required to better align\nstakeholders’ incentives.\
    \ Indeed, there are cases where farmers may have greater incentives than\ngovernment\
    \ agencies to ensure the effective water conservation, such as in the cases in\
    \ Nepal [78],\nthe Philippines [79], and Bali [80]. Implications derived from\
    \ those cases indicate that a reliable and\nrobust WSI management should be community-based\
    \ with external assistance needed to be provided\nupon a request of the community.\
    \ It is vital to mobilize water users participating in the process of\nestablishing\
    \ WSI rules, and to ensure that their implementation, as well as supervisory practices,\n\
    is user-motivated, other than external controls from the performance-based management\
    \ system.\nA future management reform should focus on bringing meaningful water\
    \ users’ participation for\nthe improvement of decision-making process. Those\
    \ include the shared perception of environmental\nproblems by water users and\
    \ government ofﬁcials, the collective monitoring of mutual accountability,\nand\
    \ the establishment of trust for designing rules, so as to promote cooperation\
    \ and to resolve the\nconﬂict of interest among different stakeholders [5,40,44,64,78–81].\n\
    4. Conclusions\nTo feed the increasing population under the conditions of keeping\
    \ sound ecosystems\nand environment, there is an urgent need for China to produce\
    \ more food with less water, which makes\nthe effective WSI management more critical.\n\
    For saving irrigation water, China has changed\nits management from the supply-side\
    \ to demand-side by a range of institutional arrangements\nand policy goals.\n\
    Nevertheless, the fragmented bureaucratic responsibilities led to conﬂicts\nbetween\
    \ upper-level and lower-level agencies, as well as between government and water\
    \ users,\nwhich undermines the enforcement of WSI policies. In response to the\
    \ growing managerial conﬂicts,\nthis paper also explores how WSI can be achieved\
    \ by highlighting the three management mechanisms.\nThe top-down regulation mechanism,\
    \ by either direct control or economic instruments, helps determine\nthe allocation\
    \ of, and the pricing strategies for, irrigation water. The design-bid funding\
    \ mechanism\nprovides an effective way to achieve the central government’s WSI\
    \ intension by reducing the\nbarriers between the government’s different departments\
    \ and different levels.\nThe bottom-up\nparticipation mechanism, although remaining\
    \ nominal to a large extent, plays a key role in improving\nwater management at\
    \ the village level by the linkage between government and local water users.\n\
    Throughout the process of WSI management, different combinations of these mechanisms\
    \ have been\nused as an attempt for aligning stakeholders’ incentives to achieve\
    \ the planning objectives.\nFor the time of policy ﬂux over the past decade, the\
    \ implementation of WSI practices can\nrely on regulation, funding, and participation,\
    \ with their respective advantages in mobilizing\ndifferent stakeholders. However,\
    \ there are challenges faced by all three management mechanisms\nbecause of the\
    \ pervasive institutional and economical inefﬁciency and the continuing near-absence\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 2339\n14 of 17\nof end-user participation. Our ﬁeld research\
    \ shows that a wide diversity of measures has been used\nduring the implementation,\
    \ which provides an effective method to realize WSI objectives in SRB. At the\n\
    same time, there are conﬂicts among different policy goals, uneven distribution\
    \ of ﬁscal resources,\ninsufﬁcient participation from farmers, and unchanging,\
    \ if not the aggravating, authoritarianism of\nthe bureaucratic system. Thus,\
    \ the WSI management should consider providing more incentives not\nonly to policy-makers,\
    \ but also to the affected population in constructing participatory institutions\n\
    and governance.\nOur analysis enriches the current understanding of WSI management\
    \ in China and supports\nthe conclusion that the government should continue to\
    \ support management reform. Neither the\nhighly-bureaucratic irrigation institutional\
    \ arrangement, nor the involved enthusiasm of local\ngovernments’ applying for\
    \ funds, nor the nominal involvement of local water users, are sufﬁcient for\n\
    successful WSI management reforms. Problems it encountered in implementation have\
    \ rendered the\nimportance of facilitating meaningful participation of stakeholders\
    \ with the well-deﬁned regulatory\npowers and aligned water-saving purposes. Meanwhile,\
    \ different management strategies, rather than a\nfavorite cure-all mechanism\
    \ should be considered to provide WSI solutions based on the understanding\nof\
    \ local contexts. The research ﬁndings seeking for the attainment of the sustainable\
    \ WSI management\ncan also be applied to other countries facing similar water\
    \ shortages.\nAcknowledgments: Our research was part of a major project supported\

    Get rights and content Highlights • We assessed carbon and nitrogen footprint
    for double rice production in Southern China. • Fertilizer and farm machinery
    operation contributed most of both GHGs and Nr emissions of agricultural inputs.
    • CH4 emission and NH3 volatilization were the largest fraction of CF and NF of
    double rice. • Some effective solutions would be necessary to mitigate environmental
    pressure. Abstract Agriculture plays an important role in greenhouse gases (GHGs)
    emissions and reactive nitrogen (Nr) loss. Therefore, carbon (C) and nitrogen
    (N) footprint reductions in agro-ecosystem have become an increasingly hot topic
    in global climate change and agricultural adaptation. The objective of this study
    was to assess the C footprint (CF) and N footprint (NF) of double rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) production using life cycle assessment method in Southern China. The
    results showed that fertilizer application and farm machinery operation contributed
    the most to both GHGs and Nr emissions from agricultural inputs in the double
    rice production process. The CF for the early, late, and double rice was 0.86,
    0.83, and 0.85 kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1 at yield-scale, respectively. In addition,
    the NF was 10.47, 10.89, and 10.68 g N-eq kg−1 year−1 at yield-scale for the early,
    late and double rice, respectively. The largest fraction of CF and NF of double
    rice was the share of CH4 emission and NH3 volatilization from the paddy field,
    respectively. Higher CF and NF at yield-scale for Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan
    provinces were presented, compared to the average level in double rice cropping
    for the region, while smaller than those of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces.
    Some effective solutions would be favorable toward mitigating climate change and
    eutrophication of the double rice cropping region in Southern China, including
    reduction of fertilizer application rates, improvements in farm machinery operation
    efficiencies, and changes in regional allocation of double rice cropping areas.

    footprintLife cycle assessment 1. Introduction Anthropogenic environmental degradation
    (e.g., climate change, water eutrophication, acid rain) seriously threaten the
    well-being of humankind and other organisms on our planet. In recent decades,
    climate change has created numerous risks for natural and human systems, due to
    anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2),
    methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Stocker et al., 2013). Agriculture is one
    of the principal contributors to anthropogenic GHGs emissions, especially non-CO2
    emissions (i.e., CH4 and N2O emission) (Stocker et al., 2013). Meanwhile, synthetic
    nitrogen (N) fertilizers are widely applied in agricultural ecosystems to meet
    the food consumption demands associated with the rapid global population increase.
    However, excess N fertilizer''s reactive nitrogen (Nr, and all N forms except
    N2) is lost to air, water, and land, and can cause a cascade of environmental
    changes (e.g., water eutrophication, smog, acid rain, stratospheric ozone depletion,
    biodiversity loss) (Galloway et al., 2008). In addition, the indirect effects
    of secondary air pollutants (e.g., secondary particulate matter) from Nr deposition
    are more of a concern to human health and surrounding ecosystems (Moldanová et
    al., 2011). Quantifying and assessing the magnitude of the impacts of carbon (C)
    and Nr emissions on agro-ecosystems could facilitate a potential solution to mitigate
    climate change and further environmental issues, and be helpful in raising awareness
    and decision-making concerning environment-friendly technological development
    for the general public and policy makers. In recent decades, various footprint-style
    indicators, such as C footprint (CF), water footprint (WF), N footprint (NF),
    have been adopted to further understand how humanity exerts pressures on the environment
    (Fang et al., 2014). The CF concept was introduced to quantify the sum of GHGs
    emissions and removals as CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) in a product system, in order
    to assess and mitigate climate change (ISO, 2013). The NF is an indicator expressing
    the total amount of Nr lost to the environment due to human activities (Leach
    et al., 2012). Further studies have recently assessed the CF of field crops under
    different agricultural practices (Gan et al., 2011). Gan et al. (2014) quantified
    the CF of alternative wheat production systems suited to semiarid environments.
    Xue et al. (2014) assessed the CF of double rice (Oryza sativa L.) production
    under different tillage practices in Southern China. Xu et al. (2013) estimated
    the CF of rice production through the life cycle assessment (LCA) method in five
    typical rice cultivation regions in China. In addition, previous studies have
    aimed to find ways to assess the NF relative to the average per capita per country
    (Gu et al., 2013, Stevens et al., 2014) and food product types (Pierer et al.,
    2014, Xue and Landis, 2010, Leip et al., 2014). However, the NF in those reports
    using input–output methods are based on “virtual N factor” and only estimated
    N nutrient fluxes, rather than assessing the specific environmental impact of
    diverse Nr forms. Recently, the LCA method has been widely applied to quantitatively
    evaluate environmental impacts, such as the CF of a product. However, scarce information
    regarding NF calculated through LCA has been presented. In order to evaluate the
    environmental impact associated with Nr emissions in the entire stages of double
    rice production, LCA method was adopted in the study. Thus, the assessment of
    both CF and NF of agricultural products (e.g., food staples) is necessary to quantify
    the impacts of human activities on the environment. In China, rice is a chief
    food staple. Double cropped rice, consisting of the early and late rice, is one
    of the most principal cropping systems in Southern China. Generally, the early
    and late rice are manually transplanted in standing water by manually throwing
    of rice seedlings in April and July, and combine harvested in July and October,
    respectively. A large number of agricultural inputs are applied in the process
    of double rice cultivation, e.g., various fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, and
    film. Double rice, accounting for ∼45% (∼13.5 million hectare, Mha) of the total
    rice planting area and ∼40% (∼80 million tons, Mt) of the total rice yield, contributes
    significantly to national food security in China (Bai, 2013). Paddy fields are
    one of the most predominant CH4 emission sources globally, emitting approximately
    493–723 Mt CO2-eq year−1 in 2010 (FAO, 2013). In addition, China is the greatest
    consumer of N fertilizer alt ∼45 Mt, accounting for ∼37.6% of world consumption
    in 2012 (FAO, 2013). As well, about 37% of world N fertilizer applied for rice
    production was consumed in China (Peng et al., 2002). Rice produced in China exhibits
    a low N use efficiency (NUE) at only 35% (MAPRC, 2013), with remaining Nr lost
    to the environment and contributing to soil, air and water pollution. There have
    been investigations concerning the CF of Chinese agriculture, however, little
    information exists concerning the CF assessment of staple grain productions (e.g.,
    rice), and no information has been presented about the NF of food staples using
    the LCA approach. Quantitative assessments of CF and NF for double rice production
    are essential in mitigating climate change and reducing environmental pollution.
    The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate CF and NF of double rice production,
    (2) assess the composition of CF and NF for double rice production, and (3) understand
    the regional distribution of CF and NF for double rice produced in Southern China.
    Here, the potential contribution of double rice production to global warming was
    expressed as CO2-eq by quantifying all GHGs emissions and removals over the whole
    life cycle and growing stages of double rice production. In addition, the eutrophication
    potential caused by Nr losses was computed by N-eq in double rice production systems.
    Moreover, the distribution of CF and NF was analyzed from various provinces in
    Southern China. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study region Generally, double rice,
    including the early and late rice, is cultivated in Southern China. The annual
    average yields of double rice were 51–67% higher than those of single rice from
    1964 to 2007 in China (Zhu, 2010). The primary double rice production regions,
    including Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi,
    and Hainan provinces, were analyzed due to a lack of data from others provinces
    in this study (Fig. 1). The agro-ecological conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature,
    sunshine duration) for the above provinces are showed in Table 1. The annual mean
    precipitation ranged from 1161.1 to 1752.5 mm for those provinces. The annual
    values among provinces ranged from 15.4 to 25.1 °C for average temperature, 11.6
    to 22.5 °C for minimum temperature, and 20.2 to 29.0 °C for maximum temperature.
    The annual sunshine duration ranged from 1445.6 to 2242.0 h for different regions.

    during 1980–2012. The above data sourced from the China Meteorological Data Sharing
    Service System (CMDSSS, 2014). 2.2. System boundaries and functional units The
    GHGs emissions and Nr losses from agricultural inputs and paddy fields were assessed
    for the entire production chain of double rice (both early and late rice). The
    system boundaries of this study included the entire stage of double rice production
    from raw material acquisition of agricultural inputs, field agricultural production
    processes to farm gate (rice harvest). The GHGs and Nr emissions included the
    following: (1) production, storage, and transportation of agricultural inputs
    (e.g., seeds, films, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides) to the farm gate, and
    application; (2) energy consumption from farm machinery operation (e.g., tillage,
    irrigation, harvest); (3) total CH4 and N2O seasonal emissions from paddy fields,
    as well as NH3 volatilization, and NO3− and NH4+ leaching during double rice growing
    periods. Generally, most of double rice is sold as a commodity by individual farmers
    after harvest. Therefore, the equivalent rice grain yields (kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1
    and g N-eq kg−1 year−1) are defined as the functional units in this study. 2.3.
    Inventory data collection The relative inventory database was compiled on an annual
    double rice production basis from 2004 to 2012, which was collated from national
    statistical reports and related literature. The agricultural inputs and rice yields
    were directly or indirectly collected from the National Cost-Benefit Survey for
    Agricultural Product (NCBSAP, 2005–2013) from 2004 to 2012 in China. Synthetic
    fertilizers consisted of N, P2O5, K2O, and compound fertilizers. Data for double
    rice planting areas of different provinces was obtained from the China Rural Statistical
    Yearbook (CRSY, 2005–2013) series throughout the period of 2004–2012. The growing
    periods of the early and late rice for different provinces were calculated through
    the duration between the transplanting and harvest stage, sourced from the China
    Meteorological Data Sharing Service System (CMDSSS, 2014). The energy consumption
    consisted primarily of diesel used for farm machinery operation during the double
    rice growing seasons. The farm machinery operations required for double rice production
    primarily include tillage, rice-seedling throwing, harvesting, and transportation
    associated with machinery operations. The amount of diesel required was estimated
    by dividing the direct diesel cost by the price of diesel per kilogram (kg) each
    year. According to Cui et al. (2011), it was hypothesized that the direct diesel
    cost accounted for ∼21% of total farm machinery operational expenses. The total
    expenses, which can be determined from the current dataset, included additional
    service costs (e.g., maintenance, repair, labor). Typically, diesel-powered pumping
    is the predominant irrigation method in these regions. Thus, diesel consumptions
    for irrigation and drainage were included with that of farm machinery operation.
    The diesel use was computed using the same method as previously described for
    machine operation. The applied pesticide amounts were derived from published literature
    (He, 1999). The emission factors of GHGs and Nr for all agricultural inputs (e.g.,
    synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, diesel) were obtained from the IKE eBalance
    v3.0 (IKE Environmental Technology CO., Ltd, China), including the Chinese Life
    Cycle Database, European reference Life Cycle database and Ecoinvent database.
    2.4. Carbon footprint calculation The CF of rice is determined by dividing all
    GHGs emissions from agricultural inputs and non-CO2 GHGs emissions (i.e., CH4
    and N2O) from paddy fields by grain yield for the early, late, and double rice.
    Estimation of CF of double rice was calculated using the following Eq. (1) (ISO,
    2013, Gan et al., 2011): (1) where CFy is the total CF for each kg of rice grain
    produced, including the early, late, and double rice (kg CO2-eq kg−1 ha−1 year−1);
    Y is the rice yield (kg ha−1 year−1); CEtotal is the total GHGs emissions associated
    with the entire life cycle of rice production (kg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1). (2) (3)
    where CEinputs is the indirect total amount of GHGs emissions associated with
    agricultural inputs (kg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1); and are the cumulative amounts of
    direct CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields, converted to CO2 equivalent (kg

    for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006). The CH4 emissions from rice
    cultivation were estimated using Eq. (4): (4) where is the annual methane emission
    per unit of rice cultivation (kg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1); EFijk is a daily emission
    factor for i, j, and k conditions from Eq. (5) (kg CH4 ha−1 day−1); tijk is the

    the scaling factor is 0.60 for the specific case; SFp is the scaling factor to
    account for the differences in water regime in the pre-season prior to the cultivation
    period, the scaling factor is 1 for the disaggregated case because the non-flooded
    pre-season is <180 days under double cropping rice production; SFo is the scaling
    factor which varies for both type and amount of organic amendment applied from
    Eq. (6); it was assumed that rice straw was the main organic amendment in this
    study area, and the amount of straw retention was half of that from the previous
    year. (6) where ROAi is the application rate of organic amendment from Eq. (7)
    (t ha−1); CFOAi is the conversion factor for organic amendment i; 1 is the conversion
    factor of different types of organic amendment to CH4 emission, when rice straw
    is incorporated into the soil at <30 days before cultivation under double rice
    cropping conditions. (7) where Y is the yield of double rice (kg ha−1 year−1),
    0.623 is the residue/grain ratio of rice (Li et al., 1998), 0.5 is the coefficient
    of rice straw retention that indicates the percentage of the amount of straw retention

    the conversion coefficient from fresh weight to dry weight for rice straw (Lu
    et al., 2010), 0.001 is a unit conversion factor (t kg−1). The direct N2O emissions

    of N2O relative to CO2 over a 100-year horizon. Common products (N:P2O5:K2O =
    15:15:15) were the main varieties of compound fertilizers generally available
    in Chinese markets (Zhang et al., 2009), the pure N concentrations of compound
    fertilizers were calculated according to the above percentages. 2.5. Calculation

    eutrophication releases to the air, water and soil, and to assess the impact associated
    with Nr emissions and losses during double rice production. And, the NF of rice
    produced was calculated according to ISO 14044 (ISO, 2006). (9) where NFy is the
    total NF for each kg of rice grain yield (g N-eq kg−1 ha−1 year−1); NEtotal is

    Nr emissions, including manufactured and/or applied (g N-eq kg−1). The Nr emission
    from foreground system included NH3 volatilization, N2O emission, NO3− and NH4+
    leaching, which was calculated through multiplying pure N use amount by relative
    loss coefficient, and converted to the value of eutrophication potential through
    multiplying eutrophication potential factors based on internationally published
    manuals (Eqs. (12), (13), (14), (15)). Here, is the volatilization loss of NH3

    reactive nitrogen emissions from agricultural inputs Double rice production was
    primarily distributed throughout nine provinces in Southern China (Table 2). From
    2004 to 2012, the total planting area was 578.2 × 104 and 622.7 × 104 ha year−1
    for the early and late rice, respectively. The total planting area from Jiangxi,
    Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces accounted for ∼80% of total double rice
    planting area. The planting areas of the late rice were larger than those of the
    early rice in all provinces. The average yields from all regions were 5965.2,
    6111.8, and 12,077.0 kg ha−1 year−1 for the early, late and double rice during
    the period, respectively. The average yields ranged from 5603.6 to 6317.2 kg ha−1
    year−1 for the early and 4064.9 to 7059.4 kg ha−1 year−1 for late rice and 9668.5
    to 13,005.2 kg ha−1 year−1, respectively. The yields for the early were greater
    than that for late rice in Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces, and
    the opposite for others provinces. Table 2. The average planting area and yield

    of yield for all provinces sourced from the National Cost-Benefit Survey for Agricultural
    Product during 2004–2012. The life cycle inventory dataset, consisting of agricultural
    inputs and paddy fields, was presented, in detail, based on the above defined
    system boundaries (Table 3). Based on the above dataset, the average GHGs and
    Nr emissions from agricultural inputs were calculated and analyzed in Table 4.
    For double rice production, the average GHGs emission from agricultural inputs
    was slightly larger for the early than for late rice (Table 4). The agricultural
    inputs contributed 2054.5, 1811.0, and 3865.4 kg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1 of GHGs emissions
    for the early, late, and double rice, respectively. The GHGs emissions of synthetic
    fertilizers (including N fertilizers, P2O5 fertilizers, K2O fertilizers, and compound
    fertilizers) were the most significant fractions of the total agricultural inputs,
    accounting for 76.51, 80.85, and 78.55% for the early, late, and double rice,
    respectively. The GHGs emissions amount from diverse forms of synthetic fertilizers
    followed the order: N fertilizers > compound fertilizers > P2O5 fertilizers >
    K2O fertilizers for both early and late rice. In addition, GHGs emissions from
    N and P2O5 fertilizers were higher for the early than late rice, but larger that
    for the late than early rice for other fertilizers. Following synthetic fertilizers,
    farm machinery operation was the second largest contributor to GHGs emissions,
    accounting for 11.10, 13.59, and 12.27% for the early, late, and double rice,
    respectively. Meanwhile, greater GHGs emissions from farm machinery operation
    were observed for the late than for early rice. The GHGs emissions from seeds
    and films were significantly greater for the early than for late rice. The GHGs
    emissions from pesticides, associated with herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides,
    were lowest, only accounting for 1.50, 2.22, and 1.84% for the early, late, and
    double rice, respectively. Table 3. Life cycle inventory for double rice production

    were presented here, and the relevant data derived from the National Cost-Benefit
    Survey for Agricultural Product during 2004–2012. b Application of fertilizers
    were calculated through dividing the concentration of effective components for
    all sorts of fertilizers by the corresponding percentage of effective components.
    Thereinto, all fertilizers consisted of N, P2O5, K2O, and mixed and compound fertilizer.
    In current dataset, N fertilizers included mainly urea (46% of N) and ammonium
    bicarbonate (18% of N). P2O5 fertilizers covered primarily calcium superphosphate
    (17% of P2O5). Most of K2O fertilizers was potassium chloride (55% of K2O). Compound
    fertilizer (45% of N, P2O5, and K2O) was the most contributor of mixed and compound
    fertilizer. c Amount of diesel application was estimated due to farm machinery
    operation consisting of tillage, seedling throwing, irrigation, and harvesting.
    d Pesticides application rate sourced from investigation in double rice production.
    e The direct CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy field were calculated through the
    method given by 2006 IPCC guidelines. The NH3 volatilization was estimated through
    multiplying pure N rate by the loss rate. The quantities of NO3− and NH4+ leaching
    were estimated multiplying pure N rate by the leaching coefficient Table 4. The

    a Double rice consisted of the early and late rice. The dataset in Table 4 were
    the average hidden GHGs and Nr emissions from agricultural inputs in those process
    of production, storage, and transportation during 2004–2012, which did not include
    GHGs and Nr emissions during the double rice cropping period in the field. The
    hidden GHGs and Nr emissions were calculated through multiplying the actual application
    amount by the specific emission rate (Eq. (11)). The actual application amount
    of agricultural inputs was presented in Table 2, and dataset of that derived from
    the National Cost-Benefit Survey for Agricultural Product during 2004–2012. The
    specific emission factor of individual agricultural input sourced from the IKE
    eBalance v3.0 (IKE Environmental Technology CO., Ltd, China). Differences on Nr
    emissions from agricultural inputs were observed when comparing with GHGs emissions
    (Table 4). The Nr emissions related to agricultural inputs for the early rice
    were nearly equivalent to late rice. Similar to GHGs emissions, the Nr emissions
    of fertilizer applications also shared the largest percentage of agricultural
    inputs, being 364.1, 323.5, and 687.6 g N-eq ha−1 year−1 for the early, late,
    and double rice, respectively. Meanwhile, the order of Nr emissions from diverse
    forms of synthetic fertilizers was consistent with those for GHGs emissions. Next
    to synthetic fertilizers, farm machinery operation emitted 203.9, 323.3, and 423.8
    g N-eq ha−1 year−1 for the early, late, and double rice, respectively, accounting
    for 29.79, 47.23, and 33.48%, respectively. The Nr emissions from seeds and films
    for the early rice were also greater than those for the late rice. The pesticides
    were still the least contributor of Nr emissions in double rice production, accounting
    for less than 2% of both early and late rice production. 3.2. Carbon footprint
    and nitrogen footprint of double rice Larger CF was observed for the early than
    late rice (Fig. 2). For double rice production, the CF for the early, late and
    double rice were 0.86, 0.83, and 0.85 kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1 at yield-scale, respectively.
    The CH4 emissions from paddy fields made the largest contribution to the CF of
    double rice production, accounting for 55.09, 59.64, and 57.36% for the early,
    late, and double rice, respectively. The GHGs emissions associated with agricultural
    inputs were the second largest contributor to the CF of double rice production,
    accounting for 40.14, 35.57, and 37.86% for early, late and double rice, respectively.
    The N2O emissions from paddy fields had a small impact on the CF of both early
    and late rice. The NF for early, late and double rice were 10.47, 10.89, and 10.68
    g N-eq kg−1 year−1 at yield-scale, respectively. The overwhelming majority of
    NF was due to NH3 volatilization from paddy fields associated with N fertilizer
    applications for double rice production, accounting for 95.13, 95.58, and 95.36%
    for the early, late, and double rice, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    rice cropping region The distribution of total GHGs and Nr emissions per unit
    area for the process of double rice production among provinces were shown in Fig.
    3. For the early rice production process, the total GHGs and Nr emissions ranged
    from 4.6 to 5.7 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1 and 53.6 to 70.1 kg N-eq ha−1 year−1, respectively.
    Compared to the average of all provinces, both higher total GHGs and Nr emissions
    per unit area were observed in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, but lower that
    in Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. There were larger Nr with smaller GHGs emission
    for Zhejiang province compared to the mean value, and greater GHGs with lower
    Nr emission for Hainan province. For the late rice production process, the total
    GHGs and Nr emissions ranged from 4.7 to 5.9 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1 and 53.7 to
    78.3 kg N-eq ha−1 year−1 among provinces, respectively. Both higher total GHGs
    and Nr emissions per unit area were observed in Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi,
    and Fujian, in comparison to the mean of the study regions, but lower that in
    Hainan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Larger Nr with smaller GHGs emissions were
    observed in Anhui province, compared to the mean values. In addition, the distributions
    of total GHGs and Nr emissions per unit area for the entire double rice production
    were similar to that for the late rice production for all provinces, except Hainan.
    Smaller Nr with greater GHGs emission were observed in Hainan. Download : Download

    (Fig. 3). The CF of the early rice among provinces ranged from 0.79 to 0.97 kg
    CO2-eq kg−1 year−1 and 9.31 to 11.67 g N-eq kg−1 year−1, respectively. Taking
    the CF and NF for each kg of grain yield into account, both the CF and NF for
    the early rice were higher for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces than other provinces.
    The CF of the early rice for Fujian and Hainan provinces were also larger than
    average, but lower NF were observed. Larger NF and lower CF were observed for
    Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, in comparison with the average of nine provinces.
    Both a smaller CF and NF were observed for the early rice at Hubei, Hunan, and
    Jiangxi. The CF of the late rice ranged from 0.71 to 1.22 kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1
    and 9.49 to 13.49 g N-eq kg−1 year−1 among provinces, respectively. Both a larger
    CF and NF for the late rice in Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, and Fujian provinces
    were observed, compared to the mean value of all nine provinces. There were both
    lower CF and NF for late rice at Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. For the entire
    double rice production, there were greater CF and NF for double rice for Guangxi,
    Guangdong, and Hainan provinces. Smaller CF and NF were observed for Jiangxi,
    Hubei, and Hunan provinces. Higher NF but lower CF were observed for Anhui and
    Zhejiang provinces, and higher CF but lower NF were observed for Fujian province.
    4. Discussion The data presented herein indicate that average GHGs emissions from
    agricultural inputs was higher for the early than late rice. Seasonal difference
    of GHGs emissions may be due to greater applications of P2O5 fertilizer, seeds
    and films for the early rice in the spring season, in spite of larger pesticide,
    mixed and compound fertilizers applications, and farm machinery operations for
    the late rice (Table 3). There were small differences in N and K2O fertilizer
    applications between the early and late rice production. However, no difference
    in Nr emission for agricultural inputs was observed between the early and late
    rice in the study. Higher Nr emissions from farm machinery operations in the late
    rice season may be the reason for this result. In this study, synthetic fertilizers
    and farm machinery operations were the main determinants for both GHGs and Nr
    emissions from agricultural inputs for double rice production. Synthetic fertilizers
    accounted for >75% of GHGs emissions from agricultural inputs in both the early
    and late rice seasons. Lower fertilizer applications and farm machinery operations
    are obviously favorable to reduced GHGs and Nr emissions. For example, utilizing
    the “National Fertilization According to Soil Test Result” program (NFASTR) could
    reduce the artificial fertilizer application rate by ∼20% per unit area (CPGPRC,
    2012), which can decrease related GHGs and Nr emissions in upstream production
    links and the direct Nr loss from paddy fields. Moreover, adoption of conservation
    tillage (e.g., minimum tillage, no tillage) can reduce diesel consumption resulting
    in reduction of GHGs and Nr emissions from farm machinery operations (Xue et al.,
    2014). Due to lower temperatures during the rice seedling stage, larger seeding
    and film rates are utilized during the early rice production to ensure good seedling
    emergence, which results in higher GHGs emissions. Thus, selection of frost-resistant
    cultivars would be an effective measure to decrease the quantity of seed and film
    applications. The CF for the early and late rice in the study ranged from 0.79
    to 0.97 and 0.71 to 1.22 kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1 among provinces, respectively.
    Xu et al. (2013) showed that the CF of rice production was 2.50, 2.33, 1.89, 1.54,
    and 1.34 kg CO2-eq kg−1 on yield-scale in Guangdong, Hunan, Heilongjiang, Sichuan
    and Jiangsu, respectively. The average CF was estimated as ∼1.36 kg CO2-eq kg−1
    for rice production on the basis of national statistical dataset in China (Cheng
    et al., 2015). Different values of CF of rice could be primarily attributed to
    differences of the source and quality of data collection, system boundary, the
    emission factor of agricultural inputs, and the calculation method among studies.
    In addition, paddy rice cultivation is a primary contributor to global CH4 emissions
    (Stocker et al., 2013). The CH4 emission from paddy fields is a primary component
    of CF of double rice in this study, similar with others studies (Cheng et al.,
    2015, Cao et al., 2014). Reduction of rice paddy field CH4 emissions would be
    an efficient solution toward lowering the CF of double rice. Adoption of appropriate
    farming practices could reduce CH4 emissions from paddy rice cultivation, such
    as optimizing tillage practice and improving water and fertilizer management.
    Adoption of reasonable water management (e.g., intermittent irrigation, flooding-midseason
    drainage-frequent water logging with intermittent irrigation, and flooding-midseason
    drainage-reflooding-moist intermittent irrigation without water logging) have
    been promoted to reduce CH4 emission compared to continuous flooding during rice
    growing seasons (Hou et al., 2012). Moreover, adoption of no tillage can significantly
    reduce CH4 emissions compared with conventional plow tillage and rotary tillage
    during the double rice growing seasons (Zhang et al., 2013, Li et al., 2012).
    Reduction of CH4 emissions from paddy fields would be paramount in reducing the
    CF of rice production. The average NF of the early and late rice among regions
    was 10.47 and 10.89 g N-eq kg−1 year−1 in the study, respectively. Xue and Landis
    (2010) estimated that the NF was ∼2.65 g N-eq kg−1 of cereals production by using
    the LCA method in the Gulf of Mexico. The NF of cereals on yield-scale was estimated
    as ∼21.9 g N-eq kg−1 based on the input–output analysis in Austria (Pierer et
    al., 2014). Difference of the calculation method was a main reason among studies.
    In addition, the difference of N management in the process of cereals production
    was also a possible cause resulting in the difference of Nr loss. The NH3 volatilization
    was the principal NF source during double rice production in this study, similar
    with the result reported by Leip et al. (2014). The NH3 volatilization increased
    linearly with the N fertilizer application rates in both early and late seasons
    (Wang et al., 2012). In addition, the contribution of NH3 volatilization to NF
    was larger for the late than early rice in the study. The trend could be attributed
    to higher air and soil temperatures during the late growing season, which would
    facilitate soil urease activity resulting in higher soil NH4+-N concentration
    in the paddy field (Wang et al., 2012). Results indicated that reduction of N
    fertilization rates and improvements in NUE played an essential role in reducing
    the NF of double rice production. According to the report of fertilizer use efficiencies
    of the three main staple crops, the NUE of those crops have improved by 5% since
    the implementation of the NFASTR program (in 2005) in China (MAPRC, 2013). The
    integrated high-efficiency practice, combining improved fertilization and irrigation
    management with improved crop cultivation technologies, is effective in reducing
    NH3 losses and improving the NUE in rice production systems (Cao et al., 2013).
    The Nr pollution poses an even more serious threat than C, due to the complex
    process involving many chemical forms (Sutton et al., 2011). However, at the present
    time, a comprehensive policy aiming to reduce Nr emissions is not yet in existence
    in China. Therefore, new policies are necessary to promote and encourage changes
    in farm management practices. Differences in total GHGs and Nr emissions per unit
    area among provinces were observed for the double rice production. These differences
    may be attributed to the differences in agricultural input rates (e.g., synthetic
    fertilizers), farming management (e.g., irrigation, tillage), climate conditions
    (e.g., precipitation, temperature) and soil types among study regions, which could
    affect the indirect and direct CH4 and N2O emissions, and other Nr losses for
    double rice production. In this study, the CF and NF of double rice were evaluated
    from the perspective of agricultural production and environmental impacts. How
    to balance food production and environment burden represents a challenge for the
    scientific community and policy makers. In addition, the NF at yield-scale increases
    with the CF for double rice production. The NF reduction for double rice production
    was equally as important as that of the CF toward the mitigation of environmental
    pressure. Moreover, the balance between the CF and NF among provinces also represents
    a significant issue to be addressed regarding the sustainable production of double
    rice. In recent decades, the percentage of cropping area for double rice in China
    decreased rapidly from 71.3% of total rice area in 1975 to 40.7% in 2007, due
    to following: an increase in the single rice planting area, labor shortage, and
    lower economic profit (Zhu, 2010). Results of this study showed that a lower CF
    and NF at yield-scale were realized for some provinces (i.e., Jiangxi, Hubei,
    and Hunan), while larger for others (i.e., Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan). Appropriate
    restoration of double rice planting areas for the above former provinces with
    lower CF and NF, simultaneously, moderate reductions for latter provinces with
    higher footprints, could also be a potential solution to mitigate climate change
    and eutrophication of the entire double rice cropping region of Southern China.
    Relevant analysis would need to be conducted in the future. However, more agricultural
    inputs (e.g., synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and diesel) would be applied
    to increase grain yields when the planting area of double rice decreased in latter
    provinces. Therefore, the tradeoff between food security and environmental degradation
    will remain a challenge for China in the future. Recently, the calculation approach
    for NF has been heavily discussed in the scientific community. Beside the output–input
    method, LCA is also one of several environmental management techniques to assess
    the environmental performance of products in their production cycles (ISO, 2006).
    Therefore, LCA has been introduced to assess the environmental burden due to Nr
    losses from double rice production in this study. The virtual N factor, which
    indicates all Nr losses related to an initial investment of N fertilizer into
    a system, has been used to calculate Nr loss rates for each food category in existing
    literature (Leach et al., 2012). The NF has been expressed as environmental impacts
    through the size of N nutrient flows in other studies. However, there are different
    and complex consequences for various chemical forms and types (e.g., NH3, N2O,
    and NOx). Adoption of the LCA approach can provide Nr loss inventories for various
    Nr forms for each production link in detail, which could then be standardized
    to the specific impact category. However, only eutrophication potential is considered
    to be an environmental impact category resulting from all Nr species losses in
    this study. In fact, excessive Nr losses can also cause a diverse array of environmental
    degradation (e.g., acidification and global warming). Further exploration of synthesizing
    various environmental impacts would need to be conducted for a comprehensive assessment
    of NF in future research. Some limitations are also presented relating to the
    dataset collection process of this study. A case was hypothesized that the diesel-powered
    pump was used for irrigation and drainage in rice production; however, there was
    actually a certain percentage of electric power associated with irrigation and
    drainage. Thus, higher Nr emissions but lower GHGs emissions can be presented,
    which may be due to higher Nr but lower GHGs emissions per unit diesel compared
    with electric power. In addition, pesticide quantities used were collected from
    a specific location in other studies. However, slight differences in pesticide
    application amounts are presented among different regions due to different distributions
    of disease and insect pests during the double rice cropping season. In spite of
    the limitation, the general trends of GHGs and Nr emissions from pesticide applications
    did not vary due to being only a small percentage of total emissions. In our study,
    kinds of fertilizers application amount sourced from the statistical dataset of
    the National Cost-Benefit Survey for Agricultural Product indicated the average
    use amount of fertilizer for each province. However, there were large fluctuations
    in fertilizer use rate among the different provinces and among the different regions
    in any province. Moreover, the same loss ratios for NH3 volatilization in double
    rice cropping system were applied in NF calculations for each province, which
    could cause some discrepancies with actual values due to the effects of soil properties,
    climate conditions and farm management practices among regions (Sommer et al.,
    2004). In addition, a possible difference of N fertilizer use amount was observed
    in different studies (Zhang et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012), which could lead
    to the difference of NH3 volatilization. Despite the above limitations, trends
    in NH3 contributions would likely not change for the NF of double rice. And, exploring
    a method to access the NF of rice is a major aim for the current manuscript. The
    CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields were estimated according to the recommended
    methods of “2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas inventories” in the
    study, resulting in the imprecise value compared to field measurement. However,
    that is a reliable method for the estimation of CH4 and N2O emissions at regional
    scale. 5. Conclusion On the basis of the above analysis, optimization of synthetic
    fertilizers application is necessary to reduce the NF of double rice, especially
    the late rice. An adjustment of planting zones for double rice cropping is some
    possible measures to balance both CF and NF of double rice among regions. There
    is a strong need to take some potential measures to mitigate climate change and
    decrease N-management-induced environmental pollution in Southern China, e.g.,
    fertilizer management, reducing soil tillage, and saving irrigation. Acknowledgments

    19 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The intensification of agricultural practices
    to increase food and feed outputs is a pressing challenge causing deterioration
    of soil quality and soil functions. Such a challenge demands provision of empirical
    evidence to provide context-sensitive guidance on agricultural management practices
    (AMPs) that may enhance soil quality. The objectives of this study are to identify
    the most promising AMPs (and their combinations) applied by farmers with the most
    positive effects on soil quality and to evaluate the sensitivity of the soil quality
    indicators to the applied AMPs. The effect of selected AMPs on soil quality was
    assessed using a visual soil assessment tool in a total of 138 pairs of plots
    spread across 14 study site areas in Europe and China covering representative
    pedo-climatic zones. The inventory and scoring of soil quality were conducted
    together with landowners. Results show that 104 pairs show a positive effect of
    AMPs on soil quality. Higher effects of the AMPs were observed in lower fertile
    soils (i.e., Podzols and Calcisols) as opposed to higher fertile soils (i.e.,
    Luvisols and Fluvisols). For the single use applications, the AMPs with positive
    effects were crop rotation; manuring, composting, and no-tillage; followed by
    organic agriculture and residue maintenance. Cluster analysis showed that the
    most promising combinations of AMPs with the most positive effects on soil quality
    are composed of crop rotation, mulching, and min-till. The agreement between scientific
    skills and empirical knowledge in the field identified by the farmers confirm
    our findings and ensures their applicability. Abbreviations AMP agricultural management

    1 INTRODUCTION Agricultural soils are under a wide variety of pressures, including
    increasing global demand for food associated with population growth, land degradation,
    and productivity reductions, potentially exacerbated by climate change effects
    (Rogger et al., 2017). Restoration of soil ecological functions, productivity,
    and regulation services, as well as prevention of further degradation, can be
    achieved with appropriate management practices. Because such practices are highly
    adaptable to the specific conditions where they are applied, they may reduce the
    potential negative effects of extensive areas of monocultures and the intensive
    use of heavy machinery (e.g., Sarker et al., 2018). Over the last decade, there
    has been growing interest on the effect of agricultural management practices (AMPs)
    on soil organic carbon (SOC), nutrient cycling, and storage worldwide (Dalal,
    Allen, Wang, Reeves, & Gibson, 2011; Hoyle & Murphy, 2011; Hoyle, Antuono, Overheu,
    & Murphy, 2013; Kopittke, Dalal, & Menzies, 2016). The nutrient contents of soil
    may be maintained or enhanced with appropriate AMPs, such as incorporation of
    organic matter into the system (Sarker et al., 2018). Management practices such
    as (a) long-term no-till or reduced-tillage with stubble retention (i.e., crop
    residues) and/or organic manure incorporation combined with synthetic fertilizer
    application, and (b) mixed crop–pasture and perennial pastures are usually associated
    with increasing or maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM) and associated nutrients
    (Dalal et al., 2011; Hoyle et al., 2013; Sarker et al., 2018). Maintenance and/or
    addition of crop residue are also vital to maintain and increase soil carbon (C)
    stocks through the formation of humus and soil macro-aggregates (Alidad, Mehdi,
    Sadegh, Hassan, & Sanaz, 2012; Liu, Lu, Cui, Li, & Fang, 2014), and hence help
    mitigate climate change effects (Chatterjee, 2013; Dikgwatlhe, Chen, Lal, Zhang,
    & Chen, 2014). Conservation tillage, including many practices such as noninversion
    tillage with tined tools at depths down to 15–20 cm, redistributes C content within
    the soil profile (Cookson, Murphy, & Roper, 2008; Cooper et al., 2016; Powlson,
    Stirling, Thierfelder, White, & Jat, 2016), with positive effects on soil chemical
    properties in the upper soil layer and contributes to the increase of wheat biomass
    (Peigné, Vian, Payet, & Saby 2018). Direct seeding without prior cultivation intends
    to protect the soil surface from crusting and erosion by leaving crop residues
    and organic matter at the surface. All these practices enhance the quantity, activity,
    and diversity of soil microorganisms in the upper soil layers (Cookson et al.,
    2008), as well as earthworm biomass and diversity (Pelosi et al., 2014). These
    benefits are accompanied by reduced labor requirements, energy consumption, and
    machinery costs (Soane et al., 2012). To manage agricultural soils appropriately,
    decision makers need science-based, easily applicable, and cost-effective tools
    to assess soil quality and functions. Since the assessment of soil quality comprises
    measuring key soil properties and their variations in space and time, providing
    such tools remains a research challenge. Assessment of soil quality is required
    for evaluation of the overall sustainability of agricultural systems, identification
    of areas with production problems, estimation of biomass production, and monitoring
    environmental changes driven by AMPs (Doran & Parkin, 1996). In recent years,
    several methods of visual field examination have been developed to provide a direct
    description of soil structure, which is considered as the property most frequently
    evaluated when determining soil quality under different land uses and tillage
    practices (Ball & Munkholm, 2015). The main aim of this study is to evaluate the
    effect of different AMPs in use by farmers in 138 pairs of plots spread across
    14 different pedo-climatic zones of Europe and China, based on a visual soil assessment
    (VSA) method. Areas within both continents are evaluated separately to highlight
    soil quality differences from developed and developing areas, where agricultural
    intensification based on conventional approaches is expected to result in severe
    soil degradation. The specific objectives of the present study are to (a) identify
    the most promising AMPs (and/or their combinations) with high positive effects
    on soil quality, and (b) evaluate the sensitivity of the soil quality indicators
    used for the assessment of AMPs. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Plots and AMPs evaluated
    In 2016, the effect of selected AMPs on soil quality was assessed in a total of
    138 pairs of plots spread across 14 study site areas (SSA), including 10 located
    in Europe and four in China (Figure 1). These plots were used as case studies
    under the European iSQAPER project – Interactive Soil Quality Assessment in Europe
    and China for Agricultural Productivity and Environmental Resilience. The criteria
    used to select the pairs of plots and full descriptions of the SSAs, including
    the pedo-climatic regions, farming systems, and AMPs tested, is provided in Barão,
    Basch, Alaoui, and Schwilch (2019). In 2018, a second assessment of soil quality
    was carried out to check the first outcomes. A total of 58 pairs of plots were
    considered (40 in Europe, and 18 in China). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer Fourteen
    case study sites covering the major types of farming systems and pedo-climatic
    zones across Europe and China used in the current study To ensure reliable comparison
    between results of all case study sites, standardized methods with related guidelines
    on how to assess the indicators have been compiled into a manual established for
    this purpose. This allows for a harmonization of the methods across Europe and
    China (See Supplemental Material for manual). The case study site leaders were
    asked to follow the procedure described in the manual for the assessment of soil
    quality. Core Ideas The effects of agricultural management practices on soil quality
    was assessed. Selected AMPs have high positive effects on soil quality in low
    fertile soils. Selection of visual soil indicators was confirmed by the farmers’
    knowledge. While not always possible, sampling soils in their original, native,
    nondisturbed conditions and comparing with a plot serving as reference soil is
    important to determine whether an area was subject to deterioration, such as soil
    compaction or loss of organic matter, as result of applied AMPs (Ball et al.,
    2017). In all case study sites, soil quality was assessed at the topsoil between
    0 and 30 cm. Each pair includes a plot where the AMP has been used for at least
    the last five years (plot-AMP) and a plot where the corresponding conventional
    practice was implemented for a similar period (plot-control). As an example, if
    the farmer uses crop rotation in the plot-AMP, a monoculture was practiced in
    the plot-control over the last five years. In order to be comparable, pairs of
    plots have the same soil type and land use history and are located within a few
    meters of distance. The previously selected 138 pair of plots include a myriad
    of AMPs and their combinations (Barão et al., 2019) in use by European and Chinese
    farmers and, thus, represent the promising management choices undertaken locally.
    This study includes the soil quality assessment of (a) 98 pairs of plots where
    17 different AMPs were used in isolation (e.g., no-till, residue maintenance,
    irrigation management), (b) 23 pairs of plots where 19 different combinations
    of two AMPs were used (e.g., min-till and irrigation management), and (c) 17 pairs
    of plots where 16 different combinations of 3–7 AMPs were used (Table 1). The
    majority of the evaluated pairs of plots (92) are practiced in arable lands, 17
    pairs address management practices in pasture, and 29 pairs represent permanent
    farming systems. TABLE 1. Agricultural management practices (AMPs) used by European

    AMPs by farmers on soil quality was evaluated with 11 visual soil indicators in
    the plot-AMP and related plot-control. Based on extensive literature review (e.g.,
    Ball et al., 2017; Mueller et al., 2009, 2013; Shepherd 2000), the indicators
    selected in this study are divided into three categories: (a) baseline indicators:
    surface ponding and susceptibility to wind and water erosion; (b) VSA indicators:
    presence of a cultivation pan, soil color, soil porosity, soil structure and consistency,
    and soil slaking test for soil stability; and (c) quantitative indicators: earthworm
    count indicating biodiversity, infiltration experiment and/or penetration resistance,
    pH, and labile organic carbon. Labile organic carbon method was adapted from Weil,
    Islam, Stine, Gruver, and Samson-Liebig (2003), pH was measured using water (pH
    H2O), and the infiltration experiment method was adapted from the falling head
    method and validated in the laboratory using different soil texture (see Supplemental
    Material). The above indicators were selected and used to classify the soil conditions
    in each of the 138 pairs of plots. The inclusion of four quantitative indicators
    was necessary to cover important biological, chemical, and physical alterations
    which are expected when different management practices are implemented in the
    agricultural fields. For each indicator, we provided the following information:
    (a) importance: information on the significance of the indicators for soil quality;
    (b) assessment: guidelines for the assessment of the variables in situ or in the
    lab; (c) scoring: evaluation of soil property under consideration based on scores;
    and (d) literature: additional details and illustrations (see Supplemental Material).
    A qualitative score was established for the 11 variables according to three conditions:
    good (Score 2), moderate (Score 1), and bad (Score 0), illustrated with standardized
    photos serving as references or classes of established limits and corresponding
    to associated scores. The full manual describing the VSA and the scorings is available
    as supporting information. The inventory and scoring of soil quality were conducted
    together with land users, between July and December 2016, for all paired plots.
    The paired plots methodology was used to compare the sensitivity of the 11 selected
    soil indicators and their response across different pedo-climatic regions. The
    scores of the 11 indicators assessed in plot-AMP and plot-control were compared.
    If the scores are similar in both plots, no improvement (0) is considered. If
    there is an improvement in plot-AMP, then a moderate or strong positive effect
    is considered (+1 or +2, respectively), according with score values difference
    between paired plots. Conversely, if the plot-AMP induces degradation of soil
    conditions, then a moderate or strongly negative effect is considered (−1 or −2,
    respectively). Finally, the VSA index was calculated by summing all positive and
    negative effects of each soil variable: Where, scoresoil variable corresponds
    to the value obtained by the difference between the soil conditions from plot-AMP
    and plot-control for a given soil variable under analysis, and soil variable refers
    to each one of the eleven variables analyzed. Farmers dealing with the implementation
    of the AMPs were also requested to express their opinion with regard to the meaning
    of the 11 soil quality variables used for the VSA. As so, for each pair of plots
    (AMP-control) considered in this study, farmers were requested to select the most
    important indicators to assess soil quality in their field according to their
    perception. Selected indicators by farmers were then compared with the ones showing
    positive effects to AMPs implementation. All the analyses were performed separately
    for the European and Chinese study sites due to distinct socio-cultural aspects,
    which may affect the AMPs adopted by farmers and their perception about the soil
    quality indicators. 2.3 Data analyses Cluster analysis was performed to detect
    groups of AMPs with similar effects through the calculation of Euclidian distance.
    The obtained results were depicted using dendrograms based on Sneath´s dissimilarity
    criteria, a single binding agglomeration requiring one to obtain the matrix of
    dissimilarity, from which the most similar pair of individuals is identified.
    These individuals form the initial cluster. Beginning from there, the possibility
    of inclusion of other individuals is evaluated, adopting the criteria that the
    average intracluster distance should be lower than the average intercluster distance
    (Sneath & Sokal, 1973). The clustering analysis was used to highlight the AMPs
    that cluster together, indicating significant similarities in showing effects
    on soil quality between them. The analysis was performed using Statistica software
    version 13.1. 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Soil quality indicators Results show
    that the most sensitive soil quality indicators (displaying higher VSA index)
    in Europe and China are those describing soil structure, such as soil structure
    and consistency, porosity, aggregate stability inferred by the slaking test, and
    soil color, followed by soil compaction indicated by the presence of a cultivation
    pan (Figure 2a & c). In China, however, labile organic carbon and infiltration
    are also sensitive indicators. Although labile organic carbon is much more sensitive
    to changes in soil management practices that total organic carbon (Haynes, 2005),
    in our case, labile organic carbon was unexpectedly one of the VSA indicators
    least affected by the implementation of the AMPs in Europe, probably due to the
    spatial variability of labile organic carbon and/or variation in the fertilizers
    application. Surface ponding and susceptibility to erosion in a high number of
    plots showed neutral effects probably because they are not directly linked to
    the AMP implementation in the majority of the cases. Surface ponding depends on
    soil compaction which is spatially variable. Naveed et al. (2016) reported that
    in their topsoils, stress propagation was heterogeneous and occurred through specific
    pathways as long as macropores were not deformed (cited in Guimarães, Lamandé,
    Munkholm, Ball, & Keller, 2017). In our case, biodiversity (indicated by earthworm
    number) and infiltration rate are relatively sensitive to the changes in the management
    practices, indicating existing intact macropores that can partially explain the
    neutral effect of surface ponding (Figure 2). The fact that the presence of cultivation
    pan is a less sensitive indicator than those describing soil structure can be
    explained by different factors. The persistence of subsoil compaction over decades
    (Alaoui, Rogger, Peth, & Blöschl, 2018; Kellner & Hubbart, 2016) indicated a long
    memory effect probably older than the effect of the AMP under consideration. In
    addition to land use effect, potential factors controlling this memory are land
    use, soil type, topography, and climate (Cambi, Certini, Neri, & Marchi, 2015;
    Rogger et al., 2017). The focus on soil structure examination without considering
    textural or stone effects on agronomic potential did not allow distinguishing
    compacted layers of anthropic origin from changes in in texture between different
    horizons (Ball et al., 2015). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer Results of Visual
    Soil Assessment index for each of the 11 soil quality indicators used to assess
    the effect of agricultural management practices (AMPs) on soil quality in Europe
    in 2016 (a) and 2018 (b) and in China in 2016 (c) and 2018 (d). Numbers represent
    the percentage of plots where the indicators return positive (white), negative
    (black), or no effect (green) between AMPs and control In Europe, soil porosity
    and infiltration capacity behave very similarly, and are closely linked with labile
    organic carbon (Figure 2a). However in Chinese study sites, surface ponding and
    susceptibility to erosion were the closest parameters, grouping with presence
    of the cultivation pan, biodiversity, pH, and infiltration rate (Figure 2c). The
    remaining indicators showed more independent responses to applied management practices,
    as resulted from the cluster analysis. Earthworm indicator, however, should be
    interpreted carefully since it may be affected by other parameters, such as the
    timing of field assessment, and thus its inclusion in VSA methodologies should
    be better considered for future studies. Previous studies showed that the type
    of tillage significantly affects earthworm populations. Baldivieso-Freitas et
    al. (2018) reported that plots that had been moldboard ploughed (soil inversion)
    in the year prior to their sampling presented more juveniles than adults. Variables
    describing biodiversity (earthworm counts) and the infiltration rate provide similar
    results within European plots and are in agreement with each other (Figure 2a).
    This can be explained by the fact that soil biopores, representing only 0.2–2.0%
    of the total soil volume, may account for about 74–100% of the total water flux
    (Alaoui & Helbling, 2006). These observations were not noticed in Chinese case
    studies, possibly because of the restricted number of investigated sites (26 in
    China against 112 in Europe) and the wider range of pedo-climatic zones than monitored
    in Europe. It is worth noting that some AMPs were implemented only over 3 years,
    which may be too short to provide positive effects on soil quality. Overall, the
    sensitivity of the indicators related to soil structure is confirmed in Europe
    by the outcomes of 2018 (Figure b), while in China, only porosity and soil structure
    and consistency were sensitive to the changes in AMPs, probably due to the low
    number of Chinese sites considered (Figure 2d). There was some overlap between
    the indicators selected by farmers as the most convenient to evaluate soil quality
    and the most sensitive indicators to soil quality, namely soil structure (Figure
    3). These indicators include soil porosity (reported by 61 farmers in Europe and
    25 in China), soil structure and consistency (reported by 63 farmers in Europe
    and 23 in China), and soil slaking test (reported by 47 farmers in Europe and
    23 in China). These results show that generally, both in Europe and China, farmers
    are aware of the visual soil indicators that are sensitive to the rapid changes
    in their fields. This fact highlights the link between the scientific knowledge
    with farmers’ background and empirical knowledge of their fields and attests to
    the applicability of our findings. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer Correlation
    between the number of positive effects observed for a single indicator and the
    number of farmer''s selecting this indicator as significant for soil quality evaluation
    (numbers represent the indicators given in the y-axis of Figure 2) 3.2 Effects
    of selected AMPs in Europe and China Globally, the results show that between the
    138 sets of paired plots, 104 pairs (75.4%) showed a positive effect of the AMPs
    on soil quality, 20 pairs (14.5%) did not show any difference in soil quality
    between soils under selected practices and soils in the control, and the remaining
    14 plots (10.1%) showed an inverse effect. These effects are similarly distributed
    between both continents, with positive effects of selected AMPs recorded in 73.2%
    of the European and 84.6% of the Chinese paired plots, and negative effects representing
    a minority of the plots (9.8 and 11.5%, respectively). The neutral effects of
    AMPs represent 17% of the plots in Europe and 3.8% in China. When investigating
    single AMPs implemented by farmers representing the largest number of the analyzed
    paired plots (98 out of 138), results show that no-till (10 pairs), residue maintenance
    (8 pairs), manuring and composting (9 pairs), crop rotation (10 pairs), and integrated
    pest and diseases (6 pairs) provide the highest positive effects on soil quality.
    However, when looking at Europe and China separately the majority of positive
    effects from no-till, crop rotation, and integrated pest and diseases occurred
    in European plots. In China, however, the highest positive effects were associated
    with residue maintenance, manuring and composting, and to some extent, green manure
    and/or integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation management show positive
    effects on soil quality (Figure 4a and c). Within these highlighted AMPs, both
    no-till and residue maintenance show no neutral or negative effects, whereas manuring
    and composting, crop rotation, and integrated pest and diseases also show some
    cases of neutral and/or negative effects. Negative effects on soil quality are
    also recorded in practices such as measures against compaction, leguminous crops,
    irrigation management, changes in timing of activities, and change of land use
    practices. The assessment carried out in Europe in 2018 confirmed similar trends
    in terms of proportionality (Figure 4b). In China, crop rotation, min-till, green
    manure, integrated soil fertility management, and to some extent no-till show
    positive effects on soil quality (Figure 4d). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer Number
    of study site areas where the single-used agricultural management practices (AMPs)
    affect soil quality positively (gray), negatively (black), and neutrally (green)
    in Europe in 2016 (a) and 2018 (b) and in China in 2016 (c) and 2018 (d) When
    correlating the AMPs with positive effects on soil quality with changes in SOM,
    it appears that AMP 1 (no-till) in combination with permanent crops, and AMP 3
    (permanent soil cover) in combination with no-till and organic farming positively
    affect SOM (Figure 5). The year of implementation tends to increase SOM, but a
    clear generalization cannot be made. This last observation is also valid for the
    inverse phenomena: Short periods of implementation cannot explain decreases in
    SOM (Table 2). Our findings highlight the positive effect of permanent soil cover,
    which supplements and strengthens the effects of other AMPs such as min-till or
    no-till. These tillage practices have been shown to preserve the organic matter
    in surface soil layers favoring earthworm diversity, rather than throughout the
    soil profile (Baldivieso-Freitas et al. 2018). Previous studies have shown that
    the inclusion of cover crops may provide a range of vital ecosystem services and
    benefits. Permanent soil cover may reduce nutrient losses during winter (Gómez,
    Guzmán, Giráldez, & Fereres, 2009; Munkholm & Hansen, 2012), improve soil quality
    and C sequestration (Luo, Wang, & Sun, 2010; Mutegi, Petersen, & Munkholm, 2013;
    Weil & Kremen, 2007), and alleviate problems with soil compaction, thereby reducing
    the need for intensive tillage (Abdollahi & Munkholm, 2014; Chen & Weil, 2010).
    The above considerations show the potential benefit of using combinations of different
    AMPs such as cover crop treatments and no-till or min-till to enhance their positive
    effects. In comparison, the potential contribution of the single no-till treatment
    to the sustainable intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed
    (Pittelkow et al., 2014). FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer Correlation between changes

    When considering the Sneath criterion 66%, the results of cluster analysis showed
    that some of the AMPs clustered together in Europe and China, indicating significant
    similarities in the effects on soil quality between them and thus, either AMP
    of this group can be used to improve soil quality (Figure 6). Considering the
    more restrictive Sneath criterion (33%), only two groups of AMPs were observed,
    and the rest of the other AMPs are distinguished as separate clusters, for both
    locations in Europe and China. In Europe, the investigated AMPs are displayed
    in two separate clusters: the first cluster comprises crop rotation, mulching
    and min-till, with rather positive or neutral effects on soil quality, and a second
    cluster including measures against compaction, irrigation management, change of
    land use practices, and manuring and composting, with negative effects. However
    in Chinese SSAs, although two separate clusters were observed for tested AMPs,
    there were no trends in the direction of soil quality effects among the two groups
    of practices. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer Cluster analysis of the agricultural
    management practices AMPs showing similarities in the effect on soil quality in
    Europe and China When comparing the effects of one single AMP with the effects
    of their combinations, the results show that in Europe, the positive effects are
    higher when two or three AMPs are practiced together (83 and 80%, respectively),
    followed by the single application (73%). In fact, the percentage of positive
    effects increases from the single use to two combinations, while the combinations
    of three AMPs resulted in fewer positive effects but also fewer negative effects
    in detriment of more neutral effects. In China, combinations of two and three
    AMPs also resulted in more positive effects than the single application, although
    the number of paired plots analyzed is substantially lower (data not presented
    here). The combination of two or three AMPs with higher positive effects on soil
    quality often included crop rotation, minimum tillage, and manuring and composting.
    This suggests that these AMPs have a complementary function and that their overall
    benefits are increased by their mutual application. Crop rotation affects the
    nutrient balance (Bullock, 1992, Martin-Rueda et al., 2017) by covering soil with
    organic matter which increases soil fertility (Altieri & Nicholls, 2003, Wiesmeier
    et al. 2017), whereas nondisturbance avoids soil breakdown and CO2 emissions (Wander
    & Bidart, 2000). By acting on different management aspects, such as soil and nutrient
    management strategies, the combination of these AMPs can provide synergetic effects
    on soil quality (Barão et al., 2019). Therefore, we hypothesize that a good combination
    should include AMPs from different management classes such as soil, water, nutrient,
    and pest and crop management, each one acting on a different level and without
    overlapping, as suggested by Barão et al. (2019), who investigated the same SSA.
    The better effect of AMP combinations was also previously reported, particularly
    in conservation agriculture where crop rotation is practiced together with no-till
    or minimum tillage and residue maintenance (Giller et al., 2015). The relatively
    low number of plots using three or more AMPs (12% of all study sites) does not
    allow a clear understanding of the effect on soil quality, given the small difference
    between SSA with positive, neutral, and negative effects. Nevertheless, the combination
    of four or more AMPs doesn''t seem to result in increasing soil quality when assessing
    it with the VSA method used in this study. These findings open new avenues in
    land management strategies for helping practitioners, advisers, and policymakers
    to improve soil quality and the sustainability of farming systems. 3.3 Effect
    of AMPs in different soil types Considering the AMPs that had a positive effect
    on soil quality in more than 10 instances across all study sites, we observe that
    these AMPs are mostly implemented on Podzols (positive effects observed in 100%
    of cases), Calcisols (91%), Regosols (84.6%), Antrosols (71.4%), Luvisols (70.6%),
    Cambisols (62.5%), and Fluvisols (58%). However, Cambisols, Fluvisols, and Luvisols
    are also linked to negative effects (37.5, 42, and 29.4% respectively; Figure
    7). FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer Distribution of soil types where the agricultural
    management practices have potential to improve soil quality in Europe and China,
    based on visual soil analysis methodology. The values in the legend correspond
    to the percentage of the cases where a positive effect was seen in the study sites
    with similar soil type The effect of AMPs could have been affected by pedoclimatic
    variations. The use of selected AMP in plots located in Podzols and Calcisols
    revealed a positive VSAindex for all cases, whereas the use of the same AMP in
    Fluvisols was advantageous in 50–60% of the cases (Figure 8). However, this can
    be associated with the inherent soil properties of distinct soils and their intrinsic
    soil quality. For instance, Podzols are normally acidic soils with low levels
    of organic matter and where agricultural activities are difficult (Jordanova et
    al., 2017), so the adoption of AMPs will always represent an improvement for soil
    quality. In Calcisols, which are common in semi-arid regions and associated with
    calcareous parent material and stoniness, crop productivity is limited without
    proper soil management practices. On the contrary, Fluvisols and Luvisols are
    very fertile soils, typically with high levels of clay and organic matter. On
    these types of soils, improvements on soil quality assessed with VSA method are
    limited, unless the soil is already intensively explored and has become degraded.
    Similar AMPs also revealed some contrasting effects on soil quality based on long-term
    experiments (≥5 yr; Bai et al., 2018). FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer Positive,
    negative, and neutral effects of different agricultural management practices,
    taking into account the soil type; white color indicates positive effect, gray
    color indicates no effect, and black color indicates negative effect on soil quality.
    Agricultural areas with naturally lower soil quality (i.e., Podzols and Calcisols)
    greatly benefit from AMPs (Figure 8). These AMPs might be quite different, ranging
    from strategies to avoid disturbance, such as no-till operations, to fertility
    strategies such as the integration of manure and the inclusion of leguminous crops,
    to crop rotations, or even irrigation management strategies, since all of them
    have positive effects on such soils. On high fertile soils however, the strategy
    to manage agriculture soils should be different, since the same AMPs resulted
    in different outcomes when applied in plots located in Luvisols or Fluvisols.
    For example, leguminous crops, crop rotation, or no-till resulted in high VSAindex
    in Portuguese and Romanian SSAs, whereas the effect in Slovenian plots was negative
    (data not shown). In some plots, the application of selected AMPs resulted in
    neutral effects that might indicate that some management practices would require
    a longer time of implementation to have a positive effect. Management strategies
    designed for these areas should focus on site-specific threats and climatic variability
    to ensure that new solutions effectively contribute to improving soil quality
    or that more time is required for noticing the positive effects. When considering
    only the AMPs that positively affect soil quality (excluding neutral and no effect)
    of a given soil type, extrapolating results of Table 3 using spatial distribution
    of soil types (Tóth et al.,2013) show two distinct areas where different agricultural
    approaches should be applied (Figure 8). Low fertile soils such as Podzols and
    Calcisols are mainly located southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, northern area
    of Germany, and in the Netherlands, Denmark, and other Scandinavian countries
    where any implementation of AMPs should be encouraged to improve the overall low
    soil quality of the agricultural fields. However, in Central Europe where more
    fertile soils are present, such as the United Kingdom and the Balkans, the agricultural
    management strategies should be site-specific. These results do not include the
    effect of cropping systems (i.e., crop rotation) which may be additional key pieces
    to improve the quality and fertility of soils. Further investigations are needed
    to refine our findings by investigating additional regions to include all pedoclimatic
    zones and by considering land use in the upscaling exercise. TABLE 3. Agricultural

    soil quality, the ones describing soil structure (porosity, structure and consistency,
    aggregate stability) were revealed to be the most responsive to improved management
    practices both in Europe and China. The indicators selected by farmers for the
    assessment of soil quality are also related to soil structure and confirm the
    consistency of researchers’ choice either in Europe or China. Between the European
    plots, soil porosity, infiltration rate, and labile organic carbon presented similar
    behavior in response to AMPs investigated. In China, however, the most sensitive
    cluster of parameters included infiltration rate, pH, biodiversity, presence of
    the cultivation pan, surface ponding, and susceptibility to erosion. The VSA was
    applied in 138 paired plots where different AMPs (single or in combination) in
    use by local farmers are compared with control agriculture practices. Among the
    138 sets of paired plots, 75.4% show a positive effect of AMPs on soil quality,
    14.5% do not show any difference in soil quality between soils under the practices
    and soils in the control plots, and the remaining 10.1% show negative effects
    on soil quality. The AMPs providing higher VSAindex were no-till, manuring and
    composting, crop rotation, and residue maintenance and mulching. Cluster analyses
    showed similarities in the effect on soil quality between crop rotation, residue
    maintenance and mulching, and min-till, and therefore, either AMP from this group
    can be used to improve soil quality. Nevertheless, plots using combinations of
    two or three AMPs showed greater positive effects on soil quality than single
    applications of AMPs. More specifically, AMP–SOM relationships show the potential
    benefit of using combinations of cover crop treatments and no-till or min-till
    to preserve or even enhance the organic matter in surface soil layers. The effects
    of APMs were more noticed when plots were implemented in naturally less fertile
    soils, such as Podzols and Calcisols. In these soils, AMPs presented higher percentage
    of positive effects (90–100%), whereas in other soils with intrinsic high fertility,
    such as Luvisols and Fluvisols, the positive effects of AMPs were lower (50–60%).
    This shows that site-specific decisions should be considered for efficient implementation
    of the management strategies. The outcomes of our study should be considered to
    establish such strategies. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS iSQAPER is funded by the European Union''s

    10.1111/j.1752-1688.2012.00665.x Abstract: The water of the Colorado River of
    the southwestern United States (U.S.) is presently used beyond its reliable supply,
    and the flow of this river is forecast to decrease significantly due to climate
    change. A recent interim report of the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand
    Study is the first acknowledgment of these facts by U.S. federal water managers.
    In light of this new stance, we evaluate the current policy of adaptation to water
    shortages in the Colorado River Basin. We find that initial shortages will be
    borne only by the cities of Arizona and Nevada and farms in Arizona whereas the
    other Basin states have no incentive to reduce consumptive use. Furthermore, the
    development of a long-term plan is deferred until greater water scarcity exists.
    As a potential response to long-term water scarcity, we evaluate the viability
    of an interstate water market in the Colorado River Basin. We inform our analysis
    with newly available data from the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia, which has
    used interstate water trading to create vital flexibility during extreme aridity
    during recent years. We find that, despite substantial obstacles, an interstate
    water market is a compelling reform that could be used not only to adapt to increased
    water scarcity but also to preserve core elements of Colorado River Basin law.
    Introduction The Colorado River and its tributaries originate in the Rocky Mountains
    and provide much of the water that has allowed the economic, cultural, and political
    development of the arid southwestern United States (U.S.) (Powell, 2008). The
    water of these rivers is used by 30 million people and 4 million acres of farmland
    as the primary supply to several cities and $3 billion in agricultural productivity
    across seven states (USBR, 2011). Spring runoff from winter snow is vital to maintaining
    a reserve of water stored primarily in two large mainstem reservoirs, Lake Mead
    and Lake Powell. However, runoff in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) has been markedly
    below its long-term average in several years since 2000; plentiful runoff occurred
    only in 2005, 2008, and 2011. During this time, deliveries to water users continued
    undiminished, and so reservoirs reached record-low levels before rebounding somewhat
    (USBR, 2010). Continued low runoff coupled with steadily rising demand are forecast
    to exhaust reservoir storage in the coming decades (USBR, 2007; Barnett and Pierce,
    2008; (Rajagopalan et al., 2009). Such a failure of the water supply system would
    lead to major economic and social disruption in the Southwest (Barnett and Pierce,
    2008). The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) manages the dams of the Colorado
    River and its major tributaries and thus acts as the initial supplier of water
    to irrigation districts and municipal water supply agencies. In early 2011, it
    released the first interim report of its Colorado River Basin Water Supply and
    Demand Study. The purposes of this report are to quantify the reliability of the
    Colorado River to meet the needs of those who depend on it until 2060 and to formulate
    options for mitigating imbalances in the water supply system. The first interim
    report contains the concepts governing the study and quantitative forecasts for
    supply and demand in the CRB. The final report, which is scheduled for release
    in mid-2012, will include options for reform in the CRB (USBR, 2011). The USBR
    adopts two important premises for the first time in this report. First, current
    demand in the CRB exceeds supply. The steadily growing annual demand first exceeded
    the 10-year running average of annual supply in 2003. Annual water deficits probably
    occurred earlier; for example, total water use across the Basin was 16.0 million
    acre-feet (maf; 1 maf = 1,233 gigaliters (GL); 16 maf = 19,700 GL) in 1999, whereas
    the long-term average flow in the mainstem of the Lower Colorado River (below
    the confluences of all major tributaries) is ∼14.7 maf/yr (18,100 GL/yr) (USBR,
    2011). Second, the USBR considers climate change explicitly for the first time
    in this report after having intentionally neglected its effects during previous
    planning documents that pertain to the CRB (e.g., USBR, 2007). The Water Supply
    and Demand Study states that climate change will lead to a “new mean state” of
    lower runoff in the CRB (USBR, 2011). Thus, the general management approach of
    the USBR now conforms much more closely to previous research implying a near-term
    transition to increased dryness in the Southwest (Seager et al., 2007). Australia
    has adapted to similar water scarcity by introducing an interstate water trading
    market in its Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), and thus its experiences may provide
    useful lessons to the CRB. Water markets allow water transfers at prices that
    respond to seasonal changes in demand and water availability (Howe et al., 1986).
    Water rights are generally traded on either a temporary or a permanent basis,
    and, if desired, prices can be reset yearly at initial values before trading begins
    anew (Chong and Sunding, 2006). An optimally efficient water market is one in
    which trading of water rights allows each user to get as much water as it is willing
    to buy and for each user to pay for the true value of the water it receives (Freebairn,
    2003). However, over- or underregulation, which frequently occurs when diverse
    political concerns must be placated at the inception of a market (Colby, 2000),
    impedes efficiency (Colby, 1990). Water markets depend on a diversity of water
    users. When all users plant the same crop, they all tend to be either buyers or
    sellers at a given price, and no trades occur (Nieuwoudt and Armitage, 2004).
    Thus, markets that cover large geographic areas may be likely to thrive because
    of a diversity of water uses. Water markets incur costs that relate to both the
    regulation and execution of transactions and the mollification of potential impacts
    on parties external to a water sale (Chong and Sunding, 2006). In light of the
    new attitudes put forth by the USBR in the Water Supply and Demand Study, this
    article analyzes the existing policy for low levels in the mainstem reservoirs
    of the CRB. This policy, articulated as the “preferred alternative” in the 2007
    Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and Coordinated Operations
    of Lake Powell and Lake Mead: Final Environmental Impact Statement (henceforth,
    “the Shortage Guidelines”), represents the result of negotiation between the seven
    states of the CRB and subsequent minor modification by the USBR (NRC, 2007; USBR,
    2007). It is the only enforceable document that targets management of the Colorado
    River during times of low water (USBR, 2007). We find that the Shortage Guidelines
    are a stopgap solution. They introduce supply shortages by decreasing the volume
    of water that can be diverted from Lake Mead. This slows the depletion of Lake
    Mead before 2026 and does little to protect water users during prolonged periods
    of scarce water. They do little to address demand, providing incentives for conservation
    only to some parties. Finding the Shortage Guidelines lacking, our second purpose
    in this article is to draw from recent experience in Australia to evaluate the
    viability of an interstate water market as a possible reform for the CRB. Response
    to Drought in the Colorado River Basin The Shortage Guidelines exist in the context
    of the legal framework that governs water use in the CRB. Briefly, the seven states
    of the CRB are divided into an “Upper Basin” (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming)
    and a “Lower Basin” (Arizona, California, Nevada) (Figure 1). The Lower Basin
    is guaranteed 7.5 maf/yr (9,250 GL/yr) from the Upper Basin, and, based on their
    understanding of CRB runoff, the framers of the original Colorado River Compact
    believed that this would leave the same amount for yearly use in the Upper Basin.
    Guaranteed a volume of water each year, the Lower Basin divided it among its states
    such that Arizona receives 2.8 maf/yr (3,500 GL/yr), California receives 4.4 maf/yr
    (5,400 GL/yr), and Nevada receives 0.3 maf/yr (370 GL/yr). A subsequent treaty
    and policy statement obligates each Basin to provide 0.75 maf/yr (930 GL/yr) to
    Mexico, but Lower Basin division of water has not changed to reflect this. In
    each CRB state, rights to the consumptive use of water are granted to entities
    and organizations such as irrigation districts, municipalities, corporations,
    landowners, and Native American tribes. These rights are honored in the order
    of their creation, with “junior” rights holders potentially losing their entire
    yearly share of water to ensure that rights of more “senior” users are fulfilled.
    This system of “prior appropriation” was preserved in the federal Colorado River
    Compact: the USBR fulfills water rights of Lower Basin users in the order in which
    they were created. Further details of CRB law are described well in a review by
    MacDonnell (2009). Water appropriations are at or near their maximum in each Lower
    Basin state despite an estimated loss of 1.6-2.2 maf/yr (2,000-2,700 GL/yr) to
    evaporation from reservoirs, half of which can be attributed to each Basin (USBR,
    2011). Thus, the Lower Basin suffers from a water imbalance that has been ameliorated
    by surpluses from the Upper Basin and storage in Lake Mead, the latter of which
    decreases when low runoff to Lake Powell induces minimum obligatory releases from
    Glen Canyon Dam. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The Colorado River

    International Mapping Associates, used with permission. The CRB has never experienced
    a shortage, and the three Lower Basin states have never received volumes below
    those promised for their consumptive use (see above). Federal law designates the
    USBR as the primary agency responsible for response to drought planning (NRC,
    2007), and so the Shortage Guidelines were developed after years of below-average
    runoff in the CRB (USBR, 2007). The Shortage Guidelines provide revised management
    plans that decrease water deliveries from Lake Mead to when it is at low levels.
    As the water level in Lake Mead drops, the USBR will reduce withdrawals, augment
    supply, and encourage conservation. This is achieved through four specific approaches.
    First, water available for consumptive use in the Lower Basin will be reduced
    by 0.333, 0.417, and 0.5 maf/yr (411, 514, and 617 GL/yr, respectively) when the
    water level in Lake Mead falls to 1,075, 1,050, and 1,025 ft above sea level,
    respectively. At this lowest elevation, meetings between states will be convened
    with the purpose of writing additional guidelines. Second, water storage will
    be balanced between Lake Mead and Lake Powell during low reservoir levels. This
    provision has the practical effect of allowing increased deliveries from Lake
    Powell to Lake Mead. Third, a system of “intentionally created surplus” was created
    as a way of crediting water to Arizona, California, or Nevada when these states
    conserve water to leave it in Lake Mead. Fourth, previously negotiated guidelines
    that apply to times of surplus were suspended. A variety of management options
    were considered in the Shortage Guidelines. Strategies ranged from declaring shortage
    earlier so that reservoir storage can be maximized to declaring no shortages until
    reservoirs are empty. The “preferred alternative” represents an effort to maintain
    water deliveries with minimal disruption while also protecting the drinking water
    supply of Las Vegas. In comparison with other management strategies, it is predicted
    to delay the probability of shortage declarations for Lower Basin states in the
    near term (before 2016) while having no significant impact on longer time scales
    (2030-2065) (Figure 2). If continued shortages are necessary in the medium term
    (2020-2026), the “preferred alternative” stipulates that they be more severe than
    other alternatives (with the exception of the strategy that maximizes reservoir
    storage) to extend the time that Lake Mead is >1,000 ft above sea level, the elevation
    at which submerged intake pipes withdraw water for Las Vegas (USBR, 2007). Furthermore,
    the Shortage Guidelines represent an agreement in effect until 2026, and the “preferred
    alternative” features an abrupt increase in the probability of a shortage declaration
    between 2026 and 2027. It is important to note that these forecasts are based
    on water availability in 2007. Although the specific dates of these time horizons
    would be different if the calculation were redone for current reservoir levels
    and water consumption patterns, the qualitative trends described here would not
    likely change significantly. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Probability
    of Shortage in the Lower Basin Under Various Management Scenarios. Black line:

    Gray lines: other alternatives considered. From USBR (2007). Shortages in this
    plan would not affect the three Lower Basin states equally. The Central Arizona
    Project (CAP), a large municipal and agricultural irrigation system that supplies
    water to both farms and major cities in Arizona, was built on the condition that
    Arizona’s water rights be subrogated to those of California. Consequently, after
    fulfillment of water rights established before June 25, 1929 to users in the three
    Lower Basin states, all of California’s water rights must be met before any further
    water is delivered to Arizona (MacDonnell, 2009). Only 22.1% of the water rights
    in Arizona predate 1929, and these are mostly irrigators, small cities along the
    Colorado River, and Native American reservations (USBR, 2007). Thus, California
    will suffer reductions only during extreme shortages, whereas only a small subset
    of the population of Arizona is insulated from shortage. Nevada’s share of overall
    Lower Basin deliveries will remain constant, and thus it will suffer shortages
    at the first shortage declaration (Table 1). Table 1. Effects of Water Shortages
    on Lower Basin States. Shortage volumes and water deliveries (af/yr) Shortage

    0 11.4 14.3 17.1 Nevada 0 4.4 5.6 6.7 Note: All values from USBR (2007). This
    agreement, which was codified in the 1968 Colorado River Basin Project Act (CRBPA),
    represented a compromise that brought expensive water infrastructure to Arizona
    and greater water security to California. However, it may make the Shortage Guidelines
    impractical and unmanageable because, consistent with a steady growth in urban
    water use across the CRB in the last several decades (NRC, 2007), water rights
    created in Arizona and Nevada after 1968 have largely been granted to municipal
    and industrial users. Consequently, the large population centers in greater Phoenix,
    Tucson, and Las Vegas rely on some of the most junior water rights in their states
    (granted to the CAP and the Southern Nevada Water Authority [SNWA], respectively).
    Thus, they will be the first to be affected by water shortages. After Arizona
    cancels deliveries of 16,223 acre-feet per year (af/yr) (20 GL/yr) to some small
    municipalities and farms (by itself a not insignificant action), its most junior
    water user is the CAP, which has rights to 1.7 maf/yr (2,100 GL/yr). In 2008,
    municipalities used ∼750,000 af (925 GL) of Arizona’s yearly Colorado River water
    (USBR, 2011). The CAP provides the vast majority of this, and thus municipalities
    are at risk during a shortage. The SNWA, the most junior user in Nevada, has rights
    to nearly the entire allotment of Nevada and distributes it to the ∼2 million
    residents of the Las Vegas Valley (USBR, 2007). Both Arizona and Nevada have plans
    to replace water lost to curtailed deliveries from Lake Mead with other in-state
    sources. Arizona stores unused water in a groundwater bank. When that empties,
    it can protect its population by reducing CAP water deliveries to irrigators,
    essentially trading water security for economic security by supporting basic human
    needs at the expense of agricultural productivity. Nevada has been aggressively
    encouraging conservation by storing unused water in groundwater banks, which will
    yield 30,000 af/yr (37 GL) from separate banks in California and Arizona (SNWA,
    2009) for as long as they last. Additionally, the SNWA has purchased 1.2 maf (1,480
    GL) for $350 million from Arizona in a unique water transfer (Tavares, 2009).
    It has also designed a >500-km long, $3 billion pipeline to bring pumped groundwater
    from the center of the state. If approved and built, it is forecast to yield a
    maximum of 137,000 af/yr (169 GL/yr) (SNWA, 2009); the long-term sustainability
    of this yield is beyond the scope of this article. Thus, on a strictly volumetric
    basis, Nevada would seem able to withstand extended Colorado River shortages only
    on the condition that this politically contentious and expensive pipeline is built.
    The potential shortages for which Arizona and Nevada must prepare contrast starkly
    with the uninterrupted water supplies to the other CRB states. The water supplies
    of the two Basins are separated legally, and, in 2008, no Upper Basin state consumed
    close to its maximum allotment (MacDonnell, 2009; USBR, 2011). Certainly, a sustained
    Basin-wide drought could require reductions in consumptive use in Upper Basin
    states for the Upper Basin to meet its required deliveries to the Lower Basin,
    but this scenario is not nearly as likely as the continued decline of Lake Mead
    due to overallocation of Lower Basin water, although this was interrupted by a
    significant rise in 2011 that resulted from extra releases from Lake Powell after
    bountiful inflows there. In California, senior water rights (2.7 maf/yr [3,300
    GL/yr] were created before 1929) and the CRBPA ensure that it will not suffer
    shortages during conditions stipulated by the Shortage Guidelines. Consequently,
    whereas Arizona and Nevada have ample reason to conserve water, take advantage
    of the intentionally created surplus feature of the Shortage Guidelines, and maintain
    water levels in Lake Mead, the other five CRB states have no such motivation.
    If shortages continued for many years, Arizona and Nevada could face extremely
    difficult choices that may involve reductions in population or economic activity,
    whereas agricultural irrigation in the California desert and development of new
    water projects in the Upper Basin could continue unabated. This inequality, although
    consistent with existing laws, seems sufficiently glaring to spark political outcry
    by the governors and federal representatives of Arizona and Nevada. If Lake Mead
    falls to 1,025 ft above sea level, the Shortage Guidelines offer no plan other
    than a meeting of the seven CRB states. Such a meeting is sure to feature insistence
    by Arizona and Nevada that the other CRB states share in the suffering created
    by low reservoir levels, despite their worsening bargaining position and existing
    legal protections for the other states. Because the Shortage Guidelines contain
    no long-term plan for Basin-wide adaptation to aridity, they present a threat
    to the legal framework of the Colorado River by potentially creating a scenario
    in which an increasingly desperate Arizona and Nevada may use every means at their
    disposal to force hasty changes to Colorado River law. Moreover, the Shortage
    Guidelines are designed to react to shortages forecast up to 2026, and this seems
    short-sighted given their assertion that shortages become significantly more probable
    immediately thereafter under the enacted “preferred alternative.” A significant
    additional shortcoming of the Shortage Guidelines is their approach to reduced
    Colorado River flow as an ephemeral problem. The document was written as a response
    to drought (USBR, 2007), although its planning considers neither the possibility
    of a multidecade drought in the CRB, which is not without precedent (Meko and
    Woodhouse, 2005), nor evidence that severe multiyear droughts have occurred multiple
    times during the last 500 years (Woodhouse et al., 2006). Moreover, as the Water
    Supply and Demand Study acknowledges, low river flows may be due to a long-term
    shift to increased aridity in the CRB, not temporary drought. Climate change is
    likely to lead to significant reductions in long-term average runoff in the CRB
    (NRC, 2007; Seager et al., 2007; Barnett and Pierce, 2008; Cooley et al., 2009),
    which is very sensitive to small increases in mean annual air temperature (McCabe
    and Wolock, 2007). After extensive consideration within the Shortage Guidelines,
    the USBR chose to neglect the effects of climate change in its runoff forecasts
    because global climate models at the time of publication could not provide sufficiently
    specific information about individual river basins. Although the USBR cited multiple
    studies that pointed to notable long-term changes in surface runoff in the western
    U.S. and thus knew that accepting the premise of no effect due to climate change
    would be flawed, the Shortage Guidelines were based only on the measured record
    of Colorado River flows (USBR, 2007). Thus, their forecasts probably overestimate
    future water supply and underestimate the need for long-term adaptation to decreased
    river flows. The Shortage Guidelines state that errors due to neglect of the effect
    of climate change are acceptable because that document plans only to 2026 and
    thus requires an update relatively soon (USBR, 2007). The lack of a plan for Lake
    Mead elevations below 1,025 ft above sea level is a particularly glaring example
    of this optimistic, short-term approach. However, a pessimistic, long-term fate
    may await the Lower Basin: when flow reductions due to climate change were taken
    into account, a Monte-Carlo simulation indicated a 50% probability of total reservoir
    storage depletion as early as 2021, relative to 2007 conditions (Barnett and Pierce,
    2008). This undercuts substantially the claim that there is sufficient time to
    plan by using projections that neglect climate change and then revise nearer to
    2026. The reforms stipulated in the Shortage Guidelines are likely inadequate
    even if the premise of no effect due to climate change is correct. If the several
    forecasts of lower runoff due to climate change are correct, the Shortage Guidelines
    are even weaker. There appears to be a strong possibility that they will only
    delay an inevitable and painful confrontation between competing interests of the
    CRB. Australian Implementation of an Interstate Water Market Whereas the Shortage
    Guidelines have focused on progressive reductions in supply as a means of conserving
    water in Lake Mead, the MDB has instituted water reforms in the last decade that
    have moved existing water supplies to meet demands most efficiently. These reforms,
    which center on the creation of an interstate water market, have created the flexibility
    that has allowed both municipalities and a variety of irrigators to manage significant
    reductions in total supply that have prevented the failure of the MDB water supply.
    If prolonged aridity in the CRB leads to increasingly strict reductions in supply,
    important new information emerging from Australia’s experience with water management
    reform in the last two decades may provide an effective example for future reform
    in the CRB. The MDB covers 10.6 million km2 and is drained by Australia’s two
    longest rivers, the Darling (2,740 km long) and the Murray (2,530 km long), and
    their tributaries. Like the CRB, agricultural irrigation is the primary consumptive
    use of water; the MDB contains 65% of the irrigated land in Australia. Average
    runoff is 17.2 maf/yr (21,200 GL/yr), and several large reservoirs have a total
    storage capacity of just under 28.3 maf (34,900 GL) in preparation for recurring
    periods of aridity (MDBA, 2008; CSIRO, 2008). Climate change is likely to reduce
    long-term average runoff in the MDB. Such effects may have already started: flows
    in the Murray River reached historic lows during a long dry period from 1995 to
    2009 (Pittock and Connell, 2010). The two upstream riparian states of the Murray
    River, New South Wales and Victoria, share its yearly flow equally (i.e., the
    volume of water available to each state varies annually) after guaranteeing a
    fixed volume to South Australia, which lies downstream. During low river flow,
    the volume delivered to South Australia was reduced to bring it in line with its
    historical percentage of overall flows. After the yearly share to each state is
    announced, states declare the percentages of permanent water rights that will
    be delivered to each user. These “seasonal allocations,” which are volumes of
    water delivered to users per month or year, are based on volumes stored in reservoirs.
    If necessary, they are small fractions of the volumes declared in permanent water
    rights, which are known as “entitlements.” Thus, yearly consumptive use is tuned
    to the available water of that year (Crase et al., 2004; Turral et al., 2005).
    Entitlements and seasonal allocations are traded in a regulated interstate water
    market that was created in 1989. Trading was insignificant until consumptive use
    of MDB water was capped in 1996 in response to drought conditions and increasing
    demand (Connell and Grafton, 2011). Then, yearly trading increased to <1% of entitlements
    and ∼10% of allocations (Crase et al., 2004). Intense aridity from 2005 to 2009
    sharply curtailed allocations and spurred interstate water trading, which represented
    19.9% of all water trading in Australia in 2008-2009 (Australian National Water
    Commission, 2010). Patterns have since developed in the interstate market (Figure
    3). In times of shortage, irrigators of opportunistic crops (e.g., rice, cotton)
    in New South Wales, particularly the Murrumbidgee River Basin, sold water to horticulturalists,
    viticulturalists, and dairy farmers in South Australia and Victoria, who require
    yearly supplies of water to prevent the death of plants and cows (Crase et al.,
    2004; Australian National Water Commission, 2009). The largest buyer of water
    was South Australia, which acted on behalf of Adelaide (Australian National Water
    Commission, 2009). When extremely wet conditions came in 2010-2011, all allocations
    across the MDB were ≥100% of entitlements. Irrigators had surplus water for their
    crops, and so large volumes of water were sold at low prices to regions that could
    store water for future years (Australian National Water Commission, 2011). Figure

    Buyers and sellers are abbreviated as follows: NSW Murray = the mainstem of the

    Goul. = Goulburn River subbasin, Victoria; SA = South Australia. Sizes of circles
    represent volumes transferred, in megaliters. Adapted from the Australian National
    Water Commission (2009, 2011). During recent dry years, these reforms appear to
    have provided essential flexibility to both sellers and buyers. The sales from
    New South Wales to irrigators in other states led to incomes in regions that did
    not have adequate water to raise their water-intensive crops, probably preventing
    recession (Pittock and Connell, 2010). In South Australia, the Murray River usually
    supplies ∼40% of the municipal supplies for 1.525 million people (Adelaide, South
    Australia, is easily the largest city depending on the MDB system), with the remainder
    coming from small surface water sources, groundwater, and a desalination plant
    (SA Water, 2011). However, monthly allocations during the extremely dry 2008-2009
    growing season ranged from 2 to 18% in South Australia, and so the state relied
    on the Murray River for 86% of its municipal water supply that year. Interstate
    water trading allowed the state to purchase 187,000 af (231 GL) for municipal
    uses (Australian National Water Commission, 2009); this accounted for nearly all
    of the municipal water delivered that year, which was 175,000 af (216 GL); (SA
    Water, 2009). Thus, interstate water trading was essential in preventing a municipal
    water supply emergency because the necessary volume of water did not exist within
    South Australia during 2008-2009. Conversely, the net volume of water purchased
    by South Australia in 2010-2011 was just 2% of that purchased in 2008-2009 and
    it was the largest gross seller in the MDB. In a wet year, interstate water trading
    allowed South Australia and other saturated regions to gain an economic benefit
    from surplus water. In addition to responding to yearly variations in flow, Australia
    has used interstate water trading to accommodate two environmental protection
    measures: a cap on total water diversions from the MDB (Pittock and Connell, 2010)
    and a federal water purchasing program designed to leave additional water in the
    river (Connell and Grafton, 2011). Water supply and water trading in the MDB are
    administered by multiple federal agencies such as the Murray Darling Basin Authority
    (MDBA), which is charged with the development of a Basin Plan to set long-term
    withdrawal limits for surface and groundwater, and the Australian Competition
    and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which monitors water trading and enforces market
    regulations (ACCC, 2011). Historically, Australian states operated with near-total
    independence with regard to their water resources, although they consulted with
    each other via the Council on Australian Governments (COAG) to form similar regional
    water management plans. However, Australian water reform has concentrated increasing
    power at the federal level, with the 2007 Water Act granting substantial interstate
    power to the newly formed MDBA and the ACCC in order to manage an increasingly
    limited resource amidst acrimony between states (Connell and Grafton, 2011). This
    was the outgrowth of successive basin-wide commissions formed by a coalition of
    states, yet its inception at the federal level has presented a challenge in that
    it brought long-standing tensions between states and the federal government into
    water management (Connell and Grafton, 2011). Concentration of power in a central,
    basin-wide authority is consistent with theoretical work that describes ideal
    water markets (Matthews, 2004). It is important to acknowledge that the efficiency
    of water allocation in Australia has been impeded by noneconomic barriers to trading
    water between sectors of its economy. In addition to potential externalities that
    pertain to all water markets (Chong and Sunding, 2006), Australian culture includes
    a strong predisposition toward agricultural life, as a countryside of small farms
    was part of governmental plans to both settle the Australian interior during colonial
    times and to repatriate soldiers after the large wars of the 20th Century. This
    led to the development of Australia’s water market only after drought persisted
    for several years and the inclusion of impediments to transfer of water away from
    agriculture in market rules (Crase et al., 2007). Additionally, state endorsement
    of water transfers from farms to cities counteracts a tradition of state sponsorship
    of irrigation infrastructure that is meant to offset precipitation variability,
    and so Australian state governments have tended to respond to drought first with
    new infrastructure projects, not with policy reforms (Crase et al., 2007). An
    Interstate Water Market in the Colorado River Basin Probable Features Water trading
    is not unprecedented in the western U.S. Intrastate water markets are common,
    although they vary in their implementation. An early water market began in the
    Central Valley of California, which does not use Colorado River water, in 1992.
    Created in response to drought, it led to the sale of water from farmers to cities,
    with large profits made by the former (Loomis, 1994). In Arizona, only permanent
    yearly water rights established before 1919 can be traded, and transactions require
    a 420-day waiting period. In New Mexico, water rights must predate 1907 to be
    sold, and transactions can require up to 1.5 years. In the Northern Colorado Water
    Conservancy District, standardized water rights, small transaction fees, and short
    processing times have led to a vigorous water market in which sellers are nearly
    always irrigators who usually sell to municipalities (Brookshire et al., 2004;
    Brewer et al., 2007; Donohew, 2009). Across the western U.S., the number of transactions
    has been increasing over time due to increasing sales of permanent water rights
    (Brewer et al., 2007), although sales of seasonal water deliveries have historically
    been much greater (Brown, 2006). Prices paid by agricultural users tend to be
    significantly lower than prices paid by urban users due to differing levels of
    utility for a unit volume of water. Both agricultural and urban prices have been
    steadily climbing over the last decade (Brown, 2006; Brewer et al., 2007; Donohew,
    2009). The stable operation of water markets at the state level suggests that
    an interstate water market could be a viable option for the CRB. To date, isolated
    interstate agreements have been limited in scope and have transferred unused Arizona
    water to cities of southern Nevada or farms of southern California (U.S. Bureau
    of Reclamation et al., 2002; MacDonnell, 2009). Given that both Arizona and Nevada
    have limited in-state water resources, intrastate water markets do not provide
    sufficient water security in these states. Furthermore, water is only used for
    municipal and industrial uses in Nevada, so an intrastate market would be useless
    due to a lack of diversity of users (Nieuwoudt and Armitage, 2004; USBR, 2011).
    Conversely, an interstate market would give these arid states access to agricultural
    trading partners with different crops, planting patterns, and water needs. The
    CRB is large enough to contain a wide diversity of users, and the infrastructure
    exists to allow the physical transfer of water between most potential trading
    partners. The large sums of money offered by Nevada for additional sources of
    water indicate a clear willingness to pay, and California agriculture and unused
    Upper Basin water may be more practical sources than unused Arizona water or groundwater
    from central Nevada. In addition to a decrease in the long-term average runoff,
    interannual variability of runoff is likely to increase due to climate change
    (IPCC, 2007). Although the large reservoir capacity in the CRB mitigates interannual
    variability, water trading can also help alleviate it as it has in Australia.
    Thus, an interstate water market may not only be viable in the CRB, but the flexibility
    it provides may also become essential as scarcity and runoff variability increase.
    An interstate water market will likely increase the economic efficiency when willing
    buyers in arid southwestern cities connect with potential agricultural sellers
    across the CRB. Generally, water allocation based on seniority without trading
    is extremely inefficient, with irrigators paying much less for their water than
    municipalities (Chong and Sunding, 2006). In the Colorado market from 1987 to
    2005, the median prices of single-year agriculture-to-urban and agriculture-to-agriculture
    transfers were $40/af ($0.0324 per 1000 L) and $10/af ($0.0081 per 1000 L), respectively
    (Brewer et al., 2007). By contrast, the purchase of unused Arizona water cost
    the SNWA $291.67/af ($0.2366 per 1000 L) (Tavares, 2009). This high price appears
    to be a function of a paucity of sellers willing to meet the demand of Las Vegas
    due to the lack of a functioning market for water. The potential for any new water
    management practice to improve upon existing policy depends on understanding the
    costs of available alternatives. Implementing interstate water trading would bring
    new costs to the water supply of any participant, and so the magnitude of the
    benefit of a new interstate water market will vary by location and by water user.
    Thus, it will require a careful, site-specific study; although the costs of market
    regulation (see below) should be rather constant across the CRB, transaction costs
    could vary substantially between basin states. Such costs arise from any impediment
    to a water transfer. They tend to be higher in arid regions, and policy-induced
    costs are often desirable because they monetize externalities of trading (Colby,
    1990). As a simple example, if water trading moved net consumptive use either
    upstream or downstream of Lake Powell and Grand Canyon during a given season,
    this could affect hydropower revenue at Glen Canyon Dam, the health of (endangered)
    species in the sensitive Grand Canyon ecosystem, and recreational benefits in
    both locations. Although there is a clear need for research to quantify such costs
    and, consequently, the net economic benefit of the initiation of interstate water
    trading, the large difference between the prices of water in routine sales in
    the Colorado market relative to that of the SNWA-Arizona agreement indicates that
    interstate water trading offers strong potential for an increase in availability
    and a decrease in price for some willing buyers. Water-scarce regions outside
    Arizona and Nevada stand to benefit from expanded interstate trading. For example,
    although California will not experience shortages under the Shortage Guidelines
    and enjoys the largest share of Colorado River water of any CRB state, the majority
    of this water is used on farms; the water supplies for metropolitan Los Angeles
    and San Diego are not plentiful. Although no intrastate market for Colorado River
    water exists in California, San Diego has purchased 0.2 maf/yr (247 GL/yr) from
    the Imperial Irrigation District starting at $258/af ($0.2092 per 1000 L) (San
    Diego County Water Authority, 2011). This demonstrates a strong willingness to
    pay for water in a state that receives a large volume from the Colorado River.
    Just as active trading in the Australian market occurs within states, junior rights
    holders across the CRB would likely be active participants in a freer water market,
    purchasing both in-state and out-of-state water. The concept of prior appropriation
    and the seniority of certain water rights could be preserved in an interstate
    water market, as it has been in Australia. There, water rights are separated into
    two tiers known as “high security” or “low security” entitlements, which are more
    or less likely to receive their full seasonal allocation (e.g., Bjornlund, 2004).
    The trading of permanent or temporary water rights in the U.S. neither implies
    nor rejects the adoption of the Australian system of allocations. If desired,
    the CRB could maintain prior appropriation in a water market by classifying the
    seniority of a water right to reflect the date of its creation, not the date of
    its possession by its current owner. In this case, market participants could control
    the reliability of their water supplies as well as the size of their supplies.
    Presumably, senior water rights would sell (i.e., a permanent transfer) or lease
    (i.e., the purchase of a volume of water for a fixed time period, such as one
    year) for much higher prices than junior ones as they currently do in the Colorado
    intrastate market (Brookshire et al., 2004; Brewer et al., 2007). Preserving seniority
    of water rights should make interstate water trading attractive to senior rights
    holders across the CRB due to the strong potential for profit. Coupled with the
    access to new sources of water for junior rights holders, it may make interstate
    water trading more universally appealing across the Basin. Thus, interstate water
    trading is not a threat to prior appropriation, one of the bedrock principles
    that has guided Western water law since its inception. Barriers to Interstate
    Water Trading in the Colorado River Basin Several barriers exist to the implementation
    of an Australian-style water market in the CRB. A merger of existing intrastate
    water markets would be problematic because regulations pertaining to water trading
    vary widely across the CRB (Colby, 1988; Loomis, 1994; Brookshire et al., 2004).
    The water market in Colorado is the most efficient, whereas rules in Arizona and
    New Mexico seem intentionally restrictive to trading. The laws of Colorado thus
    provide the best model for standardization. The Australian innovation of “tagged
    trade,” in which the features of a water right are honored in the state of purchase,
    even if they are inconsistent with the rights created in that state (Australian
    National Water Commission, 2010), could allow for an interstate water trading
    system that does not necessitate the political and economic costs of full standardization.
    However, in the MDB, state laws were similar before the inception of interstate
    trading due to coordination through the COAG (Connell and Grafton, 2011), but,
    in the CRB, state laws vary to the extent that even the basic terminology of water
    rights depends on different definitions in different states (Colby, 1988). The
    success of a water market depends on regulation by a central authority that can
    apply rules fairly to all participants, execute trades in a time frame that allows
    users to respond to changing water needs and availabilities, and protect third
    parties from potential negative effects of water transfers (Chong and Sunding,
    2006). Consequently, Basin-wide standardization and subsequent market regulation
    would almost certainly require states ceding some authority to an entity with
    interstate jurisdiction. The states of the CRB hold strong authority over their
    water supplies, yielding only to legal agreements negotiated with other basin
    states or to federal laws that were not designed explicitly to control water,
    such as the U.S. Endangered Species Act (MacDonnell, 2009). The USBR provides
    a poor U.S. analogy to the Australian federal agencies; the former merely manages
    water infrastructure and does not set CRB-wide conservation or use policies. No
    other Basin-wide entity exists, and the creation of an authority that could operate
    above the CRB states would require delicate negotiation given the disquiet between
    states of the two Basins as well as negativity related to perceptions of unnecessary
    new regulation by nonlocal government entities, which has been observed in Texas
    (Colby, 2000). The national economic and cultural significance of the Colorado
    River and the current involvement of the USBR suggest that a CRB Authority might
    lie within a federal agency. In addition to the MDBA, rough analogies for such
    an entity exist in those that regulate interstate electricity trading, and thus
    an Independent System Operator or a Regional Transmission Organization could serve
    as a model for some elements of a regulatory agency that oversees interstate water
    trading in the CRB. Just as cultural factors have been an impediment to agricultural-urban
    water transfers in Australia (Crase et al., 2007), an additional, significant
    barrier to creation of an interstate water market in the CRB is strong resistance
    to change among Upper Basin states that is derived from fear that water transfers
    could remove water from economic use in the Upper Basin in favor of economic use
    in the Lower Basin. In 2008, then-Colorado senator (and the current U.S. Secretary
    of the Interior) Ken Salazar called any modification of the laws that divide CRB
    water between the Basin states “an anathema to the fundamental principles of Colorado’s
    water rights.” He believed that renegotiation of Colorado River law might lead
    to less water for Colorado and more for Lower Basin states, and Colorado “did
    not want California to gobble up all of the water supply on the Colorado River”
    (Ashby, 2008). Furthermore, survey data indicate that CRB water managers consider
    water law to be an important influence on local water supply yet have little understanding
    about how potential regulatory changes might affect them (USBR, 2011). Such distrust
    and uncertainty may delay meaningful CRB reform, including the implementation
    of interstate water trading, until the cities of the Southwest face certain crisis,
    at which point the flexibility provided by a water market would be largely diminished.
    Management of the psychological and emotional costs of the instability brought
    by institutional change has received attention in the field of sustainability
    theory (e.g., Senge, 1990; Senge et al., 1999). A detailed discussion of the principles
    of change management with respect to water managers across the CRB is beyond the
    scope of this article, but the concerted application of these principles as well
    as effective public communication would be an essential part to any meaningful
    regulatory reform in the CRB. An interstate water market could be the reform that
    best suits the distrust in the CRB, because participation would be optional and
    Coloradoans (or others) could refuse to sell their water downstream. This may
    be preferable to entering into negotiations during a water crisis and receiving
    reduced access to the Colorado River with no option for amendment once an altered
    Compact is finalized. Furthermore, interstate trading could be phased in gradually
    by first creating separate markets in the Upper and Lower Basins and then merging
    them after several years. Although interstate water trading is not incompatible
    with prior appropriation, it could challenge other core principles of CRB water
    law. For example, the guarantee of a minimum flow from the Upper Basin to the
    Lower Basin could, in principle, be undermined if great volumes of water were
    voluntarily sold from users below Glen Canyon Dam to those above it, although
    this seems highly unlikely in the coming decades. Additionally, laws invalidate
    water rights if water is not put to beneficial use, and environmental flows are
    not considered as beneficial uses in all CRB states (Colby, 1988). Although advocates
    of ecological health might wish to purchase water to increase instream flows (as
    in Australia, see above), such an action runs counter to the values espoused in
    CRB water law. A complete review of the legal complexities induced by interstate
    water trading is beyond the scope of this article, but these examples indicate
    that responding to scarcity by creating an interstate water market may challenge
    some long-held beliefs that are embedded in the Basin’s laws. However, the existence
    of such conflicts does not negate the value of an interstate water market, which
    may be necessary to prevent desperate, poorly conceived, more significant challenges
    to CRB law from states suffering from shortages. Should the CRB acquiesce to change
    and create an interstate water market, the attendant emotional fears should be
    easier for the new CRB-wide entity to address. Concerns such as entities being
    forced to sell and then experiencing financial ruin, farms losing all their water
    to wealthy cities, and farming towns depopulating have been debunked as existing
    water markets have been studied (Chong and Sunding, 2006). For example, based
    on data from California, Colorado, and Australia, it would seem unlikely that
    the sale of water at market prices from agricultural areas in Colorado and Utah
    to Lower Basin cities would have exceptionally deleterious effects to the economies
    or cultures of upstream regions. Other impediments to successful introduction
    of markets can arise if regulations are poorly written (cf., Colby, 2000), although
    ample legal precedent for the application of state water law exists (Colby, 1988).
    This should ease the adjustment to an interstate market somewhat. Conclusions
    The 2011 interim report of the Water Supply and Demand Study marks the first official
    acknowledgement by the USBR of facts that nontechnical and peer-reviewed publications
    have reported for some time: supply in the Colorado River exceeds demand, and
    that supply is expected to decrease substantially due to climate change (USBR,
    2011; e.g., Powell, 2008; Barnett and Pierce, 2008). Climate change cannot be
    ignored in reservoir management (Viers, 2011), and so this new stance by the USBR
    would seem to render obsolete an important premise that underlies the reactions
    to drought described by the Shortage Guidelines (USBR, 2007). Although the Shortage
    Guidelines are based on an outdated and flawed premise, their reaction to aridity
    persists as policy. They are consistent with the many laws governing the Colorado
    River, but they place the burden of low water availability on the cities of Arizona
    and Nevada and agriculture along the CAP. Were the reduced withdrawals from Lake
    Mead likely to prevent further shortage, then the Shortage Guidelines would offer
    some water security to Arizona and Nevada at high cost. However, the fall of Lake
    Mead to <1,025 ft above sea level remains a real possibility, and so current policy
    imposes high, targeted costs yet addresses the root problem inadequately, merely
    postponing contentious negotiations until less water is available. It is unlikely
    that the impending water-shortage crisis of the Southwest can be managed by conservation
    alone, either at the regional level (i.e., as reduced deliveries from Lake Mead
    to Lower Basin states) or at the municipal level. During more than a century of
    water development in the CRB, demand has changed from the solely agricultural
    economy of the early 20th Century to a mixture of lucrative agriculture and large,
    economically and politically strong municipalities. However, the legal division
    of the Colorado River has not evolved. Allowing market forces to redistribute
    supply so that it matches demand will offer vital flexibility in the face of declining
    average yearly flows and steadily increasing the population while, if desired,
    also preserving the system of prior appropriation that is central to water rights
    in the American West. Recent data from active interstate water trading in Australia
    show that basin-wide water trading improved the well-being of both agricultural
    and municipal users during a time of prolonged aridity. Currently, should forecasts
    for long-term aridity come true, Arizona and Nevada are extremely unlikely to
    have enough water to sustain their growth rates of recent decades. Under a market
    system, the price of water everywhere would rise when water becomes scarce and
    water will move to those most able to pay for it. This allows Arizona and Nevada
    to have water security, at a cost, and senior rights holders will have a new source
    of income during times of scarcity. Such a market would depend on effective regulation
    to ensure fairness in transactions and limit negative third-party effects. Although
    the barriers to trading water across state lines in the CRB are not trivial, the
    potential benefits of an interstate water market there are too significant and
    numerous to ignore. The final report of the Water Supply and Demand Study is sure
    to spark conversations about updating water allocation policy in the CRB. Creation
    of an interstate water market there should be a meaningful part of that discussion.

    \ in Brazil in 2018 was \nestimated in approximately 45.6 million metric tons\
    \ \n(ANUÁRIO, 2018). This ranks the country as the third \nlargest fruit producer\
    \ in the world, behind only China \nand India. Orange for industrialized juice\
    \ production or \nfresh fruit market is the largest fruit crop produced in the\
    \ \nnation, followed by banana, pineapple, grape and apple. \nThe orange production\
    \ is currently concentrated in São \nPaulo (72%), Bahia (6.7%), Minas Gerais (6.5%),\
    \ Paraná \n(5.5%) Sergipe (3.3%), Rio Grande do Sul (2.7%) and Pará \n(1.3%).\
    \ The 2017 orange harvest was 18.7 million tons \nin approximately 630 thousand\
    \ hectares, with an average \nyield of 29.0 t ha-1 (IBGE, 2018).\nAccording to\
    \ Swingle and Reece’s (1967) \nclassification, the true citrus fruits belong to\
    \ the family \nRutaceae and include six genera, namely, Fortunella, \nMicrocitrus,\
    \ Eremocitrus, Clymenia, Poncirus, and Citrus, \nwhich are cultivated all over\
    \ the globe, with commercial \nrelevance in several countries on all continents\
    \ (SUN et \nal., 2015). Citrus fruits are notable as excellent sources \nof vitamin\
    \ C, which are consumed in natura or processed \nto make juices, jellies, jams,\
    \ preserves, and other types of \ncandies. The extraction of essential oils and\
    \ byproducts \nfrom citrus fruits for industrial processes, such as pulp \npellets,\
    \ is also commercially relevant.\nCitrus has spread worldwide by sexual propagation\
    \ \nfrom its center of origin in Southwest Asia, including to \nChina, India,\
    \ Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia (KRUEGER; \nNAVARRO, 2007). Citrus was introduced\
    \ in Brazil a \nfew years after its discovery in the 15th Century, and \nthen\
    \ spread to several regions within the country. The \ncultivation of citrus on\
    \ a commercial scale dates from \nthe 17th Century onward, with a notable evolution\
    \ in the \nproduction and export of fresh fruit beginning in the 20th \nCentury.\
    \ Since the 1960s, this crop became one of the \nmost important Brazilian commodities,\
    \ generating revenue \nprimarily through the exportation of frozen concentrated\
    \ \norange juice (NEVES et al., 2010).\nThe adoption of new technologies, such\
    \ as \nproduction of varieties with more adaptations to various \nenvironmental\
    \ stresses and better yields, and the use of \nadvanced cultural practices related\
    \ to tree nutritional, pest, \nand disease management were essential for the expansion\
    \ \nof citrus cultivation in Brazil (BOTEON; NEVES, \n2005). Recent advances in\
    \ the cultural practices used \nfor the production of basic citrus propagation\
    \ materials \nand nursery trees were also essential to guarantee the \ncompetitiveness\
    \ and efficiency of Brazilian citriculture \nover the last few decades.\nThe implementation\
    \ of strict laws and regulations \nfor citrus nursery tree production in protected\
    \ environments \nin São Paulo state has excluded the insect vectors of \ndestructive\
    \ diseases, such as citrus variegated chlorosis \n(CVC) and Huanglongbing (HLB),\
    \ making this an \ninnovative reference system for citrus propagation around \n\
    the globe. \nThis review presents and discusses the main aspects \nof these advances,\
    \ including techniques of propagation, \nscion and rootstock varieties, tools\
    \ for genetic validation \nand characterization, and cultural practices such as\
    \ \nirrigation and fertilization for the production of citrus \nbasic materials\
    \ and nursery trees.\nPropagation techniques\nSeed propagation: Seed propagation\
    \ has been \nof great importance in citrus evolution and dispersion \nworldwide,\
    \ as well as in clonal cleaning programs in \nseveral countries, including Brazil\
    \ (MOREIRA; SALIBE, \n1966). The weak vascularization of seed tissues allows \n\
    them to be systemically filtered to remove pathogens, and \nnucellar embryony\
    \ results in clonal plants that are identical \nto their female parent plant.\
    \ The availability of virus-free \nnucellar clones of the main commercial scion\
    \ varieties \nwas essential for the 1969 implementation of the Mother \nTree Program\
    \ in São Paulo state (GREVE et al., 1991).\nThe rapid evolution of citrus clonal\
    \ cleaning with \nthe use of nucellar embryony was achieved with the \ndevelopment\
    \ and improvement of the shoot-tip grafting \ntechnique, which allows for the\
    \ recovery of healthy \nplants without undesirable juvenility (MURASHIGE et \n\
    al., 1972; NAVARRO et al., 1975; PAIVA; CARVALHO, \n1993). Shoot-tip grafting\
    \ using portions larger than the \nmeristematic apex and without the objective\
    \ of cleaning \nhas also been applied in the establishment and development \n\
    of new varieties in breeding programs, including through \nsomatic embryogenesis,\
    \ protoplast fusion, and genetic \ntransformation (CARVALHO et al., 2005).\nSexual\
    \ propagation by seeds was initially the \npreferred method for the commercial\
    \ production of citrus \nnursery trees. Until the middle of the 19th Century,\
    \ most \nBrazilian citrus orchards started from trees derived from \ndirect seed\
    \ germination (e.g., ungrafted trees) (POMPEU, \nJR., 2005). \nCurrently, seed\
    \ propagation is limited to the \nproduction of rootstocks. The main desirable\
    \ characteristics \nin the materials to be multiplied by seeds are high levels\
    \ \nof nucellar polyembryony (directly related to the average \nnumber of embryos\
    \ that can be produced per seed) \nand germination after prolonged storage (CASTLE\
    \ et \nal., 1993; CARVALHO et al., 2005). A high degree \nof polyembryony facilitates\
    \ the clonal propagation of \nrootstock seeds (SOARES FILHO et al., 2014). Production\
    \ \nmay also target the replacement of rootstocks in existing \norchards by inarching\
    \ (POMPEU, JR., 2005). This method \nhas been successfully used for the recovery\
    \ or prevention \nof the citrus sudden death (CSD) disease (GIRARDI et \nal.,\
    \ 2007b; RIBEIRO et al., 2014).\n3\nAdvances in Citrus propagation in Brazil\n\
    Rev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6:  (e-422) \nPropagation by\
    \ cuttings: Scions obtained by \ncuttings are clonal plants, meaning that they\
    \ have the \nsame genetic identity as their parental trees, and their use \nis\
    \ considered a vegetative propagation method (ARAÚJO \net al., 1999; ANDRADE;\
    \ MARTINS, 2003).\nThe use of cuttings for citrus nursery tree production \nis\
    \ still limited. Webber (1948) reported its use in citron \n(Citrus medica L.)\
    \ production in Sicily, Italy. Pompeu Jr. \n(2005) indicated that the technique\
    \ was used in Florida, \nUnited States of America (USA), to obtain ‘Tahiti’ \n\
    (Citrus latifolia Tanaka) acid lime plants, inducing earlier \nproduction compared\
    \ to that in grafted plants. Cuttings of \nthe ‘Tahiti’ acid lime presented rooting\
    \ success greater \nthan 90% under nebulization (ARAÚJO et al., 1999; \nPRATI\
    \ et al., 1999). \nThe production of adventitious roots by rooted \ncuttings leads\
    \ to the formation of plants with a more \nsuperficial root system than that observed\
    \ in plants grown \nfrom seeds (CASTLE; YOUTSEY, 1977). Therefore, it \nis possible\
    \ that such plants will be more susceptible to \ntip-over after planting in the\
    \ field. Plants obtained from \ncuttings are usually smaller than those that originated\
    \ \nfrom seeds. Rooted trees can also be similar to ungrafted \ntrees in terms\
    \ of their poor adaptation to different soil \nconditions, and present variable\
    \ resistance or tolerance \nto abiotic and biotic factors such as water stress,\
    \ salinity, \nand Phytophthora gummosis (WEBBER, 1948).\nOn the other hand, cuttings\
    \ may be a good option \nfor rootstock propagation in varieties with low numbers\
    \ \nof seeds per fruit, such as ‘Sunki’ mandarin [C. sunki \n(Hayata) hort. ex\
    \ Tanaka] (OLIVEIRA et al., 2014; \nSARMIENTO et al., 2016). Semi-woody cuttings\
    \ of \n‘Swingle’ citrumelo [C. paradisi Macfad. × Poncirus \ntrifoliata (L.) Raf.]\
    \ derived from juvenile material can be \nused to obtain rootstocks for the production\
    \ of grafted trees \nor be used for inarching in the field (MOURÃO FILHO et \n\
    al., 2009). Recently, procedures to increase propagation \nof rootstocks by root\
    \ cuttings have been evaluated in \nFlorida and found to propagate seedless materials\
    \ or those \nwith low seed counts, and to accelerate the production of \ncertain\
    \ rootstocks and budwood for nurseries (BEESON \nJR.; SILVA, 2017a; 2017b).\n\
    In vitro micropropagation: Advances in the \ndevelopment of micropropagation protocols\
    \ to produce \nuniform rootstocks from parthenocarpic fruit with low \nnumbers\
    \ of seeds or low percentages of polyembryony \nwere described by Carimi and De\
    \ Pasquale (2003), Sharma \net al. (2009), and Tallón et al. (2012). Although\
    \ this method \nincreases the cost of production per tree, it can guarantee \n\
    uniformity and genetic fidelity, as in several other species \nthat are already\
    \ propagated by this method. The use of \nmicropropagation at a large scale started\
    \ in the 1980s with \nthe propagation of ornamental plants, vegetable crops, \n\
    and other fruit trees (KITTO, 1997; WINKELMANN et. \nal., 2006). \nMicropropagation\
    \ has been used in citrus as an \nimportant auxiliary biotechnological tool and\
    \ for the \nrapid multiplication of new materials with horticultural \ncharacteristics\
    \ of interest (CARVALHO et al., 2005). \nThis method was already used commercially\
    \ in Brazil \nfor the propagation of ‘Sunki’ mandarin in the 1980s due \nto its\
    \ small number of seeds and low seed availability \n(CARVALHO, 1992).\nPlants\
    \ propagated by seeds, both from zygotic \nand nucellar embryony, present a pivotal\
    \ or axial root \nsystem, with a pivotal root responsible for growth in depth\
    \ \n(ESAU, 1977). The root system is bimorphic, consisting \nof a primary root\
    \ and derivatives called secondary roots \n(CASTLE, 1980). There is a low predominance\
    \ of the \noccurrence of a pivotal root in micropropagated plants  \nas well as\
    \ those obtained by cuttings. These plants are \ncharacterized by having a ramified\
    \ and more superficial \nroot system, with greater susceptibility to drought stress\
    \ \nand tipping over (CARVALHO, 1992).\nMicropropagation is gaining more importance\
    \ \ndue to the tendency of producers to use more compact \nplants at higher planting\
    \ densities associated with \nirrigation needs, which eliminates the drawbacks\
    \ of trees \nwith shallower root systems (AZEVEDO et al., 2015). \nConsidering\
    \ the high demand for rootstock varieties \nwith these characteristics and the\
    \ difficulty of the large-\nscale multiplication of newly introduced materials\
    \ from \nbreeding programs, the commercial production of citrus \nrootstocks using\
    \ micropropagation has been successfully \nachieved in several countries by private\
    \ companies \n(BORDAS et al., 2016).\nGrafting: The great majority of commercial\
    \ citrus \norchards planted worldwide are propagated by grafting, \nand there\
    \ are records of grafting occurring in São Paulo \nnurseries since 1912 (HASSE,\
    \ 1987). There are many \nadvantages in the use of grafting when compared to the\
    \ \nuse of seedlings, especially the reduction of the juvenile \nperiod, production\
    \ of more compact trees that better \nfacilitates harvesting and handling, and\
    \ the adaptation \nof the plant to unfavorable soil and climate conditions \n\
    (DAVIES; ALBRIGO, 1994).\nEven though grafting has promoted the \nadvancement\
    \ of commercial citrus production in Brazil, \nfew improvements in the technique\
    \ have been reported \nin recent years. In general, grafting in citrus results\
    \ in a \nhigh yield, with practically 100% success when performed \nby bud slipping\
    \ in the shape of an inverted T. Although \nsome studies have evaluated alternatives\
    \ for propagation, \nsuch as micro-bud grafting (SKARIA, 2000), apical stem \n\
    grafting (OLIVEIRA et al., 2002), and even seed grafting \n(BAR-JOSEPH, et al.,\
    \ 2011), the high yield observed from \ntraditional grafting in citrus nurseries\
    \ may be one of the \nreasons why other methods have not yet been developed \n\
    and/or widely used. However, techniques for improving \nconventional budding have\
    \ been investigated, such as the \n4\nS. A. de Carvalho et al.\nRev. Bras. Frutic.,\
    \ Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6:  (e-422)                                   \
    \                                   \nuse of photodegradable tape, which eliminates\
    \ the need \nfor manual tape removal after grafting and thus saves \nlabor in\
    \ the nursery (OLIVEIRA et al., 2004; HAYASHI \net al., 2012).\nInter-grafting:\
    \ This technique is necessary when \nthere is incompatibility between the scion\
    \ and rootstock, \nbut the nurserymen or growers still want that specific \ncombination.\
    \ This is the case for the grafting of ‘Pera’ \nsweet orange [C. sinensis (L.)\
    \ Osbeck] on ‘Volkamer’ \nlemon (C. volkameriana V. Ten. & Pasq.), or selections\
    \ \nof trifoliata [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] and some of its \nhybrids, such\
    \ as the ‘Swingle’ citrumelo (POMPEU JR., \n2005). When needed, the production\
    \ of ‘Pera’ trees is \npossible by using inter-grafting, the attachment of a ‘filter’\
    \ \nor ‘sandwich’ of another sweet orange graft, for example \na graft of ‘Valencia’\
    \ between the ‘Pera’ and ‘Swingle’ \n(GIRARDI; MOURÃO FILHO, 2006; CARVALHO et\
    \ al., \n2011). Although the cost of producing inter-grafted trees is \nhigher\
    \ than that of conventional trees, this technique has \nmade it possible to produce\
    \ ‘Pera’ in regions with a high \nrisk of CSD, such as in the northern part of\
    \ São Paulo state \nand in the southern part of Triangulo Mineiro in Minas \n\
    Gerais state (JESUS JUNIOR; BASSANEZI, 2004), \nwhere the use of ‘Rangpur’ lime\
    \ (C. limonia Osbeck) as \na rootstock is not recommended.\nUse of nursery trees\
    \ with two rootstocks: To \novercome the low adaptability of ‘Swingle’ citrumelo\
    \ \nin conditions of low soil moisture, nurserymen started \nproducing trees with\
    \ two rootstocks, especially those of \n‘Rangpur’ lime and ‘Swingle’ citrumelo.\
    \ This strategy \nwould serve as a protection for the plants in regions \npotentially\
    \ affected by CSD but with no need for irrigation. \nThe ‘Rangpur’ lime would\
    \ act as a drought tolerant \nrootstock and, in the event of root damage or death\
    \ by the \ndisease, the ‘Swingle’ citrumelo roots would continue to \nfeed the\
    \ plant (SETIN et al., 2005, 2009). The technical \nfeasibility and scientific\
    \ evidence of the validity of this \npractice are yet to be confirmed.\nScion\
    \ and rootstock selection\nBrazil is the world’s largest producer of sweet \n\
    oranges, with oranges accounting for 89% of the cultivated \narea in the state\
    \ of São Paulo and southeastern Triangulo \nMineiro in 2018, followed by acid\
    \ limes and lemons \naccounting for 8%, and mandarins for 3% of the area \n(INVENTÁRIO,\
    \ 2018). There are also small areas in \nwhich ‘Persian’ limes, grapefruits, citrons,\
    \ and kumquats \nare cultivated.\nThe number of varieties used in commercial \n\
    orchards has been relatively stable over the last 50 years. \nThe most frequently\
    \ planted sweet oranges are ‘Hamlin’ \n(early maturing), ‘Pera’ (mid-season maturing),\
    \ and \n‘Valencia’ and ‘Natal’ (late maturing) (Table 1). In the \ncase of ‘Pera’\
    \ sweet orange, the most widespread clone \nin São Paulo and its neighboring states\
    \ is ‘Pera IAC’, \nwhich is pre-immunized against the most severe isolates \n\
    of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) (MÜLLER et al., 1999; \nCARVALHO et al., 2015b).\
    \ ‘Pera D6’ is usually planted in \nthe northeastern region of Brazil (CUNHA SOBRINHO\
    \ et \nal., 1980; PRUDENTE et al., 2004; ALMEIDA; PASSOS, \n2011). The published\
    \ inventory for the São Paulo and \nsoutheastern Triangulo Mineiro region indicates\
    \ that \nmore than 194 million sweet orange trees (productive \nand non-productive)\
    \ are grown there, comprising 11% \n‘Hamlin’, 35% ‘Pera’, 27% ‘Valencia’, 11 %\
    \ ‘Natal’, \nand 4% ‘Folha Murcha’ trees, with the remaining 13% \nof trees distributed\
    \ among more than 15 other varieties \n(ESTIMATIVA, 2018). \nThe limited number\
    \ of sweet orange varieties used \nin Brazil is due the focus of cultivation in\
    \ this country on \nthe juice market and the lack of better substitutes. This\
    \ \nstable composition favors the prevalence of a limited \ngenetic pool, inducing\
    \ the potential for phytosanitary \nproblems due to the close genetic base shared\
    \ among \nsuch cultivars.\nThe main desirable characteristics in sweet orange\
    \ \nvarieties destined for use in industrialization (i.e. juice \nproduction)\
    \ are high fruit yield and adequate juice \nquality (volume, color, soluble solids\
    \ content, and total \nacidity). Varieties used for fresh fruit production must\
    \ \nalso present attractive coloration and low seed numbers \nor parthenocarpy,\
    \ in addition to out-of-season maturation \n(early or late) for higher market\
    \ value.\nSeveral breeding programs around the world have \nsought to produce\
    \ new varieties of sweet orange and other \ncitrus species. In Brazil, improvement\
    \ teams are located \nat the Campinas Agronomic Institute’s ‘Sylvio Moreira’ \n\
    Citrus Research Center (CCSM-IAC), University of São \nPaulo’s School of Agriculture\
    \ ‘Queiroz’ (ESALQ-USP), \nUniversity of São Paulo’s Center for Nuclear Energy\
    \ \nin Agriculture (CENA-USP), Brazilian Agricultural \nResearch Corporation (Embrapa),\
    \ and Paraná Agronomic \nInstitute (IAPAR).\nSome new materials have been made\
    \ available to \ncitrus growers in recent years, with emphasis on sweet \norange\
    \ varieties, such as ‘Iapar 73’ (TAZIMA et al., 2000), \n‘Charmute de Brotas’\
    \ (NASCIMENTO et al., 2005), and \n‘Homosassa’ (CAVALCANTE et al., 2009). The\
    \ navel \noranges ‘Navelina’, ‘Navelate’, ‘Lanelate’ (OLIVEIRA et \nal., 2005),\
    \ and ‘Salustiana’ (CAPUTO et al., 2012) were \nintroduced from Uruguay by Embrapa\
    \ Temperate Climate \nthrough Embrapa Genetic Resources and Biotechnology \nand\
    \ indexed for viruses from June 1999 onward at the \nCCSM-IAC (CARVALHO et al.,\
    \ 2003).\nBecause of the presence of pigments that provide \nprotection from oxidative\
    \ stress, heart disease, and certain \ntypes of cancer (due to their capacity\
    \ to inactivate free \nradicals), sweet oranges with a reddish flesh coloration\
    \ \nhave been especially recommended for consumption to \n5\nAdvances in Citrus\
    \ propagation in Brazil\nRev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6: \

    \ which originated from Carabobo, Venezuela, \nand is rich in lycopene, stands\
    \ out, as do other red sweet \noranges and several true blood sweet oranges (BASTOS\
    \ \net al., 2014) with a more intense pulp and juice color \nprovided by the high\
    \ levels of anthocyanins in their flesh, \nsuch as ‘Moro’, ‘Sanguinelli’, ‘Tarocco’,\
    \ and ‘Malta \nBlood’, which were introduced from different countries in \nthe\
    \ Citrus Germplasm Bank of the CCSM-IAC (LATADO, \n2016).\nOne hundred and fifty-two\
    \ citrus varieties were \nintroduced in 1998 in Brazil from Italy, Corsica, Spain,\
    \ and \nPortugal by the Bebedouro Citrus Experimental Station. \nThe introduction\
    \ and quarantine were done by Embrapa \nGenetic Resources and Biotechnology, and\
    \ the materials \nwere indexed for viruses at the CCSM-IAC. Among these, \n‘Navelina\
    \ ISA-315’ presents particularly good potential \nfor cultivation due to its demonstrated\
    \ resistance to CVC \nin the field (FADEL et al., 2014). This clone was diagnosed\
    \ \nas harboring the viroids of cachexia and xyloporosis and \nhaving been sanitized\
    \ and pre-immunized against the most \nsevere strains of CTV (CARVALHO et al.,\
    \ 2003).\nThe ‘Shamouti’ sweet orange presented excellent \nperformance in field\
    \ evaluations for tolerance to the citrus \ncanker bacterium (Xanthomonas citri\
    \ subsp. citri (ex \nHasse) Gabriel et al., 1989) (CARVALHO et al., 2015a). \n\
    On the other hand, due to problems with blooming and \nfruiting in crops of this\
    \ variety in the southern region of \nBrazil, it requires trunk girdling in the\
    \ fall to achieve better \nperformance (KOLLER et al., 2000).\nIn addition to\
    \ the promising seedless materials \nobtained by mutation (LATADO et al., 2001),\
    \ the \nadaptability of several ‘Pera’ sweet orange clones to \ndifferent rootstocks\
    \ and climates has also been indicated \nin studies done in the states of Paraná\
    \ and São Paulo \n(TAZIMA et al., 2010; MAIA et al., 2013; CARVALHO \net al.,\
    \ 2015b).\nNew introductions of mandarins and hybrids have \nled to the dissemination\
    \ of new cultivars in Brazil. This is \nimportant for the diversification of varieties\
    \ in Brazil, since \nthis market is still dominated by the ‘Ponkan’ mandarin \n\
    (C. reticulata Blanco), followed by small proportions \nof the ‘Murcott’ tangor\
    \ [C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck × C. \nreticulata Blanco], ‘Cravo’ mandarin (C. reticulata\
    \ \nBlanco), and ‘Do Rio’ and ‘Montenegrina’ mandarins (C. \ndeliciosa Ten.) (PIO\
    \ et al., 2005). Although ‘Ponkan’ is \npreferred by the Brazilian consumer, it\
    \ is problematic for \ncommercialization due to its high numbers of seeds and\
    \ \nshort post-harvest conservation period. New materials \nindexed for viruses\
    \ introduced from the CCSM-IAC’s \nCitrus Germplasm Bank have been evaluated,\
    \ and as a \nresult, the ‘Fremont’ (C. clementina Hort. ex Tan. × C. \nreticulata\
    \ Blanco) and ‘Thomas’ mandarins (C. reticulata \nBlanco) have already been released\
    \ (AZEVEDO et al., \n2010; BASTIANEL et al., 2014; PACHECO et al., 2017).\nThe\
    \ ‘Murcott’ tangor hybrid has also been gradually \nreplaced by other cultivars\
    \ that are equally productive \nand more resistant to the Alternaria brown spot\
    \ disease \n(Alternaria alternata f. sp. citri), a disease with high \ncontrol\
    \ costs. Originally from Morocco and introduced in \nCalifornia, USA, in 1985\
    \ as ‘W Murcott’, the ‘Afourer’ \ntangor, also known as ‘Nadorcot’ (NADORI, 2004),\
    \ \nproduces seedless fruits with earlier maturation than those \nof ‘Murcott’.\
    \ In 2000, through the Florida Department \nof Agriculture and the Campinas Agronomic\
    \ Institute’s \nQuarantine Center, this variety, which had been micro-\ngrafted\
    \ and pre-immunized, was introduced in Brazil by \nthe CCSM-IAC and registered\
    \ at the National Register of \nCultivars (RNC) of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture,\
    \ \nLivestock, and Food Supply (MAPA) as ‘IAC 2013 WM’.\nThe ‘Dekopon’ hybrid,\
    \ a seedless variety obtained \nfrom the crossing of ‘Ponkan’ mandarin (C. reticulata\
    \ \nBlanco) with ‘Kiyomi’ tangor [C. unshiu Marcow x C. \nsinensis (L.) Osbeck],\
    \ was developed in 1972 in Nagasaki, \nJapan. This variety is known as ‘Shiranui’\
    \ in Japan, ‘Sumo’ \nin the USA, and ‘Kallabong’ and ‘Jallasan’ in South Korea\
    \ \n(OLIVEIRA et al., 2012). This variety was introduced in \nBrazil in the 1980s\
    \ and indexed and micro-grafted at the \nCCSM-IAC, and was registered at the RNC\
    \ of MAPA as \n‘IAC 2009 Dekopon’. It is cultivated by citrus growers \nfrom Pilar\
    \ do Sul, São Paulo (SP), who are members of \nthe São Paulo State Association\
    \ of Persimmon Producers, \nand it was renamed ‘Kinsey’ mandarin in November 2007.\n\

    \ Blanco], \n‘Clemenules’ and ‘Marisol’ clementines (C. clementina \nhort. ex\

    \ et al., 2010; TAZIMA et al., 2015). They are \ncurrently recommended as apyrenic\

    institutions for use in southern Brazil (OLIVEIRA et al., \n2005; BORGES et al.,\

    \ presenting good fruit production with high \nquality, even in tropical climate\

    Rev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6:  (e-422) \nAmong the acid\
    \ limes, the Mexican lime variety, \nknown in Brazil as ‘Galego’ [C. aurantiifolia\
    \ (Christm.) \nSwingle], has a limited market. The most cultivated variety \n\
    is the ‘Tahiti’ lime. The most prevalent clone of ‘Tahiti’ \nlime in São Paulo\
    \ is ‘IAC 5’ (also known as ‘Peruano’), \nwhich is of nucellar origin (FIGUEIREDO,\
    \ 1991). This \nclone was later submitted to clonal cleaning and pre-\nimmunized\
    \ against the most severe isolates of CTV and \nnamed ‘Tahiti IAC 5-1’ (CARVALHO\
    \ et al., 2001a), and \nthen became the most widely cultivated clone in São Paulo\
    \ \nstate. The ‘CNPMF-1’ and ‘CNPMF-2’ clones of ‘Tahiti’ \nlime are more common\
    \ in the northeastern region of Brazil \n(PIO et al., 2005). Even though legislation\
    \ prohibits the \ndelivery of trees contaminated with citrus diseases by \nnurseries\
    \ since diseased plants are smaller and induce out-\nof-season fruiting compared\
    \ to that of healthy trees, ‘Tahiti \nQuebra-Galho’ is still cultivated in São\
    \ Paulo and other \nstates, despite it being contaminated with citrus viroids\
    \ \n(CVd), including those of citrus exocortis (CEVd) (PIO \net al., 2005). Recent\
    \ studies indicated the potential of new \n‘Tahiti’ acid lime cultivars to achieve\
    \ high productivity in \nboth irrigated and non-irrigated orchards in São Paulo\
    \ and \nBahia states, including such nucellar clones and accesses \nintroduced\
    \ from other countries as ‘BRS Ponta Firme’, \n‘CNPMF-01’, ‘CNPMF-02’, ‘Persian-58’,\
    \ and ‘5059’ \n(BREMER NETO et al., 2013; SANTOS et al., 2016).\nThe true lemons\
    \ [C. limon (L.) Burm. f.] most \nfrequently cultivated in Brazil are of the ‘Eureka’,\
    \ \n‘Femminello’, ‘Lisboa’, and ‘Genova’ varieties, for which \nthe Sicilian synonymy\
    \ is generally used, alluding to the \norigin of the first lemons introduced in\
    \ the country from \nSicily, Italy (POMPEU JR., 2005). \nRegarding the varieties\
    \ used as rootstocks, the use \nof ‘Rangpur’ lime has been predominant since the\
    \ citrus \ntristeza virus outbreak in the late 1930s and has mainly \nbeen used\
    \ to produce viroid-free sweet orange nucellar \nclones. The reasons for this\
    \ include this variety’s rusticity, \nresistance to drought, and vigor in the\
    \ nursery and in the \nfield, as well as the precocity of its fruit production\
    \ and \nits high productivity (POMPEU JR., 2005). However, as a \nresult of CSD\
    \ (INFORMATIVO, 2001; MACCHERONI \net al, 2005), a significant change in the scion/rootstock\
    \ \ncombinations used occurred, with the occurrence of \n‘Swingle’ citrumelo becoming\
    \ higher (Table 2).\nTable 2. Rootstock cultivars used in the production of citrus\

    \ and \n2.5% ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin (C. reshni hort. ex Tanaka) \n(POMPEU JR.; BLUMER,\
    \ 2016). However, this \ndistribution tends to change over time, with the use\
    \ of \n‘Swingle’ citrumelo likely to surpass that of ‘Rangpur’ \nlime in the near\
    \ future. In 2016, 50% of the approximately \n10.5 million nursery trees produced\
    \ in São Paulo nurseries \nwere grafted on ‘Swingle’ citrumelo, with only 33%\
    \ \ngrafted on ‘Rangpur’ lime (Table 2). There is also more use \nof P. trifoliata\
    \ hybrids in comparison to that in previous \nyears, which is probably due to\
    \ the expansion of the \ntrifoliate dwarfing variety ‘Flying Dragon’ [P. trifoliata\
    \ \nvar. monstrosa (T. Ito) Swingle], especially as a rootstock \nfor the ‘Tahiti’\
    \ acid lime (CANTUARIAS-AVILÉS et al., \n2012; ESPINOZA-NUÑEZ et al., 2011; STUCHI\
    \ et al., \n2003).\nIt is also important to mention that other studies \nevaluating\
    \ disease-tolerant rootstocks with lower \nirrigation demand also have a smaller\
    \ canopy size, \nincreasing the efficiency of production per canopy volume \n\
    (POMPEU JR., 2005). This strategy has been adopted in \nrecent years due to the\
    \ increased frequency of the HLB \ndisease. Technologies that include the production\
    \ of \nsmaller trees and use of increased planting densities have \nbeen investigated\
    \ in other countries to compensate for the \neradication of infected plants and\
    \ maintain productivity. \nAmong other strategies for reduction in tree size,\
    \ the use \nof viroids, ‘filters’, and ‘inter-grafts’ can be mentioned \n(SALEH\
    \ et al. 2008; HUSSAIN et al., 2012). Genetic \nimprovements to obtain materials\
    \ that have reduced \ncanopy sizes, especially tetraploid rootstocks, have also\
    \ \nbeen sought (BRUYERE et al., 2016).\n8\nS. A. de Carvalho et al.\nRev. Bras.\

    \                                            \nStudies seeking to increase the\
    \ diversification of \nrootstock varieties indicated the great potential of using\
    \ \n‘Sunki Tropical’ mandarin (SOARES FILHO et al., 2002), \ncitrandarins and\
    \ trifoliate hybrids (BLUMER; POMPEU \nJR., 2005; CRISTOFANI-YALI et al., 2007;\
    \ RAMOS \net al., 2015; CARVALHO et al., 2016b; FRANÇA et \nal., 2016), and the\
    \ ‘F80’ citrumelo and other trifoliates \n(POMPEU JR.; BLUMER, 2005). The performance\
    \ \nof several new rootstocks and their combination with \ndifferent varieties\
    \ under nursery conditions was reported \nby Schinor et al. (2015), Rodrigues\
    \ et al. (2015, 2016), \nand Parolin et al. (2017).\nCharacterization and genetic\
    \ certification\nThe adequate characterization of citrus varieties \nis of great\
    \ importance for their distinction from those \nalready known, and is essential\
    \ for their registration in \nthe Brazilian RNC of MAPA. New materials need to\
    \ \nbe characterized and evaluated under different soil and \nclimatic conditions\
    \ before they can be made available as \nscion or rootstock.\nResearchers collect\
    \ and analyze data on the plant \ngrowth and production, fruit and juice quality,\
    \ scion/\nrootstock compatibility, and tolerance to pests and diseases \nof new\
    \ materials (ZORZO; CARVALHO, 2012). Based \non research and consolidated records,\
    \ most of the citrus \nvarieties used in São Paulo and other Brazilian states\
    \ \nhave the desirable vegetative and fruit aspects that are \nwell-described\
    \ in the literature (FIGUEIREDO, 1991; \nKOLLER, 1994; DONADIO et al., 1995; POMPEU\
    \ JR., \n2005; PIO et al., 2005). In nursery is recommended that \nlots of seeds\
    \ and budwoods used for propagation must \nchecked for their respective morphological\
    \ description, \nas early mentioned, aiming to ensure varietal fidelity. \nThis\
    \ procedure maximize the use of propagules free of \nvariations caused by mutations\
    \ that may compromise \nthe quality and productivity of the clones (PERIN, et\
    \ al., \n1998). \nMore detailed genetic characterization for the \npurpose of\
    \ cultivar protection can be done using \nmorphological descriptors. These parameters\
    \ can be found \nin the manual ‘Descriptors for Citrus’ of the International \n\
    Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IBPGR, 1988), and in \nthe guidelines for the\
    \ examination of homogeneity and \nstability distinction established by the ‘International\
    \ Union \nfor the Protection of New Varieties of Plants’ (UPOV, \n2003). \nOn\
    \ the other hand, similar rootstock genotypes \nare difficult to differentiate,\
    \ especially in the early stages \nof growth, when their morphological and agronomic\
    \ \ncharacteristics are not fully expressed. Biotechnological \ntools, including\
    \ isoenzymatic and molecular markers, \nhave been used to identify seedlings of\
    \ zygotic origin \nin breeding programs and in citrus nurseries (ASHARI \net al.,\
    \ 1988; ANDERSON et al., 1991; CRISTOFANI; \nMACHADO, 1998; ANDRADE-RODRIGUEZ\
    \ et al., \n2004; ANDRADE et al., 2007). Molecular markers are \nalso useful for\
    \ the genetic certification of citrus varieties \nused as scions (NOVELLI et al.,\
    \ 2004, 2006; MORAES \nFILHO et al., 2011; SUN et al., 2012; SANKAR et al., \n\
    2014) and as rootstocks (SHÄFER et al., 2004; SCHINOR \net al., 2011). As an example,\
    \ the use of microsatellite \nor simple sequence repeats molecular markers allowed\
    \ \n‘IAC 2019Maria’ to be genetically differentiated from \n‘Murcott IAC’ tangor,\
    \ which is used as a female parent \nin crosses with ‘Pera IAC’ sweet orange (CRISTOFANI-\n\
    YALI, 2017).\nFor sweet oranges, promising results have also been \nobtained with\
    \ the use of the laser-induced fluorescence \nspectroscopy (LIFS) technique, which\
    \ uses the optical \nproperties of leaves to distinguish varieties based on \n\
    their chemical composition and to differentiate between \nhealthy and diseased\
    \ citrus plants (MILORI et al., \n2013). The use of LIFS made it possible to discriminate\
    \ \nvarieties, or even sweet orange clones, with a specificity \nof 97.5% (KUBOTA\
    \ et al., 2017). This technology is \na potential tool for the early identification\
    \ of seedlings \nin breeding programs, characterization of accessions in \ngermplasm\
    \ banks, and certification and protection of \ncultivars. The LIFS technique presented\
    \ better results in \nthe differentiation of ‘Sunki’ mandarin selections than\
    \ \nthe use of molecular markers, which only differentiated \n‘Sunki Tropical’\
    \ and ‘Sunki Maravilha’ from one another \nand their parents, but did not differentiate\
    \ the common \n‘Sunki’ and ‘Sunki da Florida’ varieties from one another \n(SANTANA-VIEIRA\
    \ et al., 2014).\nAiming to meet the demands of the Brazilian citrus \nindustry,\
    \ the CCSM-IAC, in Cordeirópolis, SP, has been \nproviding genetic certification\
    \ for rootstock varieties \nsince the early 2000s (COLETTA-FILHO et al., 2004).\
    \ \nAnalyses are conducted using the DNA polymerase \nchain reaction technique\
    \ and have been used to identify \nrootstock citrus varieties at the sowing stage,\
    \ whereas \nthe differentiation of varieties at this stage based on \nmorphological\
    \ characteristics, such as leaf and thorn \nmorphology, is uncertain. The same\
    \ applies at the seed \nstage. Characteristics such as seed size and shape are\
    \ \nvery useful if the genotypes are different but can lead \nto uncertainty (Figure\
    \ 1). Exampling the phenotypic \ndifferentiation between trifoliate hybrids, such\
    \ as citranges \nand citrumelos (Figure 1) and the ‘Cleopatra’ and ‘Sunki’ \n\
    mandarins (Figure 2), in the initial phase of growth is still \nvery uncertain.\
    \ The genetic confirmation of the rootstock \nof an adult plant in the field is\
    \ also possible, but for this \npurpose it is necessary to obtain a piece of a\
    \ root or bark \nbelow the grafting region.\n9\nAdvances in Citrus propagation\

    \ molecularly certified using these selected primers \n(COLETTA-FILHO et al.,\

    \                \nIn the trifoliate group, genetic certification can be \nsuccessfully\
    \ done for several selections of P. trifoliata, \nsuch as ‘Limeira’, ‘Davis A’,\

    \ ‘F80-8’, \nand ‘F80-18’ (all intergeneric hybrids of P. trifoliata × \nC. paradisi),\
    \ as well as citranges (intergeneric hybrids \nof P. trifoliata × C. sinensis),\
    \ can be genetically certified \nwith a high degree of confidence. However, the\
    \ ‘Troyer’ \nand ‘Carrizo’ citranges, which seem to be different \ndenominations\
    \ of the same germplasm, are exceptions \nto this (SAVAGE; GARDNER, 1965). Selections\
    \ of \ncitrandarins may also be genetically discriminated from \ntheir trifoliate\
    \ parent, and from other selections that have \nthe trifoliate leaf as the dominant\
    \ marker (Figure 1).\nInformation on lemons and their relatives are \nonly available\
    \ for the ‘Rangpur’ lime and ‘Volkamer’ \nlemon, since only a few genetic materials\
    \ are available. \nThe genetic certification in this group of rootstocks is \n\
    made mainly using lots of seeds, seedlings, and pieces \nof the rootstock trunk\
    \ bark already planted in orchards. \nHowever, it is not possible to genetically\
    \ separate the \nselections ‘Palermo’, ‘Catania 1’, and ‘Catania 2’ from \nthe\
    \ ‘Volkamer’ lemon. Selections of ‘Rangpur’ lime with \nhorticultural differences\
    \ reported by Pompeu Jr. (2005) \nwere insufficiently separated by the available\
    \ molecular \nmarkers, indicating the need to search for other molecular \ntools.\n\
    Among mandarins, genetic certification is required \nat the seedbed phase, at\
    \ which ‘Sunki’ and ‘Cleopatra’ are \nmorphologically similar (COLETTA-FILHO et\
    \ al., 2004). \nAccording to these authors, microsatellite-based primers \n(CCSM\
    \ 6R/6F) allowed the ‘Sunki’ mandarin nucellar \nclone to be separated from other\
    \ selections such as ‘Tietê’, \n‘Tropical’, and ‘Maravilha’ (Figure 2).\nProduction\

    \ trees, \nsuch as those applied in other countries like Spain (PINA \net al.,\
    \ 2015) and the USA (VIDALAKIS et al., 2010). \nIn Brazil, the Citrus Mother Tree\
    \ Program of the \nState of São Paulo was established in 1969 (GREVE et \nal.,\
    \ 1991), and restructured in 1998 to require the use of \nscreens in all nurseries\
    \ to protect the plants against CVC \nvectors (CARVALHO, 1998). The mandatory\
    \ use of \nscreens was also the main restriction of the Standards for \nProduction\
    \ of Certified Nursery Trees, a São Paulo state \nvoluntary program introduced\
    \ in 1994 (NORMAS, 1998). \nThe use of screens was also adopted in January 2003\
    \ as a \nmandatory rule in the production of nursery trees in this \nstate (CARVALHO,\
    \ 2004). \nThe São Paulo State Citrus Mother Tree and the \nCertified Nursery\
    \ Trees programs were aimed at the \ndevelopment and dissemination of technology\
    \ for the \nproduction and release of healthy citrus basic materials \nand were\
    \ supported by research institutes and public \npolicies (CARVALHO; LARANJEIRA,\
    \ 1994; BORGES \net al., 2000; CARVALHO et al., 2001a; VALLE, 2002). \nThese programs\
    \ were the basis for the implementation \nand improvement of standards and techniques\
    \ for the \nproduction of nursery trees and basic materials in protected \nenvironments\
    \ to exclude the vectors of important diseases, \nsuch as CVC and HLB, which made\
    \ the system used in this \nstate a reference system to be used as a model worldwide.\
    \ \nOn a historical note, the legal agreement between \nthe São Paulo State’s\
    \ Secretary of Agriculture and Food \nSupply (SAA-SP) and MAPA lost validity with\
    \ the new \nnationwide law of Seed and Nursery Trees of July 2004 \n(DECRETO,\
    \ 2017), causing a major setback to the citrus \nindustry. The Standards for Citrus\
    \ Nursery Tree Production \nand the Certified Nursery Tree Production System were\
    \ \nalso extinguished on this occasion (CARVALHO, \n2014). Today, the São Paulo\
    \ State Agricultural Defense \nCoordination, linked to the SAA-SP, acts only within\
    \ the \nphytosanitary aspects of its legal competence, focusing on \nthe physical\
    \ and genetic standards indicated by MAPA.\nAccording to the federal regulations\
    \ of December \n2005 (INSTRUÇÃO, 2017b), all agents involved in \nthe execution\
    \ of production activities must register or \nbe certified in the National Nursery\
    \ Trees and Seed \n11\nAdvances in Citrus propagation in Brazil\nRev. Bras. Frutic.,\
    \ Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6:  (e-422) \nPlants that are candidates for mother\
    \ trees should \nbe tested for the presence of systemic pathogens, which \nmay\
    \ compromise the production or longevity of the plants \noriginating from them.\
    \ In Brazilian conditions, in addition \nto severe strains of CTV, the plant health\
    \ is evaluated for \nthe occurrence of exocortis, psorosis, cachexia, decline,\
    \ \nCVC, and HLB (CARVALHO et al., 2005). The plants \nsupplying propagation materials\
    \ must also be free of the \ncitrus canker and of the citrus leprosis virus, although\
    \ these \ndiseases are not systemic and present lesions limited to the \naffected\
    \ organs (branches, leaves, and fruits).\nIncreasingly faster and more accurate\
    \ immunological \nand molecular tests are becoming available, but the \ndiagnosis\
    \ of the presence of certain pathogens is still \ndependent on the application\
    \ of biological tests using \nindicator plants (Table 4). For the establishment\
    \ of a \ncomplete mother tree program, other steps are also \nnecessary, such\
    \ as shoot tip-grafting, either associated \n(or not) with thermotherapy and cross-protection\
    \ against \nthe most severe isolates of CTV or pre-immunization \n(MÜLLER; REZENDE,\
    \ 2004). Only plants maintained \nin a vector-free, protected environment are\
    \ used in these \nprocesses. \nThese programs require equipment, products, and\
    \ \nspecialized technical personnel. The high cost and time \nrequired to perform\
    \ this work restricts it to being done \nat more complex research institutions,\
    \ larger companies, \nor nurseries. These services may be requested from such\
    \ \ninstitutions as the CCSM-IAC (INFORMATIVO, 2017), \nand all selected materials\
    \ must be registered by qualified \ntechnicians registered in the RNC and RENASEM\
    \ of \nMAPA.\nShoot-tip grafted plants provide buds for the \nestablishment of\
    \ citrus mother trees, since they are \npathogen-free and pre-immunized against\
    \ severe strains \nof CTV (Figure 3A-C). The use of an anti-aphid screen \nand\
    \ antechambers are federal requirements and prevent \nthe entry of insect vectors\
    \ of diseases. The structure \nused must be resistant to strong winds and must\
    \ have a \nminimum height of 4 m to ensure good internal ventilation \n(CARVALHO;\
    \ SETIN, 2014). The use of windbreaks is \nrecommended to protect the structure\
    \ against inclement \nweather, and as a preventive practice against contamination\
    \ \nwith the citrus canker bacteria (BEHLAU; BELASQUE \nJR., 2014).\nRegistry\
    \ (RENASEM) of MAPA. There are specific \nconditions and documentation for this\
    \ registration, \nincluding the obligatory use of the species or cultivars \n\
    included in the RNC of MAPA, proof of genetic origin, \ntechnical responsibility\
    \ for the respective class entity, and \ncertificates of genetic sanity.\nNationwide,\
    \ the production of citrus nursery trees \non substrate containing soil has not\
    \ been allowed since \nSeptember 2017 (INSTRUÇÃO, 2017a). The mother \ntrees,\
    \ certified budwood blocks, and certified nursery trees \nshould all be kept in\
    \ a protected environment, covered \nby screens with maximum mesh size of 0.87\
    \ × 0.3 mm, \nwith an antechamber of at least 4 m2 and a footbath at the \nentrance\
    \ (INSTRUÇÃO, 2017d). In areas with frequent \noccurrences of HLB, the certified\
    \ budwood increase \nblocks and nurseries must also be kept under a screen, \n\
    even if they are not used for the production of certified \nbudwood or certified\
    \ nursery trees (INSTRUÇÃO, 2017e). \nThe regulation of the production of citrus\
    \ rootstocks \nby in vitro micropropagation is also encompassed by \nfederal regulations,\
    \ which establish the standards for \nthe production and commercialization of\
    \ nursery trees \nand other propagation structures obtained through tissue \n\
    culture (INSTRUÇÃO, 2017a). \nIn addition to the federal regulations of MAPA,\
    \ all \nthose involved in the production and commercialization of \ncitrus propagation\
    \ materials in the state of São Paulo must \nalso comply with state regulations,\
    \ such as the mandatory \nuse of screens to protect the nursery trees and mother\
    \ \ntrees against CVC and HLB vectors, with the exception \nof rootstock mother\
    \ trees (SÃO PAULO, 2018b). This is \nalso mandatory for citrus budwood increase\
    \ blocks and \nnurseries (SÃO PAULO, 2018c), and citrus nursery tree \nstorage\
    \ areas (SÃO PAULO, 2018a). The methodology for \ncollecting samples for laboratory\

    \ \nResources and Biotechnology (EMBRAPA, 2016) or \nIAC (QUARANTENÁRIO, 2016),\

    \ Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6:  (e-422) \nIn addition to citrus canker,\
    \ specific management \npractices should also be adopted to avoid contamination\
    \ \nwith CVC, HLB, and other diseases. Spraying with \nregistered chemical or\
    \ biological pesticides should be \nperformed when symptoms of scab (caused by\
    \ the fungus \nElsinoë fawcettii Bitancourt & Jenkins) or citrus black \nspot\
    \ disease [caused by the fungi Guignardia citricarpa \nKiely (teleomorph) and\
    \ Phyllosticta citricarpa (McAlp.) \nvan der Aa (anamorph)], or the presence of\
    \ aphids, mites, \ncochineal scales, or the citrus leaf miner, is detected inside\
    \ \nthe screened environments. The use of adhesive insect \ntraps is also required.\
    \ Strict control is necessary of door \nopening and personnel entrance, and the\
    \ disinfestation \nof footwear, vehicles, equipment, and tools is highly \nrecommended\
    \ (CARVALHO et al., 2005). The São Paulo \nstate ordinances do not regulate the\
    \ quality of water used \nin the irrigation of mother trees; however, they recommend\
    \ \nthat attention be paid to not to let water from flooding \nor insects from\
    \ the ambient environment enter through \ndrainage holes. \nFor mother trees planted\
    \ on the ground (Figure 3C), \nthe same cultural practices used in commercial\
    \ orchards, \nsuch as soil and leaf analyses, liming, and fertilization via \n\
    soil, fertigation and/or foliar application, is recommended. \nIn addition to\
    \ routine inspections, samples of plants \nsuspected of having citrus canker or\
    \ other diseases should \nbe taken for laboratory tests. Mother trees grown in\
    \ pots \nor soil should be evaluated annually, and the samples \nshould be sent\
    \ to a certified laboratory for testing for CVC \nand HLB (CARVALHO et al., 2005).\
    \ The occurrence of \nviruses and viroids in ornamental citrus mother trees was\
    \ \nreported by Rizzo et al. (2017) in Italy. The possibility of \ncontamination\
    \ with diseases transmitted by insect vectors \nfrom other plants and commercial\
    \ orchards emphasizes the \nimportance of the health care of citrus plants produced\
    \ for \nall uses, not just in the production of nursery trees for use \nin industrial\
    \ juice processing and the fresh fruit market.\nAs there is no evidence of pathogen\
    \ transmission \nthrough seeds, the mother trees of rootstock varieties \nmay\
    \ be kept in open-air conditions, but they must also be \nperiodically indexed\
    \ for viruses, blight, CVC, and HLB \n(CARVALHO; SETIN, 2014).\nBudwood increase\
    \ blocks: These blocks consist of \nhigh-density groups of plants kept in pots\
    \ or directly in the \nground and are exclusively intended for the production\
    \ of \nbudstick branches. To produce citrus certified budwood, \nthese plants\
    \ must be maintained in completely enclosed \nand screened houses, under a screen\
    \ with an antechamber \nin the entrance according to federal regulations. \nThe\
    \ height of the screened housing influences the \ninternal temperature of the\
    \ budwood increase blocks, \nespecially when using very large production facilities\
    \ and \na plastic ground cover, which is mandatory in the state of \nSão Paulo.\
    \ The use of drip irrigation and the plastic ground \ncover reduces and/or eliminates\
    \ the leaching of products \nused to control pests and diseases and the excessive\
    \ \naccumulation of water in the trunk, branches, and leaves, \nreducing susceptibility\
    \ to such diseases as Phytophthora \ngummosis and citrus canker (BEHLAU; BELASQUE\
    \ JR., \n2014). The use of plastic in the roof and side walls also \nallows the\
    \ use of heat in the colder months of the year.\nThe plant spacing used in these\
    \ screened houses \ndepends on the cultivation system adopted by the \nnurserymen.\
    \ For the production of budsticks with two or \nthree branches, spacing between\
    \ 0.3 and 0.4 m has been \nused within a system of single or double rows spaced\
    \ \nfrom 0.7 to 1.0 m, obtaining up to 200 buds per plant \nper year when the\
    \ plants reached maximum production \n(CARVALHO, 1998; CARVALHO et al., 2000a).\n\
    For the formation of budwood increase blocks, \na vigorous rootstock with a satisfactory\
    \ tolerance to \nPhytophthora gummosis, such as the ‘Rangpur’ lime, \nshould be\
    \ used. This rootstock is considered to be of \nmoderate susceptibility to this\
    \ disease according to \nPompeu Jr. (2005). The accumulation of moisture and lack\
    \ \nof ventilation caused by high densities of plants may favor \nthe development\
    \ of this and other diseases (CARVALHO \net al., 2005). As an option that can\
    \ be planted directly on \nthe ground, the trees multiplied with budwood increase\
    \ \nblocks can be maintained in containers with variable \nsubstrate capacities\
    \ of 4 to 20 L (Figure 3 D-F). The \nmaximum legal period of use of an increase\
    \ block is 5 \nyears (SÃO PAULO, 2005b). This system allows for the \neasier substitution\
    \ of plants but requires greater care with \nthe use of fertilizer and better\
    \ irrigation management. The \nsubstrates used should be free of pathogens, lightweight,\
    \ \nand have good drainage. The most common mixtures used \nare based on pine\
    \ bark and coconut fiber. \nTo monitor for different species of sharpshooter \n\
    leafhoppers (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) and psyllids \n(ACP, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama)\
    \ in the budwood \nincrease blocks, yellow adhesive sticky traps should \nbe placed\
    \ in the screened house to monitor its insect \npopulation (HALL, 2009). The use\
    \ of these traps is also \nefficient to monitor for ACP inside screened houses\
    \ used \nfor the production of HLB-free citrus nursey trees under \nprotective\
    \ systems (FERRAREZI et al., 2017b). The \napplication of fungicides, insecticides,\
    \ and acaricides \nrecommended for citrus crops should also be performed \nwith\
    \ products in rotation using different modes of action \nand active ingredients\
    \ (CARVALHO et al., 2005).\nIrrigation and fertigation in budwood increase \n\
    blocks: The irrigation of budwood increase blocks in pots \nshould be performed\
    \ to supply the tree’s water demand \nbased on monitoring the substrate moisture.\
    \ This can be \nestimated by manually sensing the substrate (empirical \nand inaccurate\
    \ method) and by monitoring the weight \nof the containers (SPANN; FERGUSON, 2014)\
    \ or, \nmore precisely, by soil moisture sensors [time-domain \nreflectometry\
    \ (TDR), frequency-domain reflectometry \n(FDR), and others]. In addition, it\
    \ is possible to monitor the \nweather conditions to calculate the evapotranspiration\
    \ rate, \nallowing for greater precision in irrigation management. \n14\nS. A.\

    \                                                                      \nMethods\
    \ based on measuring the sap flow in citrus \nbudwood using micro-sensors inserted\
    \ in a section of the \nstem have also been studied (GIRARDI et al., 2010a). \n\
    Although the daily water consumption can be measured \ndirectly using low-cost\
    \ sensors that can be manufactured \nby the nurseryman, the latter method is still\
    \ experimental \nand can cause physical damage to the stock trees after \nprolonged\
    \ use. \nThe most common irrigation methods used for \nbudwood increase blocks\
    \ are the drip irrigation system \nand manual irrigation using hose nozzles, rain\
    \ wands, and \noverhead micro-sprinklers. Most nurserymen also use a \nrigid schedule\
    \ based on timers to control irrigation. The \nuse of automatic timers can be\
    \ problematic since they \ndo not take into consideration water demand and water\
    \ \navailability based on the environmental conditions and \nplant growth stage.\n\
    Regarding the fertilization of budwood increase \nblocks, an adequate balance\
    \ of nutrients is necessary \nto avoid deficiencies. Granular, controlled-release,\
    \ \nand water-soluble fertilizers used for fertigation \n(supplied using separate\
    \ tanks of pre-prepared blends \nor complete solutions) can be used, but at faster\
    \ rates. \nIt is recommended that adequate concentrations of N, \nP, Mg, and micronutrients\
    \ are maintained to stimulate \nthe growth of sprouts that will produce the buds\
    \ to be \nused for grafting. Bataglia et al. (2008) recommend a \nbalanced formulation\
    \ for nursery trees in bags that should \nbe adjusted for the budwood increase\
    \ blocks. Further \nresearch is needed to recommend fertilizer types, sources,\
    \ \nand application rates, as well as updated guidelines for \ndifferent varieties\
    \ and rootstocks.\nCollection and processing of buds: The budsticks \ncan be harvested\
    \ as soon as the branches became semi-\nwoody, with dark-green mature tissue and\
    \ triangular \nedges. The branches are cut with disinfected pruning \nclippers\
    \ used only for this task and transferred to a clean \nand shaded place to remove\
    \ the leaves. The extremities of \nthe budsticks are removed, leaving the central\
    \ part with \napproximately 10 to 15 buds (CARVALHO et al., 2005). \nThe budsticks\
    \ can be stored at 8°C if not used \nimmediately (ROMEIRO et al., 2001). The sticks\
    \ are \npre-treated with fungicide and placed on a clean and \nventilated rack\
    \ to dry in the shade. If the citrus black-\nspot (Guignardia citricarpa Kiely)\
    \ disease’s causal agent \nis present in the producing region, the budsticks can\
    \ be \ntransported without risk to other disease-free regions, \naccording to\
    \ the São Paulo state regulation for the transit \nof propagation material. A\
    \ heat treatment to inactivate the \nfungus is recommended by immersion in heated\
    \ water at \na temperature of 50°C for 15 min (CARVALHO et al., \n2005). Due to\
    \ the important damages caused by them to \ncitrus trees, attention should be\
    \ paid to the presence of \nthe phytophagous mite vectors of the disease, such\
    \ as the \ncitrus rust mite, citrus bud mite, and especially the citrus \nleprosis\
    \ mite. According to Carvalho et al. (1989), the \nuse of Binapacril at 0.2% presented\
    \ 100% efficiency in \ncontrolling these citrus mites without compromising the\
    \ \nquality of the bud eyes for use in grafting. \nNursery tree production\nThe\
    \ nurseries used for the production of citrus \ntrees are completely enclosed,\
    \ with an antechamber \nand a footbath with cupric and bactericidal products at\
    \ \nthe entrance for disinfection (BREMER NETO, et al., \n2015). The same applies\
    \ for the production of propagation \nmaterials, such as mother trees and budwood\
    \ increase \nblocks. The plastic roof facilitates sanitary and irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ and allows the use of heat to increase plant \ngrowth during winter. The use\
    \ of 50% shading screens, \nreflective screens, or other roof coatings can reduce\
    \ the \neffect of high temperature and is widely used during the \ngermination\
    \ phase (CARVALHO; SETIN, 2014). During \nthe night, the interruption of the dark\
    \ period for one hour \nwith the use of artificial lighting results in greater\
    \ growth \nof sweet orange trees grafted on rootstocks sensitive \nto short photoperiods,\
    \ such as ‘Carrizo’ citrange and \n‘Swingle’ citrumelo (BRAR; SPANN, 2014).\n\
    In February 2017 the state of São Paulo adopted \nthe status of an Area under\
    \ Risk Mitigation to follow the \nchanges in federal regulations related to the\
    \ establishment \nand maintenance of the phytosanitary status of citrus \ncanker\
    \ disease (INSTRUÇÃO, 2017c). The actions \nneeded to eradicate or suppress citrus\
    \ canker are no longer \nrequired there; rather, only measures to prevent the\
    \ disease \nspreading to other areas and its management are required \n(RESOLUÇÃO,\
    \ 2017). The citrus tree nurseries should \nbe located 200 m away from any disease\
    \ focus. In the case \nof the disease’s occurrence, a 1000-m quarantine zone is\
    \ \nrequired for protection against the disease and to avoid \nnursery interdiction\
    \ in the event of canker occurrence in \nadjacent areas (PORTARIA, 2017). \nThe\
    \ citrus tree production system can be divided \ninto multiple, successive phases\
    \ based on the nursery \noperation as follows: seed production and extraction,\
    \ seed \ncoat removal, germination in seedbeds, liner production, \nrootstock\
    \ transplanting, grafting, and termination. Each \nof these phases is performed\
    \ in specific facilities and \nfollows strict state and federal regulations to\
    \ guarantee \ntree health and quality. The specific details of each phase \nare\
    \ discussed in the following sections.\nSeed production, collection, processing,\
    \ and \nstorage: The rootstock seeds must be obtained from fully \nmatured fruit,\
    \ characterized by the typical peel color of \neach species. Seeds obtained from\
    \ immature fruit may \npresent germination problems, especially for P. trifoliata\
    \ \nand hybrids. The use of fruit harvested from the ground \nand near the tree\
    \ skirt is not recommended to avoid the \noccurrence of fungal diseases that may\
    \ cause problems \nwith seed conservation and seedlings damping-off. For \nthe\
    \ same reason, manual or mechanical seed injury during \nextraction must be avoided.\
    \ The complete removal of \nthe seed mucilage by immersion of the seeds in hydrated\
    \ \n15\nAdvances in Citrus propagation in Brazil\nRev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal,\

    \ \nout, followed by a heat treatment at 52°C for 10 minutes \n(CARVALHO et al.,\
    \ 2005). \nCitrus seeds are recalcitrant, presenting challenges \nin the maintenance\
    \ of their physiological quality when \nkept in storage at low moisture content\
    \ when compared to \nother types of seeds (CARVALHO et al., 2002). In addition\
    \ \nto treatment with fungicides, citrus seeds should be stored \nat low temperatures\
    \ and properly wrapped in well-sealed \nplastic bags. Despite the gradual loss\
    \ of germination \npotential with storage time, the seeds can be maintained \n\
    in storage for up to 1 year (SIQUEIRA et al., 2002; \nFigure 3. Irrigation systems\

    \   \nCARVALHO; SILVA, 2013; CONCEIÇÃO et al., 2015). \nSeedbed: The container\
    \ type used in this phase \nis a cone-shaped plastic tube of 0.05 dm3 volume,\
    \ with \nlongitudinal furrows that induce root growth toward \nthe basal orifice,\
    \ causing root meristem pruning. This \n‘air pruning’ of the pivotal root favors\
    \ the emission of \nsecondary roots and increases root system development in \n\
    comparison to seedlings grown in soil or other pot shapes \n(CARVALHO et al.,\
    \ 2005). The containers should be kept \nsuspended using plastic trays hanging\
    \ over cables fixed to \nwooden or concrete posts (Figure 3 G-I). The use of these\
    \ \ncontainers facilitates plant sorting into homogeneous lots \nand optimizes\
    \ tree management. Regarding the substrates, \ncommercial products with a base\
    \ of pine bark, vermiculite, \norganic materials, and/or coconut fiber have been\
    \ used \nextensively. The potting mix should have a finer grain size \nthan those\
    \ used in the bags due to the small volume of \nthe container. Growth media also\
    \ must be pathogen-free, \nlightweight, of adequate porosity with good drainage,\
    \ \nphysically and chemically stable, and should not contain \nnutrients like\
    \ boron (B) in excess to avoid toxicity \n(MATTOS JR. et al., 1995; PERIN et al.,\
    \ 1999).\nThe removal of the seed tegument can be done \nmanually after treatment\
    \ with abrasive or caustic products. \nThis procedure favors the speed and uniformity\
    \ of \ngermination and was well-described by Bremer Neto et \nal. (2015). The\
    \ effectiveness of seed coat removal may \nvary according to the rootstock variety\
    \ used and should \nonly be done at the time of sowing (GIRARDI et al., \n2007a;\
    \ TEIXEIRA et al., 2009; CARVALHO; SETIN, \n2014). While seeding, only two or\
    \ three seeds should \nbe used per container, and one should avoid placing the\
    \ \nseed with the micropyle in the upward position to reduce \nroot deformation\
    \ caused by kinking or curling (SILVA; \nCARVALHO, 2007). \nSeedling sorting after\
    \ germination is an important \nprocess to eliminate atypical plants, which are\
    \ often of \nhybrid or zygotic origin and have different leaf patterns \nand abnormal\
    \ development. The occurrence of these \nvariations depends on the rootstock,\
    \ with higher percent \noccurrences in materials with lower rates of polyembryony,\
    \ \nsuch as ‘Rangpur’ lime, in which the seedling discard rate \ncan reach up\
    \ to 60% (BREMER NETO et al., 2015).\nTransplanting: The seedlings reach 10 to\
    \ 15 cm \nin height between 3 to 5 months after sowing, depending \non the variety\
    \ and the growing conditions. The liners \ncontaining the seedlings’ root masses\
    \ can be transplanted \ninto larger containers to complete rootstock growth. \n\
    The transplanting provides uninterrupted growth of the \nrootstock due to the\
    \ reduction of root ball formation. The \ntransplanted rootstock can be grafted\
    \ within 3 to 4 months \n(CARVALHO et al., 2005).\nThe process of citrus rootstock\
    \ production by \nmicropropagation starts in the laboratory, using growth \nrooms\
    \ and appropriate combinations of growth regulators \nand nutrients for multiplication,\
    \ elongation, and rooting. \nInformation is available in the literature for different\
    \ \nspecies (CARVALHO et al., 1991; SEN; DHAWAN, 2010; \nEED et al., 2011). The\
    \ various aspects of this methodology \nare also discussed by Carimi and De Pasquale\
    \ (2003), \nincluding seedling acclimatization under screened \nconditions and\
    \ when grown in containers, following the \nsame procedures as recommended for\
    \ seed germination \nabove. \nNursery phase: The containers for this growing \n\
    stage should be at least 10 cm wide and 30 cm tall, with a \nsubstrate capacity\
    \ of 4 L. Containers with higher capacity \nallow for greater vegetative growth\
    \ (GIRARDI et al., \n2005b), although recent studies indicate that there is \n\
    potential for the production of grafted trees in containers \nwith reduced capacity\
    \ (180 mL) (GIRARDI et al., 2017). \nThe most common materials used are plastic\
    \ bags, which \nare foldable, present lower costs than rigid containers, and \n\
    have the advantage of being a recyclable material, with \nno need for returning,\
    \ washing, and disinfestation for \nlater use. The bags are arranged in groups\
    \ of 4, 6, 8, or 10 \nlines per bench, depending on the diameter, and should be\
    \ \nsuspended from the ground, hanging from benches with \na minimum height of\
    \ 40 cm and made of cement blocks \nand pre-fabricated material, but not wood\
    \ (Figure 3J). A \nregular nursery can produce on average 20 to 25 trees \nper\
    \ square meter, depending on the number and size of \ncirculation areas, container\
    \ size, and number of tree lines \nused per bench (CARVALHO et al., 2005). \n\
    Regarding the substrate used, the media \ngranulometry recommended for the final\
    \ phase of the \nproduction process is one with a higher proportion of \nparticles\
    \ between 0.5 and 4 mm in diameter, which is \nlarger than the substrates used\
    \ for the seedbed phase \n(ZANETTI et al., 2003). There are several commercial\
    \ \nblends of the appropriate substrate currently available on \nthe market (MOURÃO\
    \ FILHO et al., 1998; ZANETTI et \nal., 2003; SETIN et al., 2005; FOCHESATO et\
    \ al., 2007).\nGrafting and conduction: Grafting is usually \nperformed at 10\
    \ to 20 cm from the substrate surface by \nnormal T- or inverted T-type budding\
    \ (INSTRUÇÃO, \n2017d). For the production of inter-grafted trees, the bud \n\
    of the scion variety should be placed 10-12 cm above \nthe grafting point of the\
    \ inter-grafted variety (BREMER \nNETO et al., 2015). The bud union is covered\
    \ by plastic \ntape (traditional or degradable), which may or may not \nrequire\
    \ removal depending upon the type used. After \ngrafting, the rootstock stem is\
    \ bent to induce sprouting. \nThis technique presents increased vigor compared\
    \ to \nthat involving the decapitation of the rootstock above \nthe grafting point\
    \ (CARVALHO; MACHADO, 1997; \nPEREIRA; CARVALHO, 2006).\nThe lateral sprouts should\
    \ be removed over time, \nand the sprouting of the grafted bud is conducted in\
    \ a \nsingle stem system until maturation. The conduction can \nbe done with or\
    \ without tutors (metallic, plastic, or wooden \nstakes). The final pruning is\
    \ performed when the stem is \n17\nAdvances in Citrus propagation in Brazil\n\
    Rev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6:  (e-422) \nbetween 40 and\
    \ 50 cm in height, and the cut area should \nbe treated with fungicides. The tree\
    \ can be planted as a \nsingle stem or kept in the nursery for canopy sprouting,\
    \ \nwith three to five spiral branches. To avoid the formation \nof a root ball,\
    \ the tree should be maintained in the nursery \nfor a maximum of 15 months from\
    \ the rootstock sowing \nwhen it has a single stem, and for up to 24 months for\
    \ \nnursery trees with branches (CARVALHO et al., 2005). \nIrrigation of rootstock\
    \ liners in the seedbed: The \nirrigation systems traditionally used in the production\
    \ \nof citrus liners include manual watering using shower \nheads, hose nozzles,\
    \ rain wands, and perforated PVC \npipes (Figures 4A and 4B) (SALVADOR et al.,\
    \ 2016), \nmicro-sprinklers (Figure 4C), and spray bars (Figure 4D) \n(TESTEZLAF;\
    \ FERRAREZI, 2017). \nAlthough widely used in seedbeds and nurseries, \nmanual\
    \ overhead irrigation using shower heads, hose \nnozzles, rain wands (Figure 4A),\
    \ or perforated pipes \n(Figure 3B) requires intensive labor, and presents low\
    \ \napplication efficiency and excessive leaching, with \nthe potential for soil,\
    \ groundwater, and water table \ncontamination with agrochemicals. On a seedbed,\
    \ the use \nof overhead irrigation causes total canopy wetting, which \nfavors\
    \ the dissemination of certain diseases, such as citrus \ncanker (BELHLAU; BELASQUE\
    \ JR., 2014). \nThe irrigation of a seedbed can be automated \nwith the use of\
    \ spray bars designed to apply water \nthrough nebulizer sprays mounted on metal\
    \ structures \nthat automatically move on rails along the length of the \ngreenhouse\
    \ (Figure 4D). The amount of water applied \nis controlled by adjusting the speed\
    \ of the moving spray \nstructure. To eliminate the potential damages caused by\
    \ \nthe size of the droplets, nebulizer sprays should produce \nsmall droplets,\
    \ but with enough flow to cross the leaf \ncanopy and reach the substrate surface\
    \ (TESTEZLAF; \nFERRAREZI, 2017).\nNew, innovative irrigation methods are needed\
    \ to \nincrease irrigation efficiency and eliminate the drawbacks \nof overhead\
    \ irrigation. Subirrigation, an irrigation \nmethod that applies water to the\
    \ bottom of containers \nand allows for its recirculation, is already available\
    \ and \nis commercially used in other large plant production \nindustries, such\
    \ as those producing ornamental and woody \nspecies. This system induces the vertical\
    \ movement \nof water through the substrate by the capillary rise \nprinciple.\
    \ For comparative purposes, the data available \nin the literature indicate that\
    \ sprinkler irrigation has an \nirrigation efficiency of 9%, the drip and capillary\
    \ mats \nof 53%, and the subirrigation benches of 77% in the \ncultivation of\
    \ potted plants (NEAL; HENLEY, 1992). \nA high efficiency indicates that little\
    \ water is lost through \npercolation, reducing the leaching of nutrients into\
    \ the soil \nand reducing the potential of environmental contamination \nby salinization.\
    \ The advantages and disadvantages of \nthese technologies were described by Ferrarezi\
    \ et al. \n(2015). There are several types of subirrigation equipment \navailable\
    \ (FERRAREZI et al., 2015). The most widely \nused equipment is the ebb-and-flow\
    \ bench (Figure 1E), \nin which the benches are filled with water up to 1/3 of\
    \ the \ncontainer height. \nStudies on using ebb-and-flow subirrigation \nfor\
    \ citrus production were started in Brazil in 2005 at \nthe University of Campinas’s\
    \ School of Agricultural \nEngineering (Campinas, SP, Brazil), and have been \n\
    providing critical information regarding the use of \nthis system at a large scale.\
    \ These studies include the \ndetermination of the relationship between the water\
    \ level \nheight and the water retention time in the substrate in \nsubirrigation\
    \ systems (FERRAREZI et al., 2017a), and \nthe validation of operational parameters\
    \ for the use of \nsubirrigation benches (RIBEIRO et al., 2017). Studies \non\
    \ the effect of subirrigation on the production of citrus \nrootstock liners were\
    \ described by Ferrarezi & Testezlaf \n(2017a, 2017b). The results of these studies\
    \ demonstrated \nthat ebb-and-flow subirrigation could be successfully used \n\
    to produce ‘Rangpur’ lime liners, shortening the crop cycle \nby 30 days by anticipating\
    \ the time of transplantation for \ngrafting and allowing for the production of\
    \ Phytophthora-\nfree trees compared to when trees were irrigated \nmanually by\
    \ overhead irrigation using breaker nozzles. \nThe monitoring and operation of\
    \ this system was also \nsuccessfully automated using soil moisture sensors, \n\
    meaning that it is a promising piece of technology for use \nin optimizing citrus\
    \ nursery tree production.\nSolis et al. (2016) compared subirrigation benches\
    \ \nwith sprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation, and capillary \nmats in Florida,\
    \ USA, and observed similar production \nresults among all methods, but greater\
    \ water savings when \nusing subirrigation than the other methods. However, the\
    \ \ninvestment cost of drip irrigation is lower than those of \nsubirrigation\
    \ and manual irrigation. This is related to the \nlack of commercial equipment\
    \ currently available for the \napplication of subirrigation in citrus production\
    \ and the \nhigh initial cost for infrastructure installation. \nIrrigation of\
    \ rootstocks and grafted trees: In \naddition to manual overhead irrigation, the\
    \ most frequently \nused system for the production of nursery trees in citrus\
    \ \npots is drip irrigation using drippers with multiple outlets \nconnected to\
    \ microtubes, a system which is characterized \nby its simplicity of operation\
    \ and maintenance (Figure \n1E). This system can have one emitter with one- or\
    \ multi-\noutlet small tubes to route the water from the emitter to the \ntrees.\
    \ These small tubes are called distribution or spaghetti \ntubes and are usually\
    \ 1/4 or 1/8 of an inch in diameter \nand made of polyethylene or soft vinyl (TESTEZLAF;\
    \ \nFERRAREZI, 2017). \n18\nS. A. de Carvalho et al.\nRev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal,\

    \ general, a fertilizer solution \ncontaining the following concentration (in\
    \ mg/L) is \nconsidered balanced for the cultivation of citrus plants \nin substrate\
    \ using fertigation: N (200), P (18), K (152), \nCa (140), Mg (29), and S (21)\
    \ (BATAGLIA et al., 2008). \nHowever, information on the chemical composition\
    \ of \nthe irrigation water and substrate is important to make \nappropriate adjustments\
    \ to this nutrient solution and \ndetermine the concentrations of micronutrients\
    \ that should \nbe incorporated into the final fertilizer solution.\nPositive\
    \ effects of mineral nutrition on the \ngrowth of different rootstocks and grafted\
    \ trees have \nbeen obtained with the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal \nfungi and\
    \ other beneficial microorganisms (BOGAS et \nal., 2016; BACK et al., 2017; CARDOSO\

    \ 2004; WEBER et al., \n1990). However, despite its great potential, especially\
    \ for \nthe current model of citrus tree production system using \nsoilless substrates\
    \ and greater environmental control, there \nhave been no studies of the application\
    \ of these methods \nat a larger scale that can serves as references for their\

    Management of vectors, pests, and diseases: The \nuse of healthy trees produced\
    \ in a protected environment \n1973). Chemical analyses of foliar macronutrient\
    \ contents \nwere carried out in a reference population, based on which \nDRIS\
    \ indices were calculated and the optimum nutrition \nlevels were determined for\
    \ rootstocks and trees at different \nstages of development (Table 5). \nThe reference\
    \ standards of Bataglia et al. (2008) \nindicated that ‘Swingle’ citrumelo requires\
    \ higher \nconcentrations of N, Mg, and S when compared to other \nrootstocks\
    \ (Table 5). Grafted trees at the end of the first \ngrowth flush and before the\
    \ final pruning also had higher \nN and K concentrations, demonstrating the shoot’s\
    \ ability \nto control nutrient demand. A similar study with ‘Rangpur’ \nlime\
    \ and ‘Swingle’ citrumelo rootstocks ready for grafting \nin a commercial citrus\
    \ nursery showed that DRIS is \nefficient at establishing regional criteria for\
    \ nutrient \nsufficiency ranges (REZENDE et al., 2017). \n20\nS. A. de Carvalho\

    \ component of the current integrated pest \nmanagement used in citriculture.\
    \ In Brazil, this system \nstarted in the late 1990s and early 2000s in the state\
    \ of \nSão Paulo (SÃO PAULO, 2005a; 2005b) as a preventive \nmeasure against the\
    \ spread of CVC, and in later years \nit was also extended to other states for\
    \ the prevention \nof the CSD and HLB diseases. Current legal norms for \nthe\
    \ production of citrus nursery trees in São Paulo are \navailable in São Paulo\
    \ (2018a, 2018b, 2018c, 2018d). \nNursery trees must be free of CVC CSD, HLB,\
    \ \ncitrus canker, root-rot, and nematodes. These trees are \nregularly inspected\
    \ and monitored, and contaminated trees \nare destroyed. Production in a protected\
    \ environment does \nnot on its own guarantee that pest- and disease-free trees\
    \ \nwill be grown, and a series of additional measures are \nnecessary to guarantee\
    \ the protection of trees in addition \nto those previously discussed under the\
    \ topic of indexing. \nAlthough certain pests and diseases that affect citrus\
    \ trees \nare not legally restrictive of their commercialization, they \ncan still\
    \ cause economic or aesthetic damages. Considering \nthe high cost of production\
    \ and the strict regulations of \nthe citrus nursery industry, it is necessary\
    \ to identify \nthe occurrence of such problems early as a preventative \nmeasure.\
    \ The maintenance of a small-scale analytical lab \nin the nursery and the strict\
    \ control of agricultural inputs \nused in the nursery (irrigation water, fertilizer,\
    \ substrate, \nseeds, budwood, and rootstocks) are decisive tools to avoid \n\
    unexpected surprises. \nThe production of citrus trees in protected nurseries\
    \ \nusing anti-insect screens with 0.87 × 0.30 mm mesh is the \nmain preventive\
    \ measure against diseases transmitted by \ninsects. Target insects include: the\
    \ Asian citrus psyllid, a \nvector of Candidatus Liberibacter spp. Jagoueix et\
    \ al., \nthe bacteria associated with HLB; leafhoppers of the \nsubfamily Cicadellinae,\
    \ which transmit Xylella fastidiosa \nWells et al., 1987, the causal agent of\
    \ CVC, especially \nBucephalogonia xanthophis (Berg), which is more \nfrequent\
    \ in nurseries and among young plants; and the \nbrown citrus aphid, Toxoptera\
    \ citricida Kirkaldy, a vector \nof the CTV and CSD (PARRA et al., 2005). \nOther\
    \ measures have also been used to manage \nvectors in citrus nurseries, such as\
    \ the use of yellow sticky \ntraps in the antechambers to monitor the insects\
    \ that enter \nthere and the use of plastic in the nursery cover to block \nultraviolet\
    \ radiation, which may interfere with the ability \nof ACP to fly and find its\
    \ host (MIRANDA et al., 2015). \nThe drench application of imidacloprid and thiamethoxan\
    \ \nsystemic insecticides to the nursery trees a few days before \nplanting them\
    \ in the field controls ACP and other vectors \nfor up to 90 days (SANCHES et\
    \ al., 2009; MIRANDA \net al., 2016). \nThe pests regularly found inside citrus\
    \ nurseries \ninclude the citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton),\
    \ \nbroad mite [Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks)] \nthat infests seedbeds at\
    \ an especially high frequency, \nMexican mite [Tetranychus mexicanus (McGregor)],\
    \ \nTexan mite [Eutetranychus banksi (McGregor)], citrus \nred mite [Panonychus\
    \ citri (McGregor)], citrus rust mite \n[Phyllocoptruta oleivora (Ashmead)], citrus\
    \ bud mite \n(Aceria sheldoni Ewing), green scale [Coccus viridis \n(Green)],\
    \ citrus mealybug [Planococcus citri (Risso)], \ncottony cushion scale (Icerya\
    \ purchasi Maskell), rufous \nscale [Selenaspidus articulatus (Morgan)], and slugs\
    \ and \nsnails (BREMER NETO et al., 2015; CARVALHO et \nal., 2005; RODRIGUES and\
    \ OLIVEIRA, 2005). These \npests require constant monitoring, since they depreciate\
    \ \nthe commercial value of the nursery trees. Fungus gnat \n(Bradysia spp.) flies\
    \ are also a recurring problem in \nseedbeds as their very small, semi-transparent\
    \ white larvae \nfeed on the roots and root hairs of seedlings (CARVALHO \net\
    \ al., 2005).\nSince root-rot (Phytophthora spp.), including \nPhytophthora nicotianae\
    \ Breda de Haan (sin. P. \nparasitica) and P. citrophthora (R.E. Sm.; E.H. Sm.)\
    \ \nLeonian (LARANJEIRA et al., 2005), is the most \nimportant disease in citrus\
    \ nurseries, the citrus trees \nproduced should be Phytophthora-free. Surveys\
    \ carried \nout after the implementation of regulations to protect trees \nin\
    \ São Paulo indicated that the spread of Phytophthora \nspp. root-rot can be significant\
    \ in nurseries that do not use \npreventative control measures (SALVA, 2004; GRAHAM;\
    \ \nFEICHTENBERGER, 2015). Some nurseries have small \nlaboratories to analyze\
    \ samples collected throughout the \nproduction cycle to monitor for the presence\
    \ of diseases in \nsubstrate batches and in the nursery, promptly eliminating\
    \ \nany possible sources of fungal inoculum. The most \nfrequently used method\
    \ is the bait test, given its simplicity \nand low cost (SIVIERO et al., 2002).\
    \ Briefly, in this test \nthe substrate samples are inserted into a plastic cup\
    \ filled \nwith disinfected water. Healthy leaf discs of citrus are \nplaced on\
    \ the surface of the water, and the glass is covered \nwith plastic film and kept\
    \ under constant artificial lighting. \nAfter one week, the disks are collected\
    \ and analyzed under \na microscope for the observation of any hyphae, sporangia,\
    \ \nand zoospores of Phytophthora spp.\nOther diseases that may occur in protected\
    \ nurseries \nrequire rigorous preventive measures, including citrus \ncanker\
    \ (caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri); \ndamping-off (caused by Rhizoctonia\
    \ solani Kühn, and in \nsome cases by Pythium sp. and Fusarium sp.); albinism\
    \ \n(caused by Alternaria tenuis Nees and Aspergillus flavus \nLink); ‘Rangpur’\

    \ et al. and P. coffeae (Zimmermann) Goodey \n(LARANJEIRA et al., 2005; SANTOS\
    \ et al., 2005). \nFoliar spraying with metallic copper and other \nagrochemicals\
    \ does not guarantee the health of the young \ntrees, although some nurseries\
    \ do this as a preventive \n21\nAdvances in Citrus propagation in Brazil\nRev.\
    \ Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 6:  (e-422) \nmeasure. The disinfestation\
    \ of vehicles, tools, equipment, \nand utensils used in the nursery with a quaternary\
    \ \nammonia solution is much more effective, as well as the \ndisinfestation of\
    \ hands and footwear and the use of clean \nclothing. Restricted staffing traffic\
    \ and the use of healthy \npropagation materials (seeds, budwood, and rootstock\
    \ \nliners) are essential. Other prevention measures include \nthe use of localized\
    \ irrigation, keeping the canopy as dry \nas possible, especially for such young\
    \ susceptible tissues \nas new sprouts and graft shoots, to discourage the spread\
    \ \nof the disease and reinfection. Trees should be kept away \nfrom the side\
    \ screens to avoid rain splashes as well. \nAs discussed previously, the main\
    \ substrates used \nin the production of citrus nursery trees have a base of \n\
    composted pine bark and coconut fiber. Due to inadequate \ncomposting, macrofungi\
    \ can be present in commercial \nbatches. The basidiomycete Leucocoprinus birnbaumii\
    \ \n(Corda) Singer is the most common, producing yellow-\ncolored mushrooms, as\
    \ well as other species, such as the \ndung-loving bird’s nest mushroom Cyathus\
    \ stercoreus \n(Schwein.) De Toni, the white or skullcap dapperling \nmushroom\
    \ Leucocoprinus brebissonii (Godey) Locq., \nthe false truffle Agariaceae incertae\
    \ sedis, and the red \nmushroom Gymnopilus dilepis (Berk. & Broome) Singer \n\
    (AGUILAR-VILDOSO, 2009). These macrofungi \ngenerally do not cause direct damage\
    \ to the citrus plants; \nhowever, they induce substrate hydrophobicity, which\
    \ \nmeans the irrigation of the plants is not as effective, \nespecially after\
    \ transplanting them to the field, which \ncan cause decreased plant growth and\
    \ even tree death. \nChemical control should be used in association with the \n\
    manual elimination of fungal structures from the substrate. \nWeeds should be\
    \ avoided in the nursery because \nthey shelter citrus pests, cause commercial\
    \ depreciation, \nand compete for water and nutrients, reducing tree growth. \n\
    Oxalis corniculata L. and Cardamine bonariensis Pers. \nare the most frequent\
    \ weed species that grow on the same \nsubstrate as citrus nursery trees (ALVES,\
    \ 2007). Manual \nweeding is preferred over the use of herbicides due to the \n\
    risk of phytotoxicity to the citrus plants. \nNursery management tools\nThe management\
    \ of a citrus nursery is a complex \nactivity that involves planning, executing,\
    \ monitoring, \nand adjusting a series of interconnected processes and \nactivities.\
    \ In addition to the technical processes inherent to \ncitrus propagation related\
    \ to cultural practices, integrated \npest management, fertilization, and irrigation\
    \ decisions, \nthere are several administrative tasks involved, such as \nmarketing,\
    \ procurement, sales, inventory management, \npersonnel hiring, leadership, and\
    \ customer service. \nThe labor and input usage are the most important \ncomponents\
    \ in the cost management of nursery production \n(BREMER NETO et al., 2015). The\
    \ demand for these \nfactors depends on the evaluation of the production \nsystem\
    \ and its technical efficiency indicators, which \nrequires constant and accurate\
    \ data collection and analysis. \nIn addition to the production system, other\
    \ relevant \ncomponents of the management involve certification \nprograms, which\
    \ require a series of procedures to be \nundertaken by the nursery that often\
    \ require a more \nprofessional management strategy (INSTRUÇÃO, \n2017d). \nThe\
    \ technical management of the nursery should be \ncoordinated by integrated systems\
    \ capable of generating \nreports. Computer software can be used to plan and \n\
    monitor activities and to calculate production costs for \nprofessional business\
    \ administration. Some programs are \ncommercially available in the Brazilian\
    \ market, ranging \nfrom apps developed by small nurserymen to complex \nsystems\
    \ created by specialized companies. The latter \nare usually adapted from those\
    \ used in other farming \nactivities, in particular for the management of orange\
    \ \nproduction farms or nurseries of ornamental and other \ntree crops. Some examples\
    \ of software adapted for use \nin citrus nurseries are those developed by Altec\
    \ (Araras, \nSP, Brazil) (http://www.altec.inf.br) and by MasterPlanti \n(Curitiba,\
    \ Paraná, Brazil) (http://www.masterplanti.com.\nbr). Integrated computer-based\
    \ information systems \nhave been successfully developed for implementation in\
    \ \ntraceability and certification of the citrus nursery chains \nin Italy, and\
    \ also serve as an example for the application \nof such systems in this industry\
    \ segment in other citrus-\nproducing regions (PORTO et al., 2011, 2014).\n22\n\

    \   \nFinal considerations\nThe technological advances incorporated into citrus\
    \ \ntree production in protected nurseries to exclude vectors of \nCTV, CVC, and\
    \ most recently HLB, make it a formidable \nsystem for the production of high-quality\
    \ trees for \ncitriculture in Brazil, and in São Paulo state in particular. \n\
    Among the main elements of this innovative system, \nwe have highlighted its use\
    \ of healthy basic materials \nand pathogen-free water and substrates, as well\
    \ as the \ngreater control of production processes, with benefits to \ntree health.\
    \ The possibility of controlling environmental \nfactors with the use of plastic\
    \ covers and containers, and \nthe adequate management of fertilizer, phytosanitation,\
    \ \nand irrigation results in the production of rootstocks and \ngrafted trees\
    \ with outstanding quality in a shorter time in \ncomparison to the traditional,\
    \ unprotected field system. \nThe easiness of selection and standardization of\
    \ plants \nin containers, with transplanting performed without \ndisturbing the\
    \ root system, allows for the better survival \nof transplants in the field and\
    \ planting year-round. \nHowever, the production of citrus trees still presents\
    \ \nseveral challenges despite the many recent technical \nadvances made therein.\
    \ The system used in São Paulo \nstate has become a worldwide reference for citrus\
    \ tree \nproduction, but it has yet to be implemented nationwide \nin Brazil.\
    \ However, only its nationwide application \nwill be able to adequately contain\
    \ the dissemination \nand financial damage caused by diseases that threaten \n\
    Brazilian citriculture, especially in regions with limited \nlabor training.\n\
    In the coming years, the nursery industry should \nincrease the use of automation\
    \ in the different stages \nof basic material and tree production, with concurrent\
    \ \ndecreases in labor costs and lower risk to employees’ \nhealth. Nurserymen\
    \ should use micropropagation to \naccelerate the production of higher quality\
    \ trees at \nlower cost. The availability of new technologies, such \nas different\
    \ container types, especially related to those \nwith a smaller capacity that\
    \ combine the formation of \nhigh-performance nursery trees at less cost, as well\
    \ as \ndiversification and optimization of substrates, fertilizers, \nand products\
    \ to control pests and diseases, are also \nnecessary. The nursery industry needs\
    \ to have access to \nnew chemical and biological molecules to control pests \n\
    and diseases, and modern kits for the determination of \ngenetic origin and disease\
    \ diagnostic tools for rapid and \nreliable on-site testing. Finally, it is necessary\
    \ to improve \nthe management systems applied in the nurseries. \nThe longstanding\

    \x03\x04\x05\x06\a\nAbstract: Irrigated agriculture plays a fundamental role as\
    \ a supplier of food and raw materials.\nHowever, it is also the world’s largest\
    \ water user. In recent years, there has been an increase in the\nnumber of studies\
    \ analyzing agricultural irrigation from the perspective of sustainability with\
    \ a focus\non its environmental, economic, and social impacts. This study seeks\
    \ to analyze the dynamics of\nglobal research in sustainable irrigation in agriculture\
    \ between 1999 and 2018, including the main\nagents promoting it and the topics\
    \ that have received the most attention. To do this, a review and a\nbibliometric\
    \ analysis were carried out on a sample of 713 articles. The results show that\
    \ sustainability\nis a line of study that is becoming increasingly more prominent\
    \ within research in irrigation. The study\nalso reveals the existence of substantial\
    \ diﬀerences and preferred topics in the research undertaken by\ndiﬀerent countries.\
    \ The priority issues addressed in the research were climatic change, environmental\n\
    impact, and natural resources conservation; unconventional water resources; irrigation\
    \ technology\nand innovation; and water use eﬃciency. Finally, the ﬁndings indicate\
    \ a series of areas related to\nsustainable irrigation in agriculture in which\
    \ research should be promoted.\nKeywords: sustainable irrigation; bibliometric\
    \ analysis; climate change; innovation and technology;\nwater use eﬃciency; unconventional\
    \ water resources\n1. Introduction\nThe current global context is conditioned\
    \ by the growth of the world’s population and the\nprogressive and continuous\
    \ deterioration of the environment. This creates the challenge of ensuring\nthe\
    \ supply of basic resources, such as food and water, and sustainable development\
    \ [1], where water\nplays an essential role in the survival of human society [2]\
    \ and contributes to the provision of a wide\nrange of services on which the wellbeing\
    \ of society is based [3–5]. However, water resources are\nsubject to severe degradation\
    \ due to many factors, such as the consequences of global climate change,\nalterations\
    \ in the use of land, agricultural and urban expansion, and overexploitation due\
    \ to economic\ndevelopment [6–8]. In parallel with this degradation and overexploitation\
    \ of ecosystems and water\nresources, the demand for the services supplied by\
    \ these resources is expected to increase.\nAgricultural ecosystems are the principal\
    \ suppliers of food, but they are also the main users of\nwater resources on a\
    \ global level [9,10]. These ecosystems use between 60% and 90% of the available\n\
    water, depending on the climate and economic development of the region [11,12].\
    \ The global area\ndedicated to irrigated crops is estimated to be 275 million\
    \ hectares, with an upward growth trend of\n1.3% per year [13]. This accounts\
    \ for just 23% of farmed land; however, 45% of total food production is\nobtained\
    \ through these types of crops [14,15]. It has been estimated that in order to\
    \ satisfy the food\nWater 2019, 11, 1758; doi:10.3390/w11091758\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/water\n\
    Water 2019, 11, 1758\n2 of 26\ndemand in 2050, world production must increase\
    \ by 70% [16]. In a scenario of low production, in order\nto fulﬁl this objective,\
    \ it will be necessary to increase the use of water resources on a global level\
    \ by\n53% [17]—around 50% in developing countries and 16% in developed countries\
    \ [18]—keeping the\ncurrent values of variables like productivity and technology.\n\
    Currently, diﬀerent approaches are being used to address the challenges of food\
    \ provision and the\nsupply of water for diﬀerent uses and to maintain an environmental\
    \ balance. Some works point to the\ndevelopment of measures to control demand\
    \ so that irrigation water sustainability can be reached.\nThe development of\
    \ eﬃcient water markets can be an optimal measure in underdeveloped areas and\n\
    with a high level of water scarcity, like in South Africa [19,20]. The implementation\
    \ of joint restrictions\nbased on the establishment of quotas and the payment\
    \ of fees can be an eﬀective control system for the\nuse of agriculture water\
    \ in developed regions specialized in the production of high-quality crops and\n\
    where overexploitation of water resources is currently taking place [21]. Regarding\
    \ water supply, many\nauthors recommend the joint use of diﬀerent water resources\
    \ and the development of infrastructures as\nnonconventional water sources [22,23].\
    \ Another line of research is focused on the improvement of the\neﬃciency of water\
    \ use and the development of clean production models that guarantee sustainability\n\
    from social and economic perspectives [24,25]. In order to achieve this objective,\
    \ the whole irrigation\nprocess must be analyzed. This process covers diﬀerent\
    \ phases beginning with the water source and\nending with its use for agriculture.\
    \ Zhang et al. [26] identiﬁed three phases in irrigation: The ﬁrst\nincludes the\
    \ extraction of water from the source and its transfer through channels to the\
    \ point of use;\nthe second consists of the distribution of the water to the root\
    \ system to facilitate its absorption by crops\n(this includes both traditional\
    \ irrigation using ﬂoods and furrows and modern irrigation through drip\nsystems\
    \ and microsprinklers); and the third covers the whole crop-growing process, whereby\
    \ the water\nis transported from the roots to the rest of the plant. The goal\
    \ is to save resources through minimizing\nwater losses during these three phases\
    \ and to improve the eﬃciency in the use of water resources.\nThe so-called “Science\
    \ of Sustainability” also studies how to address these challenges. It is deﬁned\n\
    as “a discipline that points the way towards a sustainable society” and is “aimed\
    \ at understanding\nthe fundamental character of interactions between natural,\
    \ human, and social systems, covers a wide\nrange of academic disciplines”, for\
    \ the development of agricultural systems and the sustainable use of\nwater [27–29].\
    \ At the end of the 1990s, sustainability was used as a characteristic to describe\
    \ ecosystems,\nreferring to the capacity to maintain the ﬂow of services in diﬀerent\
    \ environmental, economic, and social\ncontexts [30]. When it is applied to the\
    \ management of water resources in agriculture, sustainability\nis considered\
    \ to be a series of practices that increase crop yield and minimize water losses\
    \ [31]. The\nobjectives of the sustainable management of water resources in agriculture\
    \ consider the continuity of\nthe agricultural system from physical and biological\
    \ perspectives, as well as the economic eﬃciency of\nthe use of the resources\
    \ and social participation in the decision-making processes [32]. An evaluation\n\
    of a change in water use requires, therefore, a multidisciplinary approach that\
    \ includes an analysis of\nthe body of water under study in order to understand\
    \ the possible impacts on the quantity and quality\nof the water and the timetable\
    \ of the diﬀerent uses. A comprehensive evaluation of the marginal\nproductivity\
    \ of water is also required, together with an analysis of its nonmarketable value,\
    \ such as\nthat derived from ecosystem services [33].\nIn recent years, there\
    \ has been an increase in the number of studies analyzing agricultural\nirrigation\
    \ from the perspective of sustainability with a focus on its environmental, economic,\
    \ and social\nimpacts. The objective of this study is to analyze the dynamics\
    \ of the research on sustainable irrigation\nin agriculture over the last twenty\
    \ years. In order to fulﬁl this objective, a two-fold analysis was\nundertaken:\
    \ quantitatively through a bibliometric analysis; and qualitatively through a\
    \ systemic review\nbased on keyword analysis. The study analyzes the evolution\
    \ of the number of articles published, the\nmain authors, institutions and countries\
    \ that promote this research ﬁeld, the disciplines involved in the\nresearch,\
    \ the main lines of research, the diﬀerences in academic approach and the countries\
    \ considered,\nand the main issues that aﬀect the research in this ﬁeld.\nWater\
    \ 2019, 11, 1758\n3 of 26\nBibliometric analysis was introduced by Garﬁeld in\
    \ the 1950s [34], and its objective is to identify,\nclassify, and evaluate the\
    \ principal components within a speciﬁc research ﬁeld [35]. Bibliometry\ncombines\
    \ tools of quantitative analysis to study the trends of a research topic and identify\
    \ the main\ndriving agents and the relevance of their publications [36,37]. In\
    \ bibliometric analyses, three types\nof indicators can be distinguished, which\
    \ were deﬁned by Durieux and Gevenois [38]: productivity\nindicators, relevance\
    \ indicators, and structural indicators. In addition to these indicators, diﬀerent\n\
    approaches exist in bibliometric analysis. Co-occurrence, co-citation, and bibliographic\
    \ coupling\nanalysis are among the traditional approaches. This extended methodology\
    \ can be considered as\na new one in some research areas. This has also continuously\
    \ been developing. In this sense, this\nwork introduces some new methodological\
    \ aspects which provide a contribution regarding previous\nworks—in fact, the\
    \ sample search process, a mixed quantitative and qualitative review, and the\n\
    production of keyword networks to identify main trends per country. The results\
    \ of this study provide\na basis on which to establish priorities and to develop\
    \ new projects in future research on this topic.\n2. Methodology\nIn order to\
    \ conduct this study, a traditional approach based on co-occurrence was selected,\n\
    which included the assessment of productivity, quality, and structural indicators.\
    \ In this approach,\nﬁrst, the agents with the highest number of publications\
    \ were identiﬁed, and second, the impact of\nthe publications of these authors\
    \ was analyzed. This type of analysis, particularly with respect to\njournals,\
    \ is highly interesting for researchers, given that it constitutes a way to assess\
    \ the relevance\nof the journals in which authors publish their studies [39].\
    \ Finally, we used mapping techniques to\nanalyze the structure of the network\
    \ between diﬀerent agents. The Scopus database was used to select\nthe sample\
    \ of studies to analyze. This database has proven to be the most suitable for\
    \ our area of\nstudy, enabling us to ensure the selection of a representative\
    \ sample of the studies carried out on\nsustainable irrigation (SI). Furthermore,\
    \ it is easy to access, allows the visualization and analysis of\ndata, and allows\
    \ data to be downloaded in diﬀerent formats for subsequent processing using software\n\
    applications [40]. Nevertheless, if some works on SI are not indexed in the Scopus\
    \ database, they have\nnot been considered in our sample.\nThe term used to carry\
    \ out the search was “sustainable irrigation”, and this selection was based on\n\
    previous studies on the same topic [41–43]. This term was searched for under authors’\
    \ keywords and\ntitles. The study period selected was 1999 to 2018. Research activity\
    \ in this topic peaked during these\nyears. Furthermore, this period immediately\
    \ followed the 1st World Water Forum held in Marrakesh\nin 1997, which is considered\
    \ to be one of the main landmarks in this ﬁeld. Only documents until 2018\nwere\
    \ included so that complete annual periods could be compared. In order to avoid\
    \ duplication, the\nsample only included original articles [44]. It is worth pointing\
    \ out that a diﬀerent search query could\ngive rise to diﬀerent results. The search\
    \ was carried out in January 2019. The sample of this study was\ncomposed of 713\
    \ articles. In addition, a search of articles on “irrigation” was also carried\
    \ out with the\nsame restrictions in order to analyze the relative importance\
    \ of sustainability within this general theme.\nFigure 1 shows an outline of the\
    \ methodology on which this study was based.\nThe analyzed variables were the\
    \ number of articles, their years of publication, all of the authors\nof the articles,\
    \ the institutions and countries of all of the authors, the subject areas in which\
    \ Scopus\nclassiﬁes the studies, the name of the journals in which they were published,\
    \ and the keywords. After\ndownloading this information, the ﬁrst task was to\
    \ eliminate duplications. The names of authors and\ninstitutions can be found\
    \ in diﬀerent formats. This can lead to errors when counting these records.\n\
    Therefore, these two variables were analyzed, and the diﬀerent records were regrouped\
    \ so that the\nsame author and institution were not counted more than once. Once\
    \ the information had been reﬁned,\ndiﬀerent tables and ﬁgures were drawn up,\
    \ and the analysis of the data was conducted. The programs\nused were Excel (version\
    \ 2016) and SciMAT (v1.1.04) (University of Granada, Granada, Spain). The\ntool\
    \ used to create the network maps was VOSviewer, which is widely used in this\
    \ type of study [42].\nFinally, keyword analysis was used to extract the principal\
    \ research trends [45]. The terms were\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n4 of 26\nregrouped\
    \ in order to eliminate duplications due to plurals, hyphens, words in upper case\
    \ letters,\netc. For the grouping of keywords by topics, standardized grouping\
    \ algorithms were used with the\nfollowing tools: Vosviewer (Association strength)\
    \ and SciMAT (network analysis).\nAs for the methodology, this work includes some\
    \ novel aspects compared to previous studies \ndealing with a similar topic. Firstly,\
    \ regarding the sample selection of articles to be analyzed, some \nprevious studies\
    \ made a search based on titles, abstracts, and keywords [41–43,46,47]. In this\
    \ work, \nthe search was conducted in the fields of title and authors’ keywords.\
    \ Furthermore, before getting \nthe final sample, it was checked that all included\
    \ articles were related to the actual SI research. \nSecondly, most works on bibliometric\
    \ reviews include the analysis of keywords. Nevertheless, this is \nthe first\
    \ search analysis which aims at detecting SI research trends based on the disciplinary\
    \ approach \nof the study and the country where the research was conducted. Finally,\
    \ the work includes a \nquantitative review based on a bibliometric analysis,\
    \ as well as a qualitative one based on the \ntraditional review.  \n \nFigure\

    \ (SI) \nTable 1 shows the evolution of the main variables related to research\
    \ on SI during the period \n1999–2018. During the studied period, relevant events\
    \ like international declarations and congresses \ndecisively influenced on the\
    \ sustainability research. The Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 2008), which \ncommits\
    \ world countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, should be highlighted, as\
    \ well as the \nEconomics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity of 2010; the Rio +20\

    \ which provides guidelines for improving livelihoods and \nthe environment globally;\
    \ or the Paris Agreement on Climate Change of 2016; among others. These \nhappenings\
    \ additionally stimulate research on this topic [48]. This could also explain\
    \ the existence of \npeaks regarding the publication of articles on SI research,\
    \ like in 2017. A further reason explaining \nthe higher number of published articles\
    \ in 2017 compared to 2018 is that the sample selection was \nconducted in January\
    \ 2019. The Scopus database updates itself continuously and, at the time of the\
    \ \nsample search, not all published articles in 2018 had been registered. If\
    \ the sample selection were to \nbe performed at the end of 2019, the number of\
    \ published and indexed articles on SI in Scopus in \n2018 would increase. \n\

    \ categories related to SI research.\nThe keyword analysis revealed that there\
    \ is a series of commonly used terms in research on SI,\nirrespective of the approach\
    \ of the study. These terms include, among others, agriculture, alternative\n\
    agriculture, climate change, crops, groundwater, irrigation system, salinity,\
    \ sustainable development,\nwater conservation, water management, water resources,\
    \ water supply, water use, water use eﬃciency,\nand water quality. When we took\
    \ the analysis beyond these terms, we identiﬁed a group of keywords\nused speciﬁcally\
    \ by each discipline.\nIn the studies classiﬁed in the category of Environmental\
    \ Sciences, there was an emphasis on\nthe state of the soil (soils, soil moisture),\
    \ aquifers, and surface water. With respect to processes, from\nWater 2019, 11,\
    \ 1758\n7 of 26\nthe environmental approach, recycling and wastewater reclamation\
    \ were prominent. In terms of\nmethodology, the keywords that stood out were numerical\
    \ model and decision making, particularly\nrelated to the management of the available\
    \ water resources (water budget, water availability). With\nregard to the geographical\
    \ dimension, China, the United States, and India were particularly prominent,\n\
    as were the regions of Eurasia and Asia.\nIn the studies classiﬁed within the\
    \ category of Agricultural and Biological Sciences, technical\nterms were predominant.\
    \ Studies in this category mostly focused on soils and groundwater. There\nwas\
    \ particular emphasis on diﬀerent types of crops (Triticum aestivum, Zea mays,\
    \ fruit, Gossypium\nhirsutum, and rice) and irrigation processes (deﬁcit irrigation,\
    \ drainage, drip irrigation, leaching,\nwaterlogging, agricultural irrigation).\
    \ Furthermore, from the agronomic perspective, the environmental\ndimension was\
    \ also considered (Environmental Impact). In these studies, China and the United\
    \ States\nstood out, together with the regions of Africa and Asia.\nThe studies\
    \ carried out from a Social Sciences approach had a more multidisciplinary perspective.\n\
    They focused primarily on the stakeholders, water demands, and food security.\
    \ However, technical\nconcepts were also prominent, particularly those related\
    \ to irrigation and water management (drip\nirrigation, sustainable water management),\
    \ crops (Triticum aestivum), and economics (water economics).\nUnlike the over\
    \ categories, land use was found to be one of the prominent subjects of this group\
    \ of\nstudies. A focus on management and decision making at diﬀerent levels was\
    \ also characteristic of\nthese studies (governance approach, water planning,\
    \ policy making, resource management, decision\nsupport system). With respect\
    \ to geographical distribution, the United States, China, India, Spain,\nand Australia\
    \ were among the most cited countries, and Asia, Europe and Africa stood out on\
    \ a\nregional level.\nFinally, the studies carried out based on an economic approach\
    \ (Economic Sciences) were\nthe most multidisciplinary, including technical, social,\
    \ and environmental aspects.\nAmong the\nmain themes analyzed in these studies,\
    \ we found food supply, food security, the development and\ninnovation of irrigation\
    \ systems (agricultural technology, irrigation performance) and management\nprocesses\
    \ (integrated resource management, managed change, project management, strategic\
    \ change,\nstrategic management, strategic planning, decision making), and issues\
    \ related to economic and social\nmanagement (eﬃciency, investment, performance,\
    \ economic and social eﬀects) and the environment\n(environmental impact, environmental\
    \ sustainability).\n3.3. Most Relevant Journals in the Research on SI\nTable 2\
    \ shows the main characteristics of the most proliﬁc journals in the ﬁeld of SI.\
    \ The group of\njournals with the highest number of articles published on SI accounted\
    \ for 25.7% of the total articles in\nthe sample. This indicates that there is\
    \ a high level of dispersion in terms of the journals that publish\narticles on\
    \ this subject area. The leading journal in terms of the total number of articles\
    \ published\nduring the whole period analyzed was Agricultural Water Management,\
    \ with a total of 52 articles on SI.\nThis journal has the highest H index and\
    \ the most citations of the journals with articles published in\nthis area, and\
    \ a Scimago journal rank (SJR) factor of 1.272. It published its ﬁrst issue on\
    \ this subject in\n2001. Since then, it has remained among the top positions in\
    \ terms of the number of articles published\non SI, becoming the leader in 2014.\
    \ The journal in second place was Irrigation and Drainage, with a total\nof 30\
    \ articles on SI. This journal published its ﬁrst article on SI in 2001 and was\
    \ the most proliﬁc journal\nuntil 2005. It has the second highest H index, an\
    \ average of 10.4 citations per article and an SJR index\nof 0.342. The third\
    \ journal was Sustainability, with 17 articles on SI. This journal is among the\
    \ most\nrecently incorporated journals, as its ﬁrst article on SI was published\
    \ in 2013. However, in only ﬁve\nyears, it rose to third position in terms of\
    \ the number of articles for the whole of the period of study. It\nhas an average\
    \ of 3.8 citations per article, an H index of 6 and an SJR of 0.537. The journal\
    \ with the\nhighest average number of citations per article was Science of the\
    \ Total Environment with 33.8; followed\nby the Journal of Hydrology with 31.5\
    \ and Water Resources Management with 29.4.\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n8 of 26\nTable\

    Table 3 shows the principle characteristics of the articles on SI from the most\
    \ proliﬁc countries.\nDuring the analyzed period, the United States was the leading\
    \ country in research on SI in terms of the\nnumber of articles, with a total\
    \ of 143. The country with the second highest number of articles was\nIndia, with\
    \ a total of 74. This was followed by Australia with 67, Spain with 61, and Italy\
    \ with 55. Due\nto the diﬀerences in terms of the size and economic development\
    \ of the diﬀerent countries, these data\nwere analyzed to determine the number\
    \ of articles per capita, measured as the number of articles per\nmillion inhabitants.\
    \ Based on this variable, Australia was shown to be the most productive country\n\
    with 2.7 articles per million inhabitants. This was followed by the Netherlands\
    \ with 1.5, Spain with\n1.3, Italy with 0.9, and the United Kingdom with 0.8.\

    \ per country has been included in the last\ncolumn of the table, as well as the\
    \ position they have in the world ranking regarding this variable. It can\nbe\
    \ stated that these countries do not occupy leading positions as far as irrigation-equipped\
    \ cultivated\nland is concerned. From the available information about 177 countries,\
    \ Japan is the country with the\nhighest percentage of irrigation-equipped land\
    \ surface—54.96%—, reaching the 25th place—followed\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n9 of\

    \ with 46.85% (31st\nplace). However, some countries leading research on SI place\
    \ themselves on lower positions within the\nirrigation-equipped cultivated surface\
    \ ranking. This is the case for the USA with 16.94% (72nd place),\nAustralia with\
    \ 5.72% (110th place), or the UK with 3.41% (126th place).\nTable 4 shows the\
    \ principal variables related to the international collaboration of countries\
    \ with\nthe highest numbers of articles. The average percentage of articles carried\
    \ out through international\ncollaboration was 50.3%. The countries with the highest\
    \ percentage of studies carried out in collaboration\nwere Canada with 81.8%,\
    \ France with 79.3%, Germany with 75.1%, the Netherlands with 65.4%, and\nChina\
    \ with 55.8%. The United States was found to have the largest collaboration network,\
    \ with 33\ndiﬀerent collaborators. In addition, similarly to Australia, this country\
    \ forms part of the group of the\nmain collaborators of 10 of the 15 countries\
    \ in the table. These data reveal the global nature of research\nin this subject\
    \ area, with very high percentages and extensive collaboration networks on a global\
    \ level.\nThe majority of the countries obtained a higher average number of citations\
    \ per article when they\nworked in collaboration with other countries. The articles\
    \ produced through collaboration obtained an\naverage of 14.6 citations as opposed\
    \ to 13.5 citations of noncollaborative articles. When comparing\nthese results\
    \ to those of related works on irrigation and water [37,39,48], it can be observed\
    \ that studies\non sustainability trigger a higher level of international cooperation.\n\

    \ were found to place more emphasis on new alternative agriculture systems\n(alternative-agriculture)\
    \ and the agricultural activity in arid areas (arid-regions) on an ecosystem\n\
    level (ecosystems). Agronomic aspects such as the nutrition and fertilization\
    \ of crops (fertilizers,\nnutrient) and their productivity (crop-yield, productivity)\
    \ were also prominent. Both surface and\ngroundwater were studied (surface-water),\
    \ as was the planning and development of irrigation projects\nfor optimizing the\
    \ resource (irrigation-planning, irrigation-project, optimization), with particular\n\
    emphasis on irrigation processes (drainage, waterlogging, water-table) and alternative\
    \ water sources\n(wastewater). The term most used in relation to methodology was\
    \ numerical model (numerical-model),\nand with regard to crops, the most used\
    \ terms were rice and vegetables (rice, vegetables). Prominent\ngeographical terms,\
    \ such as the State of Maharashtra or the region of South Asia, were identiﬁed.\n\
    The studies conducted in Australia covered food supply (food-supply), runoﬀ (runoﬀ),\n\
    and environmental protection (environmental-protection).\nAgronomic issues, such\
    \ as crop\nevapotranspiration (evapotranspiration) and irrigation eﬃciency (irrigation-eﬃciency),\
    \ were prominent.\nWith respect to water resources, particular emphasis was placed\
    \ on the availability of the resources, the\nwater budget (water-availability,\
    \ water-budget), and the use of alternative sources through recycling\nand wastewater\
    \ treatment (wastewater, water-treatment, recycling). From a methodological point\n\
    of view, the hydrological and geological approaches were prominent (hydrology,\
    \ hydrogeology), as\nwere controlled studies (controlled-study), and in terms\
    \ of crops, the prominent term was rice (rice).\nNoteworthy geographical terms,\
    \ such as the basin of the river Murray–Darling (Murray-Darling-basin),\nthe region\
    \ of Australasia and the country of Canada, were identiﬁed.\nIn the case of Spain,\n\
    relevant topics were the management of the use of energy\nresources (energy-eﬃciency,\
    \ energy-resources), the productivity of water (water-productivity),\neﬃciency\n\
    (eﬃciency),\nsemiarid\nregions\n(semiarid-regions),\nand\nenvironmental\nprotection\n\
    (environmental-protection). Agronomic issues such as soil moisture (soil-moisture)\
    \ were prominent,\nas were innovations in agricultural and irrigation systems\
    \ (alternative-agriculture, irrigation-networks,\ndrip-irrigation, deﬁcit-irrigation)\
    \ and irrigation eﬃciency (irrigation-eﬃciency).\nIn terms of\nmethodology, the\
    \ economic approach was prominent (water-economics, economic-analysis,\nproﬁtability),\
    \ as was the social approach (stakeholders, decision-support-systems). With respect\n\
    to crops, fruit was the most relevant term (fruit). Noteworthy geographical terms,\
    \ such as the regions\nof Southern Europe and Eurasia (Southern-Europe, Europe,\
    \ Eurasia), were identiﬁed.\nThe studies conducted in Italy were similar to those\
    \ conducted in Spain. The main diﬀerences\nwere found in certain agronomic terms\
    \ related to crops (crop-yield, dicotyledon, stomatal-conductance,\nstem-water-potential)\
    \ or irrigation (drainage, soil-moisture). The studies were carried out on a farm\n\
    level (farms, orchard) and focused on the Mediterranean environment. In terms\
    \ of methodology, the\nnumerical models focused on decision making (decision-making)\
    \ were noteworthy. With respect to\ncrops, as well as fruit (fruit), Zea mays\
    \ was also prominent. The central themes included water stress\n(water-stress),\
    \ the environmental impact (environmental-impact), and forestry (forestry).\n\
    The articles conducted in China placed greater emphasis on environmental protection\n\
    (environmental-protection), agricultural activity in arid regions (arid-regions),\
    \ decision-making\nprocesses (decision-making), and issues at the district level\
    \ (irrigation-district). Agronomic issues\nsuch as crop evapotranspiration (evapotranspiration)\
    \ and crop productivity (crop-yield) were also\nprominent. With respect to water,\
    \ the central theme was the level of water resources (water-level), while\nin\
    \ the methodological area, hydrogeological models were prominent (hydrogeological-modelling).\n\
    With respect to crops, rice, corn maize and wheat were found to be noteworthy\
    \ (rice, Zea-mays,\nTriticum-aestivum, maize). The most prominent geographical\
    \ terms were the regions of the North\nChina Plain and Xinjiang Uygur.\nThe central\
    \ themes in the studies conducted in the United Kingdom were crop yield (crop-yield);\n\
    the environment and the assessment of the environmental impact (environment, environmental-impact),\n\
    particularly in arid regions (arid-regions); and hydrocarbon (hydrocarbon). Processes\
    \ related to water\nand irrigation, such as drainage (drainage), runoﬀ (runoﬀ),\
    \ and the recycling of water in wetlands\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n13 of 26\nand\
    \ wastewater treatment (water-treatment, wastewater, wetlands-recycling), stood\
    \ out. The most\nprominent term related to methodology was cost beneﬁt analysis\
    \ (cost-beneﬁt-analysis), and in terms\nof crops, the study of rice was predominant\
    \ (rice). This may be due to the country’s connection with\nAsian countries (Asia,\
    \ Eurasia, and South Asia).\nThe articles conducted in Germany, as in the case\
    \ of other countries, were conditioned by its\ncollaborative ties with other nations.\
    \ The main themes included food supply and food security\n(food-supply, food security);\
    \ the new alternative agricultural systems and the intensiﬁcation of\nagricultural\
    \ activity (alternative-agriculture, agricultural-intensiﬁcation); agricultural\
    \ activity in arid\nregions (arid-regions, oasis); and the eﬀects of agricultural\
    \ activity on economic and social levels and\nenvironmental pollution (economic-and-social-eﬀects,\
    \ greenhouse-gas, particle-size). The prominent\nagronomic aspects were fertilizers\
    \ (fertilizers), leaching (leaching), and drip irrigation (drip-irrigation).\n\
    The most commonly used term with respect to methodology was related to the study\
    \ of the eﬀects\nof climate change: climate models (climate-models). Further ﬁelds\
    \ of interest are common pool\nresources; and, with respect to crops, studies\
    \ on wheat (Triticum-aestivum). One of Germany’s\nprincipal collaborators was\
    \ China, which is why this country appeared prominently among the\nkeywords of\
    \ German studies. Similarly, Uzbekistan is one of Germany’s main trading partners\
    \ and\nalso appears among the keywords.\nThe studies carried out in France particularly\
    \ focused on the policy and institutional\ndimension (environmental-policy, decision-making,\
    \ governance-approach, public-private-partnership,\npricing-policy). French studies\
    \ analyzed the level of exploitation (farming-system) and contemplated\nthe diﬀerent\
    \ agents involved (stakeholders).\nThe priority issues included the overexploitation\n\
    of groundwater and surface water (groundwater-overexploitation, surface-water);\
    \ the chemical\ncomposition (chemical-composition); crop evapotranspiration (evapotranspiration)\
    \ and the response\nto possible alterations (ecophysiological-responses); and\
    \ deﬁcit irrigation (deﬁcit-irrigation).\nIn\nterms of methodology, dynamic models\
    \ and linear programming were prominent (dynamic-model,\nlinear-programming),\
    \ together with economic issues related to water (water-economics).\nStudies conducted\
    \ in Japan considered issues such as the development of irrigation,\nparticularly\
    \ through participative processes on both institutional and irrigation water user\n\
    levels (irrigation-development, water-users’-organization, participatory-irrigation-management,\n\
    institutional-development, water-policy). The Japanese studies analyzed aspects\
    \ related to the salinity\nof irrigation water and soil (saline-water-irrigation,\
    \ soil-water-salinity) and the electrical conductivity\nof water (electrical-conductivity).\
    \ Water shortages due to drought, particularly in semiarid regions,\nwere also\
    \ found to be relevant issues (drought, semi-arid-region). The studies from this\
    \ country\nanalyzed the use of rainwater as a source for irrigation (rainfall).\
    \ It is the country with the highest\nnumber of crops, and the study of the sustainable\
    \ production of rice was found to be particularly\nrelevant (sustainable-rice-production,\
    \ Triticum-aestivum, Zea-mays, sorghum, sorghum-bicolour).\nIn the Netherlands,\
    \ the primary topics identiﬁed were the management and development\nof agriculture,\
    \ particularly towards the use of new alternative systems (agricultural-development,\n\
    agricultural-management, alternative-agriculture), and there was special emphasis\
    \ on the extension of\nagricultural practices (agricultural-extension). Other\
    \ subject areas of many of this country’s studies\nwere the security and production\
    \ of food (food-supply, food-production). The crop that is most\nstudied was wheat\
    \ (Triticum-aestivum). The articles focused on groundwater and rainwater with\n\
    respect to water resources (well, groundwater-abstraction, rain), recirculation\
    \ processes and network\ndevelopment (drainage, recirculations, networking-system)\
    \ and the studies on the level of the basins\nwere predominant (catchments). On\
    \ a social level, the point of view of the small farmers (smallholders)\nwas given\
    \ special attention, particularly in relation to the decision-making processes\
    \ (decision-making).\nThe studies conducted in Brazil contemplated the environmental\
    \ impacts (environmental-impact),\nwater\navailability\n(water-availability),\n\
    and\nthe\nexpansion\nof\nthe\nagricultural\nactivity\n(agricultural-expansion).\n\
    With respect to crop processes,\nevapotranspiration,\nmetabolism,\nsustainable\
    \ production, and carbon dioxide were prominent (carbon-dioxide, sustainable-production,\n\
    Water 2019, 11, 1758\n14 of 26\nevapotranspiration, metabolism). This country\
    \ has published a large number of studies on the use of\nrainwater for irrigation\
    \ (rainwater). Particularly noteworthy is the research on crops related to the\n\
    use of biomass for diﬀerent purposes (biofuel, bioenergy, biomass-power, sugar-cane,\
    \ glycine-max,\nsaccharum-oﬃcinarum). On a geographic level, studies in the region\
    \ of Cerrado were predominant.\nAdditionally, the most prominent methodological\
    \ approach was found to be chemistry (chemistry).\nIn Canada, the most relevant\
    \ themes were the new forms of agriculture (alternative-agriculture),\nenvironmental\
    \ protection (environmental-protection), food security (food-security, food-production),\n\
    and decision making (decision-making, water-policies). The global perspective\
    \ of this line of research\n(global-perspective) was found to be noteworthy. From\
    \ a methodological point of view, the sensitivity\nmodels, stochastic programming,\
    \ and uncertainty analysis were prominent (sensitivity-analysis,\nstochastic-programming,\
    \ uncertainty-analysis). The predominant terms with respect to water were\nwater\
    \ availability, water stress, and water sharing. With regard to crops, wheat and\
    \ cotton stood out\n(Gossypium-hirsutum, Triticum-aestivum).\nIn the case of Iran,\
    \ concern for the food supply was found to be prominent, despite its relationship\n\
    with the FAO—Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (food-supply,\
    \ FAO, crop-yield).\nOn a methodological level, genetic algorithms stood out (genetic-algorithm),\
    \ together with processes\nfor optimizing decisions (optimum-decision), and Bayesian\
    \ networks (Bayesian-networks). The\neconomic and social levels were represented\
    \ through the motivation of farmers and the assessment of\nthe economic and social\
    \ eﬀects (economic-and-social-eﬀects, farmers-motivation). In the agronomic\n\
    ﬁeld, cropping patterns and the use of untreated wastewater were priority areas\
    \ (cropping-pattern,\nuntreated-wastewater-irrigation). In addition to wastewater,\
    \ the combined integral use of surface\nwater, recycled water, and rainwater for\
    \ irrigation was prominent (rainfall, surface-water-resources,\nrecycling).\n\
    Finally, the articles from South Africa were based on controlled studies, geographical\n\
    information systems, and computer simulations (computer-simulation, simulation,\
    \ controlled-study,\nGIS). The environmental impacts (environmental-impact), particularly\
    \ those related to the use\nof mine water and wastewater (mine-water, wastewater);\
    \ food supply (food-supply); project\nmanagement (project-management); and the\
    \ economic and social eﬀects related to irrigation\n(economic-and-social-eﬀects)\
    \ were priority themes.\nWith respect to the agronomic dimension,\nthe evapotranspiration\
    \ processes, drought, electric conductivity, and water balance stood out\n(evapotranspiration,\
    \ drought, electric-conductivity, water-balance).\n3.5. Most Relevant Institutions\

    Table 7 shows the main characteristics of the authors who have produced the highest\
    \ numbers\nof articles on SI. A large number of authors published articles on\
    \ SI within the study period, but the\nnumber of publications per author was small.\
    \ The three authors with the most articles were Henning\nBjornlund from the University\
    \ of South Australia, Bartolomeo Dichio from the Università degli Studi\ndella\
    \ Basilicata, and Ajay Kumar R. Singh from the Indian Institute of Technology\
    \ Kharagpur. Although\nthey published the same number of articles, there were\
    \ large diﬀerences in terms of the relevance of the\npublications of the diﬀerent\
    \ authors. Bjornlund has a total of 20 citations for his articles, Dichio 11,\
    \ and\nSingh 145. James D. Oster of the University of California was the author\

    \ 11, 1758\n17 of 26\n3.7. Main Issues in SI Research\nThe most relevant issues\
    \ in SI research were determined based on the analysis of keywords.\nThese issues\
    \ included the concern for the state of natural resources, including water and\
    \ soil and their\nconservation; the impact of agriculture on the environment and\
    \ the consequences of climate change;\nthe use of nonconventional water resources\
    \ as an alternative for irrigation, including desalinated\nseawater, reused water,\
    \ and harvested rainwater; the developments in innovation and technology for\n\
    irrigation systems, particularly drip irrigation and deﬁcit irrigation; and, ﬁnally,\
    \ the improvements\nin the eﬃciency of the use of irrigation water. Below is an\
    \ overview of the research carried out on\nthese four priority issues. The weight\
    \ of each priority research line has been established through the\nrepetition\
    \ number of the main keywords within each research line as the article average\
    \ of the sample.\nIt has to be taken into account that an article can be classiﬁed\
    \ under diﬀerent topics. For example,\nan article which analyzes water eﬃciency\
    \ regarding nonconventional water resources shows as the\nmost weighted research\
    \ line climatic change, environmental impact, and natural resource conservation,\n\
    with a 56.8% out of the total sample works; followed by water use eﬃciency with\
    \ 42.5%, irrigation\ntechnology and innovation with 37.6%, and unconventional\
    \ water resources with 31.2%.\n3.7.1. Climatic Change, Environmental Impact, and\
    \ Natural Resource Conservation\nIt is predicted that the consequences derived\
    \ from global climate change will be alterations\nin precipitation cycles, triggering\
    \ long-term droughts, more frequent and more intense extreme\nphenomena, and water\
    \ supply imbalances [39,50]. Furthermore, these consequences will be reﬂected\
    \ in\nagriculture by way of variations in soil humidity and in the evapotranspiration\
    \ and runoﬀ ﬂows [14,51].\nThe United Nations report on the development of global\
    \ water resources of 2015 estimates that there\nwill be a drinking water shortage\
    \ of 40% on a global level by the year 2030 [52].\nBad practice in agriculture\
    \ produces a series of impacts that can have consequences on\nenvironmental, economic,\
    \ and social levels. As well as water use, current irrigation agriculture\nrequires\
    \ the addition of fertilizers and other chemical products [53]. When the use of\
    \ chemical products\nis incomplete or ineﬃcient or when excessive water is applied,\
    \ the resulting ﬁltration ends up in\ndrainage systems or in the groundwater recharge\
    \ areas under the cultivated land [54]. The most\ndeteriorated ecosystems currently\
    \ include the majority of the groundwater bodies on a global scale.\nThese water\
    \ resources have enabled the development of agricultural activity in arid and\
    \ semiarid\nregions and also in more humid regions where there are mismatches\
    \ between precipitation and the\nneeds of the crops [55]. In recent decades, the\
    \ intensiﬁcation of agriculture has given rise to a fall in\npiezometric levels,\
    \ the development of salinization processes, seawater intrusion, and pollution\
    \ by\nagricultural nitrates, among other eﬀects [23].\nDue to the estimated increase\
    \ in the amount of fresh water required to meet the future irrigation\ndemands,\
    \ a drastic reduction in biodiversity is expected to take place, together with\
    \ an increase in the\nsalinity or ﬂooding of soil, a loss in the ﬂow of complementary\
    \ services provided by the ecosystems,\nand the degradation of water sources and\
    \ ecosystems in general [56,57]. On a social level, an increase\nin the vulnerability\
    \ and inequality between users is expected [58,59].\nIn order to mitigate these\
    \ adverse eﬀects and to contribute to the conservation of the ecosystems,\nimportant\
    \ legislation is currently being developed on a global level. Among the objectives\
    \ established\nby the United Nations for the Horizon 2030 on Sustainable Development\
    \ is one speciﬁcally related\nto water and sanitation (ODS 6), which addresses\
    \ aspects ranging from water shortage to water use\neﬃciency [60]. The Horizon\
    \ 2020 Plan of the European Parliament includes the requirement for\nsustainable\
    \ production in agricultural systems [61]. Many countries, including the United\
    \ States,\nChina, India, and Costa Rica, have consolidated payment systems for\
    \ environmental services provided\nby agricultural ecosystems with the objective\
    \ of conserving water resources in good condition.\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n18 of\
    \ 26\n3.7.2. Unconventional Water Resources\nThe current scenario is one in which\
    \ so-called conventional water sources are being exhausted\nand degraded in large\
    \ parts of the world. These water sources include both surface water (rivers,\n\
    lakes, reservoirs) and groundwater (aquifers). The principal option for increasing\
    \ the water supply\nfor irrigation consists of using alternative sources, also\
    \ called nonconventional water sources [23].\nThese other sources include the\
    \ reuse of urban and industrial water, the desalination of seawater, and\nrainwater\
    \ harvesting. In recent years, water from nontraditional sources has become a\
    \ competitive\noption in the supply of quality water for irrigation, particularly\
    \ in arid and semiarid regions [62] The use\nof these types of resources has a\
    \ series of advantages—two in particular. First, the contribution of these\nnew\
    \ water sources represents an increase in the supply of the resource, which is\
    \ capable of satisfying the\ngrowing demand of the diﬀerent sectors (urban supply,\
    \ agricultural activity, tourism sector, industrial\nsector, and environmental\
    \ requirements) [63]. Second, the use of water from alternative sources should\n\
    serve to diminish the use of traditional water sources so that the state of deterioration\
    \ of the wetlands,\nrivers, and aquifers can be restored or at least alleviated\
    \ [64]. If these two advantages are to be\neﬃcient, they have to be accompanied\
    \ by demand control. In addition to these two principal functions,\nthe use of\
    \ nonconventional water resources gives rise to other advantages. They provide\
    \ a greater\nreliability in the supply, they supply higher quality water, they\
    \ can generate increases in crop yields,\nthey contribute to ensuring the stability\
    \ of agricultural incomes, and they can have positive eﬀects on\nseawater intrusion\
    \ processes in the aquifers [65–67].\nThe use of each of these alternatives also\
    \ gives rise to a series of limitations and disadvantages.\nEvidently, the construction\
    \ of seawater desalination plants is only feasible in coastal areas. A wastewater\n\
    treatment plant requires a volume of a large enough size for the facility to be\
    \ viable [64]. Therefore, the\nuse of this resource is not possible in areas where\
    \ the activities generating wastewater (population\nnuclei, industrial facilities,\
    \ livestock farms, etc.) do not have suﬃcient water use [63]. Thus, despite\n\
    water reuse being the ideal way of maintaining continuous use of the resource,\
    \ this type of facility\nis not appropriate for many rural areas where the population\
    \ is dispersed. The main problem of\nrainwater harvesting systems is the low volume\
    \ of water that can be supplied in comparison with\nthe demand [67]. Furthermore,\
    \ the seasonality of rain in many regions means that the water must be\nstored\
    \ for long periods of time for use when needed. To these limitations we must also\
    \ add the high\ncost of water derived through these systems. The installation\
    \ costs are usually very high, and we must\nalso take into account the cost of\
    \ production. In the case of desalination and reuse, these costs usually\nestablish\
    \ a price for water that is much higher than the price of conventional resources\
    \ [68]. This means\nthat many farmers throughout the world are not willing to\
    \ pay the price of the water unless there is no\nalternative available. Studies\
    \ have been carried out on experience with the use of desalinated seawater,\n\
    reused water or harvested rainwater all over the world [69–75].\n3.7.3. Irrigation\
    \ Technology and Innovation\nIrrigation technology has evolved continuously over\
    \ the last few decades. Flood irrigation,\nsprinkler irrigation, furrow irrigation,\
    \ and drip irrigation are some of the methods that have emerged,\nand their advantages\
    \ and disadvantages have been studied with respect to diﬀerent types of crops,\n\
    soils, and climatic conditions. New technologies have given rise to the development\
    \ of comprehensive\nautomated systems that combine the use of tensiometers, lysimeters,\
    \ software applications, and even\ngeographical information systems. However,\
    \ drip irrigation and deﬁcit irrigation are the terms that\nappear among the most\
    \ used keywords.\nDe Wrachienb et al. [76] date the beginning of drip irrigation\
    \ systems to the 1940s in Australia.\nThe development of this system came about\
    \ after the emergence of polypropylene tubes. It was\nnot until two decades later\
    \ that this system was improved in Israel, from where it was exported\nall over\
    \ the world. Currently, thanks to automation and the use of microcontrollers,\
    \ sensors, and\nintegrated systems, this method has been perfected, and the drip\
    \ irrigation system is now considerably\nmore advantageous than traditional systems\
    \ such as ﬂood irrigation or sprinklers [77–79]. The main\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n\
    19 of 26\ncontribution of this system is that it enables a substantial saving\
    \ in the use of water for irrigation, which\nenables the development or expansion\
    \ of agricultural activity in arid and semiarid regions, where it\nwould not be\
    \ possible otherwise [80,81]. Another advantage is that it can prevent evaporation,\
    \ as it\nsupplies water directly to the roots of plants [82]. Diﬀerent studies\
    \ show that the use of drip irrigation\nincreases the marketable yield and quality\
    \ of crops and stabilizes production when deﬁcit irrigation is\nused and that\
    \ fertigation through drip irrigation helps to reduce the use of fertilizers and,\
    \ therefore,\nthe risk of pollution due to leachate [80,83]. Salvador and Aragüés\
    \ [84] analyzed the advantages and\ndisadvantages of the use of underground drip\
    \ irrigation systems. They demonstrated their usefulness,\nproﬁtability, and sustainability\
    \ and indicated that the design, handling, and maintenance of this\nsystem, together\
    \ with the quality of the irrigation water and type of soil, are fundamental aspects\
    \ that\ndetermine their sustainability. On the other hand, Puy et al. [85] indicated\
    \ that this type of system can\nhave harmful consequences in terms of the degradation\
    \ of the soil or the production of greenhouse\ngas emissions.\nDeﬁcit irrigation\
    \ was introduced as a measure to limit the vegetative growth of crops [86]. This\n\
    irrigation technique has been fully developed, and it is used extensively [87].\
    \ This method has been\nused with both drip irrigation and microsprinkling on\
    \ diﬀerent crops and can be combined with\nremote sensing technology or infrared\
    \ techniques to produce signiﬁcant water savings while crop\nyields remain unaﬀected.\
    \ Du et al. [88] analyzed the use of deﬁcit irrigation as a sustainable strategy\n\
    for managing water resources in agriculture for food security in China. These\
    \ authors concluded\nthat the current understanding of physiological processes\
    \ enables the deﬁcit irrigation methods to be\nadjusted to diﬀerent crops and\
    \ environments in order to increase water use eﬃciency and the yield\nand quality\
    \ of crops. Many studies have been carried out on this subject area [89–93].\n\
    Though many authors support drip irrigation as a sustainability measure, some\
    \ recent studies\nquestion it. Perry et al. [94] conﬁrm the “zero-sum game” hypothesis\
    \ which argues that the impact of\nhigh-technology watering in a farm increases\
    \ the demand of local water and land production at the\nexpense of water availability\
    \ and production in other places. Furthermore, due to the advantageous\neﬀects\
    \ of drip irrigation, it makes water more aﬀordable and, at the time, it allows\
    \ irrigating larger\nareas, obtaining greater proﬁts, and shift to more valuable\
    \ crops. The most foreseeable impact of\nwater eﬃciency improvement will be the\
    \ increase of current water demands. In this sense, water\nscarcity would remain\
    \ diﬃcult to manage. Paul et al. [95], in their review of the rebound eﬀects on\n\
    the management of land and cultivation soils, found evidence for the presence\
    \ of rebound eﬀects and\nthe Jevons paradox, together with productivity increases\
    \ and eﬃciency of irrigation water due to\ntechnological innovations. Further\
    \ studies agree with these results [96,97].\n3.7.4. Water Use Eﬃciency\nAll of\
    \ these innovations have the objective of improving water use eﬃciency for irrigation.\
    \ In\nthe year 2000, Koﬁ Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, proposed\
    \ a “Blue Revolution\nin Agriculture” that was proposed to be capable of increasing\
    \ productivity per unit of water. This\nstrategy became known by the slogan “more\
    \ crop per drop” [24]. According to Yang [98], obtaining\nthe ideal water eﬃciency\
    \ for irrigating crops involves the reduction of losses caused by evaporation,\n\
    runoﬀ, and underground draining while increasing production. Zhang et al. [26]\
    \ indicated that the\nuse of technology to save irrigation water not only saves\
    \ water and increases production but also\nimproves the nutritional value of agricultural\
    \ products and guarantees food safety by improving\nthe environmental conditions.\
    \ Water use eﬃciency in agriculture generally implies a reduction in\nwater use\
    \ to meet a speciﬁc production objective or to increase the production of a speciﬁc\
    \ water\nsupply [99]. The aim of improving water use eﬃciency is to increase food\
    \ production, boost ﬁnancial\ngains, and guarantee the supply of ecosystem services\
    \ at lower social and environmental costs per\nunit of water used [100,101]. The\
    \ practices used to achieve this objective include rainwater harvesting,\ncomplementary\
    \ irrigation, deﬁcit irrigation, and the use of precision irrigation techniques\
    \ and practices\nto conserve groundwater [24,102]. The priority areas where it\
    \ is possible to signiﬁcantly increase the\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n20 of 26\nproductivity\
    \ of water include areas with a high level of poverty and a low level of water\
    \ productivity;\nareas with physical water shortage, where competition for water\
    \ is high; areas with limited development\nof water resources, where the high\
    \ yields of additional water have a considerable impact; and areas with\ndegraded\
    \ ecosystems driven by water, such as depleting water tables and dried-up rivers\
    \ [103,104].\nAmong the diﬀerent improvements developed over the last few decades,\
    \ the use of drip irrigation\nhas been fundamental in the improvement of water\
    \ use eﬃciency and saving. Diﬀerent studies\nhave shown that drip irrigation has\
    \ a water-saving potential of between 18% and 75%. According\nto Narayanamoorthy\
    \ [82], drip irrigation saves an average of 25 to 75% of water compared to\nﬂood\
    \ irrigation.\nSimilar results were found, although with diﬀerent percentages,\
    \ in studies by\nIbragimov et al. [105], Maisiri et al. [106], Yazar et al. [107],\
    \ or Peterson and Ding [108], Abdulai et al. [109],\nCremades et al. [110], and\
    \ Jalota et al. [111].\n4. Conclusions\nThis study presented the dynamics of global\
    \ research in sustainable irrigation in agriculture over\nthe last two decades,\
    \ the main agents promoting it, and the topics that have received the most attention.\n\
    The main concerns stated in the Introduction section related to the improvement\
    \ of irrigation water\nuse in order to increase food production, the world overexploitation\
    \ of water resources, and the eﬀects\nof global climate change. Our analysis veriﬁed\
    \ how these questions are addressed by countries taking\ninto account interdisciplinary\
    \ approaches, and it also proved how these questions are mirrored in the\nmain\
    \ research lines on SI.\nThe results of the analysis of the principal variables\
    \ revealed that the study of sustainable irrigation\nhas grown in recent years\
    \ in all of the variables considered: articles, authors, journals, institutions,\n\
    and countries. Despite the fact that the growth trend in this topic is higher\
    \ than that of general\nresearch in irrigation, an even greater research eﬀort\
    \ using a sustainability-based approach is required\nto further knowledge in this\
    \ area. Traditionally, studies on sustainability have focused on one of the\n\
    areas of which it is composed, namely, the environmental, social or economic dimensions.\
    \ In the\nstudy of irrigation, the dominant area has been the environmental dimension,\
    \ far more than the social\nor economic perspectives. The studies that analyzed\
    \ just one of these dimensions provide highly\nuseful information, but this information\
    \ is only partial. It is necessary to integrate the three aspects of\nsustainability\
    \ in order to gain full knowledge of the feasibility of certain practices, not\
    \ only in terms of\ntheir environmental impacts but also with respect to income\
    \ generation for farmers and the wellbeing\nof the community.\nThe keyword study\
    \ revealed the existence of diversity between studies carried out using speciﬁc\n\
    approaches and in diﬀerent countries. In general, the study of environmental impacts\
    \ and climate\nchange, water availability, the improvement in eﬃciency, sustainable\
    \ development, food supply, and\nthe conservation of water bodies, particularly\
    \ aquifers that have deteriorated, are common themes.\nHowever, certain practices,\
    \ such as deﬁcit irrigation or drip irrigation and aspects related to energy\n\
    consumption and certain crops, are priority issues for particular countries. The\
    \ methodological\napproaches used and the tools applied are other points of diﬀerentiation\
    \ of the research carried out\nby each country. The keyword analysis showed four\
    \ main research lines on SI: climatic change,\nenvironmental impact, and natural\
    \ resource conservation; unconventional water resources; irrigation\ntechnology\
    \ and innovation; and water use eﬃciency. Due to the large number of analyzed\
    \ documents\nand the scope of this work, an in-depth content analysis per topic\
    \ has not been undertaken. It will\nbe highly interesting for future studies in\
    \ order to provide more detailed information of these four\nspeciﬁc topics.\n\
    As a ﬁnal conclusion, we believe that certain aspects of the research on sustainable\
    \ irrigation\nin agriculture in each of the dimensions of sustainability should\
    \ be promoted. From a technical\npoint of view, innovation and technology have\
    \ furthered the development of irrigation systems and\nnew available water sources\
    \ that can contribute to improving the eﬃciency of water use and the\nsustainability\
    \ of rural areas, particularly agricultural activity in arid regions. However,\
    \ eﬀort should\nWater 2019, 11, 1758\n21 of 26\nbe made to make this technology\
    \ accessible, as its cost is economically unfeasible for small-scale\nagriculture\
    \ in many countries. New water sources, such as those derived from desalination,\
    \ reuse\nand rainwater harvesting systems, are very expensive for farmers compared\
    \ to traditional sources.\nThe production processes for desalination and reuse\
    \ should be improved, particularly with respect to\nenergy consumption in order\
    \ to bring down the ﬁnal price of the water. Furthermore, although the use\nof\
    \ these nonconventional water resources has proved to have a series of advantages\
    \ for the crops and\nthe soil, this knowledge has not been transmitted to the\
    \ farmers, and therefore, they are still reluctant to\nuse it for irrigation.\
    \ Greater eﬀort should be made to communicate the results of the research to society.\n\
    Finally, greater knowledge of the environmental impacts of irrigation-related\
    \ practices in diﬀerent\nareas on plot, district, basin and regional levels is\
    \ needed. Water bodies are connected to each other, so\ncertain practices that\
    \ generate a small impact on river source areas can have a multiplying eﬀect and\n\
    be experienced in the underground bodies of coastal areas.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ and leaf area index (LAI) were used to calibrate\nthe SWAT model, whereas remotely\
    \ sensed precipitation and other climatic parameters were used\nas forcing data\
    \ for the 6300 km2 Day Basin, a tributary of the Red River in Vietnam. The efﬁcacy\n\
    of the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) parameter sensitivity and optimization\
    \ model was\ntested with area speciﬁc remote sensing input parameters for every\
    \ Hydrological Response Units\n(HRU), rather than with measurements of river ﬂow\
    \ representing a large set of HRUs, i.e., a bulk\ncalibration. Simulated monthly\
    \ ET correlations with remote sensing estimates showed an R2 = 0.71,\nNash–Sutcliffe\
    \ Efﬁciency NSE = 0.65, and Kling Gupta Efﬁciency KGE = 0.80 while monthly LAI\n\
    showed correlations of R2 = 0.59, NSE = 0.57 and KGE = 0.83 over a ﬁve-year validation\
    \ period.\nAccumulated modelled ET over the 5-year calibration period amounted\
    \ to 5713 mm compared to\n6015 mm of remotely sensed ET, yielding a difference\
    \ of 302 mm (5.3%). The monthly ﬂow at two ﬂow\nmeasurement stations were adequately\
    \ estimated (R2 = 0.78 and 0.55, NSE = 0.71 and 0.63, KGE = 0.59\nand 0.75 for\
    \ Phu Ly and Ninh Binh, respectively). This outcome demonstrates the capability\
    \ of SWAT\nmodel to obtain spatial and accurate simulation of eco-hydrological\
    \ processes, also when rivers are\nungauged and the water withdrawal system is\

    www.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2018, 10, 212\n2 of 21\norganizations, and international\
    \ research institutes. The newly adopted Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs)\
    \ prescribe key hydrological, environmental, and economical processes to be expressed\n\
    in terms of performance indicators. Water accounting systems are currently under\
    \ development\nto facilitate the mapping and description of these SDG indicators\
    \ at river basin scale [1–4]. Water\navailability, water consumption, utilizable\
    \ water, and water withdrawals are key elements of such\naccounting processes,\
    \ as well as the services and beneﬁts rendered. At the global scale, 60% of ET\n\
    is from green water (precipitation stored in soil moisture), the rest being withdrawals\
    \ from blue\nwater sources (rivers, reservoirs, lakes, and aquifers) [5]. Eco-hydrological\
    \ modelling tools have been\ndeveloped to quantify a wide range of natural ecosystem\
    \ services as well as human intervention\nderived from these signiﬁcant volumes\
    \ of water [6–8]. A comparison of different hydrological models\nthat are suitable\
    \ for modelling hydrological ecosystem services was conducted in [9], among them\n\
    are the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) [10], Variable Inﬁltration Capacity\
    \ VIC [11], Integrated\nValuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs INVEST\
    \ [12], and ARtiﬁcial Intelligence for Ecosystem\nServices ARIES [13]. SWAT was\
    \ indicated as a preferred tool in a rigorous review of the modelling\nof certain\
    \ ecosystem services [14] for simulation of provisioning and regulating services,\
    \ because\nhydrological, ﬂow dynamics, water quality, plant growth and nutrient\
    \ loading processes are included\nin the model. SWAT was also recommended as the\
    \ most suitable model for long-term simulations in\nwatersheds dominated by agricultural\
    \ land uses [15], since its original design was to assess the impact\nof land\
    \ management practices on water, sediments, and agricultural residues. SWAT model\
    \ is also\npreferred in studies in ungauged basins [16,17].\nClassically, the\
    \ SWAT model is calibrated using a few hydro-meteorological stations e.g., [18–22].\n\
    Large uncertainties in observed stream ﬂow data are common [23], and that more\
    \ sophisticated\ncalibration method needed to be developed.\nSWAT Calibration\
    \ and Uncertainty Programs\n(SWAT-CUP) [24] was developed for automatically computing\
    \ sensitive model parameters and\ncalibrating SWAT by means of parameter optimization.\
    \ Most SWAT-CUP applications are using\nSequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2)\
    \ algorithms and ﬂow observations to deﬁne the best parameter\nset. Additional\
    \ uncertainty bounds are computed according to the good parameter sets and typical\n\
    SWAT parameters are calibrated by means of parameter optimization. The current\
    \ paper investigates\nhow SWAT can be set up for assessing ecosystem services\
    \ in ungauged basins using remote sensing\ndata and auto-calibration facilities.\n\
    Several review papers on remote sensing technology for hydrology, e.g., [25,26]\
    \ and water\nmanagement, e.g., [27,28] indicate that land cover, land use, precipitation,\
    \ ET, soil moisture, snow\ncover, and water levels can be determined from spectral\
    \ radiances measured remotely. Several open\naccess databases on precipitation\
    \ have recently been developed on the basis of remote sensing data;\nsee [29,30].\
    \ A simultaneous development took place on operationalizing remote sensing-based\
    \ energy\nbalance models to accurately determine and upscale ET from local heterogeneous\
    \ watersheds (e.g., [31])\nto continental scale (e.g., [32]). Extensive reviews\
    \ of remote sensing-based approaches to derive ET\nwere carried out earlier by\
    \ [33–36]. Remote sensing provides a great source of data to study vegetation\n\
    indices and Leaf Area Index (LAI) from multi-spectral bands [37].\nSome hydrological\
    \ studies utilized remote sensing data before—or a combination of remote\nsensing\
    \ and in situ data—to calibrate hydrological models, e.g., [38–42]. Earlier research\
    \ demonstrated\nthe capacity to calibrate SWAT with remotely sensed ET data, e.g.,\
    \ [43–47] and LAI [48,49]. Several\nstudies in Vietnam integrated SWAT and remote\
    \ sensing data, including [21], on the impact of climate\nchange on stream ﬂow\
    \ in Dakbla River Basin. The objective of this Vietnamese case study is to use\
    \ quasi\nopen access remote sensing data to improve SWAT modelling performance\
    \ using the standard SUFI-2\nfunctionalities, both as forced variable, i.e., precipitation\
    \ or calibration dataset, i.e., ET and LAI. The\ninnovation is that the standard\
    \ calibration module is based on remote sensing data instead of classical\ndischarge\
    \ data, and that it incorporates soil and vegetation parameters of individual\
    \ Hydrological\nResponse Units (HRU). The anticipated result of such a calibration\
    \ approach is a better quantiﬁcation\nof the natural and anthropogenic eco-hydrological\
    \ processes in ungauged basins, which is vital for\nWater 2018, 10, 212\n3 of\
    \ 21\nreporting ecosystem services to governments and the United Nations. The\
    \ novelty of this study is the\napplication of SUFI-2 in the optimization of 15\
    \ input parameters of the soil vegetation processes using\nobservations of actual\
    \ water management processes, such as irrigation and conservation of water in\n\
    wetlands in a local context. Such level of detail and reﬂection of real world\
    \ interferences of mankind\non the natural hydrological cycle can never be achieved\
    \ from ﬂow measurements, and opens better\nopportunities for simulation of local\
    \ eco-hydrological processes that occur locally in ungauged basins,\nwhich can\
    \ never be interpreted from bulk ﬂow measurements, if there are any.\n2. Study\

    \ and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) \nThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)\
    \ [10,53] has been set up for the Day Basin to compute \nflows, fluxes, and stocks.\
    \ A total amount of 119 sub-basins and 7909 HRU has been included for ensuring\
    \ \nsufficient detail. HRU is a modeling unit that exists of a unique combination\
    \ of land slope, land use, and \nsoil type [54]. SWAT simulates eco-hydrological\
    \ processes, i.e., surface runoff, groundwater recharge, \nbaseflow, water stocks,\
    \ erosion, plant production, and water quality. The production of food, feed,\
    \ and \ntimber, and the sequestration of carbon can be inferred from the biomass\
    \ production [54]. SWAT \nestimates the fate and transport of nutrients, sediment,\
    \ pesticides, and bacteria in both land and water \nphases [55]. This mathematical\
    \ framework provides a great basis for the determination of various \necosystem\
    \ services and SDG indicators. The soil water balance is conceptualized in SWAT\
    \ using \nEquation (1), as described in [53]: \n\U0001D446\U0001D44A\U0001D461\

    \ measured in mm H2O on \nday i. The reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is computed\
    \ with Global Land Data Assimilation System \n(GLDAS) meteorological input data.\
    \ SWAT does not allow reading layers of ET0 directly, and therefore, \nmeteorological\
    \ records need to be prescribed. The chosen method for reference ET in SWAT is\
    \ the \nPenman–Monteith method, as described in [53]. Compared with other equations\
    \ in SWAT, i.e., \nHargreaves [56] and Priestley–Taylor [57], the Penman–Monteith\
    \ method fully takes advantage of \nremote sensing and global data source, such\
    \ as GLDAS. \n3.2. Model Calibration Using SUFI-2 \nThe calibration of a semi-distributed\
    \ and physical based model, such as SWAT, requires various \nplant and soil model\
    \ parameters to be optimized, to ensure a rigorous representation of a basin’s\
    \ \nprocesses, e.g., streamflow, ET, ecological change, etc. The calibration task\
    \ can become difficult and \nalmost infeasible in large-scale applications [54].\
    \ A number of auto-calibration and uncertainty analysis \ntools for SWAT were\
    \ developed to support solving this problem, and are currently available to assist\
    \ the \noptimization process. This study is based on the SUFI-2 model that is\

    \ detail. HRU is a modeling unit that exists of a unique combination of land\n\
    slope, land use, and soil type [54]. SWAT simulates eco-hydrological processes,\
    \ i.e., surface runoff,\ngroundwater recharge, baseﬂow, water stocks, erosion,\
    \ plant production, and water quality. The\nproduction of food, feed, and timber,\
    \ and the sequestration of carbon can be inferred from the\nbiomass production\

    and bacteria in both land and water phases [55]. This mathematical framework provides\
    \ a great basis\nfor the determination of various ecosystem services and SDG indicators.\
    \ The soil water balance is\nconceptualized in SWAT using Equation (1), as described\

    \ of auto-calibration and uncertainty analysis\nWater 2018, 10, 212\n5 of 21\n\
    tools for SWAT were developed to support solving this problem, and are currently\
    \ available to assist\nthe optimization process. This study is based on the SUFI-2\
    \ model that is part of the SWAT-CUP\nsupporting software package [58]. SWAT-Calibration\
    \ and Uncertainty Program (SWAT-CUP) [24,58]\nis an auto-calibration and uncertainty\
    \ analysis module program based on the SWAT engine that can\ndeal with a range\
    \ of input parameters. The optimization algorithm of SWAT-CUP allows model\nparameters\
    \ to be predeﬁned and optimized throughout the auto calibration process or manually\n\
    adjusted iteratively between calibration batches. The employment of SUFI-2 is\
    \ suitable for both\nnew and advanced users of hydrological models, even though\
    \ a good understanding of hydrologic\nprocesses and of parameter sensitivity is\
    \ recommended in general terms [54]. In order to assess the\nefﬁcacy of using\
    \ remote sensing data and to compare with traditional discharge station-based\
    \ for\ncalibration, SWAT-CUP was run with two settings: (a) entirely based on\
    \ remote sensing data (ET and\nLAI) and (b) entirely based on river discharge\
    \ measurements. Among various evaluation coefﬁcients\nallowed in SUFI-2, Nash–Sutcliffe\
    \ (NSE) and Kling Gupta Efﬁciency (KGE) were chosen. For this\nparticular study,\
    \ a total number of 15 plant and soil parameters were pre-selected according to\
    \ their\nsensitivity to the evolution of ET and LAI. The selection of these parameters\
    \ was based on detailed\nreviews and analyses on SWAT parameters carried out before\
    \ by various authors (e.g., [16,42,43,54,59]).\n4. Spatial Input Datasets for\
    \ SWAT\n4.1. Physiographical Maps\nThe Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was downloaded\
    \ from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission\n(SRTM) with a resolution of 1 arc-second\
    \ or 30 m (Figure 1b). The DEM is used to calculate slope, slope\nlengths, and\
    \ to extract the stream network, solar angles, and air temperature corrections.\
    \ The land\nuse map is downloaded from Globcover [60]. Globcover is developed\
    \ by the European Space Agency\n(ESA) and University of Louvain, with a spatial\
    \ resolution of 300 m × 300 m. The satellite input data\nused for the classiﬁcation\
    \ was the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor on the\nEnvironmental\
    \ Satellite (ENVISAT) during 2009. While this dataset exists for several years,\
    \ it captures\nthe time span of the SWAT analysis very well. The major land cover\
    \ in the Day Basin is agricultural\nland (64%), followed by forests (24%), and\
    \ mixed mosaic (12%). Three thousand hectares (76%) of\nagricultural land is irrigated.\
    \ The soil map used in this study originates from the International Soil\nReference\
    \ Information Centre (ISRIC) [61] and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)\
    \ Digital Soil\nMap of the World [62]. The SoilGrids database (ISRIC, Wageningen,\
    \ The Netherlands) has a spatial\nresolution of 1 km × 1 km, and is produced during\
    \ 2014. The physical properties included in the\ndataset are (i) soil organic\
    \ carbon (g/kg), (ii) pH index (H2O solution) (%), (iii) sand, silt and clay\n\
    content (kg/kg), (iv) coarse fragments (volumetric) (%), (v) bulk density (kg/m3),\
    \ (vi) cation-exchange\ncapacity (ﬁne earth fraction) (cmol+/kg), and (vii) depth\
    \ to bedrock (cm). A new soil map was created\nin this study by combining the\
    \ two ISRIC and FAO soil maps with the aims to both (i) increase\nthe spatial\
    \ representation, and (ii) maintain the soil classiﬁcation and soil properties\
    \ from the FAO\ndatabase. This task was accomplished by using standard unsupervised\
    \ classiﬁcation procedures (see\nFigure 2). Based on the distribution of land\
    \ slope, soil type, and land use classes, the basin is divided\ninto 119 sub-basins\
    \ and 7909 HRUs.\n4.2. Meteorological Data\n4.2.1. Precipitation\nSatellite precipitation\

    \ data as input, a Penman–Monteith type of equation, is MOD16 (University of Montana,\n\
    Water 2018, 10, 212\n7 of 21\nMissoula, MT, USA) [69]. Several years of data can\
    \ be downloaded if one is registered. MOD16 is\nbased on a simpliﬁed stomatal\
    \ conductance model governed by LAI, vapor pressure deﬁcit, and air\ntemperature.\
    \ Soil evaporation is limited by a complementary relationship hypothesis which\
    \ deﬁnes\nland–atmospheric interactions from vapor pressure deﬁcit and relative\
    \ humidity [69]. Various ET\ncomparison studies using MOD16 data have been undertaken,\
    \ see for instance [32,39,70]. MOD16\nET was validated [71] using ﬂux towers in\
    \ South Africa, and found that ET was systematically\nunderestimated by 7.5 to\
    \ 26.3 mm per month, something conﬁrmed by [72,73]. On the contrary, studies\n\
    conducted in Asia showed that MOD16 consistently overestimates ET for forested\
    \ land cover [38].\nAnother example of a global energy balance model is SEBS (University\
    \ of Twente, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands) [74,75] that has a quasi-open accessibility\
    \ to acquire the data. SEBS applies an\nanalytical solution of surface roughness\
    \ for heat transfer, and it was used to create a global scale dataset\nthat is\
    \ quasi open access. It limits the sensible heat ﬂux estimates with upper and\
    \ lower boundaries of\nthe surface resistance to evaporation. The upper boundary\
    \ is determined by latent heat ﬂux equal to\nzero; the lower limit by potential\
    \ evapotranspiration with a minimum bulk surface resistance. CMRSET\n(Commonwealth\
    \ Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Canberra, Australia)\
    \ [76]\ncalculates actual ET from the Priestley and Taylor reference ET for water\
    \ unlimited land surfaces [77]\nand a crop factor (Kc) based on an enhanced vegetation\
    \ index (EVI). A global vegetation moisture index\n(GVMI) is used to account for\
    \ non-optimal moisture conditions. This method is generally empirical,\nand aims\
    \ to develop an ET dataset that GVMI is independent from land cover classiﬁcation.\n\
    Another energy balance method is the Operational Simpliﬁed Surface Energy Balance\
    \ (SSEBop,\nUSGS EROS Center, Sioux Falls, SD, USA) [35] that employs a relationship\
    \ between ET0 and a land\nsurface temperature-based scalar (ETrf) to express land\
    \ wetness. An operational version of SSEB\nwas proposed [78,79] by assimilating\
    \ air temperature to account for the topographical and latitudinal\nheterogeneity\
    \ impact on surface temperature. The SSEBop model deﬁnes the temperature scalar\
    \ using\nhot and cold reference values for any pixel. The cold reference value\
    \ is estimated as an empirically\nestablished fraction of the daily maximum air\
    \ temperature; the hot reference value is obtained by\nadding a vertical temperature\
    \ difference (dT) to the cold reference value [35].\nThough progressing signiﬁcantly\
    \ in the past years and gaining maturity enough for calibration\nof hydrological\
    \ models, remote sensing-based ET products still induce various uncertainties,\n\
    e.g., [72,73,80].\nThese uncertainties come in various forms, such as from temperature\
    \ and net\nradiation [35], and the aerodynamic component [81]. An uncertainty\
    \ of up to 4 to 18% can be linked\nto sources of net radiation [35]. The largest\
    \ uncertainty originates, however, from the impact of soil\nmoisture on the regulation\
    \ of the ET process. While thermal infrared measurements are excellent\nindicators\
    \ of evaporative cooling [82], they are sensitive to cloud cover. Solutions based\
    \ on microwave\nmeasurements are therefore suggested simultaneously for a long\
    \ time [83,84]. Consequently, a suite of\nET algorithms have been built during\
    \ the last 25 years, and every algorithm will have its own model\nformulation\
    \ and accuracy. Only physically-based algorithms with thorough validation in several\n\
    environmental conditions should be considered for the calibration of hydrological\
    \ models.\nBecause existing global scale ET products have different predictive\
    \ capabilities, and there is no\nreliable ground truth dataset available in Day\
    \ Basin to select any one of them, an ensemble ET product\nhas been created in\
    \ addition to the original datasets, on the basis of a simple linear average value\n\
    for the Day Basin. The ensemble ET product used in this study is based on the\
    \ combination of SEBS\n(5 km × 5 km), CMRSET (5 km × 5 km), SSEBop (1 km × 1 km),\
    \ and MOD16 data (1 km × 1 km), and\nhas a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km grid.\
    \ A ﬁner ET map is deemed necessary to assess water\nbalances at HRUs spatial\
    \ level. The same downscaling procedure as described in CMRSET using the\nEnhanced\
    \ Vegetation Index (EVI), and Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) was applied.\
    \ The\nResidual Moisture Index (RMI) was used to describe the impact of vegetation\
    \ moisture content on the\ncrop coefﬁcient.\nThe selection criteria for a certain\
    \ ET product were based on the hydrological consistency between\nthe annual totals\
    \ of precipitation (ΣP) and discharge (ΣQ) for a time span of 10 consecutive years\
    \ (2003\nWater 2018, 10, 212\n8 of 21\nto 2012). The stream ﬂow data (ΣQ) from\
    \ the 2 stations (Phu Ly and Ninh Binh) were used (see Figure 4).\nIn the case\
    \ of the Day Basin, there is an unknown withdrawal from the Red River, which makes\
    \ a\ndirect comparison weaker. The analysis of the Day Basin demonstrates that\
    \ SEBS produces the highest\nET values, and MOD16 the lowest. CMRSET and MOD16\
    \ performed similarly for annual and seasonal\nperiods, and both were lower than\
    \ the ensemble ET. Of all ﬁve ET datasets (4 individual and 1 ensemble\nproduct),\
    \ the ensemble ET, SSEBop, and CMRSET delivered similar annual ET rates, averaged\
    \ for the\ndrainage area at Phu Ly (ΣET of 1073 mm, 1041 mm, and 1007 mm, respectively)\
    \ and Ninh Binh (ΣET\nof 1103 mm, 1044 mm, and 1031 mm, respectively). This is\
    \ because the ensemble ET compensated for\nthe difference between higher end and\
    \ lower end ET products. Of all four ET datasets, SSEBop gave the\nmost similar\
    \ results compared to the ensemble ET. Albeit minor, differences were spotted\
    \ during the\ndry period. For the dry season, ET from MOD16 is comparable with\
    \ the ensemble ET (ΣET of 361 mm\nand 359 mm for Phu Ly, 376 mm and 369 mm for\
    \ Ninh Binh, respectively), while SSEBop tends to give\nlower ET. The performance\
    \ of a certain actual evapotranspiration (ETact) algorithm is dependent on\nfactors\
    \ such as land use land cover type, climate, and the presence of mountains [8],\
    \ meaning that the\naccuracy of ETact predictions will vary across the basin.\
    \ The seasonal performance of the ensemble ET\nvalues mismatch, due to storage\
    \ changes in the soil water balance and the regulating role of lakes and\nreservoirs\
    \ on river discharge. During the dry season, ET was much higher than precipitation\
    \ hence,\nthe displayed axis scale differed from the yearly average and the seasonal\
    \ wet period. The interim\nconclusion is that the ensemble ET product generated\
    \ from linear average SEBS, CMRSET, SSEBop,\nand MOD16 provided accurate and most\
    \ stable results for the Day Basin. Accordingly, the ensemble\nET data was tested\
    \ further before being used in the optimization process.\nWater 2018, 10, x \n\
    8 of 21 \n \n1103 mm, 1044 mm, and 1031 mm, respectively). This is because the\
    \ ensemble ET compensated for the \ndifference between higher end and lower end\
    \ ET products. Of all four ET datasets, SSEBop gave the \nmost similar results\
    \ compared to the ensemble ET. Albeit minor, differences were spotted during the\

    \ ET (ΣET of 361 mm and \n359 mm for Phu Ly, 376 mm and 369 mm for Ninh Binh,\

    \ actual evapotranspiration (ETact) algorithm is dependent on factors \nsuch as\
    \ land use land cover type, climate, and the presence of mountains [8], meaning\
    \ that the accuracy \nof ETact predictions will vary across the basin. The seasonal\
    \ performance of the ensemble ET values \nmismatch, due to storage changes in\

    \ most stable results for the Day Basin. Accordingly, the ensemble ET data \n\
    was tested further before being used in the optimization process. \n \nFigure\

    \ was also\nsuggested by [16,42,59]. Calibration of ET is less common, because\
    \ this dataset is usually not available.\nMore recent studies, including [8,43,45],\
    \ demonstrated that SWAT can be calibrated against spatial\nET data as well. Key\
    \ parameters for the calibration of ET and their value range were derived from\n\
    the SWAT user’s manual [53]. Since the purpose of this study is to calibrate the\
    \ model for ET and\nLAI, the model parameters to be optimized were divided into\
    \ two groups: ET and LAI. This grouping\nindicates which parameters are most sensitive\
    \ to ET and LAI, and thus, suitable for optimizing the\nmodel performance for\
    \ these two processes. The list is long because one parameter might control\n\
    more than one process, e.g., the available water capacity of soil layers affects\
    \ the generation of surface\nrunoff, but simultaneously determines the amount\
    \ of water that is evaporated (ET) and percolated\nto the underground. SUFI-2\
    \ automatically optimizes the selected parameters within their predeﬁned\nrange,\
    \ hence this aspect of parameter selection is following the default guidelines\
    \ of the tool.\nSix parameters ESCO, EPCO, REVAPMN, SOL_K, SOL_AWC, and SOL_BD\
    \ have been selected\nto optimize the ET simulations. The baseﬂow recession constant\
    \ ALPHA_BF and SCS runoff curve\nnumber (CN2) were also included because of their\
    \ inﬂuences on the surface–subsurface hydrological\nprocesses, and thus, on the\
    \ water availability for evapotranspiration. Seven other parameters are\nidentiﬁed\
    \ that inﬂuence the leaf area index development, see [53]: BLAI, ALAI_MIN, DLAI,\
    \ LAIMX1,\nLAIMX2, FRGRW1, and FRGRW2. SUFI-2 thus optimizes 15 model parameters\
    \ for different sub-basins\nand HRUs. Since SWAT-CUP is unable to read spatial\
    \ data, time series of ET and LAI was derived\nand used as input into the model.\
    \ While ET process is more dependent on the local climate and land\ncover properties,\
    \ LAI is strictly driven by the plant type, and hence, the calibration should\
    \ be done at\nsub-basin, land cover, and HRU levels. The utilization of high resolution\
    \ spatial datasets as input into\nHRU analysis in SWAT (i.e., land use, DEM, soil\
    \ maps) ensures fair distribution of HRUs, and hence,\nspatially distributed ET\
    \ and LAI across the watershed.\nIn the case of conventional calibration using\
    \ discharge, two river discharge points (i.e., Phu Ly\nand Ninh Binh) were used\
    \ (500 simulations for both calibration and validation) and the acquired result\n\
    was used to compare against the output from calibration technique using remotely\
    \ sensed data.\nIn the ﬁrst step of calibration technique using remote sensing\
    \ data, average ET and LAI for\n119 sub-basins and all land-cover groups was extracted\
    \ from ensemble ET and Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ and used as observed data in SWAT-CUP. Derived time series\nof ET and LAI from\
    \ each sub-basin and land cover type was used to calibrate 15 parameters in\n\
    each sub-basin and land cover group individually (500 simulations each run for\
    \ calibration and\nvalidation). This ﬁrst estimation of ET and LAI ensures a good\
    \ agreement in term of average ET, LAI,\nWater 2018, 10, 212\n11 of 21\nand subsequently,\
    \ water balance. In the second batch of calibration, a number of HRUs from each\n\
    sub-basin representing all land use classes and ensuring a total coverage of at\
    \ least 50% the sub-basin’s\narea were selected in the calibration (500 simulations\
    \ each run for calibration and validation). The\ncalibration result yields a set\
    \ of soil and plant parameters which varies from sub-basins and land cover\ngroups,\
    \ and that reﬂects the local eco-hydrological processes, and is therefore highly\
    \ valuable. This\nunprecedented spatial variability from SUFI-2 optimization cannot\
    \ be obtained from soil surveys and\nsoil maps, which makes this investigation\
    \ interesting. The classical SUFI-2 calibration will give the\nsame parameter\
    \ value to all sub-basins and HRUs encompassed in a certain drainage area, and\
    \ hence,\nthe new system of calibration provides much more insight into the local\
    \ characteristic of the soil and\nvegetation system.\n6. Results and Discussions\n\
    The simulation covered the period 2000 to 2013 using 3 years of initialization\
    \ (2000 to 2002) as\nmodelling warm up period. Because remotely sensed data had\
    \ a different temporal coverage—2003 to\n2012 for ET and 2005 to 2011 for LAI—SWAT\
    \ was calibrated from 2003 to 2007 for ET, and validated\nfrom 2008 to 2012. LAI\
    \ was calibrated from 2005 to 2007, and validated from 2008 to 2011.\nThe monthly\
    \ simulation for the entire Day Basin, as one bulk system, was presented in Figure\
    \ 7.\nThe simulated values related satisfactorily to the observed ensemble ET\
    \ values. The ET peak value from\nremote sensing did not exceed 140 mm/month,\
    \ while the modelled ET was as high as 160 mm/month.\nFor remote sensing-based\
    \ calibration, simulated ET in SWAT is underestimated by 5 to 10 percent\nin the\
    \ irrigated agricultural land downstream, while the forest land showed good correlation.\
    \ NSE\nyielded from 0.61 (calibration) to 0.65 (validation). R2 for calibration\
    \ and validation was 0.71, while\nKling Gupta Efﬁciency (KGE) ranged from 0.80\
    \ to 0.83, respectively. The high values from KGE were\ndue to the fact that low\
    \ values were well represented for bias and correlation, as compared to NSE’s\n\
    reputation on overemphasizing peak values. By contrast, traditional discharge-based\
    \ calibration\nperformed statistically more inferior with NSE, which were only\
    \ at −0.01 and −0.20, and KGE at 0.46\nand 0.47, while R2 was of signiﬁcant values\
    \ 0.77 and 0.76, for calibration and validation, respectively.\nDischarge-based\
    \ calibration results also encountered a consistent underestimation of ET temporally\n\
    as compared to remote sensing-based method. Another observation in both cases\
    \ is that the lower\nET values simulated during winter were always lower than\
    \ the observed values from remote sensing,\neven though this difference was much\
    \ lower when using ET and LAI as calibration inputs. This could\nbe related to\
    \ the dry period in which SWAT computes water stress due to a lack of soil moisture.\n\
    This could suggest that the storage capacity of the soil in reality is higher,\
    \ or it could also be related\nto lower vertical water ﬂuxes between the top soil,\
    \ sub-soil, and the unconﬁned shallow aquifer,\nor the sensitivity of vegetation\
    \ to soil moisture. A very low reference ET0 during winter could also\nbe an explanation.\
    \ SUFI-2 ensured, however, that the spatial patterns match rather well. Some local\n\
    differences occur unavoidably due to the inaccuracy of the various mathematical\
    \ expressions used\nto compute a complex hydrological process such as ET. Remote\
    \ sensing ET values reﬂect more the\nreal world conditions as they are based on\
    \ observations [33–35,42]. The agreement between SWAT\nand remote sensing data\
    \ was expressed by means of the correlation coefﬁcient and the bias. Using\nspatial\
    \ dataset in the calibration yields resulted in much higher agreement, and reveals\
    \ that both\nthe ET formulations in SWAT as well as the SUFI-2 optimization techniques\
    \ are adequate. The same\nconclusion was drawn earlier by other researchers that\
    \ validate SWAT on the basis of ET data series.\nWater 2018, 10, 212\n12 of 21\n\

    \ the evapotranspiration simulations of SWAT, the vegetation response to water\
    \ can be \nevaluated by means of a comparison of the simulated LAI (see Figure\
    \ 8) in two cases: (a) remote \nsensing-driven, and (b) discharge-driven calibration.\
    \ The remote sensing-based calibration yielded \nacceptable NSE ranging from 0.50\
    \ for calibration and 0.57 for validation. R2 for calibration and validation \n\
    was 0.51 and 0.59, while Kling Gupta Efficiency (KGE) ranged from 0.59 to 0.75.\
    \ Conventional \ndischarge-based calibration performed poorly, in term of statistics,\
    \ with NSE of only 0.35 and 0.43, KGE \nof −0.34 and 0.03, while R2 was higher\
    \ at 0.67 and 0.77 for calibration and validation, respectively. LAI \nvalues\
    \ in discharge-based calibration were consistently underestimated compared with\
    \ observation \nfrom MODIS. With regard to remote sensing-based calibration, the\
    \ timing of the green cover \ndevelopment seems acceptable. The peak LAI values\
    \ during Spring 2005 and 2006 are not accurate. This \nmay be due to constancy\
    \ of the LAI related calibration parameters for all the different simulation years.\
    \ It \nwould be better to make the maximum LAI parameter variable for each year,\
    \ to enable it to better \nrespond to years with weather anomalies. A good description\
    \ of LAI evolution will improve the timing \nof rice emergence, which in turn,\
    \ affects the irrigation and transpiration processes. \nFigure 7. Temporal variability\

    Further to the evapotranspiration simulations of SWAT, the vegetation response\
    \ to water can\nbe evaluated by means of a comparison of the simulated LAI (see\
    \ Figure 8) in two cases: (a)\nremote sensing-driven, and (b) discharge-driven\

    \ from 0.50 for calibration and 0.57 for validation. R2 for calibration\nand validation\
    \ was 0.51 and 0.59, while Kling Gupta Efﬁciency (KGE) ranged from 0.59 to 0.75.\n\

    \ stored in lakes, streams, and also moving \nwithin the saturated layers to the\

    \ of the total system is rather accurately simulated. \nThe total water balance\
    \ for the basin in average rainfall, a dry (2007), and a wet (2008) year, is \n\

    \ precipitation, ET and LAI gridded data from open\naccess—or partially open access—earth\
    \ observation data platforms, makes it feasible to calibrate\nsoil and vegetation\
    \ process parameters of eco-hydrological models, also when rivers are ungauged\n\
    and the water distribution system is complex. In this study, four individual ET\
    \ models were averaged\nlinearly to match the simulations of ET from SWAT. No\
    \ in situ measurements were available to verify\nthe performance of individual\
    \ ET models. From inspection of the water balance, a simple linear\naverage value\
    \ gave best results as compared to streamﬂow and Kc crop coefﬁcients, described\
    \ in the\ninternational literature. Nevertheless, it is required to undertake\
    \ more studies on the ensemble ET\nproduct to provide further progressive insights\
    \ on averaging of individual estimates.\nSecondly, this paper demonstrates the\
    \ capabilities of SWAT and the auto-calibration SUFI-2 to\nrender bio-physical\
    \ processes in data scarce basins in a distributed manner. A total of 15 essential\n\
    bio-physical parameters of the unsaturated zone and exchange processes seem to\
    \ be adequately\nWater 2018, 10, 212\n17 of 21\ncalibrated in SWAT for each of\
    \ the 7907 HRUs. Otherwise, there would not have been such a good\nagreement with\
    \ the spatio-temporal variability of the remote sensing parameters, as in the\
    \ case\nof conventional discharge-driven calibration. Furthermore, this level\
    \ of spatial detail cannot be\nobtained from soil maps. The hydrological formulations\
    \ in SWAT are thus adequate for simulating\neco-hydrological processes. In the\
    \ near future, remote sensing data on soil moisture, net primary\nproduction,\
    \ and water quality will become available as well, which will undoubtedly further\
    \ enrich\nthe options to calibrate additional SWAT model parameters.\nThe approach\
    \ proposed in this study using SWAT-CUP and SUFI-2 will improve the facilitation\n\
    and standardization of calibration process for basins with scant ﬁeld data.\n\
    By optimizing\nevapotranspiration and photosynthesis for Hydrological Response\
    \ Unit, swift estimates of surface\nrunoff, erosion, groundwater recharge, baseﬂow,\
    \ storage changes, withdrawals, and carbon\nassimilation can be determined and\
    \ used to quantify ecosystems services. The availability of the\nsystem parameters\
    \ will allow future predictions of the basin water cycle in response to external\
    \ factors,\nsuch as climate and land-use changes, and computing scenarios for\
    \ green growth, i.e., conservation\nplans, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,\
    \ etc.\nAcknowledgments: This work was undertaken as part of the MK27 project\

    \ tool for crop yield prediction, allowing the\nmodel to automatically extract\
    \ features and learn from the datasets. Meanwhile, smart farming\ntechnology enables\
    \ the farmers to achieve maximum crop yield by extracting essential parameters\
    \ of\ncrop growth. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research\
    \ gaps in a particular\narea of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing\
    \ the impact of vegetation indices and\nenvironmental factors on crop yield. To\
    \ achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2012 to 2022\nfrom various\
    \ databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the advantages of\
    \ using\ndeep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable remote sensing technology\
    \ based on the data\nacquisition requirements, and the various features that inﬂuence\
    \ crop yield prediction. This study\nﬁnds that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and\
    \ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the\nmost widely used deep learning\
    \ approaches for crop yield prediction. The commonly used remote\nsensing technology\
    \ is satellite remote sensing technology—in particular, the use of the Moderate-\n\
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Findings show that vegetation indices\
    \ are the most\nused feature for crop yield prediction. However, it is also observed\
    \ that the most used features in the\nliterature do not always work for all the\
    \ approaches. The main challenges of using deep learning\napproaches and remote\
    \ sensing for crop yield prediction are how to improve the working model for\n\
    better accuracy, the practical implication of the model for providing accurate\
    \ information about crop\nyield to agriculturalists, growers, and policymakers,\
    \ and the issue with the black box property.\nKeywords: deep learning approaches;\
    \ crop yield prediction; remote sensing techniques; systematic\nliterature review\n\
    1. Introduction\nCrop yield prediction is becoming more important because of the\
    \ growing concern\nabout food security [1–3]. Early crop yield prediction plays\
    \ an important role in reducing\nfamine by estimating the food availability for\
    \ the growing world population [2]. Hunger is\none of the most devastating issues\
    \ in the world and increasing crop yield production is a\nfeasible solution to\
    \ overcome this problem. The World Health Organization [1] estimated\nthat there\
    \ is still an inadequate food supply for 820 million people around the world.\
    \ The\ntarget for the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations is to\
    \ eliminate hunger,\naccomplish food security, and encourage sustainable agriculture\
    \ by 2030. The Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that there will\
    \ be a 60 per cent demand for food\nto supply the world population of 9.3 billion\
    \ by 2050 [2]. Therefore, crop yield prediction\ncan offer crucial information\
    \ required for developing a reasonable solution to achieve the\ntarget and end\
    \ hunger [1].\nCrop yield is inﬂuenced by various parameters, and it is difﬁcult\
    \ to build a reliable\nprediction model with traditional methods. However, with\
    \ advancements in computational\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14091990\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n2 of\
    \ 21\ntechnology, the development and training of a novel approach for crop yield\
    \ prediction\nhave become feasible [3]. Deep learning is a signiﬁcant technique\
    \ that is extensively used in\nthe agricultural domain because of its numerous\
    \ data technologies and high-performance\ncomputing [4]. Deep learning is a class\
    \ of machine learning that has multiple layers\nof neural networks capable of\
    \ learning from data that are unstructured and unlabeled,\nwhereby the learning\
    \ can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised. Sarker [4]\npointed out\
    \ that deep learning techniques focus on learning abstract features of large\n\
    datasets. To accurately predict crop yield requires primary knowledge of the association\n\
    between functional attributes and interactive factors. To study such correlation\
    \ requires\nboth comprehensive datasets and high-efﬁciency algorithms, which can\
    \ be achieved by\nusing deep learning.\nThis paper conducts a systematic literature\
    \ review on the application of deep learning\napproaches in crop yield prediction\
    \ using remote sensing data. The rationale of conducting\nthis systematic literature\
    \ review is because it has the potential to highlight the existing\nresearch gaps\
    \ in a particular area of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing\n\
    the impact of vegetation indices and environmental factors on crop growth. This\
    \ systematic\nliterature review provides a new perspective of research by investigating\
    \ the advantages\nof using deep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable\
    \ remote sensing technology\nbased on the data acquisition requirements, and the\
    \ various features that inﬂuence crop\nyield prediction.\nThe structure of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the overview of\ncrop yield\
    \ prediction. Section 3 presents the research methodology adopted in conducting\n\
    the systematic review. Section 4 presents the results and discussion, followed\
    \ by the\nconclusions in Section 5.\n2. Research Methods\n2.1. Review Methodology\n\
    This systematic literature review helps us to understand the application of deep\n\
    learning approaches in crop yield prediction using remote sensing data. This systematic\n\
    literature review is carried out to highlight the existing research gaps in a\
    \ particular area of\ndeep learning methodologies and guide us in analyzing the\
    \ impact of vegetation indices\nand environmental factors on crop growth. For\
    \ the systematic literature review, not only\nare all research studies from journals,\
    \ conferences, and other electronic databases assessed,\nbut they are also integrated\
    \ and presented in correspondence to the research questions\nmentioned in our\
    \ study.\nA systematic literature review is an exceptional way to evaluate theory\
    \ or evidence\nin a speciﬁc area or to study the accuracy or validity of a speciﬁc\
    \ theory [5]. The review\nguidelines given by Kitchenham and Charters [6] are\
    \ appropriate for our systematic litera-\nture review as they provide objectivity\
    \ and transparency. Based on the review guidelines,\ninitially, the research questions\
    \ are formulated. The review is undertaken in accordance\nwith the Preferred Reporting\
    \ Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)\nstatement [7]. Several\
    \ databases, such as IEEE Explorer, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google\nScholar, MDPI,\
    \ and Web of Science, are used for selecting the relevant research articles.\n\
    These research articles are assessed and ﬁltered based on the quality criteria.\
    \ A complete\nchecklist of PRISMA (prisma-statement.org) is used for conducting\
    \ and reporting the results\nof the review.\n2.2. Research Questions\nThe following\
    \ research questions are developed to guide the systematic review:\nQ1. What deep\
    \ learning approaches are used for crop yield prediction?\nThis question helps\
    \ us to analyze both the advantages and limitations of using deep\nlearning approaches\
    \ in crop yield prediction.\nQ2. What remote sensing technologies are used with\
    \ deep learning approaches for\ncrop yield prediction?\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 1990\n3 of 21\nWith various remote sensing technologies in existence, this question\
    \ helps us to under-\nstand the suitable remote sensing technology based on the\
    \ data acquisition requirements\nfor the study of crop yield prediction, such\
    \ as land area and crop type.\nQ3. What are the vegetation indices and environmental\
    \ parameters used in crop\nyield prediction?\nAnswering this question helps us\
    \ to learn about the various features that are inﬂuenc-\ning the deep learning\
    \ approaches in crop yield prediction.\nQ4. What are the challenges in using deep\
    \ learning approaches and remote sensing\nfor crop yield prediction?\nThis question\
    \ helps us to understand the limitations and challenges in the existing\napproaches.\n\
    2.3. Procedure for Article Search\nThe approach to searching the articles is designed\
    \ based on the framed research\nquestions and the aim of the systematic literature\
    \ review. Narrowing down the focus from a\nmajor concept to the central idea of\
    \ the review helps in creating an effective search strategy.\nUsing “deep learning”\
    \ alone as a search string will generate a lot of published articles from\nvarious\
    \ application ﬁelds that are not likely related to the aim of the review and cause\
    \ the\nsearch to be complicated. Redeﬁning the search strategy as “crop yield\
    \ prediction” AND\n“remote sensing” AND “deep learning” can reduce the probability\
    \ of deviating from the\nscope of the review. Initially, by using these search\
    \ strings, the articles were retrieved from\nﬁve databases, including IEEE Explorer,\
    \ Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, and MDPI.\nFurther, to include any other\
    \ relevant studies, the following keywords, namely “crop yield\nprediction” OR\
    \ “crop yield estimation” AND “deep learning” AND “remote sensing” OR\n“artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence” AND “smart farming”, were used to retrieve the articles from the\n\
    databases. The articles from the last 10 years (2012–2022) were used for the study\
    \ as deep\nlearning approaches gained momentum after 2012 [8]. Since then, much\
    \ research has been\nconducted on deep learning approaches.\n2.4. Article Selection\
    \ Criteria\nThe retrieved articles are initially selected based on aspects such\
    \ as the quality of a\njournal, any type of remote sensing technology used for\
    \ the study, and the type of deep\nlearning approaches adopted. Analyzing the\
    \ abstracts of articles helps in understanding\nthe keywords and the selection\
    \ of articles. Exclusion of irrelevant articles was carried out\nbased on the\
    \ following criteria:\n•\nArticles that belong to the agricultural sector but\
    \ that do not fall under crop yield prediction;\n•\nPublications that include\
    \ machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction;\n•\nPublications that\
    \ have no open access;\n•\nLiterature search for articles that are published before\
    \ 2012;\n•\nArticles in different languages other than English.\nAfter applying\
    \ all the exclusion criteria, a total of 51 articles are selected. Further\nremoving\
    \ the repeated articles across the selected databases, 44 articles are selected\
    \ for\nthe review. In Figure 1, we explain the process for article selection and\
    \ rejection from\ndatabases for the review based on PRISMA. Table 1 shows the\
    \ number of articles retrieved\nafter selection criteria are applied and the number\
    \ of articles obtained after excluding the\nrepeated articles from the selected\
    \ databases. The research questions are addressed after all\nthe data from retrieved\
    \ articles are summarized and synthesized.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n4 of\

    the static regression approach and the mechanistic approach is difﬁcult due to\
    \ their limited\napplicability and uncertainty [9,10]. Many studies have used\

    5 of 21\ntreat the output, crop yield, as an implicit function of the input variables,\
    \ such as weather\ncomponents and soil conditions, which could be very complex\
    \ [11]. Moreover, supervised\nlearning approaches in machine learning fail to\
    \ capture the nonlinear relationship between\ninput and output variables [12].\
    \ However, the advancements in technology in recent years\nhave made it possible\
    \ to develop an advanced crop yield prediction model utilizing deep\nlearning.\
    \ Deep learning is a class of machine learning that uses hierarchical structures\
    \ to\nlink with the other layers, and the capability to analyze both unlabeled\
    \ and unstructured\ndata makes it a class apart from other traditional machine\
    \ learning approaches [13]. Deep\nlearning is broadly used in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld as it can analyze huge datasets, learn the\nrelationships between various\
    \ variables, and use nonlinear functions. These approaches\ncan extract features\
    \ for huge datasets in an unsupervised environment. When compared to\ntraditional\
    \ machine learning approaches, deep learning approaches perform better in fea-\n\
    ture extraction [13]. Since an accurate crop yield prediction relies on the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing\ncrop growth, deep learning has a strong ability to extract features\
    \ from available data.\nDeep neural networks have a collection of nonlinear layers\
    \ that convert the untested\ninput data into an extracted form at each layer [14].\
    \ Deep neural networks with various\nhidden layers are important to discover the\
    \ nonlinear correlation between input and\nresponse variables [14]. Nevertheless,\
    \ they are difﬁcult to train and need recently developed\nhardware and optimization\
    \ methodologies [15]. Thus, a rise in the number of hidden layers\ncan be effective\
    \ but it has some restrictions, which can be resolved by implementing\nsome techniques.\
    \ The vanishing gradient problem in deeper neural networks can be\nreduced by\
    \ making use of residual skip connections for the network [15–17]. Moreover,\n\
    the performance of deep learning approaches has been improved by undertaking various\n\
    techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), batch normalization, and\
    \ dropout.\nSome of the deep learning approaches are given below.\n3.1.1. Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks (ANN)\nArtiﬁcial neural networks are simple neural networks\
    \ that were modeled based on\nthe human brain’s neural structure [14]. The neural\
    \ network consists of nodes, which are\nconnected to each other, where the neurons\
    \ are grouped into layers. The network has three\nlayers: the input layer, the\
    \ hidden layer, and the out layer. The inputs are received by the\ninput layer\
    \ of neurons; the hidden layer with interconnected neurons performs the function\n\
    and then provides the output to the output layer [16]. Moreover, to initiate the\
    \ process,\ninitial weights are assigned randomly.\n3.1.2. Deep Neural Networks\
    \ (DNN)\nA DNN is a special kind of feed-forward neural network with many hidden\
    \ layers\nthat are fully connected. Generally, activation functions such as ReLU\
    \ and loss functions\nsuch as L2 regularization and mean squared error are used\
    \ with the hidden layers [13].\n3.1.3. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN)\nBNN uses\
    \ a neural network with Bayesian inference and probability distributions are\n\
    used as weights in BNN. Using a Bayesian neural network can prevent the problem\
    \ of\noverﬁtting without necessary validation data to evaluate the regularization\
    \ parameter [18].\nFor better accuracy, training a BNN with a large dataset can\
    \ be helpful.\n3.1.4. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)\nCompared to conventional\
    \ neural network approaches, a CNN includes layers such\nas convolution layers,\
    \ pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which helps in efﬁciently\nﬁnding\
    \ salient features within the data. The convolution layer consists of a convolution\n\
    operation and activation function, which perform feature extraction [19]. Convolution\n\
    operation includes a ﬁlter and feature map. A ﬁlter is a group of weights applied\
    \ across the\ninput and a feature map is the corresponding output for a given\
    \ ﬁlter. Moreover, a pooling\noperation is used to perform down-sampling as it\
    \ helps to detect features effectively [19].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n6 of\
    \ 21\nThe outputs are then passed through a nonlinear activation function as it\
    \ generates non-\nlinearity into the output. Fully connected (FC) layers are used\
    \ after convolution layers;\nthe network has the capacity to learn the mapping\
    \ between the feature and the target by\nincreasing the FC layers [20].\n3.1.5.\
    \ 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN\nA 2D-CNN is called a spatial method whereas 3D-CNN is called\
    \ a spatio-temporal\nmethod [16]. In a 2D-CNN, the input data are considered as\
    \ the spatial–spectral volume,\nwhere the kernel slides along the two spatial\
    \ dimensions that are across width and height.\nIn a 3D-CNN, to the two spatial\
    \ dimensions, a temporal dimension is also added. A 3D-\nCNN uses three-dimensional\
    \ kernels, which slide along width, height, and depth and help\nin generating\
    \ a 3D feature map [21]. The 3D-CNN approach is developed by implementing\n3D\
    \ convolutional layers [21].\n3.1.6. Faster R-CNN\nThe region-based convolutional\
    \ neural network (R-CNN) is predominantly used for\nobject localization and object\
    \ detection [22]. There are four different kinds of R-CNN;\nthey are R-CNN, Fast\
    \ R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN. The difference in pooling\nmethods and\
    \ region proposal methods makes the R-CNNs different and their process faster.\n\
    3.1.7. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nLSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural\
    \ network (RNN) that can learn time-\ndependent information with an appropriate\
    \ gradient-based algorithm. The LSTM com-\nprises a chain structure, which starts\
    \ with an input layer, one or more LSTM layers, and\nthe output layer. To control\
    \ the cell state and output, the LSTM uses three gates, namely\nthe input gate,\
    \ forget gate, and output gate. These gates are more likely as neural network\n\
    layers, which can control the information transfer [14]. Each cell in LSTM layers\
    \ has three\ngates; the input gate decides which information needs to be retained,\
    \ the forget gate de-\ntermines the amount of previous information that must be\
    \ forgotten and the amount of\ncurrent input that needs to be reserved, the output\
    \ gate uses both the current input and\nprevious output to decide the ﬁnal output\
    \ [23]. Tian et al. [24] proposed the ALSTM model,\nwhich had six layers, namely\
    \ one input layer, one LSTM layer, one attention mechanism\nlayer, two dropout\
    \ layers, and one output layer.\n3.2. Remote Sensing for Data Acquisition\nCrop\
    \ yield can vary according to environmental factors, climatic conditions, disease,\n\
    and other parameters. The crop growth during different stages is inﬂuenced by\
    \ these above-\nmentioned factors and this reﬂects on crop production [10]. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental\nfactors, other parameters, and crop growth can be carried\
    \ out using various instruments\nand methodologies, such as ground observation,\
    \ remote sensing, global positioning sys-\ntems, and on-ﬁeld surveying. In ground\
    \ observation and other traditional methods, it is\nchallenging to personally\
    \ acquire data for a large area and the result will be less accurate\nand unreliable\
    \ [10]. To counteract this limitation, nowadays, remote sensing is increasingly\n\
    utilized for crop monitoring.\nRemote sensing techniques provide details about\
    \ the status of crops at various growth\nlevels through the use of spectral signatures,\
    \ and all at a minimum cost when compared to\nextensive on-ﬁeld surveying. Remote\
    \ sensing technology is the acquisition and analysis\nof information about the\
    \ world and its objects by an instrument placed in the atmosphere\nor a satellite,\
    \ without any physical contact [25]. Remote sensing has the ability to produce\n\
    an adequate number of data when compared with other data acquiring techniques\
    \ such\nas ﬁeld surveying [26]. It is the process of monitoring and recognizing\
    \ places on Earth\nby measuring the emitted and reﬂected radiation with the help\
    \ of sensors [27]. Data\nacquired using remote sensing have several applications\
    \ in agriculture, which include crop\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n7 of 21\ntype\
    \ classiﬁcation, crop yield prediction, soil property detection, crop health monitoring,\n\
    weather data assessment, and soil moisture retrieval [28].\nOne of the most important\
    \ reasons to use optical remote sensing for acquiring crop\ninformation is due\
    \ to the computation of vegetation indices. Combinations of spectral\nmeasurements\
    \ at various wavelengths are known as spectral indices. They are employed\nto\
    \ derive vegetation phenology and calculate biophysical parameters [29]. Among\
    \ various\nspectral indices, vegetation indices are the desired indices signiﬁcantly\
    \ used in crop yield\nprediction. Crops in healthy condition are indicated by\
    \ strong absorption and reﬂectance of\nred and near-infrared bands [30]. The strong\
    \ difference in the intensities of the absorption\nand reﬂectance of red and near-infrared\
    \ bands can be integrated into various quantitative\nindices of the vegetation\
    \ environment. These linear or nonlinear combinational operations\nare known as\
    \ vegetation indices (VI) [31,32]. Some of the VI are the normalized difference\n\
    vegetation index (NDVI), green vegetation index (GVI), chlorophyll absorption\
    \ ratio index\n(CARI), and many others.\n3.3. Impact of Vegetation Indices and\
    \ Environmental Factors\nVegetation indices are formulated in which the sensitivity\
    \ to the vegetation character-\nistics is maximized while the factors such as\
    \ soil background reﬂectance and directional or\natmospheric effects are minimized.\
    \ Most of the vegetation indices use information involv-\ning the red and near-infrared\
    \ (NIR) canopy reﬂectances or radiances [33]. A satellite with a\nmultispectral\
    \ sensor and several bands covers the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave\n\
    infrared wavelength regions, which provides numerous vegetation indices.\nDifferent\
    \ types of vegetation indices are designed by various researchers and are\nextensively\
    \ utilized in several research areas. Even though there is some variation in these\n\
    proposed indices, all these designed indices are sensitive to biochemical attributes\
    \ and\nbiophysical parameters such as leaf angle distribution function, leaf chemical\
    \ contents, frac-\ntion of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, biomass,\
    \ fraction of green coverage,\nand leaf area index (LAI). Due to the strong correlation\
    \ between vegetation indices and\nbiophysical parameters, they are widely used\
    \ to determine the nutritional level of plants,\nmostly relative to nitrogen [34,35],\
    \ to classify vegetation and to schedule crop management.\nHowever, the phenological\
    \ stage of evaluation and the type of indices utilized inﬂuence\ntheir accuracy.\
    \ Zhao et al. [35] developed a function that established a relationship between\n\
    the crop coefﬁcient (Kc) for irrigation management and the vegetation index, and\
    \ it was\nused in water conservation. Other signiﬁcant areas where these indices\
    \ are used are the\nestimation of crop yield, protein content, biomass, weed management,\
    \ and fertilizer man-\nagement [36–38]. Some of the most commonly used indices\
    \ are the normalized difference\nvegetation index (NDVI), green vegetation index\
    \ (GVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI),\nchlorophyll absorption ratio index\
    \ (CARI), and many others.\nVarious studies have investigated how the correlation\
    \ between remotely sensed data\nand crop yield differs as a function of time in\
    \ the course of the growing season [39,40].\nThe studies have indicated that the\
    \ relationship between vegetation indices and crop\nyield varies during the crop\
    \ growth cycle [41–44]. Moreover, the relationship between\nvegetation indices\
    \ and crop yield is not consistent in every growth stage. For example, the\nsuitable\
    \ phenological growth stages for wheat to obtain spatial yield data from satellite\n\
    remote sensing are stem elongation, heading, and the development of fruit until\
    \ early\nripening [45–47]. Similarly, Ali et al. [48] proposed that the appropriate\
    \ crop growth stage\nto study the correlation between vegetation index and crop\
    \ yield and to estimate crop yield\nand biomass for oat grain was the appearance\
    \ stage of the leaf health and kernel watery\nripe stage. Most previous studies\
    \ have performed correlation analyses between vegetation\nindices, soil data,\
    \ and yield data and were mostly carried out for particular crop types,\nspeciﬁc\
    \ years, and a restricted number of vegetation indices [48–51]. The ultimate goal\n\
    in correlation analysis between vegetation indices and crop yield data is to develop\
    \ an\noptimal crop yield prediction model [52–54].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n\
    8 of 21\nFor developing a workable crop yield prediction model, it is important\
    \ to determine\nthe appropriate vegetation indices and environmental factors [55,56].\
    \ You et al. [57] pre-\ndicted corn yield using the greenness index with 90% accuracy.\
    \ Fernandes et al. [58]\nnoticed that the crop yield is inﬂuenced by vegetation\
    \ indices selection. Their study on\nmaize yield prediction showed that NDVIre,\
    \ NDVI, and GNDVI performed well for ﬁeld\nvariability. Haghverdi et al. [59]\
    \ observed that crop yield prediction with NDVIre was\nmore effective when compared\
    \ to NDVI and GNDVI. Wang et al. [60] estimated the corn\nyield by combining vegetation\
    \ indices such as the normalized vegetation index (NVDI)\nand Absorbed Photosynthetically\
    \ Active Radiation (APAR) with environmental factors\nincluding canopy surface\
    \ temperature and water stress index [56]. Further, other features,\nsuch as humidity,\
    \ nutrients, and soil information, are also used in crop yield prediction.\nAs\
    \ so many features are already used in crop yield prediction, there is less investigation\n\
    related to ﬁnding speciﬁc features majorly impacting crop yield prediction. Hence,\
    \ detailed\nresearch is essential to achieve a better overview of these variables\
    \ and factors inﬂuencing\ncrop yield prediction.\n4. Results and Discussion\n\
    The articles selected for the review are analyzed and summarized. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the\nnumber of articles published between 2012 and 2022. For the years 2012–2014,\
    \ the articles\nthat we retrieved did not satisfy the condition of using both\
    \ deep learning and remote\nsensing to predict crop yield. It is evident that\
    \ the study of crop yield prediction using\nremote sensing has increased in recent\
    \ years. Table 2 provides a detailed review of the type\nof remote sensing used\

    \ —Approaches used in literature discussion:\nFor the ﬁrst research question (RQ1),\
    \ the deep learning approaches used for crop yield\nprediction are summarized\
    \ in Table 2. Some unique approaches used are Neuroevolution\nof Augmenting Topologies\
    \ (NEAT) and YieldNet. Table 2 shows that LSTM and CNN are\nthe most used deep\
    \ learning approaches for crop yield prediction. Apart from using CNN\nand LSTM\
    \ approaches, these approaches are widely used together with CNN-LSTM, multi-\n\
    level deep learning approaches with multiple levels, and when using multimodal\
    \ fusion\napproaches. It is found that simple neural networks are least used for\
    \ crop yield prediction\nwhen using remote sensing data. The use of Neuroevolution\
    \ of Augmenting Topologies\n(NEAT) in ANN, Caffe for implementing CNN, and Faster\
    \ R-CNN are some promising\naspects of deep learning. Most of the approaches included\
    \ data-pre-processing, and in\nsome approaches, the Gaussian process was used\
    \ along with CNN and LSTM. Figure 3\nshows the distribution of crop yield prediction\

    \ \nThe overall result of this study indicates that the use of deep learning approaches\
    \ for \ncrop yield estimation has increased over the years, and the number of\
    \ articles retrieved \nfrom our initial search strategy before applying exclusion\
    \ criteria indicates the considera-\nble amount of research carried out on crop\
    \ yield prediction. However, the number of ar-\nticles using remote sensing and\
    \ deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction is still \nrelatively low.\
    \ Even after selecting possible potential articles for this review, there is a\
    \ \npossibility that some valuable articles might have been missed. However, the\
    \ effectiveness \nof this systematic literature review can be validated considering\
    \ the process adopted to \nconduct this review and the search string used to retrieve\
    \ the maximum number of articles \nrelated to this review. \n \nFigure 3. Distribution\
    \ of articles based on deep learning approaches. \n \n \nFigure 3. Distribution\
    \ of articles based on deep learning approaches.\nTable 2 shows that one of the\
    \ most frequently used deep learning approaches for crop\nyield prediction is\
    \ the convolutional neural network (CNN). It is widely used because of its\nspecial\
    \ ability to ﬁnd the important features within the data. Nevavuori et al. [20]\
    \ studied\ncrop yield prediction with a unique proﬁle of temperature and photoperiod,\
    \ developing\na region-speciﬁc deep learning model. Terliksiz and Altýlar [66]\
    \ explained that choosing\nthe right data frame for 3D-CNN is signiﬁcant for crop\
    \ yield prediction. Wolanin et al. [67]\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n11 of 21\n\
    analyzed the inﬂuence of reducing the input time series in 25 days on model performance,\n\
    and the CNN model with 10 variables had a better prediction for days during the\
    \ ﬂowering\nstage of wheat. Nevavuori et al. [85] developed 3D-CNN, ConvLSTM,\
    \ and CNN-LSTM\nfor modeling crop yield. Among them, a model with ﬁve 3D-CNN layers\
    \ had good\nperformance. Yang et al. [86] studied crop yield prediction during\
    \ the ripening stage, in\nwhich the VI-based model had poor performance as the\
    \ maximum greenness stage had\nan inﬂuence on the VIs, but the CNN with RGB and\
    \ multispectral images performed well\neven in the fully ripened stage. Yang et\
    \ al. [87] proposed a CNN approach to study corn\nyield, in which the CNN using\
    \ spectral and color image features performed well when\ncompared to the 1D-CNN\
    \ and 2D-CNN using spectral and spatial features.\nLSTM was also used extensively\
    \ in crop yield prediction, and its ability to learn\ntime-dependent information\
    \ makes it different from the other deep learning approaches.\nWang et al. [60]\
    \ studied the model performance accuracy by using a different combination\nof\
    \ remote sensing and meteorological data and soil data. The addition of soil data\
    \ was\nan advantage for the model in acquiring the spatial variability of yield.\
    \ Tian et al. [23]\nused different combinations of input data, such as a combination\
    \ of vegetation temperature\ncondition index (VTCI) and remote sensing data and\
    \ a combination of VTCI, meteorological\ndata, and remote sensing data, to identify\
    \ the best-performing wheat yield estimation\nmodel. The authors pointed out that\
    \ the incorporation of VTCI with remote sensing and\nmeteorological data can acquire\
    \ information about various inﬂuences on crop growth.\nCunha and Silva [61] studied\
    \ crop yield prediction using LSTM and performed thirty\ndifferent train–test\
    \ cycles to assess the performance. Their approach was to use weather\nand soil\
    \ data rather than satellite data as NDVI-based crop yield prediction is achievable\n\
    only after a certain plant growth stage, whereas weather-based prediction is feasible\n\
    before the planting period. Kaneko et al. [77] studied crop yield prediction in\
    \ a group of\ncountries using the LSTM approach. LSTM with Gaussian processing\
    \ performed well for\nrandom splits when compared to the chronological splits.\
    \ Jiang et al. [78] proposed an\nLSTM approach; prediction accuracy was good in\
    \ extreme weather conditions compared\nto LASSO and RF. Moreover, LSTM performed\
    \ well in learning temporal features when\ncompared to ML approaches such as RF\
    \ and LASSO. Zhang et al. [80] also found that the\ncombination of input data\
    \ performs well for crop yield prediction and estimated a suitable\nVI for crop\
    \ yield prediction. The authors trained the model with six VIs and two climatic\n\
    indices individually to choose the optimal CI, and then found the optimal combination\n\
    for crop yield prediction from the following optimal VI and environmental indices\
    \ (EI)\ncombination, optimal CI and EI combination, optimal VI and optimal CI\
    \ combination,\nand optimal VI, optimal CI, and EI combination. Incorporating\
    \ all these indices helped to\ncapture important variations in maize yield prediction.\n\
    Tian et al. [24] applied a stepwise sensitive analysis method to investigate the\
    \ signiﬁ-\ncance of each input variable in wheat yield prediction, which can help\
    \ in understanding\nthe ALSTM algorithm. ALSTM has two parts: one is the LSTM\
    \ network and the other is\nthe attention mechanism. The ALSTM’s performance was\
    \ better when compared to LSTM.\nMoreover, ALSTM has good generalization ability\
    \ and performed well even though the\nsampling sites had varied farming systems.\n\
    The CNN and LSTM approaches are combined and are studied as CNN-LSTM ap-\nproaches.\
    \ Sharma et al. [70] studied crop yield estimation using the CNN-LSTM approach.\n\
    They studied the inﬂuence of contextual information such as water bodies, farmlands,\n\
    and urban landscape in crop yield prediction by comparing it with another prediction\n\
    model using CNN-LSTM without these factors. The CNN-LSTM along with contextual\n\
    information performed well, thus improving the yield estimation. Gastli et al.\
    \ [72] used\nCNN-LSTM with Gaussian Process (GP) to predict crop yield in California\
    \ and compared\nthe approach with CNN and LSTM. It was found that CNN-LSTM with\
    \ GP performed\nbetter on data with and without moisture and histograms. When\
    \ compared to CNN\nand LSTM, the CNN-LSTM aims to capture features effectively.\
    \ Sun et al. [92] used the\nCNN-LSTM approach to study the end-of-season crop\
    \ yield prediction and compared its\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n12 of 21\nperformance\
    \ with the CNN and LSTM approaches. The CNN-LSTM-based end-of-season\nmodel performed\
    \ well when compared to both CNN and LSTM for ﬁve years. Compared\nto environmental\
    \ features, the MODIS surface reﬂectance had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the\nCNN-LSTM-based\
    \ model.\nDNN was also mostly used in crop yield prediction, either individually\
    \ or in mul-\ntimodal fusion. Cao et al. [68] compared DNN with ML approaches\
    \ such as SVM and\nrandom forest to ﬁnd the best winter wheat yield prediction\
    \ model. Jin et al. [82] stud-\nied biomass estimation using the DNN approach.\
    \ Initially, the DNN performed well for\nbiomass estimation with 15 vegetation\
    \ indices; however, the biomass estimation accuracy\nwas improved when LAI was\
    \ combined with 15 vegetation indices. Ma et al. [79] com-\npared BNN with ML\
    \ approaches, and BNN performed well in both end-of-season and\nwithin-season\
    \ crop yield prediction.\nChen et al. [22] used a region-based convolutional neural\
    \ network (R-CNN) as this\nreduces the number of proposed regions generated while\
    \ ensuring precise object detection.\nMoreover, the authors compared the R-CNN,\
    \ Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN performance\nfor detecting strawberry ﬂower and\
    \ fruit. The Faster R-CNN showed better performance\nwith the lowest training\
    \ time and had the fastest detection rate.\nMultimodal data fusion, a fundamental\
    \ method of multimodal data mining, aims\nto integrate the data of different distributions,\
    \ sources, and types into a global space\nin which both intermodality and cross-modality\
    \ can be represented uniformly [93–96].\nGavahi et al. [62] proposed a deep yield\
    \ approach by combining 3D-CNN and Conv-\nLSTM networks together. Maimaitijiang\
    \ et al. [90] used feature fusion at the input level\nand intermediate level within\
    \ a DNN framework to predict crop yield. The proposed\nmultimodal deep learning\
    \ performed well, and also when considering prediction accuracy,\nspatial adaptivity,\
    \ and robustness, the overall performance of the intermediate-level feature\n\
    fusion DNN framework was comparatively higher than the input-level feature fusion\n\
    DNN framework. Similarly, Danilevicz et al. [91] used multimodal deep learning\
    \ by\nincorporating tab-DNN, sp-DNN, a fusion module with two linear layers, and\
    \ ReLU. For\nthe fusion module input, the authors concatenated the weights from\
    \ the last layer of tab-\nDNN and sp-DNN. The approach performed well for early\
    \ crop yield prediction. However,\nin MLDL/ensembling techniques, several networks\
    \ are stacked in levels and the model\nuses the features extracted by several\
    \ networks. Moreover, Sun et al. [92] proposed the\nMLDL, which is based on combining\
    \ models together to form a single network and stacking\nit in different levels\
    \ with convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.\nA deep\
    \ residual network or ResNet is a speciﬁc type of neural network that was\nintroduced\
    \ to avoid the vanishing/gradient problem. ResNet can assist in training up to\n\
    a thousand layers of deep networks. The core element of ResNet is the residual\
    \ blocks,\nand the skip connections in ResNet help to skip any layer that affects\
    \ the performance\nof the approach using regularization [77]. The YieldNet framework\
    \ was proposed by\nKhaki et al. [97], where they used a transfer learning methodology\
    \ to share weights for the\nbackbone feature extractor. Based on this approach,\
    \ the authors predicted the yield of corn\nand soy simultaneously. Moreover, when\
    \ compared to YieldNet, other approaches such\nas 3D-CNN and DFNN required more\
    \ parameters for prediction and longer training time.\nBarbosa et al. [81] proposed\
    \ an approach called NEAT, where they used a genetic algorithm\ncalled Neuroevolution\
    \ of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) on the proposed dataset. NEAT\nis used to adjust\
    \ both topology and weight parameters in the development of the artiﬁcial\nneural\
    \ network for crop yield prediction.\nIt can be seen that CNN approaches have\
    \ performed well in dealing with data with\nsimilar features. Yang et al. [87]\
    \ used a CNN to predict crop yield at the ripening stage.\nThe CNN approach performed\
    \ well when both the test set and training set had the same\nphenological stage.\
    \ The CNN-LSTM model performs better when predicting crop yield\nwith a large\
    \ dataset [60,68,78,93]. From Table 2, based on the evaluation metrics, the\n\
    CNN- and LSTM-based approaches have better performance when compared to ANN and\n\
    DNN approaches.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n13 of 21\nFrom the study, we have\
    \ observed that multiple software programs were used to\nprocess the data and\
    \ various techniques were adopted to overcome overﬁtting in deep\nlearning approaches.\
    \ Fernandes et al. [58] used TIMESAT to extract a set of metrics from\nthe NDVI\
    \ growing curves and they only considered the unmixed sugarcane pixels while\n\
    extracting metrics for each municipality in Brazil using an Interactive Data Language\
    \ (IDL)\ntechnique. The wrapper with sequential backward elimination technique\
    \ with ANN for\nfeature extraction was carried out as input in a stacking ensemble\
    \ neural network model.\nIn order to overcome overﬁtting, the authors divided\
    \ the datasets into three parts (70%\nfor training, 10% for validation, and 20%\
    \ for testing). Haghervedi et al. [59] calculated\nvegetation indices and implemented\
    \ the ANN approach using Neurosolution V 7.1.1.1\nsoftware. The authors used the\
    \ technique of stopping the training when the mean square\nerror of the cross-validation\
    \ subset started to increase or showed no improvement after\n100 iterations to\
    \ avoid overﬁtting. For UAV images, Chen et al. [22] incorporated the\nidea of\
    \ using orthoimages to avoid the distortion of photos, and all the images were\n\
    labeled manually using the labeling program developed by the Computer Science\
    \ and\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT, MA, USA). Kaneko et al. [77] used\
    \ the surface\nreﬂectance data (all seven bands of the MOD09A1.006) and temperature\
    \ data (two bands\nof the MOD11A2.006) of MODIS to generate features such as NDVI\
    \ and EVI. The authors\nemployed the histogram dimensionality reduction approach\
    \ with LSTM to counteract\noverﬁtting as the quantity of label data might be sparse.\
    \ Nevavuori et al. [20] processed the\nirregular set of data points obtained from\
    \ the yield measurement devices as rasters of ﬁeld-\nwise yield. FarmWorks software\
    \ was used for ﬁltering and the generation of raterizable\nvector ﬁles. The authors\
    \ extracted ﬁeld-wise image data (UAV images) and yield values\nusing the sliding\
    \ window technique to obtain geolocational matching pairs of inputs and\ntargets.\
    \ To overcome the problem of overﬁtting, two distinct regularization strategies\
    \ with\nCNN, such as weight decay and early stopping, are used. The GEE-based\
    \ transformation\nwas used by Sun et al. [69] to transform an entire image collection\
    \ composed of remote\nsensing data into a 32-bin normalized histogram by country\
    \ level. The authors employed\nthe early stopping regularization technique to\
    \ reduce the generalization error in the CNN-\nLSTM model. The pooling layer with\
    \ convolution layer were used to extract features [62].\nSharma et al. [70] did\
    \ not include a pooling layer in the CNN-LSTM approach because\nof strided convolutions.\
    \ Regularization strategies such as early stopping, L2 penalty, and\nthe dropout\
    \ technique were used in CNN- and LSTM-based approaches to overcome the\nproblem\
    \ of overﬁtting.\nSome of the software and techniques used for calculating VIs,\

    \ indicates the consider-\nable amount of research carried out on crop yield prediction.\
    \ However, the number of\narticles using remote sensing and deep learning approaches\

    \ better performance of the approach. It is\nobserved that the use of remote sensing\
    \ technology for data acquisition is based on the\nrequirements of the study.\
    \ For instance, satellite images are more useful when dealing with\na large area\
    \ of land, such as a state or district. Figure 4 depicts the distribution of articles\n\

    \ 1990\n17 of 21\nas it is difﬁcult to understand the working behind the neural\
    \ networks, and understanding\nthis may help to develop a better model. Khaki\
    \ et al. [99] have trained DNN and CNN-RNN\nusing the backpropagation method to\
    \ perform feature selection for reducing the black box\nnature of the model. The\
    \ authors used this feature selection method to effectively evaluate\nthe individual\
    \ effects of weather components, soil conditions, and management variables,\n\
    as well as the time period. To improve the traceability and interpretability of\
    \ the LSTM\nmodel, recurrent network structures such as the Gated Recurrent Unit\
    \ and basic RNN,\nand advanced analytical tools such as the attention network,\
    \ can be further explored in\nthe model [67]. Moreover, as the inﬂuence of the\
    \ crop growth phase/phenological stage\nin crop yield prediction is signiﬁcant,\
    \ any change in the climatic conditions during crop\ngrowth stages can drastically\
    \ affect the plant growth, which eventually leads to variation\nin crop yield\
    \ estimation. Nevavuori et al. [85] observed the signiﬁcance of the crop growth\n\
    phase in crop yield prediction using weather information at a city scale; however,\
    \ the use\nof local temperatures and other climatic variables from local weather\
    \ stations can improve\nthe possibility to learn the accuracy of change in crop\
    \ growth stages.\nThe ANN approach was not efﬁcient to capture the variability\
    \ in micro-topography,\nwhich affected the prediction and had large model errors\
    \ for ﬁelds with high yield vari-\nability [75]. The challenge with deep learning\
    \ approaches is that large amounts of data are\nrequired to achieve good accuracy,\
    \ and also the complexity of deep learning approaches\nincreases the time complexity\
    \ of the algorithm [76]. Terliksiz and Altýlar [66] observed\nthat the results\
    \ can be affected when data frames with different cropland coverage are fed\n\
    to the 3D-CNN. Ma et al. [79] mentioned that incorporating the Bayesian deep learning\n\
    approach with another deep learning approach such as LSTM, which has the potential\n\
    to handle time-series features, can help in improving the model. Apart from the\
    \ features\nmentioned in the previous section, the inclusion of other factors\
    \ such as phenological stages,\ncrop varieties, water availability, and others\
    \ can help in the development of a potential\nmodel [69,75]. Moreover, the challenge\
    \ lies in developing an approach with potential\nvariables that is likely to perform\
    \ well for all crops or speciﬁc kinds of crops.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper has\

    \ All the studies were carried out on different types\nof crops, geological positions,\

    \ approach for crop yield prediction are better when compared to tradi-\ntional\
    \ machine learning approaches. The deep learning approaches are all equally capable\n\
    in crop yield prediction based on the factors/parameters used in the model. However,\
    \ the\nmost effective deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction are the\
    \ CNN- and LSTM-\nbased approaches. CNN has the ability to ﬁnd important features\
    \ that can inﬂuence the\ncrop yield prediction. Moreover, LSTM does not only identify\
    \ the data’s variation pattern,\nbut also the time-series data’s dependent connection\
    \ [23]. Based on this study, it is observed\nthat the vegetation indices and the\
    \ meteorological data are the most used features, where\nthe vegetation indices\
    \ explain the crops’ characteristics and the meteorological data help to\nmonitor\
    \ the climatic conditions, which has a direct inﬂuence on crop yield prediction.\
    \ It\ncan also be seen that the factors inﬂuencing crop yield prediction are selected\
    \ based on the\ncrop yield and its correlation with other factors. It is also\
    \ shown that the main challenges\nof using deep learning approaches and remote\
    \ sensing for crop yield prediction are in\nhow to improve the working model for\
    \ better accuracy, the practical implications of the\nmodel for providing accurate\
    \ information about crop yield to agriculturalists, growers, and\npolicymakers,\
    \ and the issue concerning the black box property.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n\
    18 of 21\nIn future work, we will consider conducting a systematic literature\
    \ review on articles\nthat use data from hyperspectral sensors for crop yield\
    \ prediction. Moreover, we will\ninclude the speciﬁc food crops and classify the\
    \ techniques and approaches used for different\ncrop yield predictions.\nAuthor\

    \ 2015\nAbstract. Irrigation agriculture plays an increasingly impor-\ntant role\
    \ in food supply. Many evapotranspiration models are\nused today to estimate the\
    \ water demand for irrigation. They\nconsider different stages of crop growth\
    \ by empirical crop\ncoefﬁcients to adapt evapotranspiration throughout the veg-\n\
    etation period. We investigate the importance of the model\nstructural versus\
    \ model parametric uncertainty for irrigation\nsimulations by considering six\
    \ evapotranspiration models\nand ﬁve crop coefﬁcient sets to estimate irrigation\
    \ water re-\nquirements for growing wheat in the Murray–Darling Basin,\nAustralia.\
    \ The study is carried out using the spatial deci-\nsion support system SPARE:WATER.\
    \ We ﬁnd that structural\nmodel uncertainty among reference ET is far more important\n\
    than model parametric uncertainty introduced by crop coef-\nﬁcients. These crop\
    \ coefﬁcients are used to estimate irriga-\ntion water requirement following the\
    \ single crop coefﬁcient\napproach. Using the reliability ensemble averaging (REA)\n\
    technique, we are able to reduce the overall predictive model\nuncertainty by\
    \ more than 10 %. The exceedance probability\ncurve of irrigation water requirements\
    \ shows that a certain\nthreshold, e.g. an irrigation water limit due to water\
    \ right of\n400 mm, would be less frequently exceeded in case of the\nREA ensemble\
    \ average (45 %) in comparison to the equally\nweighted ensemble average (66 %).\
    \ We conclude that multi-\nmodel ensemble predictions and sophisticated model\
    \ aver-\naging techniques are helpful in predicting irrigation demand\nand provide\
    \ relevant information for decision making.\n1\nIntroduction\n1.1\nPredicting\
    \ crop water needs\nGlobally, the proportion of freshwater consumption by agri-\n\
    culture from rainfall as well as surface and groundwater re-\nsources is large\
    \ (9087 km3 yr−1) (Hoekstra and Mekonnen,\n2012). It is projected that water demand\
    \ will increase in the\nfuture, in particular by irrigation agriculture, in order\
    \ to sup-\nport the increasing world population with food (Foley et al.,\n2011;\
    \ De Fraiture and Wichelns, 2010; Hanjra and Qureshi,\n2010; Wada and Bierkens,\
    \ 2014). Therefore, strategies based\non improved irrigation methods and local\
    \ adaptions of man-\nagement practices are likely to be implemented to anticipate\n\
    this trend. Such strategies are often developed using decision\nsupport systems\
    \ that are informed by mathematical models.\nFor example, irrigation management\
    \ has been optimized by\nmodelling and measurements for crops grown in Central\
    \ Asia\n(Pereira et al., 2009) and for irrigated cotton in the High\nPlains region\
    \ of Texas (Howell et al., 2004). Others have in-\nvestigated water use efﬁciency\
    \ (Wang et al., 2001) or crop\nwater productivity (Liu et al., 2007) by modelling\
    \ experi-\nments for irrigated crops grown in China.\nAll these models depend\
    \ on the calculation of evapotran-\nspiration (ET), which represents the evaporation\
    \ from a sur-\nface and transpiration from plants. In the case of agricultural\n\
    crops, ET is equal to the crop water needed for crop growth\nPublished by Copernicus\
    \ Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1234\nS. Multsch\
    \ et al.: Reducing uncertainty of irrigation\nand yield production. Globally,\
    \ evapotranspiration represents\nabout two-thirds of the total rainfall on land,\
    \ while evapotran-\nspiration from crops amounts to about 8 % (Oki and Kanae,\n\
    2006) and is therefore the most important term of the wa-\nter balance. The basic\
    \ concept for deriving crop water needs\nof irrigated crops has been initially\
    \ reported by Jensen (1968)\nand is proposed by Allen et al. (1998) as the single\
    \ crop coef-\nﬁcient concept. The crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration (ETc) is\nderived\
    \ from reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and a crop-\nspeciﬁc coefﬁcient (Kc):\n\
    ETc = ETo · Kc,\n(1)\nwith ETo given in millimetres and dimensionless Kc. ETo\n\
    can be calculated by standardize potential evapotranspiration\n(PET) to a short\
    \ (grass) or tall (alfalfa) reference crop. In\nthe case of the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation (Monteith, 1965;\nPenman, 1948) standardized ﬁxed values for albedo\
    \ (0.23),\nplant height (0.12 cm) and surface resistance (70 m s−1) are\nassumed\
    \ (Allen et al., 1998; Jensen et al., 1990). Kc is com-\nmonly calculated on the\
    \ basis of ﬁeld experiments (e.g. Ko\net al., 2009; da Silva et al., 2013) and\
    \ varies with the crop\ndevelopment.\nSuch an approach is part of many irrigation\
    \ management\nmodels, including Cropwat (Smith, 1992), ISAREG (Pereira\net al.,\
    \ 2009), ISM (George et al., 2000), and global crop\nwater models (Siebert and\
    \ Döll, 2010). Moreover, the sin-\ngle crop coefﬁcient concept is the basis for\
    \ the simulation of\ncrop water needs in many studies. For example, Lathuillière\n\
    et al. (2012) have derived water use by terrestrial ecosystems\nand have shown\
    \ that actual ET declines over a 10-year period\nby about 25 % in response to\
    \ deforestation and replacement\nby agriculture in Brazil. They showed that irrigation\
    \ water\nrequirement (IRR) is relevant for terrestrial water ﬂuxes, and\na reliable\
    \ estimation is crucial for the closure of the water cy-\ncle. In another study\
    \ future climate impacts on groundwater\nin agriculture areas have been investigated\
    \ (Toews and Allen,\n2009). They showed that larger return ﬂows to the ground-\n\
    water can be related to increased IRR under warmer tem-\nperatures and longer\
    \ vegetation periods. Moreover, the crop\ncoefﬁcient concept is also the basis\
    \ for the water footprint\n(volume of water consumed or polluted to produce one\
    \ unit\nof biomass) assessment of crops (Mekonnen and Hoekstra,\n2011) and has\
    \ been used to determine water requirements\nand the water footprint of the agriculture\
    \ sector in Saudi Ara-\nbia (Multsch et al., 2013). In almost all studies, researchers\n\
    use only one ETo method with a single, often spatially inde-\npendent, Kc set.\
    \ As a result, some scientists ask to use locally\nadapted Kc sets at least (Ko\
    \ et al., 2009; da Silva et al., 2013).\nFor this reason, the investigation of\
    \ predictive uncertainty of\nIRR is needed, in particular in the frame of large-scale\
    \ as-\nsessments.\n1.2\nSources of predictive uncertainty\nMajor sources of uncertainties\
    \ should be considered in the\nstudy design, quantiﬁed throughout the modelling\
    \ process\n(Refsgaard et al., 2007) and communicated as part of the\nresults to\
    \ the end users. Uncertainties related to large-scale\nestimations of the IRR\
    \ have only rarely been analysed. For\nexample, Siebert and Döll (2010) have studied\
    \ the uncer-\ntainty in predicting green (rainfall consumed by crops) and\nblue\
    \ (consumed surface and groundwater by crops in terms of\nirrigation) water consumption\
    \ by using different ETo equa-\ntions on a global scale. They observed a signiﬁcant\
    \ difference\nof blue water consumption, i.e. required irrigation, and only\n\
    a small change in green water consumption between model\nruns while using two\
    \ classical ETo equations. More recently,\nShefﬁeld et al. (2012) pointed out\
    \ that using a more up-to-\ndate parameterization of PET to calculate drought\
    \ indices led\nto different conclusions on drought occurrence globally.\nGenerally,\
    \ model predictive uncertainty can be traced back\nto four sources: input uncertainty,\
    \ output uncertainty, struc-\ntural uncertainty and parametric uncertainty (Renard\
    \ et al.,\n2010). The last two, structural and parametric uncertainty,\nare addressed\
    \ in this study with a focus on the prediction\nof IRR. As part of the parametric\
    \ uncertainty, the parame-\nterization of equations to quantify natural or anthropogenic\n\
    processes has received considerable interest, particularly in\nconceptual rainfall-runoff\
    \ modelling (Beven, 2006; Vrugt et\nal., 2009). In case of modelling crop water\
    \ needs according\nto Eq. (1), Kc is an important model parameter. Kc values for\n\
    a large number of crops are provided by the FAO56 irrigation\nguidelines (Allen\
    \ et al., 1998), which are commonly used for\nirrigation planning. However, it\
    \ has been highlighted that an\nadjustment to the global Kc is needed if the simulations\
    \ are\nused for irrigation planning on a local to regional scale (Ko\net al.,\
    \ 2009; da Silva et al., 2013). Nevertheless, it is still un-\nclear whether a\
    \ local adaption of Kc leads to a better model\nperformance. For this reason,\
    \ we quantify the parametric un-\ncertainty of model parameterization with different\
    \ Kc sets.\nThe model structure also introduces uncertainties, as any\nmodel remains\
    \ a simpliﬁcation of the real world. In the\ncontext of modelling water resources,\
    \ all hydrological and\ncrop growth models rely on the estimation of ET. Accord-\n\
    ing to Eq. (1), ETo is required to estimate crop-speciﬁc\nevapotranspiration.\
    \ ETo equations are often divided into\ncategories according to the input data\
    \ (Bormann, 2011;\nTabari et al., 2013): temperature-based equations such as the\n\
    Hargreaves–Samani (HS) equation (Hargreaves and Samani,\n1985), radiation-based\
    \ equations such as Priestley–Taylor\n(PT) (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) or combined\
    \ equations\nsuch as the FAO56 Penman–Monteith (PM56) equation\n(Allen et al.,\
    \ 1998), which further takes wind speed into ac-\ncount. Nevertheless, in many\
    \ cases it was shown that the vari-\nability among ETo methods is large (Fisher\
    \ et al., 2011; Kite\nand Droogers, 2000). Because most water resources models\n\
    Geosci. Model Dev., 8, 1233–1244, 2015\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/8/1233/2015/\n\
    S. Multsch et al.: Reducing uncertainty of irrigation\n1235\nrely on some calculation\
    \ of ETo, we see it as a crucial source\nof structural uncertainty that is rarely\
    \ considered.\n1.3\nReduction of predictive uncertainty by\nensemble modelling\n\
    Ensembles of model predictions can be developed by differ-\nent sets of model\
    \ parameterization (single-model ensemble)\nand model structures (multi-model\
    \ ensemble). The weight-\ning of model ensembles according to their ﬁt to observational\n\
    data has become of interest to reduce the uncertainty and to\nderive more robust\
    \ predictions and projections. Giorgi and\nMearns (2002) have introduced the reliability\
    \ ensemble av-\neraging (REA) technique in climate research. Basically, dif-\n\
    ferent models are weighted according to their performance\nin representing measured\
    \ data and according to the distance\nof individual models to the ensemble average\
    \ prediction to\nquantify the convergence of different models. This approach\n\
    has been applied more recently for predicting catchment ni-\ntrogen ﬂuxes (Exbrayat\
    \ et al., 2013) and calculating water\nbalances and land use interaction (Huisman\
    \ et al., 2009).\nIn a ﬁrst step, we analyse the relative contributions of the\n\
    structural and parametric model uncertainty in hindcasts of\nIRR of wheat across\
    \ the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB), Aus-\ntralia. Simulations are calculated using\
    \ the spatial decision\nsupport system SPARE:WATER (Multsch et al., 2013). In\
    \ a\nsecond step, we apply the REA methodology to reduce the\npredictive uncertainty\
    \ of IRR. The general procedure is as\nfollows:\n– The applicability of six different\
    \ ETo methods is eval-\nuated by using available measured class-A-pan evapo-\n\
    ration measurements of 34 stations in the MDB over a\n21-year time period.\n–\
    \ 30 different model realizations are set up in a multi-\nmodel ensemble by combining\
    \ various ETo equations\n(n = 6) and crop coefﬁcient data sets (n = 5).\n– IRR\
    \ is calculated by forcing the multi-model ensemble\nwith climate time series\
    \ of 21 years (monthly data) for\n3969 sites (each 1 km2 × 1 km2) in the MDB where\
    \ ir-\nrigated wheat has been grown according to the land use\nallocation in 2000.\n\
    – The 30 model realizations are weighted according to\ntheir performance in representing\
    \ measured data and\ntheir distance to the ensemble average.\nBy doing so, we\
    \ quantify structural (ETo method) and para-\nmetric (Kc set) uncertainty and\
    \ apply REA to provide a ro-\nbust estimate of IRR and the conﬁdence interval\
    \ around it.\nThe underlying research question is how can we derive better\npredictions\
    \ by using an ensemble of well-known ETo meth-\nods as well as Kc sets and which\
    \ are the likely causes of\npredictive uncertainty in IRR estimations. Finally,\
    \ we show\na procedure to reduce predictive uncertainty of IRR.\n2\nMethods and\
    \ data\n2.1\nStudy site and data\nThe MDB covers about 1 million km2 of south-east\
    \ Aus-\ntralia (Fig. 1). Irrigation agriculture in the MDB sums up to\n17 600\
    \ km2, which is equal to 65 % of the total irrigation agri-\nculture in Australia.\
    \ Total water withdrawal for irrigation in\n2006 amounted to 7.36 km3 yr−1 (ABS,\
    \ 2006). Wheat is the\nsecond most important crop grown in MDB after grazing pas-\n\
    tures, covering 3969 km2 in 2006, and was therefore selected\nfor this case study\
    \ for which IRR and its underlying uncer-\ntainty was calculated. The cropping\
    \ areas have been taken\nfrom a land use map from 2006 (ABARES, 2010) with a spa-\n\
    tial resolution of 0.01◦ × 0.01◦ (∼ 1 km × 1 km). We assume\na ﬁxed land use distribution\
    \ over time in our model study\nto clearly target the uncertainty in ETo method\
    \ and crop co-\nefﬁcients. Climate data for 1986–2006 were taken from the\nSILO\
    \ Data Drill of the Queensland Department of Natural re-\nsources and Water (https://longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/;\
    \ Jef-\nfrey et al., 2001) with a spatial resolution of 0.05◦ × 0.05◦\n(∼ 5 km\
    \ × 5 km). We used the same weather data set over\nall 3969 1 × 1 km land grid\
    \ cells overlapped by a 5 × 5 km\ngrid cell in the weather data. The model was\
    \ forced with\nmonthly data. For validation, we compared simulated ETo\nto measured\
    \ class-A pan data from 34 stations throughout\nthe MDB. The class-A pan data\
    \ were obtained from Patched\nPoint Dataset of the Queensland Department of Science,\
    \ In-\nformation Technology, Innovation and the Arts (http://www.\nlongpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/ppd/).\
    \ Measured data have been\nadjusted with monthly pan coefﬁcients according to\
    \ McMa-\nhon et al. (2013) to represent evaporation from open surface\nwater.\
    \ For stations where no pan coefﬁcient was available,\nwe used the one from the\
    \ nearest station.\n2.2\nSimulation of irrigation requirement with\nSPARE:WATER\n\
    SPARE:WATER (Multsch et al., 2013) is a spatial decision\nsupport system for the\
    \ calculation of crop-speciﬁc water re-\nquirements and water footprints from\
    \ local to regional scale.\nInput parameters for the simulation are climate data,\
    \ irri-\ngation management (irrigation water quality, irrigation efﬁ-\nciency,\
    \ irrigation method), a digital elevation model and crop\ncharacteristics such\
    \ as maximum crop height and length of\ngrowing season as well as sowing and planting\
    \ date. In a ﬁrst\nstep, the water requirement of growing a crop is simulated\n\
    for each grid cell according to the spatial resolution of the\ninput data. In\
    \ a second step, the water footprint for spatial\nentities such as administrative\
    \ boundaries or catchments is\ncalculated considering statistical data on crop\
    \ yield and har-\nvest area. Water footprints for geographic entities are given\n\
    as volume of water consumed per year (e.g. km3 yr−1) and\nwater footprints for\
    \ speciﬁc crops as volumes of water con-\nsumed per biomass (m3 t−1).\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/8/1233/2015/\n\

    \ P . The ﬁxed fraction of runoff is adapted\nfrom the default setting of the\
    \ FAO Cropwat model (Smith,\n1992). On this basis, IRR is calculated according\
    \ to Eq. (2):\nIRR = max(ETc − Peff,0),\n(2)\nwith IRR, ETc and Peff given in\
    \ millimetres. ETc is calcu-\nlated based on the single crop coefﬁcient approach\
    \ initially\nproposed by Jensen (1968) and recommended by Allen et\nal. (1998)\
    \ according to Eq. (1). The input parameters for\nthis method are the length of\
    \ four individual stages (initial\nseason, growth season, mid-season and late\
    \ season) during\nthe growing season and three related crop coefﬁcients (Kc).\n\
    These deﬁne the ratio between ETo and ETc for each part of\nthe growing season.\
    \ We have considered ﬁve different Kc\ndata sets (Table 1). The most common data\
    \ set has been\nproposed from the FAO56 Irrigation and Drainage Guide-\nlines\
    \ (Allen et al., 1998). This approach has been applied for\ncalculating crop water\
    \ footprints (Mekonnen and Hoekstra,\n2011) and is part of the widely used Cropwat\
    \ model (Smith,\n1992). It has been discussed that locally adapted Kc sets are\n\
    superior in simulating site-speciﬁc crop water requirement to\nglobal ones (Ko\
    \ et al., 2009; da Silva et al., 2013). Thus, fur-\nther data sets have been collected\
    \ from various sources which\nrepresent site-speciﬁc relationships between ETo\
    \ and ETc for\nareas in the MDB.\nETo has been calculated with six different methods\
    \ (Ta-\nble 2). Two of them are classiﬁed as combined meth-\nods (PM56, PPET),\
    \ three are radiation-based methods (PT,\nTURC, APET) and one is a temperature-based\
    \ method (HS).\nAll of them are commonly applied functions. For example,\nPM56\
    \ and HS are included in Cropwat (Smith, 1992) and\nAquacrop (Steduto et al.,\
    \ 2009), two models to quantify crop\nwater and IRR, widely used and promoted\
    \ by the FAO. The\ncropping system model EPIC (Williams, 1989) additionally\n\
    allows the use of the PT equation, while the global vegetation\nmodel LPJmL (Fader\
    \ et al., 2010) and the global water model\nWaterGap (Döll et al., 2003) are restricted\
    \ to PT. APET and\nPPET have been particularly tested for the utilization under\n\
    Australian weather conditions in several studies (Chiew et\nal., 2002; Chiew and\
    \ Leahy, 2003; Donohue et al., 2010).\n2.3\nReliability ensemble averaging\nWe\
    \ used two types of ensemble averaging techniques that\ndiffer in the weighing\
    \ technique. We calculated an equally\nweighted average of all 30 model realizations\
    \ (6 ETo meth-\nods × 5 Kc data sets) for every grid cell, which sum up to\n3969\
    \ cells (1 × 1 km) in the MDB, where irrigated wheat is\ngrown according to the\
    \ land use allocation in 2006. However,\nthis method neither considers the capability\
    \ of its ensemble\nmembers to predict a target value nor does it value the agree-\n\
    ment of model predictions amongst each other. Therefore,\nwe apply the REA technique\
    \ that was initially proposed by\nGiorgi and Mearns (2002) to reduce uncertainties\
    \ in climate\nchange projections. Moreover, it was used in impact studies\ntargeting\
    \ land use change impacts on hydrology (Huisman et\nal., 2009) and water quality\
    \ scenario projections (Exbrayat et\nal., 2013).\nThe strength of the REA method\
    \ is that it considers both\nthe quality of a model prediction (performance) and\
    \ its po-\nsition within an ensemble of prediction (convergence). The\naim is\
    \ to provide a best estimate of predictions and a robust\nassessment of the conﬁdence\
    \ interval around it. The REA\nweighting scheme estimates two factors: model performance\n\
    (RB) and model convergence (RD). RB represents the capa-\nbility of each ensemble\
    \ member to represent real-world data\nby its bias B. RD is a measure of the distance\
    \ D of a single\nmodel to the equally weighted ensemble average. Both are\nlimited\
    \ by the natural background variability (ε). The com-\nbined effect known as reliability\
    \ factor (R) is derived as\nR =\nRB\nz\n}|\n{\n\x14\nε\nabs(B)\n\x15\n·\nRD\n\
    z\n}|\n{\n\x14\nε\nabs(D)\n\x15\n.\n(3)\nIn this study, ε is calculated from measured\
    \ class-A pan evap-\noration for 34 climate stations in the study region for the\n\
    time period from 1986 to 2006. The class-A pan data have\nbeen adjusted with monthly\
    \ pan coefﬁcients for climate sta-\ntions in Australia (McMahon et al., 2013).\
    \ We calculated\nthe annual mean evaporation in millimetres for each year\nand\
    \ each station and used the 50 % conﬁdence interval (dif-\nference between the\
    \ 25 and 75 % percentile) of 224 mm to\nGeosci. Model Dev., 8, 1233–1244, 2015\n\

    \ The consideration of the difference between up-\nper and lower percentiles has\
    \ been recommended by Giorgi\nand Mearns (2002). Model performance is measured\
    \ by the\nRMSE between measured (class-A pan) and predicted ETo\nfor each model\
    \ (i).\nThe convergence criterion RD is calculated in an itera-\ntive procedure.\
    \ The difference between the average IRR of\neach ensemble member i and the ensemble\
    \ average is cal-\nculated. Under the consideration of the natural background\n\
    variability ε, a ﬁrst guess of RD (for each ensemble mem-\nber) is predicted as\
    \ well as a ﬁrst guess of the REA aver-\nage. This procedure is repeated by considering\
    \ the newly de-\nrived REA average until the ensemble convergence so that\nthe\
    \ difference between ensemble members and the REA av-\nerage cannot be reduced\
    \ by additional iterations (see Giorgi\nand Mearns, 2002, for a complete methodological\
    \ descrip-\ntion). The error of the equally weighted ensemble average is\ndescribed\
    \ by the RMSE between IRRi predicted by model\ni (with n = 30 models) and the\
    \ equally weighted ensem-\nble average irrigation water requirement (IRR). The\
    \ error of\nthe reliability ensemble average (RMSEREA) is derived from\nthe reliability\
    \ factor of each model (Ri), the irrigation wa-\nter requirement predicted by\
    \ model i (IRRi) and the REA-\nweighted ensemble average (IRRREA). The RMSE represents\n\
    an approximate 60–70 % conﬁdence interval under the as-\nsumption that the amount\
    \ of irrigation is distributed some-\nwhere between normal and uniform.\n3\nResults\n\
    3.1\nValidation of ETo methods\nWe applied six ETo equations to 34 sites in the\
    \ MDB for\nwhich measured class-A pan evaporation data were avail-\nable from\
    \ 1986 to 2006 (Fig. 2). Class-A pan data represent\nthe evaporation from an open\
    \ water surface and integrate all\nclimate factors driving evaporation such as\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, humidity and temperature. Pan evaporation differs\n\
    from evaporation from a cropped surface through a different\nalbedo, heat storage\
    \ and humidity above the surface. For this\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/8/1233/2015/\n\

    \ adjusted with site-speciﬁc pan\ncoefﬁcients. The coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ (r2) and the root\nmean square error (RMSE) are depicted for each ETo method\n\

    \ Hargreaves–Samani; PPET: point potential evapo-\ntranspiration; PT: Priestly–Taylor;\
    \ TURC: Turc).\nreason, the class-A pan data have been adjusted with monthly\n\
    pan coefﬁcients (McMahon et al., 2013) to better compare\nthem with ETo simulations\
    \ of open surface waters. On an an-\nnual average, class-A pan evaporation of\
    \ 1558 mm yr−1 was\nreduced by 9 % to 1422 mm yr−1 across all stations.\nThe\n\
    median\ndaily\nETo\nfor\nAPET\nis\n3.6 mm d−1,\nPM56 3.9 mm d−1, HS 3.8 mm d−1,\
    \ PPET 5.2 mm d−1, PT\n6.4 mm d−1 and TURC 3.4 mm d−1. According to the root\n\
    mean square error (RMSE) PM56 gave the most reliable re-\nsults. The medians of\
    \ ETo for APET, PM56, and HS are\nclose to the median of the measured evaporation\
    \ rate of\n3.7 mm d−1. Apart from PT and PPET, the other methods un-\nderestimate\
    \ ETo, especially where class-A pan data are larger\nthan 6 mm d−1. The relationship\
    \ between measured and sim-\nulated ETo is linear as shown by the coefﬁcients\
    \ of determi-\nnation r2 ranging from 77 % (PT) to 88 % (PPET).\nThe simulated\
    \ ETo is normally distributed if a single sta-\ntion and 1 year is tested (Shapiro\
    \ test for normality: α > 0.1\nfor each year and station). The difference between\
    \ the 34 sta-\ntions is up to 2 times larger than the inter-annual difference\n\
    in the 21-year period. Thus, spatial variability is larger than\ntemporal variability\
    \ in the MDB. The intra-annual variabil-\nity shows a different picture. The median\
    \ ETo in the summer\nmonths is up to 4 times larger than the ETo during winter\n\
    months for all ETo methods, except PPET and PT with a 6\ntimes larger ETo in summer\
    \ than in winter months.\nFour of the six methods simulate the measured data with\n\
    a high r2 and a low RMSE. The difference between the\nmethods itself is large,\
    \ in particular through the high ETo\nestimates by PT and PPET. Thus, the structural\
    \ uncertainty\nthrough the ETo method is substantial and needs to be con-\nsidered\
    \ for the prediction of IRR, which is addressed in the\nnext sections.\n3.2\n\
    Irrigation water requirement and its variability\nThe IRR of wheat has been simulated\
    \ using an ensemble of\n30 model realizations for each of the 3969 1 km × 1 km\
    \ irri-\ngated cells in the MDB for 21 years. Average values of IRR\nfor all model\
    \ realizations are shown in Table 3. In most cases,\nthe largest estimates are\
    \ given by the combinations of the Kc\nset Hughes with the ETo method PT. These\
    \ are almost 2.5\ntimes higher than the lowest average IRR calculated by the\n\
    combination of TURC with the Kc set Harris. It is obvious\nthat changing ETo method\
    \ results in a larger variation of cal-\nculated IRR than using a different Kc\
    \ set. Hence, the average\nIRRs give a ﬁrst idea about variability due to model\
    \ struc-\ntures and parameters.\nOver a large watershed such as the MDB, local\
    \ differences\nin IRR may be large while catchment-wide water manage-\nment plans\
    \ deﬁne thresholds for water withdrawal, for exam-\nple due to water rights or\
    \ water resources protection mea-\nsures. A given threshold may require heterogeneous\
    \ local\nadaptations of irrigation management and a change in crop-\nping patterns.\
    \ Figure 3 shows the probability that a certain\namount of IRR is exceeded in\
    \ the MDB on average over the\n21-year period. It illustrates the range of IRR\
    \ predicted by\nthe ensemble of all 30 model realizations for each grid cell.\n\
    Two groups can be identiﬁed that are separated by ETo meth-\nods. The ﬁrst group\
    \ is composed of PPET and PT calcula-\ntions. In this case, IRR is up to twice\
    \ as high as compared to\npredictions by other models. The second group is formed\
    \ by\nAPET, HS, PM56 and TURC with substantially lower calcu-\nlations of less\
    \ than 500 mm in most cases. We note that the\nparametric uncertainty is almost\
    \ negligible compared to the\nuncertainty introduced by the various ETo methods.\n\
    3.3\nEnsemble averaging, uncertainty and weighting\nEnsemble predictions have\
    \ become an important tool to\naccount for different model structures and parameters\n\
    (Exbrayat et al., 2013; Huisman et al., 2009; Wada et al.,\n2013). The consideration\
    \ of ensembles is especially helpful\nto increase our conﬁdence in simulations\
    \ when no validation\ndata are at hand, such as projections of Earth’s future\
    \ cli-\nmate under speciﬁed emission scenarios. Here we apply the\nconcept of\
    \ ensemble prediction to simulations of IRR. Two\ndifferent ensemble averages,\
    \ expressed as the exceedance\nprobability of the IRR of wheat, are shown in Fig.\

    \ (IRRREA, red\nline, see methods description) that weights predictions based\n\
    on their performance and agreement with other ensemble\nmembers. This prevents\
    \ dismissing some model structure, a\nprocess that can be rather subjective. Also,\
    \ even an overall\npoorly performing model can contribute to the optimal in-\n\
    formation extracted from the ensembles (Viney et al., 2009)\nor may outperform\
    \ better performing models once boundary\nconditions are changed (Exbrayat et\
    \ al., 2013).\nWe use the inverse of the cumulative daily RMSE (Fig. 2)\nof the\
    \ ETo methods during the growing season to calcu-\nlate the criterion RB (RMSE\
    \ 154 mm for APET, 123 mm\nfor PM56, 142 mm HS, 232 mm PPET, 373 mm PT, 166 mm\n\
    TURC). The convergence criterion RD was calculated based\non the difference of\
    \ the predicted irrigation given by a sin-\ngle ensemble member and the equally\
    \ weighted ensemble\naverage (see Sect. 2.3). Overall, the PT model combinations\n\
    have the lowest reliability factors of between 0.51 and 0.6\nfollowed by PPET\
    \ with 0.96, a result driven by the poorer\nperformance of these methods to simulate\
    \ pan evaporation\n(Fig. 2), and the outlying positions of simulations using PT\n\
    and PPET (Fig. 3). All other models are weighted similarly,\na result in accordance\
    \ with the similar performance and sim-\nulated values exhibited by these methods\
    \ (see Table 4 for\ndetails).\nThe application of the reliability factor leads\
    \ to a decrease\nof the calculated total IRR in each grid cell as well as to\n\

    \ weighted and the\nREA-weighted ensemble averages are shown in Fig. 5a and\n\
    b. The equally weighted average of IRR ranges between 124\nand 691 mm with an\
    \ average across the MDB of 424 mm\n(Fig. 5a). Thus, spatial variability is large\
    \ and western and\nnorthern areas require 5–6 times more irrigation than in the\n\
    south-east. The REA-derived average IRR ranges between\n104 and 663 mm across\
    \ the river basin (Fig. 5b) with an av-\nerage of 405 mm. Depending on the location\
    \ this value is\nup to 18 % lower as compared to simulations based on the\nequally\
    \ weighted average (Fig. 5c). Also, the uncertainty\nrange decreases as a consequence\
    \ of the REA method by\nabout 10 % across the MDB with maximum values of around\n\
    26 % when comparing equally weighted and REA-weighted\nRMSE (Fig. 5d–f). The largest\
    \ change in uncertainty can be\nfound in the south-east of the MDB and also in\
    \ areas towards\nthe east (Fig. 5f). Thus, REA leads not only to a decrease of\n\
    predicted IRR but also to a reduction of its uncertainty. The\nuncertainty is\
    \ reduced because the REA is drawn toward the\ngroup of the better ETo methods\
    \ that also agree well between\nthemselves.\n4\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe\
    \ simulation of IRR strongly varies amongst ETo meth-\nods. Bormann (2011) recommended\
    \ that the selection of the\nETo method should be based on the validation of ETo\
    \ with\nreal-world observations rather than only on the availability of\nclimate\
    \ input data. This is due to the general large variabil-\nity among ETo methods,\
    \ which was also revealed in a study\nwhere PT was set as a benchmark model and\
    \ the RMSE be-\ntween ETo methods was analysed (McMahon et al., 2013).\nLikewise,\
    \ the inﬂuence of a single ETo method on the pre-\ndiction of crop yields was\
    \ also reported for an agriculture\nsite in Europe (Balkoviˇc et al., 2013) where\
    \ ETo estimates by\nPT were 40 % higher and those by Penman–Monteith 10 %\nlower\
    \ in comparison to HS. We also found a large variability\namong ETo methods in\
    \ our study. However, similar ranges\nacross Australia for ETo have been reported\
    \ by others (Chiew\net al., 2002) for APET, PPET and PM56 as well as lower\nvalues\
    \ for PT. Lascano et al. (2010) as well as Lascano and\nVan Bavel (2007) have\
    \ shown that methods to calculate ETo\nbased on combination methods, i.e. Penman–Monteith,\
    \ tend\nto underestimate ET by as much as 25 %, especially in dry\nclimates.\n\
    Bormann (2011) further recommended that the reliabil-\nity of ETo equations should\
    \ be tested in a spatial context,\nespecially if applied on large scale. For various\
    \ regions\nacross Australia, a large range of mean annual ETo between\n1700 mm\
    \ (PT) and 3670 mm (PPET) was reported (Donohue\net al., 2010). To investigate\
    \ the spatial heterogeneity within\nthe MDB we analysed results of the 34 class-A\
    \ pan stations.\nOverall, the performance of four of the ETo methods was\ngood\
    \ with RMSEs around 1 mm day−1, except for three sta-\ntions in the north. PPET\
    \ performed less well with RMSE\nincreasing to 2 mm day−1 while the PT value ranged\
    \ up to\n4 mm day−1. However, we found no consistent spatial pat-\ntern. We are\
    \ aware that the utilization of class-A pan data\ncomes along with uncertainties.\
    \ We did not assume that the\ndata are error-free, but for the application of\
    \ REA, a com-\nparison of model simulations and observations is needed to\ncalculate\
    \ the model performance criterion. We could have\ntreated PM56 as being an “observation”\
    \ in terms of a bench-\nmark model. However, we think that a more independent\
    \ test\nis more appropriate in the sense of REA and therefore de-\ncided to use\
    \ those observations that are at hand: class-A pan\nobservations. To account for\
    \ the difference of class-A pan\nevaporation and reference crop ET, we used a\
    \ commonly ap-\nplied correction factor (pan coefﬁcients according to McMa-\n\
    hon et al., 2013) to derive crop ET from class-A pan mea-\nsurements. Most often,\
    \ ET estimates are not compared to any\nmeasurements at all, leaving modellers\
    \ with no information\non how good their model application is. We therefore think\n\
    that a comparison to class-A pan is for sure not perfect but\nbetter than not\
    \ testing at all.\nETo estimates using the PM56 method revealed the best\nperformance\
    \ criteria in our study. PM56 considers the most\nmeteorological input parameters\
    \ – thereby possibly best rep-\nresenting the altering dry and wet conditions\
    \ across the MDB\nover the year. The better performance of physically based\n\
    equations in comparison to more empirical approaches for\nthe simulation of ETo\
    \ has also been reported by others\n(Donohue et al., 2010). PT performed least\
    \ well in our study\nand resulted in up to 2 times larger estimates than other\

    \ This is somewhat contrasting with other studies\n(Chiew et al., 2002; Donohue\
    \ et al., 2010) where PT gave\nlower ETo values in comparison to methods such\
    \ as APET\nand PPET. One reason is that Donohue et al. (2010) have\nconsidered\
    \ the actual albedo from remotely sensed vegeta-\ntion cover (Donohue et al.,\
    \ 2008) for the estimation of the\nnet incoming solar radiation. In our calculations,\
    \ an albedo\nof a reference crop 0.23 (short crop, i.e. grass) has been con-\n\
    sidered according to the guidelines for ETo from Allen et\nal. (1998). Another\
    \ likely reason for this observation is that\nthe PT equation is based on the\
    \ Penman–Monteith equation\nin which the aerodynamic term is replaced by a constant\
    \ (α)\nwhich is commonly set to 1.26 under Australian climatic con-\nditions (Chiew\
    \ and Leahy, 2003) and which we also applied.\nThe consideration of region-speciﬁc\
    \ α for the MDB could\nhave increased the performance of PT in our study. The\
    \ HS\nequation is commonly applied in situations where meteo-\nrological data\
    \ are scarce, because the equation depends on\nmore readily available temperature\
    \ and extraterrestrial radia-\ntion derived from latitude and day of the year.\
    \ A reason for\nits good performance in our study could be that the semi-arid\n\
    climate in most of the MDB is favourable for the HS equa-\ntion, which is supported\
    \ by Tabari (2010), who concludes\nthat HS is a good candidate model for warm\
    \ humid and semi-\narid sites but fails under cold humid climates. However, the\n\
    poor response of HS to changing climatic boundary condi-\ntions has also been\
    \ criticized in a study on global drought\nsimulations (Shefﬁeld et al., 2012).\n\
    We combined the six ETo methods with ﬁve Kc sets to ad-\ndress stochastic parametric\
    \ uncertainty for irrigated wheat in\nthe MDB. We show that the ETo method uncertainty\
    \ range\nexceeded the uncertainty range of Kc sets. Thus, the Kc\nsets have a\
    \ minor inﬂuence on predicted IRR. At ﬁrst sight,\nthis seems to be contrasting\
    \ to others who have stated that\nadapted, regional Kc sets are required to estimate\
    \ reliable\nIRR rates. For instance, da Silva et al. (2013) reported that Kc\n\
    sets from FAO56 lead to errors in plot-scale irrigation plan-\nning under tropical\
    \ conditions. Similar observations were re-\nported for semi-arid conditions in\
    \ the Texas High Plains re-\ngion (Ko et al., 2009), highlighting the importance\
    \ of region-\nally based Kc sets. While regional adaptation of Kc might be\nimportant\
    \ at smaller scales, e.g. on the farm level, we con-\nclude that large-scale applications\
    \ do not necessarily need to\nfocus on this potential contribution of uncertainty.\
    \ Rather, ef-\nfort should be put into ﬁnding appropriate ETo methods or –\neven\
    \ better – utilize ensemble predictions to cover a more\nrealistic range of predictions.\
    \ Our study conﬁrms this latter\nrecommendation, as we could not identify a single\
    \ best ETo\nmethod for the MDB. Especially in cases where no data for\na direct\
    \ evaluation of model results are available, the appli-\ncation of model ensembles\
    \ gives insight to the predictive un-\ncertainty, e.g. being helpful in the development\
    \ of best man-\nagement practices (Exbrayat et al., 2013), study of land use\n\
    (Huisman et al., 2009), and climate change (Exbrayat et al.,\n2014).\nBesides\
    \ the uncertainty introduced by local to global Kc\nvalues, the utilization of\
    \ the single crop coefﬁcient concept\nitself comes along with errors, which are\
    \ not addressed in this\nstudy. For example, Lascano (2000) shows how Kc varies\
    \ as\na function of time (50 days) and how it changes when using a\ndaily, 3-day,\
    \ and 8-day moving average. Moreover, the tem-\nporal resolution of ETo calculation\
    \ (i.e. hourly vs. daily) is an\nwww.geosci-model-dev.net/8/1233/2015/\nGeosci.\

    \ of irrigation\nimportant component and errors associated with the method\nof\
    \ irrigation (surface, drip, sprinkler) cannot be neglected,\nbut they are beyond\
    \ the uncertainty calculation of this study.\nWe acknowledge that we do not consider\
    \ uncertainties in\nboundary conditions (e.g. land-use management options, cli-\n\
    matic variability) although these may be non-negligible. For\nexample, Bocchiola\
    \ et al. (2013) reported that changes in fu-\nture precipitation regimes will\
    \ have the greatest impact on\nthe calculated water footprint (reﬂecting high\
    \ ET rates) of\nmaize in Italy and that changes in CO2 and warming were\nless\
    \ important. Conversely, water use was more driven by\nagricultural management\
    \ than by regional climatic variation\nin a water footprint analysed for an irrigation\
    \ district in China\n(Sun et al., 2013). Statistical correction of model forcing\
    \ data\n(such as bias correction of precipitation) has also been re-\nported to\
    \ alter ET estimates as shown by Ye et al. (2012)\nfor the Upper Yellow River\
    \ in China with changes of up to\n29 % of ET. Beyond that, the forcing data themselves\
    \ intro-\nduce additional uncertainties. However, this is not part of\nthis study\
    \ and it would clearly go beyond the scope of our\nwork presented here. Nevertheless,\
    \ on the long term more\nresearch needs to be done on the investigation of the\
    \ global\npredictive uncertainty of models, where all sources of uncer-\ntainty\
    \ are evaluated, i.e. spatial input data uncertainty (e.g.\nsoil and land use\
    \ information), model forcing data uncer-\ntainty (e.g. climate data), parameter\
    \ uncertainty, and model\nstructure uncertainty. Thus, an even more complete picture\n\
    of global model uncertainty can only be shown by consider-\ning all sorts of predictive\
    \ uncertainty, including model input\ndata, validation data, and spatial input\
    \ data in addition to the\nimpact of model structural and parametric uncertainty\
    \ as pre-\nsented here.\nHowever, we argue that future management practices or\n\
    the impact of climate change cannot be reliably evaluated\ndue to the large uncertainty\
    \ that exists in the ETo method, the\nbasis of water resources modelling. We partially\
    \ cope with\nthis problem by applying the REA technique to extract the\nmost relevant\
    \ information from our simulations. The advan-\ntage of REA in decision making\
    \ has already been shown for\nother ﬁelds of research, such as the development\
    \ of N re-\nduction scenarios to improve surface water quality (Exbrayat\net al.,\
    \ 2013) and estimation of the effect of land use change\non water budgets and\
    \ hydrological ﬂuxes (Huisman et al.,\n2009). Despite the growing importance of\
    \ IRR for today’s\nagriculture (Siebert and Döll, 2010) and the effect on surface\n\
    (Hoekstra et al., 2012) and groundwater (Wada et al., 2010)\nresources, few studies\
    \ have dealt with the predictive uncer-\ntainty of this requirement (e.g. Wada\
    \ et al., 2013) and how to\nreduce it.\nAcknowledgements. We acknowledge the generous\

    \ \n \n \n \nOPEN ACCESS\nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2328 \n \n \n1. Introduction\
    \ \nIn recent decades, a fast population growth along with high rates of urbanization\
    \ has exacerbated \nthe pressure on water managers to meet urban water requirements.\
    \ Such a pressure is substantially \ngreater for municipalities in arid/semi-arid\
    \ regions (e.g., western USA), where water resources are \nscarce and in high\
    \ demand. Besides the effects of population growth, some of the predicted changes\
    \ in \nclimate, such as higher summer temperatures, prolonged droughts, and less\
    \ snow pack in the \nmountains will influence both supply and demand in such a\
    \ way that meeting urban water \nrequirements will be even more challenging in\
    \ the future. Boland [1] argued that since freshwater is \nover-allocated in many\
    \ parts of the world and it is not feasible to make new water resources available,\
    \ \nthe best solution to mitigate possible consequences of climate change relies\
    \ in demand management \nrather than in supply development. Even in the regions\
    \ where developing new water supplies is still \nfeasible, long-term planning\
    \ and significant monetary investments are required for building additional \n\
    infrastructure to store water. Demand management, however, is less time and money\
    \ consuming and \nless dependent on the uncertain effects of climate change [1].\
    \ \nIn arid/semi-arid areas, landscape watering could be significantly larger\
    \ than other uses of fresh \nwater by urban residents (e.g., hygiene, drinking,\
    \ cooking). Kjelgren et al. [2] reported that landscape \nirrigation accounts\
    \ for about one third of the annual municipal water use of Denver, CO, USA. It\
    \ \nshould be noted that such an estimate includes winter months, when landscape\
    \ water use is negligible. \nHence, the same ratio would be significantly larger\
    \ if winter months are excluded. For instance, \nCooley and Gleick [3] reported\
    \ that landscape water use during summer months can reach up to 90% \nof the total\
    \ municipal water use in southwestern USA. This is mainly due to the fact that\
    \ in these areas \nsummer rainfall is not sufficient to provide landscape vegetation\
    \ with the amount of water needed to \nachieve the level of aesthetic appearance\
    \ that is desired by home and business owners and therefore \nirrigation is intensified.\
    \ Hence, improving landscape irrigation management is necessary to foster \nsustainable\
    \ management of urban water resources in the western USA [4]. Turfgrass has been\
    \ the \nfocus of irrigation studies during the past few decades, as it is one\
    \ of the most dominant components of \nurban landscapes [5]. Carrow [6] categorized\
    \ the methods for identifying the appropriate timing of \nturfgrass irrigation\
    \ into three groups: (i) based on soil moisture depletion; (ii) based on climatic\
    \ data \nand reference evapotranspiration; and, (iii) using canopy characteristics\
    \ such as temperature and \nvisible signs of stress. The third approach seems\
    \ to have received more attention in comparison to the \nformer methods. For example,\
    \ visible rating of turfgrass quality has been extensively utilized by \nresearchers\
    \ and practitioners. However, visual assessment is a subjective process that highly\
    \ depends \non the assessor’s definition of aesthetically appealing. Bell et al.\
    \ [7] found that visual rates of turfgrass \nquality were inconsistent among three\
    \ human evaluators. In addition, several researchers have used a \nvisual rating\
    \ scale of one to nine [8–10], while others have employed a range of one to ten\
    \ [11,12] or \none to six [13]. Developing objective and easy-to-use methods of\
    \ irrigation scheduling can lead to \nwater conservation and can prevent the loss\
    \ of nutrients from turfgrass systems [2]. \nOptical and thermal remote sensing\
    \ techniques can be used by turf managers in a consistent and \nnon-destructive\
    \ fashion to evaluate the quality and irrigation needs of turfgrass systems, before\
    \ stress \nsigns intensify enough to become perceptible to human eyes [7,9,14–16].\
    \ Previous studies have \nshowed that spectral reflectance of turfgrass in different\
    \ visible and near-infrared portions of the \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2329 \n \n\
    \ \nelectromagnetic (EM) spectrum is sensitive to several factors including, but\
    \ not limited to: fertilizer \nand herbicide application rates [9,12]; carbon\
    \ concentrating mechanism (C3 vs. C4 grasses) [9]; \nirrigation amount and uniformity\
    \ [14]; and, management practices such as mowing height [11]. In \naddition to\
    \ optical remote sensing, several thermal remote sensing methods have been used\
    \ in \nquantifying turfgrass water stress and water consumption. In particular,\
    \ the Crop Water Stress Index \n(CWSI) has proved to be an effective method compared\
    \ to other irrigation scheduling methods [17]. \nAs a dimensionless ratio, CWSI\
    \ determines where the measured temperature differential between plant \ncanopy\
    \ and air (dT) falls on a range of possible values for any given climatic condition.\
    \ The lower \nlimit of this range corresponds to non-water-stressed conditions,\
    \ when the rate of vegetation water use \nor evapotranspiration (ET) is only limited\
    \ by atmospheric demand (i.e., water vapor deficit). As \ntranspiring water is\
    \ the main process responsible for cooling plants, the upper limit of dT is reached\
    \ \nwhen there is no water available to be used by the plant (non-transpiring\
    \ conditions). There are two \ndifferent approaches to estimate CWSI: (i) physically-based\
    \ [18]; and (ii) empirical [19]. In the former \napproach, lower and upper limits\
    \ of dT are modeled based on the partitioning of the available energy at \nthe\
    \ vegetative surface into sensible and latent heat fluxes. Hence, it requires\
    \ numerous environmental \nvariables before it can be applied. The latter approach,\
    \ however, requires only a few easy-to-obtain \nvariables that are used to define\
    \ linear regression relationships (baselines) between the upper (non-\ntranspiring)\
    \ and lower (non-water-stressed) limits of dT and the atmospheric water vapor\
    \ pressure \ndeficit (VPD). \nSince the CWSI method is implemented in this study\
    \ to evaluate the presence and severity of stress in \nturfgrass communities (and\
    \ not agricultural crops), the term Grass Water Stress Index (GWSI) will be used\
    \ \ninstead hereafter. Both the physically-based and the empirical approaches\
    \ of GWSI have been previously \nimplemented to study water stress in turfgrass\
    \ systems under varying hydro-climatological conditions. \nSeveral researchers\
    \ have reported that the empirical approach fails to provide an accurate estimation\
    \ of dT \nbaselines for different turfgrass species such as bermudagrass (Cynodon\
    \ dactylon L.) [20], Kentucky \nbluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) [21], creeping bentgrass\
    \ (Agrostis stolonifera L) [10,21], and tall fescue \n(Festuca arundinacea L.)\
    \ [22,23]. All of these studies have reported that the poor performance was \n\
    mainly due to the fact that upper and lower dT limits were not only a function\
    \ of VPD, but also the \nincoming irradiance. For example, Jalali-Farahani et\
    \ al. [20] observed about three units of increase in \nthe intercept of the non-water-stressed\
    \ baseline when net radiation increased from 200 to 600 W·m−2. \nPayero et al.\
    \ [23] also reported 5.7 units of increase in intercept and 1.2 units of decrease\
    \ in slope of \nthe non-water-stressed baseline as solar radiation increased from\
    \ zero to 1,000 W·m−2. A similar study \nof several crops showed that the lower\
    \ dT limit under shaded conditions was always smaller than the same \nvalue under\
    \ sunlit conditions, with a 3.8 °C difference on average at VPD of 3.6 kPa [24].\
    \ Such a \ndependence on incoming irradiance was not observed when the method\
    \ was developed by Idso et al. [19], \nsince input data were all collected close\
    \ to solar noon and only if “the crops did not experience \nsignificant shading\
    \ due to clouds.” Therefore, it is not surprising that the empirical approach\
    \ does not \nperform well under conditions different that those it was developed\
    \ under. The effect of incoming \nirradiance would be negligible if the clear-sky\
    \ guidelines are followed in estimating dT limits based on \nthe empirical approach.\
    \ \nThe present study was conducted in northern Colorado in the semi-arid western\
    \ USA in order to \nfind out if optical and thermal remote sensing techniques\
    \ were efficient in monitoring the quality, \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2330 \n \n\
    \ \nwater stress, and water use of several turfgrass species under different soil\
    \ and irrigation treatments. \nMore specific research objectives were as follows:\
    \ \n• \nTo investigate the sensitivity of several vegetation indices to soil preparation\
    \ and water \napplication treatments in order to explore the possibility of replacing\
    \ them with the traditional \nvisual rating, performed by human assessors; \n\
    • \nTo estimate the GWSI based on the empirical approach and to identify the effects\
    \ of \nexperimental treatments on this stress indicator; \n• \nTo compare the\
    \ performance of several turfgrass species under limited levels of water \navailability;\
    \ and, \n• \nTo estimate turfgrass water use based on the GWSI approach, as well\
    \ as a complex surface \nenergy balance model. \nTo the best of our knowledge,\
    \ the GWSI method has been mainly used to identify the timing of \nirrigations.\
    \ Hence, using GWSI to estimate turfgrass water use will assist irrigation managers\
    \ to \nidentify both the timing and the amount of irrigation events, using the\
    \ same index. \n2. Methods and Materials \n2.1. Study Area  \nThis experiment\
    \ was conducted during the summer of 2011 (20 July–27 September) at the \nConservation\
    \ Gardens (Lat: 40°19.3′, Long: −105°4.6′, Alt: 1,548 m) in Berthoud, northern\
    \ Colorado, \nUSA. The Conservation Gardens are a research and demonstration site\
    \ developed and managed by the \nIrrigation Management Department at the Northern\
    \ Colorado Water Conservancy District (Northern \nWater hereafter). This site\
    \ was established to provide landscape owners and professionals with \ninformation\
    \ on water-conserving practices and it includes several turfgrass species under\
    \ different soil \nand water treatments. Figure 1 demonstrates a false-color multispectral\
    \ airborne image of the study \nsite. The experiment focused on two major treatments.\
    \ The first treatment was a variable irrigation \ndepth treatment (treatment I\
    \ hereafter), where sprinklers were installed at only one side of five \nrectangular\
    \ plots, resulting in a water application rate that decreased with distance from\
    \ sprinklers. For \neach turfgrass plot, remote sensing readings were taken at\
    \ four distances from the line-source \nsprinklers, namely 1.0, 2.1, 3.3, and\
    \ 4.5 m. According to irrigation application records (audit), the \naverage irrigation\
    \ rate was about 13 mm·h−1 at the closest distance, which resulted in a total\
    \ \napplication depth of 190 mm during the study period. As a result, the Water\
    \ Application Adequacy \n(WAA), defined as the ratio of applied water (gross depth\
    \ of irrigation and precipitation) divided by \nthe total grass reference ET (ETo)\
    \ during the same period was 74%. At the farthest distance, irrigation \nrate\
    \ was only 5 mm·h−1, resulting in a total irrigation depth of 73 mm and a WAA\
    \ of 38%. The five \nplots of turfgrass mixes or blends included in this treatment\
    \ were: \n(i) Warm-season mix, WSM: a mixture of 70% blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis\
    \ L.) and 30% \nbuffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides L.); \n(ii) Aggressive Kentucky\

    Turfgrass spectral reflectance was obtained using a hand-held, multi-spectral\
    \ radiometer (model \nMSR5, CROPSCAN Inc., Rochester, MN, USA) that was equipped\
    \ with two sets of upward- and \ndownward-looking detectors in five wavebands\
    \ centered at blue (485 nm), green (560 nm), red \n(660 nm), near infrared (NIR,\
    \ 830 nm), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1650 nm) parts of the EM \nspectrum.\
    \ These wavebands are selected in a fashion to be compatible with sensors on-board\
    \ the \nLandsat Thematic Mapper 5 satellite. Each sensor has a 28° field of view\
    \ (FOV), resulting in a circular \ntarget area with a diameter that is half of\
    \ the height of radiometer above the target. Downward looking \nsensors detect\
    \ reflected radiance in the mentioned five bands, while the upward looking sensors\
    \ \nmeasure the incoming radiation through a flashed, opal glass, cosine diffuser.\
    \ Obtained information \nwas then sent to a multichannel data-logger controller,\
    \ where surface reflectance in each band was \ncomputed as the ratio of downward\
    \ to upward radiations considering temperature and sun angle cosine \ncorrection\
    \ [25]. To be able to measure turfgrass temperature, a pre-calibrated infrared\
    \ thermometer or \nIRT (model IRt/c.2, Exergen Corp., Watertown, MA, USA) with\
    \ a 35° FOV was attached to the MSR5 \nradiometer. Measurements of IRT were synchronized\
    \ with radiometer measurements and all of the \ndata were sent to the data-logger\
    \ controller for analyses and recording. Turfgrass temperature and \nreflectance\
    \ were measured using the combined IRT/radiometer on seven dates during the 70\
    \ days of \nstudy period. The entire data collection over all plots took 37 minutes\
    \ on average and it was always \nwithin two hours of the solar noon, under cloud-free\
    \ conditions. To take the readings, the sensors were \nheld at a nadir view angle\
    \ and about 1 m above the surface. In order to provide more replication in \n\
    space, four readings were taken over different spots of each experimental plot.\
    \ This resulted in four \nreadings for each level of treatment I and eight readings\
    \ for each level of treatment S, since the latter \ntreatment had two replicates.\
    \ The average of four/eight readings was used in the analysis. \n2.3. Vegetation\
    \ Indices \nThe optical remote sensing data collected by the multi-spectral radiometer\
    \ were further analyzed to \nassess the effects of turfgrass species and implemented\
    \ treatments on spectral signatures. Three \nVegetation Indices (VIs) were calculated\
    \ and used in the analyses to explore the potentials and \nlimitations of utilizing\
    \ VIs as an alternative to the traditional visual rating approach that is currently\
    \ \nimplemented by turfgrass professionals. These VIs were the Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index \n(NDVI) [26], the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) [27],\
    \ and the Visible Atmospherically \nResistant Index (VARI) [28]: \nNDVI = (ρ830\
    \ – ρ660)/(ρ830 + ρ660) \n(1) \nSAVI = (1.0 + L) (ρ830 – ρ660)/(ρ830 + ρ660 +\
    \ L) \n(2) \nVARI = (ρ560 – ρ660)/(ρ560 + ρ660 – ρ485) \n(3) \nwhere ρ485, ρ560,\
    \ ρ660, and ρ830 are surface reflectance in the blue, green, red, and NIR parts\
    \ of the EM \nspectrum. The parameter L is a coefficient that changes with canopy\
    \ density, but a value of 0.5 is \nfound to be a good representative over a wide\
    \ range of densities [27]. \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2334 \n \n \nThe NDVI was\
    \ selected in this study because it is one of the most commonly used VIs and previous\
    \ \nstudies have shown that it is highly correlated with turfgrass visual assessment\
    \ rates [7,11,12,29]. \nCompared to other VIs, NDVI is more sensitive to sparse\
    \ vegetation, which makes it ideal for \nevaluating turfgrass growth and quality.\
    \ A major caveat, however, is that this VI becomes less \nsensitive at denser\
    \ canopies. Since turfgrass is usually kept at a very short height (unlike many\
    \ \nagricultural crops), the saturation of NDVI would not impose a major challenge\
    \ for turfgrass \nmanagement. The selection of SAVI was based on the fact that\
    \ it is efficient in minimizing the effect \nof soil surface wetness. In other\
    \ words, when underlying soil is viewed by the remote sensing sensor, \nwet and\
    \ dry soil surfaces would not cause a significant variation in the value of SAVI\
    \ [27]. Finally, \nVARI was utilized in this study because it is based on the\
    \ reflectance in only the visible part of the EM \nspectrum, and thus it would\
    \ provide a quantification of turfgrass quality that is the closest to human’s\
    \ \neye perception. This VI is developed in a fashion to be less sensitive to\
    \ the effect of atmosphere on \nradiation attenuation [28]. As a result, it can\
    \ be successfully applied to air- and space-borne imagery \nwithout the need to\
    \ account for the atmospheric optical thickness. The visible radiation is reflected\
    \ at \nthe topmost layer of the canopy. Hence, VARI can be interpreted as a color\
    \ indicator. The NDVI and \nSAVI, on the other hand, take into account the reflected\
    \ radiation in NIR waveband, which interacts with \nmore layers of leaves. Thus,\
    \ NDVI and SAVI can be regarded as plant growth and health indicators.  \n2.4.\
    \ Grass Water Stress Index \nThe GWSI can be estimated using the following equation\
    \ [18,19]: \nGWSI = (dTm − dTLL)/(dTUL − dTLL) \n(4) \nwhere dT is the temperature\
    \ difference between the turfgrass canopy and the air, measured at a height \n\
    above the canopy. Subscripts m, LL, and UL represent measured, lower limit, and\
    \ upper limit of dT, \nrespectively. All of the variables in Equation (4) have\
    \ the units of temperature, resulting in a \ndimensionless ratio that theoretically\
    \ varies between zero and unity. Besides dTm that is obtained by \nmeasuring turfgrass\
    \ and air temperatures, the lower and upper limits of dT need to be known in order\
    \ \nto calculate GWSI. As mentioned before, the empirical approach of Idso et\
    \ al. [19] was implemented \nin this study to model dT limits using the following\
    \ equations: \ndTLL = m (VPD) + b \n(5) \ndTUL = m (VPG) + b \n(6) \nwhere “m”\
    \ is the slope and “b” is the intercept of the linear relationship, VPD is the\
    \ water vapor pressure \ndeficit of the air, and VPG is the vapor pressure gradient\
    \ (both in kPa), estimated as the change in \nsaturated vapor pressure when the\
    \ air temperature is increased by an amount equal to the coefficient “b”. \nDue\
    \ to its empirical nature, the coefficients of Idso’s method are plant- and site-specific.\
    \ To develop \nEquation (5), estimated VPD data were plotted against dTm values\
    \ that were collected over healthy \nturfgrass after significant irrigation or\
    \ precipitation events, when non-water-stressed conditions \nprevailed. Under\
    \ these conditions, dTm can be assumed equal to dTLL. In addition, dTUL was calculated\
    \ \nusing Equation (6). To verify their accuracy, resulted dTUL values were compared\
    \ with dTm values that \nwere measured over a non-transpiring patch of turfgrass.\
    \ Surface non-transpiring conditions were \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2335 \n \n\
    \ \nachieved by spraying a small patch of grass with glyphosate, which inhibited\
    \ grass photosynthetic \nactivities and therefore the transpiration process. \n\
    2.5. Turfgrass Water Use \nTurfgrass water consumption was estimated using two\
    \ independent methods: a GWSI-based \nmethod and a surface energy balance model\
    \ known as METRIC [30]. \n2.5.1. GWSI-Based Water Use \nAccording to Jackson et\
    \ al. [18], GWSI is inversely related to the actual plant transpiration (Ta) in\
    \ \nsuch a way that a maximum GWSI (unity) translates into no water use and a\
    \ minimum GWSI (zero) \ncorresponds to Ta rates as high as the potential (disease-\
    \ and stress-free) transpiration rates (Tp): \nTa = (1 − GWSI) Tp \n(7)\nEquation\
    \ (7) is based on the assumption that GWSI ranges between zero and unity. Obtaining\
    \ GWSI \nvalues that meet this criterion requires an accurate estimation of the\
    \ upper and lower dT limits. If dTm \nvalues fall beyond the range that is defined\
    \ by baselines, GWSI estimates will be either negative or \ngreater than one,\
    \ resulting in Ta values that are larger than the potential rate or negative,\
    \ respectively. \nThus, appropriate limits were applied to GWSI values to ensure\
    \ that Equation (7) did not result in \nunreasonable Ta estimates. The Tp values\
    \ were calculated through multiplying the basal crop \ncoefficients of cool-season\
    \ grass reported in [31] and the ETo estimates obtained following the  \nASCE-EWRI\
    \ guidelines for standardized Penman-Monteith method described in [32]. The required\
    \ \nweather variables were collected at the on-site weather station. \n2.5.2.\
    \ METRIC-Based Water Use \nMETRIC (Mapping ET at high Resolution with Internalized\
    \ Calibration) is a satellite-based \nremotely sensed surface energy balance model\
    \ that relies on the simplified form of the energy balance \nequation at land\
    \ surfaces [30]: \nRn = G + H + LE \n(8) \nwhere Rn is net radiation, G is soil\
    \ heat flux, H is sensible heat flux, and LE is the latent heat flux, all in \n\
    units of energy (e.g., W·m−2). The first three components (Rn, G, and H) are estimated\
    \ by integrating \nremotely sensed and in situ weather data, while LE is calculated\
    \ as the residual of Equation (8). In this \nstudy, Rn and G were estimated following\
    \ the equations and steps provided in [30]. The only difference \nwas in estimating\
    \ surface albedo, which was based on the equation provided in [33]. METRIC takes\
    \ \nadvantage of a novel approach in modeling H, which was pioneered by Bastiaanssen\
    \ et al. [34]. Based \non this approach, spatially distributed values of H are\
    \ estimated by interpolating between two extreme \nconditions and by iteratively\
    \ correcting the aerodynamic surface resistance and friction velocity for the\
    \ \neffects of atmospheric stability, using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory\
    \ [30]. The extreme \nconditions are defined by identifying the so-called hot\
    \ and cold pixels. The cold pixel is selected over a \nwell-irrigated field, where\
    \ all of the available energy (Rn − G) is used for changing the state of water\
    \ \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2336 \n \n \nfrom liquid to gas. The hot pixel is selected\
    \ over a dry bare soil, where LE approaches zero due to the \nlack of available\
    \ water. \nApplication of METRIC in the present research had two major differences\
    \ with regular applications \nof METRIC to satellite imagery. The first difference\
    \ was in the selection of the cold pixel and the \nperformance of the internalized\
    \ calibration. In METRIC, the cold pixel is selected in an agricultural \narea\
    \ as one of the coolest pixels with a large biomass (leaf area index greater than\
    \ 4). In the \ninternalized calibration of METRIC, the ET of such a cool and tall\
    \ agricultural crop is assumed to be \n5% larger than the alfalfa reference ET\
    \ (ETr). Therefore, ETr values estimated at a standard weather \nstation (located\
    \ within or close to the area of interest) are multiplied by a 1.05 factor and\
    \ the results are \nregarded equal to the total LE flux at the selected cold pixel.\
    \ The value of H is then estimated for this \npixel using Equation (8). In this\
    \ study, however, the cold pixel was selected over a recently-irrigated, \nstress-free\
    \ turfgrass at full cover that had the coolest temperature. The fact that the\
    \ cold pixel was \nselected over a short plant such as turfgrass rather than a\
    \ tall crop such as alfalfa may introduce some \nerror, mainly due to the fact\
    \ that under similar non-water-stressed conditions, turfgrass has a lower rate\
    \ \nof water use compared to alfalfa or other tall crops [30]. This difference\
    \ was compensated for in the \npresent study by modifying the internalized calibration\
    \ process of METRIC in two ways: (i) instead of \nETr, the grass reference ET\
    \ (ETo) was assigned to the latent heat flux of the selected cold pixel; and,\
    \ \n(ii) the multiplication by 1.05 coefficient was avoided. In other words, it\
    \ was assumed that the \navailable energy over the selected turfgrass cold pixel\
    \ is equal to the ETo rate estimated at the on-site \nweather station. For the\
    \ hot pixel, readings were taken over a dry, bare soil surface that was located\
    \ \nclose to the experimental treatments and had been cultivated during previous\
    \ years, so it was not \ncompacted. This is in compliance with the guidelines\
    \ of METRIC about hot pixel selection [30]. \nThe second difference between current\
    \ and regular applications of METRIC was the difference in \nsensor platforms.\
    \ While air- and space-borne images are acquired at the same instance over a large\
    \ \narea, ground-based data used in this study were collected over the experimental\
    \ plots at slightly \ndifferent times. Since the entire data collection period\
    \ took only 37 minutes on average (with hot and \ncold pixel readings taken at\
    \ approximately half time), the error introduced by data collection \nasynchronism\
    \ is not expected to be large. It should be noted that despite the temporal concurrence\
    \ in \ndata collection in regular applications of METRIC to imagery, the LE flux\
    \ estimated at a standard \nweather station based on high-frequency data collected\
    \ during a 60-minute period is used to calculate \nthe instantaneous H flux over\
    \ the selected cold pixel. In other words, it is assumed that the 60-minute \n\
    LE flux is similar to the LE flux at the instance of overpass, which may have\
    \ happened at any time \nduring the 60-minute period. \nThe results of models\
    \ that are based on remotely sensed data (e.g., GWSI and METRIC) represent \n\
    surface conditions at the moment of data collection. Therefore, they should be\
    \ extrapolated to longer \nperiods (e.g., daily) for most practical applications.\
    \ METRIC suggests the use of ETrF extrapolation \nmethod, which is based on the\
    \ assumption that the instantaneous ratio of ETa to ETr (ETrF) remains \nconstant\
    \ throughout the day [30]. Once this ratio is estimated, it can be multiplied\
    \ by daily ETr to \nprovide an estimate of daily water use. In this study, however,\
    \ the ratio of ETa to ETo (EToF) was used \nfor extrapolating the METRIC results,\
    \ not only because it is more compatible with the proposed \nmodified internalized\
    \ calibration, but also because previous studies have shown that the EToF method\
    \ \nperforms better than ETrF under advective conditions of arid/semi-arid regions\
    \ [35–37]. A similar \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2337 \n \n \napproach (ETcF) was\
    \ used to extrapolate GWSI-based water use estimates. This approach is explained\
    \ \nin details by Taghvaeian et al. [38]. In order to obtain the cumulative water\
    \ use of turfgrass species \nduring the 70 days of study, water use estimates\
    \ of each method (GWSI and METRIC) were \ninterpolated for the days in between\
    \ the data collection dates, following the procedure outlined in [30]. \n3. Results\
    \ and Discussion \n3.1. Spectral Characteristics of Turfgrass \nThe optical remote\
    \ sensing data revealed interesting patterns in the spectral characteristics of\
    \ \nturfgrass species. Figure 2, for example, compares the spectral signature\
    \ of turfgrass species in \ntreatment I, measured at two different distances from\
    \ the sprinklers and averaged for all measurement \ndates. The spectral signature\
    \ at the closest distance was similar to that presented in [5]. At this \nlocation,\
    \ 38% of the incident radiation in NIR waveband was reflected on average, an indication\
    \ of \nlarge number of hydrated cell walls and air cavities in the mesophyll tissue\
    \ of turf blades. However, \nthe average reflectance in the same waveband decreased\
    \ to 28% at the farthest distance from \nsprinklers. Another noticeable change\
    \ was the overall increase in reflectance at the three visible bands \nas irrigation\
    \ rate decreased. In other words, all turfgrass species that received higher rates\
    \ of irrigation \nwere darker in color. Similar changes in surface reflectance\
    \ at the visible and NIR wavebands caused \nby irrigation treatments were observed\
    \ in Las Vegas, Nevada for tall fescue [14], annual ryegrass [12], \nand bermudagrass\
    \ [29]. Previous studies have shown that the SWIR waveband is the most appropriate\
    \ \none in the optical part of the EM spectrum for monitoring water status of\
    \ plant canopies [39], since at \nthis waveband, the incoming radiation is absorbed\
    \ by the moisture content of plant parts. Our results \nshowed that SWIR reflectance\
    \ of turfgrass increased with the decrease in WAA. This means that \nturfgrass\
    \ canopies that received less amount of irrigation were also at higher levels\
    \ of wilting (less \nturgid). The average SWIR reflectance at closest distance\
    \ was 25%, which increased to 35% at the \nfarthest distance from sprinklers.\
    \ The spectral signatures of the FF and TF species at the farthest \ndistance\
    \ resembled that of a bare soil surface, due to the effects of the reduced irrigation\
    \ rate. \nFigure 2. Spectral signatures of turfgrass species under two different\

    Evaluating the effects of irrigation treatments on turfgrass quality was also\
    \ performed by comparing \nthe VIs. Figure 3 illustrates the variation in NDVI,\
    \ SAVI, and VARI with the change in WAA. Based \non the observed pattern, the\
    \ following conclusions can be made: \n(i) The range of variation in NDVI and\
    \ SAVI was largest for TF, followed in order by FF, THB, \nAKB, and WSM. This\
    \ means that Festuca species were the most sensitive and the mixture of \nwarm\
    \ season grasses was the most tolerant to water limitation. \n(ii) Except for\
    \ the WSM plots, the NDVI-vs.-WAA and the SAVI-vs.-WAA relationships were \nnon-linear,\
    \ having different slopes at WAA levels below and above 0.55. In case of VARI,\
    \ \nplots of WSM, THB, and TF appeared to have linear graphs, while other species\
    \ demonstrated \na non-linear pattern. Other studies have reported similar non-linear\
    \ relationships between \nturfgrass quality indicators and water availability\
    \ [8,40].  \n(iii) Pairwise multiple comparison analysis (Holm-Sidak method) revealed\
    \ that NDVI estimates at \nthe two highest WAA levels were not statistically different.\
    \ In comparison with the highest \nWAA (closest distance to sprinklers), NDVI\
    \ values at the third highest WAA level were not \nsignificantly different for\
    \ WSM, AKB, and THB. The difference was significant only for TF \nand FF. At the\
    \ lowest WAA level (farthest distance), all turfgrass species had a NDVI that\
    \ was \nstatistically different that the values for the highest WAA level. SAVI\
    \ estimates had a similar \nbehavior, suggesting that considerable water conservation\
    \ can be achieved before turfgrass \nquality is significantly degraded. This is\
    \ similar to a previous finding that irrigation depths can \nbe reduced by 15%\
    \ at a golf course without affecting the turf quality [13]. \n(iv) According to\
    \ all VIs, the quality and growth of WSM was poorer under high WAA levels and\
    \ \nbetter under low WAA level in comparison to other species. \n(v) Treatment\
    \ S did not cause any significant variation in estimated VIs, with average NDVI,\
    \ \nSAVI, and VARI values of 0.88, 0.65, and 0.23, respectively. Since WAA was\
    \ 95% at this \ntreatment, the mentioned values can be regarded as the upper limits\
    \ that respected VIs can \nreach over a non-water-stressed Kentucky bluegrass\
    \ turf under conditions similar to those of \nthis experiment. \nFigure 3. Effect\

    \ it seemed that all of the \nplots with an acceptable aesthetic appearance had\
    \ a positive VARI during the study period. Thus, a \nVARI value of zero may be\
    \ an appropriate threshold in managing turfgrass quality. The graphs in \nFigure\

    \ \nmethodology that was explained in previous sections. Developed relationships\
    \ were essentially \nidentical for both species, with a large coefficient of determination\
    \ (R2 = 0.97): \ndTLL = −3.3 (VPD) + 10.3 \n(9) \nThis similarity is contradictory\
    \ to the findings of several previous studies that dTLL-VPD \nrelationships are\
    \ species-specific [21]. However, Carrow [41] stated that these baselines are\
    \ similar \nenough to be combined for practical purposes such as irrigation scheduling.\
    \ The slope of Equation (9) \nis a larger negative number compared to −2.2, which\
    \ is the slope of similar equations developed for \ntall fescue [22] and Kentucky\
    \ bluegrass [17]. This difference is most probably due to the difference in \n\
    climatological conditions. Carrow [41] reported that non-water-stressed baselines\
    \ developed for \nturfgrass species under arid/semi-arid climate had larger negative\
    \ slopes compared to those developed \nunder humid conditions. \nThe non-transpiring\
    \ baseline was developed by entering the coefficients of Equation (9) into \n\
    Equation (6). Predicted dTUL values varied from 17.0 to 21.9 °C, also bigger than\
    \ the finding of \nThrossell et al. [17] who reported a dTUL value of about 13.0\
    \ °C for Kentucky bluegrass at an air \ntemperature of 30.0 °C. However, dTUL\
    \ values modeled in this experiment had a high accuracy when \ncompared with dTm\
    \ values that were measured over a non-transpiring turfgrass surface, with a mean\
    \ \nbias error of only 0.7 °C and a root mean square error of 0.6 °C. Such a high\
    \ accuracy suggests that \nobserved differences in the upper and lower dT limits\

    \ a high intensity of incoming solar \nradiation (around solar noon on cloud-free\
    \ days). Figure 4 demonstrates the upper and lower dT limits, \nalong with dTm\
    \ values of four experimental plots as an example. According to this figure, dTm\
    \ values \nfor I-WSM-4 and I-AKB-4 plots that received minimum amounts of irrigation\
    \ were closer to the dTUL \nline compared to the S-SN and I-WSM-1 plots. \nFigure\

    \ along \nwith dTm values for four experimental plots. \n \n \nThe next step was\
    \ to estimate GWSI over all experimental plots (Figure 5). For treatment S, \n\
    different levels of added plant compost had no significant effect on water stress.\
    \ Soil tillage depth did \nnot have any significant effect either and there was\
    \ no statistical interaction between these two factors \n(two-way ANOVA, P < 0.05).\
    \ Within treatment I, the results showed that variations in WAA caused \nstatistically\
    \ significant (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05) changes in GWSI for all studied turfgrass\
    \ species \n(all datasets passed both equal variance and normality tests). However,\
    \ the range of GWSI variation \nwith WAA was not similar among turfgrass species.\
    \ While the WSM and AKB varieties had the \nlowest GWSI range of 0.26 and 0.28,\
    \ respectively, the difference between minimum and maximum \nGWSI values observed\
    \ over the TF plot reached 0.91, close to the full possible range of unity. \n\
    Therefore, the GWSI results based on the thermal remotely sensed data confirmed\
    \ the VI results based \non the optical remotely sensed data that the warm season\
    \ grasses were the most tolerant and the \nFestuca species were the most sensitive\
    \ species to water availability. \nSimilar to VIs results, turfgrass species had\
    \ different responses at the same distances from \nsprinklers (i.e., for the same\
    \ WAA levels). At the farthest location, FF had a GWSI of unity (Figure 6), \n\
    followed by the GWSI of TF (0.93). Bluegrass species (AKB and THB) had the same\
    \ GWSI values of \n0.53. A similar GWSI value of about 0.50 is reported for Kentucky\
    \ bluegrass under moderate levels of \nwater stress (corresponding to a soil water\
    \ potential of −0.40 MPa, measured by a gypsum resistance \nblock installed at\
    \ a soil depth of 76 mm) [17]. The smallest GWSI value (0.41) at this location\
    \ \nbelonged to WSM. This observation was expected because warm season grasses\
    \ have a higher drought \ntolerance compared to cool season species. In addition,\
    \ the two warm season species of this study are \nnative in Colorado and therefore\
    \ well-adapted to Colorado’s climate. At the closest location (largest \n-6\n\

    \ followed by that of WSM (0.19). The average GWSI was 0.15 for WSM at the second\
    \ \nclosest distance to sprinklers, where WAA was 68%. This result is very similar\
    \ to the GWSI value of \n0.16 that was estimated for bermudagrass (a warm season\
    \ species) under a similar relative water use \n(actual to reference ET) of 66%\
    \ [20]. \nFigure 5. Average GWSI for all of the experimental plots. \n \nFigure\

    \ 6 also portrays that the GWSI-vs.-WAA relationship was non-linear, similar to\
    \ the  \nVIs-vs.-WAA relationships. Pairwise multiple comparison analyses (Holm-Sidak\
    \ test, P < 0.05) \nrevealed that within each turfgrass species, the differences\
    \ in average GWSI for the three highest \nWAA levels (74, 68, and 55%) were not\
    \ statistically significant. It was only the lowest WAA (38%) \nthat caused a\

    \ Water Use \n3.3.1. GWSI-Based Water Use \nDaily turfgrass Ta was calculated\
    \ based on GWSI estimates for each of the seven dates of data \ncollection. As\
    \ expected, GWSI variations were translated into variations in Ta estimates. The\
    \ highest \nwater consumption rate was estimated over I-TF-1 and I-TF-2 plots\
    \ (closest to the sprinklers), with \naverage transpiration of 4.1 mm·d−1. The\
    \ lowest water use rate also belonged to a TF plot (the farthest \ndistance from\
    \ sprinklers), with an average Ta of 0.2 mm·d−1. The Ta rates reached a maximum\
    \ value of \n3.4 mm·d−1 at AKB plots of treatment I, slightly smaller than the\
    \ maximum Ta rate of 3.8 mm·d−1, \nestimated over the plots of treatment S that\
    \ had the same type of turfgrass but received more irrigation \nwater. Averaging\
    \ Ta values over all WAA levels (distances from sprinklers) for each turfgrass\
    \ species \nat treatment I showed that WSM had the highest average transpiration\
    \ rate (3.3 mm·d−1), followed by \nTHB (3.2 mm·d−1), AKB (2.9 mm·d−1), TF (2.9\
    \ mm·d−1), and FF (1.9 mm·d−1) species. This trend in Ta \nvalues agrees well\
    \ with the observed trends in VIs. Average ETo estimated using the weather station\
    \ \ndata and the ASCE standardized Penman-Monteith method [32] was 4.5 mm·d−1\
    \ for the same seven \ndata collection dates. \n3.3.2. METRIC-Based Water Use\
    \ \nIn general, the water use results obtained by applying the METRIC energy balance\
    \ model were \nsimilar to those of the empirical GWSI approach. For example, I-TF-1\
    \ and I-TF-2 plots had the highest \naverage METRIC-ETa rates of 4.3 mm·d−1. In\
    \ addition, the average ETa for the I-TF-4 plot, which was \nthe smallest based\
    \ on the GWSI method, was the second smallest based on METRIC. The differences\
    \ \nbetween the daily water use results of GWSI and METRIC methods were always\
    \ less than 1.0 mm·d−1, \nwith an average value of 0.4 mm·d−1 for all plots. This\
    \ difference was 11% of the average  \nMETRIC-ETa for the same seven dates. Bastiaanssen\
    \ et al. [42] reported that at field scale, the error in \ndaily water use estimate\
    \ of the land surface energy balance models can be up to 15%. A more recent \n\
    study showed that on daily scales, the errors in METRIC results can be reduced\
    \ to 10% if a surface \nroughness model is also incorporated to account for the\
    \ surface heterogeneity [35]. Hence, the \nobserved differences between GWSI and\
    \ METRIC results in this study are well within the accuracy \nrange of the METRIC\
    \ model. \nStatistical analyses were also performed to identify if there was any\
    \ significant difference among \nthe results of the METRIC and GWSI methods. As\
    \ the first step, a normality test (Shapiro-Wilk) was \nconducted to select an\
    \ appropriate group-comparison test. Databases that passed the normality test\
    \ \n(P = 0.05) were analyzed using the un-paired t-test, while those that did\
    \ not pass the test were analyzed \nusing Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test. The results\
    \ confirmed that the difference between two methods \nwas not statistically significant\
    \ (P > 0.05) for any of the studied plots. A similar observation was \nreported\
    \ when the same two methods were applied to estimate water consumption of corn\
    \ in \nnortheastern Colorado [38]. This finding is of great importance, since\
    \ METRIC is a complex and  \ndata-intensive model that needs to be applied by\
    \ a trained operator. The empirical approach of GWSI, \nhowever, is an easy-to-apply\
    \ method that neither requires an extensive knowledge on land surface \nprocesses\
    \ nor needs extensive data collection and processing. In addition, the procedure\
    \ can be easily \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2343 \n \n \nprogrammed in pocket computers\
    \ and smart phones. There is also the possibility of applying the GWSI \napproach\
    \ to air- and space-borne imagery. This method does not rely on optical remote\
    \ sensing data, \nonly a single-layer map of radiometric surface temperature suffices\
    \ for its application. However, \nGWSI method is only as accurate as the baselines\
    \ used in defining the lower and upper limit of dT. \nThese baselines need to\
    \ be developed under the specific conditions of each climatic region, so they\
    \ are \nnot transferable among the regions. Surface energy balance models, on\
    \ the other hand, can be applied \nover large areas comprising different vegetation\
    \ types, regardless of climatic conditions.  \nFigure 7 demonstrates box plots\
    \ of estimated Ta and ETa, averaged for all data collection dates. As \nthis figure\
    \ suggests, the range and median of turfgrass water use estimates were similar\
    \ among both \nmethods, except for the two farthest locations from the sprinklers\
    \ in treatment I. In other words, the \ndifference between water use estimates\
    \ of GWSI and METRIC methods had a negative relationship \nwith the depth of applied\
    \ water (or the WAA level). This is most probably due to the fact that at lower\
    \ \nWAA levels (farther distances from sprinklers) turfgrass canopy was not fully\
    \ closed. Hence, parts of \nthe underlying soil may have been viewed by the IRT,\
    \ despite our effort to take readings only over \nturfgrass. This would have contaminated\
    \ the measured turfgrass temperatures, resulting in larger \nGWSI and consequently\
    \ smaller Ta estimates. The difference between GWSI and METRIC results was \n\
    reduced from 11% to 8%, when only the higher-quality plots (those that had a positive\
    \ VARI) were \nincluded in the analysis. \nFigure 7. Box-plots of estimated turfgrass\
    \ water use based on GWSI and METRIC \nmethods for all measurement dates. \n \n\
    A traditional approach in estimating the water requirement of non-water-stressed\
    \ agricultural crops \nis to obtain the so-called crop coefficients (Kc) for each\
    \ growth stage of the crop under consideration \nand then multiply these coefficients\
    \ by the reference ET. Due to its widespread application, Kc values \nare reported\
    \ for major agricultural crops and turfgrass species in publications such as the\
    \ FAO paper \n56. According to the tables in FAO paper 56, mid-season Kc is 0.87\
    \ and 0.97 for warm season and cool \nseason turfgrass, respectively, after adjustment\
    \ are made to account for the arid/semi-arid climate of \nthe study area [31].\
    \ In this study, turfgrass Kc values were obtained through dividing the METRIC-ETa\
    \ \nby the ETo. The average METRIC-Kc at the closest distance to the sprinklers\
    \ (non-water-stressed) was \n0.86 over WSM and 0.98 over TF, very similar to the\
    \ values proposed in the FAO paper 56. The FAO \nI-WSM-1\nI-WSM-2\nI-WSM-3\nI-WSM-4\n\

    \ \nRemote Sens. 2013, 5 \n2344 \n \n \npaper 56 also outlines a procedure for\
    \ estimating a stress coefficient (Ks), which reduces the actual \nwater use estimate\
    \ in proportion to the experienced soil water deficit in the root zone of studied\
    \ plant. \nDaily values of water use based on both METRIC and GWSI methods were\
    \ interpolated for the \ndays in between remote sensing data acquisition dates\
    \ and then summed to provide an estimate of the \ncumulative water consumption\
    \ for the entire seventy days of study. The results had a pattern similar to \n\
    that of daily values, with a total water use that ranged from 8 to 300 mm based\
    \ on GWSI and from 12 \nto 321 mm based on METRIC (Figure 8). Grass reference\
    \ ET was 329 mm during the same period. For \nboth average daily and cumulative\
    \ water use estimates, it should be noted that uncertainties associated \nwith\
    \ sensors, methods, and assumptions propagate to the final approximations. Further\
    \ studies are \nrequired to address the error propagation and the sensitivity\
    \ of each model (especially the GWSI) to \nuncertainties in input variables. \n\

    \ remote sensing data were used to study the quality, water stress, \nand water\
    \ consumption of several turfgrass species under different soil and irrigation\
    \ treatments in \nnorthern Colorado, USA. Reducing water application from 74%\
    \ to 38% of the total grass-based \nreference ET resulted in average NIR reflectance\
    \ to decrease from 38% to 28%, while the SWIR \nreflectance increased from 25%\
    \ to 35%. Reflectance in the visible bands also experienced about a \ntwofold\
    \ increase. Measured surface reflectance in multiple wavebands was used to estimate\
    \ three \nvegetation indices (VIs), namely NDVI, SAVI, and VARI. Utilizing the\
    \ simple empirical approach of \nestimating grass water stress index (GWSI) was\
    \ also investigated. Similar non-water-stressed baselines \nwere developed for\
    \ tall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass species. The modeled estimates of  \nnon-transpiring\
    \ turfgrass temperature had a small error (0.7 °C) when compared to the temperature\
    \ \nreadings taken over a non-transpiring patch of turfgrass. All optical (three\
    \ VIs) and thermal (GWSI) \nindicators were consistent in having a non-linear\
    \ relationship with water application depth. They also \nrevealed that Festuca\
    \ species were the most sensitive and warm season species were the least sensitive\
    \ \nto water limitation. \nI-WSM-1\nI-WSM-2\nI-WSM-3\nI-WSM-4\nI-AKB-1\nI-AKB-2\n\

    Abstract \nIrrigation system design and irrigation management require appropriate\
    \ match of the soil and type of crop. In \nChile, agrological reports are currently\
    \ being used to determine the homogeneity of soil units and land capabil-\nity\
    \ classes: fruit tree production vs orchard design. Agrological studies use a\
    \ number of soil characteristics, but \nthese do not include hydrophysical properties,\
    \ which are essential when zoning for irrigation. Therefore, it is \nnecessary\
    \ to establish a methodology to objectively evaluate soils, based on a quantitative\
    \ analysis that includes \nhydrophysical parameters. In this study, different\
    \ methodologies are proposed for classifying homogenous soil \nunits based on\
    \ extensive field sampling. The field data was evaluated using two methodologies:\
    \ 1) the SAG-\nUSDA Manual and 2) in situ sampling of soil’s hydrophysical properties\
    \ and pedotransfer models. There were \ndifferences between the methodologies\
    \ regarding zoning soil properties for irrigation system design and man-\nagement.\
    \ The methodology based on the SAG-USDA Manual requires auxiliary data in order\
    \ to provide useful \nmaps for design and management of irrigation systems. Published\
    \ pedotransfer functions should be carefully \nassess before their use in large-scale\
    \ design, as the quality the estimations depends on the data used to derive the\
    \ \nequations. Therefore, if field data is available, we recommend calibrating\
    \ equations using well-known statistical \nmethods such as least square. In this\
    \ study, the functions obtained describe the properties of interest properly,\
    \ \nsuch as the field capacity for design of micro-irrigation systems. However,\
    \ predicting wilting point did not give \nreliable results. \nKeywords: Soil hydrophysical\
    \ properties, pedotransfer functions, management of irrigation systems\n736  \

    \ 17 ( 3), 735-750\n1. Introduction\nEfficient water use at farm level required\
    \ adequate \nunderstanding the farm’s soil properties, topography, \nand types\
    \ of crops. In fact, understanding the spatial \nvariability of physical soil\
    \ properties is a key issue, \nsince soil properties vary spatially within a field\
    \ be-\ncause of geological and pedological soil-forming \nfactors (Iqbal et al.,\
    \ 2005, Dec and Dörner, 2014). \nMoreover, spatial variability of soil properties\
    \ is also \ninfluenced by farming practices such as tillage, crop \nrotation and\
    \ irrigation management. \nSoils in Chile’s Central Valley are highly variable\
    \ \nin space, posing major problems for irrigation sys-\ntem design and management\
    \ (Rivera et al., 2015). \nHowever, current practice for designing irrigation\
    \ \nsystems considers as main input data the crop type \n(Holzapfel et al., 2009),\
    \ without properly incorpo-\nrating soil variability. Therefore, a proper design\
    \ of \nirrigation systems should consider, besides the crop \ntype, other parameters\
    \ linking soil and crops, such \nas root water extraction zone, soil depth, and\
    \ soil \nhydrophysical properties (Holzapfel et al., 2009; \nHolzapfel, 2010;\
    \ Holzapfel et al., 2015; Flores et \nal., 2010; Gooley et al., 2014). Irrigation\
    \ will be ef-\nficient as long as the soil water is only extracted from \nthe\
    \ root zone. Holzapfel (2010) has indicated that the \nroot zone from where water\
    \ is extracted is a key fac-\ntor in irrigation management, and should be related\
    \ \nto soil type. This author has also reported that the \nmain water extraction\
    \ capacity by roots of some fruit \ntrees reaches depths up to 0.6 and 0.7 meters.\
    \ \nSoil texture is essential to characterize soil hydro-\nphysical properties,\
    \ as it influences water-holding \ncapacity, the soil-water characteristic curve\
    \ for de-\nsorption, and hydraulic conductivity (Campbell, \n1974; Van Genuchten,\
    \ 1980). Bulk density (Db) is \nanother parameter that needs to be considered\
    \ as it \nreflects the structural conditions of the soil, manage-\nment and cultural\
    \ practices. Bulk Density largely \ndetermines the root growth (Cuevas et al.,\
    \ 2004). In \naddition, Selles et al. (2012) indicated that monitor-\ning soil\
    \ compaction before and after planting allows \nfor a decrease in Db and soil\
    \ penetration resistance \nand, in turn, an increase in both the macroporosity\
    \ \nand the number of fine roots per square meter in the \nsoil profile. Besides,\
    \ Db relates to the degree of soil \ncompaction and restriction to root growth\
    \ (NRCS, \n2008). Water-holding capacity (WHC) of the soil is \nassociated with\
    \ available soil water for possible ex-\ntraction in the root zone, indicating\
    \ the total amount \nof water that soil can hold for plant use. WHC is key \n\
    for irrigation management, as it indicates the maxi-\nmum amount of water to be\
    \ applied, influencing both \nirrigation timing and frequency. \nFor designing\
    \ irrigation systems, there must be a \ntrade-off between soil variability, costs\
    \ for deliver-\ning water and crop needs. Thus, if areas with different \nvalues\
    \ of WHC –depending on soil variability- are ir-\nrigated with the same criteria\
    \ of frequency and time, \nthere will be areas with excess and others with defi-\n\
    cit of water. Therefore, it is important to develop a \nmethodology to define\
    \ homogenous soil units, based \non a quantitative analysis of hydrophysical soil\
    \ pa-\nrameters. This information is essential to measure \nand manage spatial\
    \ variability, increase production \nefficiency and reduce environmental impact\
    \ of ir-\nrigation schemes/practice. Currently in Chile, the \nmanual developed\
    \ by the Agricultural and Live-\nstock Service (SAG) is used as a basic procedure\
    \ for \nthe description and mapping of soils. This manual \n(SAG, 2001), which\
    \ is based on the USDA Soil Sur-\nvey Manual (USDA - Soil Survey Staff, 2009),\
    \ pro-\nvides standards and guidelines for defining land use \nclasses for fruit\
    \ tree production.\n737\nSoil characteristics for design of irrigation systems\n\
    Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 2017 , 17 ( 3), 735-750\nThe study\
    \ aims to assess methods of producing maps \nof the spatial distribution of soil\
    \ properties for irriga-\ntion system design and management at the farm level.\
    \ \nWe propose an approach for defining homogenous re-\ngions based on extensive\
    \ field sampling. In addition, \nthe Saxton-Rawls method is evaluated and calibrated\
    \ \nto estimate soil water characteristics. \n2. Materials and Methods\nField\
    \ data was used to assess the performance of two \ndifferent methods to derive\
    \ hydrophysical data from \nsoil texture and define homogenous areas. Point- wise\
    \ \ndata was used to produce maps of the spatial distribu-\ntion of relevant parameters\
    \ for irrigation design and \nmanagement, such as WHC and bulk density. To cre-\n\
    ate maps, the kriging method was applied.\n2.1. Study site\nThe study was conducted\
    \ on a farm located in Coi-\nhueco, near Chillán in Bio Bio region  (Latitude\
    \ \n-36.622515, Longitude -71.901824, Altitude 227 \nm.a.s.l; (Figure 1a). The\
    \ climate is Mediterranean, \nwith dry and wet seasons. Average annual rainfall\
    \ is \n1,200 mm, with a rainy season extending from April \nto August. According\
    \ to the Chilean Natural Resourc-\nes Information Center (CIREN, 1999), soils\
    \ on the \nfarm are classified as Andisol (Arrayan series, AYN), \nInceptisol\
    \ (Gallipavo series, GAL, and Chacayal se-\nries, CYL), and Mollisol (Mebuca series,\
    \ MBU, and \nTalquipen series, TQP). All series are described in the \nSoil Survey\
    \ Map of the Bio Bio Region (North Area) \n(Santis 2005). \n2.2. Field sampling\
    \ and laboratory analyses\nThirty-one test pits were excavated and soil samples\
    \ \nwere taken at different depths. Measurements were \ncarried out the Water\
    \ Resources Laboratory of the \nSchool of Agricultural Engineering, University\
    \ of \nConcepción using standardized procedures (San-\ndoval et al., 2012). Samples\
    \ from each soil horizon \nwere packed in plastic bags to determine particle size\
    \ \ndistribution using the hydrometer method. Undis-\nturbed samples were analyzed\
    \ for bulk density and \nsoil water content. Bulk density was measured using \n\
    the natural lump method, while the water contents at \n-33 kPa (field capacity,\
    \ FC) and -1500 kPa (wilting \npoint, WP) were determined using the ceramic plate\
    \ \npressure extraction method (Sandoval et al., 2012). \nWater Holding Capacity\
    \ (WHC) was calculated as \nthe difference between FC and WP on a volume ba-\n\
    sis, considering soil depth (Jury et al., 1991). Field \ndata were compared to\
    \ the information provided by \nCIREN (1999) and the Survey Map of the Bio Bio\
    \ \nRegion (North Area) (Santis 2005). Soil variability \nwas characterized based\
    \ on the Soil Survey Manual \n(USDA Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993) and SAG’s\
    \ \nguidelines (2001). \n2.3. Methods for defining homogeneous soil areas\nTwo\
    \ methods were applied. The “Agrological meth-\nod” (USDA-SAG) requires texture\
    \ and soil’s depth \ndata from CIREN soil series maps (low spatial resolu-\ntion\
    \ 1:500,000). Data from maps was interpreted to \nqualitatively define homogenous\
    \ units considering \ntopography and plot boundaries. The second method \n(INSITU)\
    \ considers field sampling of other relevant \nsoil properties than texture, such\
    \ as bulk density, in-\nfiltration rate, and water holding capacity. Then, ho-\n\
    mogenous areas were defined using ordinary kriging. \nPedotransfer functions were\
    \ used to provide estimates \nof the unknown parameters (WHC, WP) based on \n\
    texture. Pedotransfer models such as the Saxton and \nRawls (Saxton and Rawls,2006)\
    \ could help to reduce \nthe amount of soil analysis types.\n738       Valdivia-Cea\
    \ et al\nJournal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 2017 , 17 ( 3), 735-750\n\
    Field data was spatialized using kigring (Gozdowski \net al., 2015). We  tested\
    \  the predictive skill of pedo\ntranfer functions when used as an auxiliary method\
    \ \nto increase the data density. \n \nFigure 1. (a) Study site at Los Abedules\

    \ is a measure of the relative \nweight of predictive variables on the final results.\
    \  \nNew pedotransfer relationships were fitted to field data \nusing least squares\
    \ (LS) for equations 1-4. LS meth-\nods fit a continuous function for data-pairs\

    \ θ is the water content at field capacity θfc and \nwilting point θwp (m3 m-3)\
    \ expressed as percentage, S \nand C are the sand and clay contents (%) respectively,\
    \ \nOM is the organic matter content (%) and Db is the \nbulk density (g/cm3).\
    \ The new approach includes ad-\nditional variables to the Saxton and Rawls (2006).\
    \ In \nequation (7), predictive variables were defined after \nan intensive screening\
    \ process.\n2.5. Spatial data\nHydrophysical properties measured in the field\
    \ were \nspatialized using the ordinary kriging method (Hengl, \n2009). Thus,\
    \ values at the locations that were not \nsampled in the study area were estimated.\
    \ Soil maps \nfor  irrigation  system  design and management were\ndiscretized\
    \ n order to define the areas with homoge-\nneous hydrophysical properties. \n\
    Physical soil quality indices were selected as in-\ndicated by Rabbi et al. (2014).\
    \ The indices are as \nfollows: clay content is less than or equal to 40%, \n\
    and bulk density ranges between 0.9 and 1.2 g/cm3. \nRegarding these indicators,\
    \ USDA (2009) states that \nclay contents greater than or equal to 40% prevent\
    \ \nthe movement and redistribution of soil water. Re-\ngarding fine-textured\
    \ soils, Reynolds et al. (2003) \nhave indicated that bulk densities below 0.9\
    \ g/cm3 \nprevent good contact between soil and roots, while \nbulk densities\
    \ greater than 1.2 g/cm3 stop rootlet \nelongation and reduce soil aeration. \n\
    Maps were compared using the coefficient of varia-\ntion:\n % = \n|X| ·\
    \ 100% \n(8)\nwhere CV is the coefficient of variation, SD is the \nstandard\
    \ deviation and     is the mean. Thus, soil units \nhaving low values of CV are\
    \ better than soils units \nshowing large values for CV. \n3. Results \n3.1. Agrological\
    \ study\nAgrological studies provide general information for \ncrop adaptation\
    \ and management, but not for irriga-\ntion system design, as the method does\
    \ not include \nthe hydrophysical properties of the soil. Figures 1b, \n1c and\
    \ 1d show the result of the preliminary analysis \nof the soil characteristics,\
    \ soil series borehole moni-\ntoring points, and areas considered as homogeneous\
    \ \nin the study site. Soils series are: Arrayan Phase 2 \n(AYN-2, 152.4 ha),\
    \ Mebuca Phase 2 (MBU-2, 17.4 \nha), Gallipavo Phase 2 (GAL 2, 15.1 ha), and Cha-\n\
    cayal Phase 2 (CYL-2, 28.4 ha). Textures ranged from \nfine sandy loam (SaL) to\
    \ clay loam (CL). Regarding \nland use, class II soils cover ca. 149 ha. This\
    \ soil class \nhas slight limitations that reduce the selection of type \nplants\
    \ or require moderate conservation practices (soil \nis flat, with gentle slope,\
    \ deep to moderately deep depth \nwith good permeability and drainage).On the\
    \ other hand,\n741\nSoil characteristics for design of irrigation systems\nJournal\

    \ statistics for the hy-\ndrophysical properties of soil samples.Bulk density\
    \ \n(Db) measured in the field ranged from 0.85 to 1.08 \ng/cm3. In general, it\
    \ can be observed that minimum \nvalues of  bulk  density are  similar in  all\
    \  sampled \nhorizons, but maximum bulk density increases with \ndepth. However,\
    \ depth-averaged values show a \nslight increase in bulk density with depth. \n\
    This is possibly caused by the increase in the sand \nfraction (higher particle\
    \ density) along the profile \n(Alvarado and Forsythe, 2005). Also farming prac-\n\
    tices, such as tillage and cropping, decrease bulk \ndensity on the surface due\
    \ to the presence of roots \nand the addition of organic matter from pruning or\

    \ al\nJournal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 2017 , 17 ( 3), 735-750\nIt\
    \ is worth noting that the minimum value of FC in the \nsurface layer is 0.28\
    \ m3 m-3, and its maximum value \nis 0.63 m3 m-3; whereas the minimum and maximum\
    \ \nvalues of WP are 0.15 m3 m-3 and 0.33 m3 m-3 respec-\ntively. Thus, the minimum\
    \ FC value overlaps the \nmaximum WP value.\nConsidering both spatial distribution\
    \ and depth, soils \nwere classified into 5 structural classes: loam (L) rep-\n\
    resenting 50.8% of total area; clay loam (CL) with \n22.0%; silt loam (SiL) with\
    \ 18.6%; sandy loam (SaL) \nwith 5.1%; and silty clay loam (SiCL) with 3.4%. \n\
    This means that even though values indicate that soils \nare mainly classified\
    \ as loam, soil texture cannot be \nrelated with certainty to available water\
    \ content when \ndesigning irrigation systems. Values are within ranges \nreported\
    \ in Sandoval et al. (2007), Rivera et al. (2015) \nand Dec and Dörner (2014).\n\
    \ \n3.3. Maps of hydrophysical soil characteristics\nBulk density (Db) measured\
    \ in the field and spa-\ntialized using kriging (Figure 2a) shows that in the\
    \ \nsouthern part of the farm, higher Db variation is ob-\nserved. Opposite, the\
    \ northern part of the farm shows \na lower variation in bulk density. In the\
    \ central part \nof the farm, higher bulk density is observed, reaching \nvalues\
    \ above 1.4 g/cm3. This area corresponds to the \nArrayan series (Figure 1b).\
    \ However, there is some \nspatial variation on bulk density that is observed\
    \ on \nsoil series maps. Thus, these areas showing discrepan-\ncies need to be\
    \ considered as different for irrigation \nsystem design and management. \nFigure\
    \ 2b shows available water content (WHC) in \nthe first 60 cm of soil and spatialized\

    \ of irrigation systems\nJournal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 2017 , 17\
    \ ( 3), 735-750\nThis allows us to select areas that should have dif-\nferentiated\
    \ management plans in the field, which is \nan important aspect for the design\
    \ and management \nof irrigation systems. In general, the study area pres-\nents\
    \ WHC values greater than 186 mm. However, \nthere are also areas where soil water\
    \ content varies \nwithin the same unit, such as the southern part of the \nfarm\
    \ where WHC ranges from 100 to 300 mm. A \nrange of variability of 200 mm in WHC\
    \ implies high \nspatial variability in soil characteristics, making the \ndesign\
    \ of irrigation units more complex. The spatial \nvariability in the field capacity\
    \ and wilting point of \nsoil in the southern part of the farm can be attributed\
    \ \nto different soil textures, which range from loam to \nclay loam. Due to their\
    \ morphological characteris-\ntics, Andisols absorb and retain high water content.\
    \ \nThe clay content of soils in the northern zone ranges \nfrom 30 to 40%, and\
    \ decreases to the south. The sand \ncontent is higher than the clay content,\
    \ on average, \nwith a slightly lower standard deviation (Table 1). \nSoils with\
    \ the highest sand content are found in the \nnorthern and central parts of the\
    \ study area, decreas-\ning to the south and reaching values ranging from \n15%\
    \ to 40%. Soils with the highest silt content are \nfound in the southern part\
    \ of the farm, while the low-\nest content was found in the northern part. Consid-\n\
    ering soil textures, silt presented the highest values \nfor both the mean value\
    \ and the standard deviation \n(Table 1), compared to sand and clay, and this\
    \ was \nalso observed in the deeper layers. It was also ob-\nserved that in terms\
    \ of depth, clay and silt mineral \nparticles decreased, whereas sand content\
    \ increased. \nDörner et al. (2009) found similar values in an An-\ndisol soil\
    \ in southern Chile, reporting values ranging\nfrom 33% to 43% sand, and from\
    \ 47% to 59% silt in \nthe first 20 cm of soil. \n3.4. Evaluation and calibration\
    \ of pedotransfer functions \nThe pedotransfer function proposed by Saxton and\
    \ \nRawls (2006) underestimates both FC and WP (Fig-\nure 3a-3d). Table 2 compares\
    \ the coefficients for the \noriginal model and the calibrated model. It shows\
    \ \nthat there is a shift on the relative weight of sand and \nclay content. In\
    \ fact, the original model defines equal \nweights for sand and clay, while in\
    \ the calibrated \nmodel the ratio of sand’s and clay’s weight is 100 \nin estimating\
    \ FC and WP. However, Table 2 shows \nthat the goodness-of-fit of both the original\
    \ model, \ndescribed in the equations by Saxton and Rawls \n(2006) (Figure 3a-3d),\
    \ have a poor performance on \nestimating FC and WP. However, other studies indi-\n\
    cate that the Saxton & Rawls model is adequate for \nmineral soils (Hong et al.,\
    \ 2013). Even though cali-\nbrated coefficients were established, and there was\
    \ \nan improvement in the model’s predictive skill, still \na large proportion\
    \ of data (ca. 50%) is overestimated \nor underestimated.\nTable 3 shows the coefficients\
    \ for the new pedotrans-\nfer function (Equation 7). The values of the coeffi-\n\
    cients (weights) show an important predictive skill of \nsand content, as well\
    \ as its relationship with bulk den-\nsity and organic matter. On the other hand,\
    \ the least \nimportant variable is clay content. As observed in \nTable 2 and\
    \ Figure 3e, the local calibration delivered \nbetter estimates, by decreasing\
    \ RD and increasing R2 \nfor field capacity. However, there was not a significant\
    \ \nimprovement for wilting point (Figure 3f).\n744       Valdivia-Cea et al\n\

    \ methods to determine \nhomogenous soil units \nFigure 4 compares the homogeneous\
    \ soil units pro-\nduced using the agrological approach (USDA-SAG) \nbased on\
    \ coarse data from maps and the INSITU \napproach, based on field measures. Analyzing\
    \ bulk \ndensity and suitability of land use, no differences \nwere found in the\
    \ values of coefficient of variation. \nThis occurs because this zone, which corresponds\
    \ to \nsoils classified as Class II, also presents a bulk den-\nsity with the\
    \ same spatial heterogeneity (Table 4). \nOn the other hand, the map that compares\
    \ the land \nuse class and available water content shows differ-\nences between\
    \ the two methods. The area that corre-\nsponds to class II presents a high heterogeneity\
    \ (CV \n= 19.7%, n=13) compared to the information pro-\nvided by the map of available\
    \ water content distribu-\ntion (CV = 8.1%, n=6) for the same area. Therefore,\
    \ \nwhen available water content is used to differentiate \ndifferent management\
    \ zones, these areas would ef-\nfectively be homogeneous.  In general, the  INSITU\n\

    4.2. Methodological proposal\nAn important parameter for design and management\
    \ \nof micro-irrigation systems is the value of field ca-\npacity (Holzapfel et\
    \ al., 2015). Thus, the pedotransfer \nmodel obtained for FC can be used for design\
    \ consid-\nering this soil type. Regarding estimates of the wilting \npoint, the\
    \ model is weak in predicting this parameter \n(Table 2) as the model overestimates\
    \ when the wa-\nter content values are lower than 25%, but underesti-\nmates when\
    \ the values are higher than 25%. In terms \nof the soils included in the present\
    \ study, the Saxton \n& Rawls model can predict some hydrophysical char-\nacteristics\
    \ with an acceptable level of accuracy. These \nresults call for more careful\
    \ use of the model, as large \nuncertainties could appear. Similarly, the model\
    \ equa-\ntions were also calibrated to the local soils in a study \nconducted\
    \ on mineral soils (Sung and Iba, 2010). The \nauthors indicated that model calibration\
    \ resulted in \nestimation improvement from 8 to 49%. These mod-\nels are only\
    \ applicable to the volcanic ash type soil \nincluded in the study, and are likely\
    \ to be improved \nin future research with other soil types. Other authors \n\
    mention that it is not convenient to use pedotransfer \nequations in soil types\
    \ different for which the model \nwas developed (Nguyen et al 2015; Givi et al\
    \ 2004). \nEven though the development of pedotransfer models \nalso requires\
    \ field data, our approach shows that lo-\ncal calibration is required to produce\
    \ more accurate \nhomogeneous soil units. \nIt is important to collect as much\
    \ information as pos-\nsible in order to have an overview of the field. The \n\
    first step in a soil study for irrigation system design \nand management purposes\
    \ is to verify soil variabil-\nity by using tools such as satellite imagery, landscape\
    \ \nanalysis, previous soil studies, and borehole sam-\npling, followed by borehole\
    \ monitoring to confirm \ndata (soil series, limitations) in order to create maps\
    \ \nwith homogeneous areas. Finally, soil samples should \nbe collected for laboratory\
    \ analysis to identify the hy-\ndrophysical properties of interest. In addition,\
    \ pedo-\ntransfer functions can be also used to characterize the \n748\nSoil characteristics\
    \ for design of irrigation systems\nJournal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition,\
    \ 2017 , 17 ( 3), 735-750\nsoil, provided that these functions correspond to the\
    \ \ntype of soil studied.  Having analyzed the informa-\ntion, the maps are made\
    \ with the variables either mea-\nsured or estimated in the field and categorized\
    \ to get \nan overview of the area. \n5. Conclusion\nThe SAG’s guidelines based\
    \ on the USDA Soil Sur-\nvey Manual provides qualitative data that could be \n\
    used as a first step on defining homogenous soil units. \nThe INSITU methodology\
    \ describes soils from a hy-\ndrophysical point of view, which allows for character-\n\
    ized maps with soil quality indicators, such as clay \ncontent, bulk density and\
    \ water retention capacity, \nwhich vary depending on the crop and the character-\n\
    istics of the soil. \nPublished pedotransfer functions should be carefully \n\
    assess before their use in large-scale design, as the \nquality the estimations\
    \ depends on the data used to \nderive the equations. Therefore, if field data\
    \ is avail-\nable, we recommend calibrating equations using well-\nknown statistical\
    \ methods such as least square. In this \nstudy, the functions obtained describe\
    \ the properties \nof interest properly, such as the field capacity to be \nused\
    \ in micro-irrigation, but they are likely to be im-\nproved in future research,\
    \ especially those used to \npredict wilting point.  \nThe maps obtained using\
    \ the in situ methodology re-\nsult in more homogeneous sites as measured by the\
    \ \ncoefficient of variation (CV) values, taking a more \nglobal view that results\
    \ in reducing associated costs \nand allows for a better use of resources. However,\
    \ \nmore research is needed to assess the reliability and \nreplicability of produced\
    \ maps, in order to define \na standardized protocol to replace current practice.\
    \ \nAlso, it is necessary to investigate whether savings \nin energy and water\
    \ offsets the cost for additional \nfield data.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study\

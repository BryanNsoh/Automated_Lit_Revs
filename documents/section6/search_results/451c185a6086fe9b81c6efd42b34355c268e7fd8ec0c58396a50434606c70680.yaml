    Countries. Agriculture 2023, 13, 1067. Copy Abstract Agriculture is the primary
    source of economic growth in many countries in West Africa. It provides food and
    livelihoods for the population. The purpose of this study is to review the digital
    agriculture status in five countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Coˆte d’Ivoire,
    Ghana, and Nigeria. The study consisted of a bibliometric analysis using a database
    exported from the web of science through a well-defined search string. Additionally,
    the cases of digital technology deployment in the countries were assessed through
    a systematic review approach comparing the technologies used in the target countries.
    Representative articles from the bibliometric review published in the last five
    years were selected for the comparative analysis. The bibliometric analysis based
    on 3,249 publications revealed that the research interests have significantly
    increased since 2014. The top two countries in terms of authors’ nationality were
    Nigeria and Ghana, respectively. Climate change, Machine Learning (ML) and adoption
    were the hot topics of discussion. The digital agriculture survey showed that
    publications in Nigeria were focused on Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensors
    Networks, blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence (IA) technologies. Ghana also
    has a strong interest in blockchain, AI, and big data, while Burkina Faso focused
    on IoT and AI. Cote d’Ivoire and Benin focused only on AI. Keywords Digital agriculture;

    \ \nABSTRACT \n \nNow a day, the latest digital technologies are involved in agriculture\
    \ field i.e. Big Data. Big Data \nplays a crucial role in the advancement of smart\
    \ farming by boosting the productivity of individual \nfarms and removing the\
    \ risk of a global food crisis by collection and analysis process of Big Data.\
    \ \nWith the increasing global population and the growing demand for sustainable\
    \ food production, the \nagriculture industry leaders and policymakers faces numerous\
    \ challenges. Fortunately, \nadvancements in technology, particularly in the field\
    \ of big data analytics, have paved the way for \ninnovative solutions in agriculture,\
    \ such as smart farming. Smart farming leverages big data to \noptimize agriculture\
    \ farming practices i.e. irrigation, fertilization, pest management and crop \n\
    selection, helps in making real time decisions, improve efficiency, improve operations,\
    \ boost \nproductivity and increase yields while minimizing resource consumption\
    \ and environmental impact \n(such as weather, soil, diseases). Big Data’s help\
    \ to farmers is by suggesting pesticides the \nquantity they could use. Hence\
    \ there arises the need for advanced practical and systematic \nstrategies to\
    \ correlate the different factors driving the agriculture to derive valuable information\
    \ out \nof it. The Big Data has power to develop technologies to achieve the aim\
    \ of sustainable and smart \nagriculture with smart farming to enhanced precision\
    \ farming, predictive analytics, and real time \nShort Research Article \n \n\

    \ Smart farming involves the collection and sharing of sensitive information,\
    \ \nranging from crop yields and livestock health to financial data. Safeguarding\
    \ this data from \nunauthorized access and maintaining privacy while still allowing\
    \ for valuable analytics poses a \ncomplex ethical and legal dilemma. This digital\
    \ revolution in agriculture is very promising and will \nenable the agriculture\
    \ sector to move to the next level of farm productivity and profitability. This\
    \ \ntransformation process is not reversible and poised to revolutionize both\
    \ agriculture and food \nsector. \n \n \nKeywords: Agriculture; big data; cloud\
    \ computing; digital agriculture; internet of things; smart farming. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION\
    \ \n \nTechnological \nrevolution \nthat \nis \ncurrently \nhappening in the agricultural\
    \ sector became \npossible, among other things, due to big data. \nCollecting\
    \ and analyzing big data can not only \nimprove the productivity of individual\
    \ farms but \nalso help halt a global food crisis [1-4]. The \nsignificance of\
    \ this lies in the growing need to \nproduce more food while using less land for\
    \ it. To \nreach this goal, policymakers and industry \nleaders seek assistance\
    \ from technological \ninnovations, including big data, IoT, analytics, \nand\
    \ cloud computing [5-7]. More and more data \nis produced and used worldwide.\
    \ But for the \nsuccessful operation of an agricultural business, \nhaving an\
    \ opportunity for big data analysis and \nmanagement is key [8-11]. Agribusinesses\
    \ are \nbecoming larger and more diverse, which results \nin the growing volumes\
    \ of complex data that has \nto be managed constantly. This includes external\
    \ \ndata from social media, supplier network \nchannels, and sensor / machine\
    \ data from the \nfield. This leads to the agricultural sphere \ntransformation,\
    \ opening new opportunities.  \n  \n2. ABOUT BIG DATA  \n \nBig data refers to\
    \ the large and complex sets of \ndata that are characterized by their volume,\
    \ \nvelocity, \nvariety, \nand \nveracity \n[12]. \nIt \nencompasses vast amounts\
    \ of structured and \nunstructured data that cannot be easily managed \nand analyzed\
    \ using traditional data processing \nmethods. \n \nThe term \"big data\" is often\
    \ associated with the \nthree V'S: \n \n1. Volume: Big data involves large volumes\
    \ of \ndata generated from various sources, such \nas sensors, social media, transaction\
    \ \nrecords, and more. The sheer volume of \ndata \nrequires \nspecialized \n\
    tools \nand \ntechnologies for storage, processing, and \nanalysis. \n2. Velocity:\
    \ Big data is generated at high \nspeed and requires real-time or near-real-\n\
    time processing. This rapid flow of data \nrequires systems capable of capturing,\
    \ \nprocessing, and analyzing data in a                 \ntimely \nmanner \nto\
    \ \nextract \nmeaningful \ninsights. \n3. Variety: Big data comes in various forms,\
    \ \nincluding structured, semi-structured, and \nunstructured data. It includes\
    \ text, images, \nvideos, audio, and other formats. The \ndiversity of data types\
    \ and sources poses \nchallenges in terms of integration, analysis, \nand interpretation.\
    \ \n \nBig data has become increasingly relevant in \ntoday's \ndigital \nage\
    \ \ndue \nto \nthe \ngrowing \ninterconnectedness \nof \nsystems \nand \nthe \n\
    proliferation of data-generating devices and \napplications. It holds tremendous\
    \ potential for \norganizations across various sectors, including \nagriculture,\
    \ healthcare, finance, manufacturing, \nand more. However, the effective utilization\
    \ of big \ndata also poses challenges, including data \nquality, privacy, infrastructure\
    \ requirements, and \nthe need for skilled professionals [13,14]. \nOvercoming\
    \ these challenges and harnessing \nthe power of big data can lead to improved\
    \ \nproductivity, sustainability, and innovation in \nvarious industries, driving\
    \ economic growth and \nsocietal advancement. In agriculture, big data \noffers\
    \ opportunities for farmers, researchers, and \nstakeholders to gain valuable\
    \ insights into crop \nmanagement, \nresource \noptimization, \nsupply \nchain\
    \ efficiency, and market trends [15,16]. By \nleveraging advanced analytics techniques,\
    \ such \nas machine learning and predictive modeling, big \ndata \nenables \n\
    data-driven \ndecision-making, \nprecision agriculture, and sustainable farming\
    \ \npractices. \n \n3. BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE \n \nBig data in agriculture is\
    \ a vast source of \nknowledge and information deals with large \nvolume of data\
    \ of farmers and growers. Big Data \nin agriculture will grow to a whopping 1,\
    \ 2 billion \nUSD by 2023. This means that the entire industry \nhas already discerned\
    \ the potential of big data, \n \n \n \n \nChoudhary and Swami; Curr. J. Appl.\
    \ Sci. Technol., vol. 42, no. 22, pp. 40-49, 2023; Article no.CJAST.104159 \n\
    \ \n \n \n42 \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Role of big data in agriculture industry \n \n\
    and companies operating in this sector are \ndetermined to make the most of it.\
    \ Big data has \nsignificant potential to transform the agriculture \nsector by\
    \ improving productivity, sustainability, \nand decision-making processes.  Implementing\
    \ \nbig \ndata \nsolutions \nin \nagriculture \nrequires \novercoming challenges\
    \ such as data collection, \nintegration, privacy, and connectivity in rural \n\
    areas. Additionally, ensuring data security and \naddressing ethical considerations\
    \ in data usage \nare vital for building trust and adoption among \nstakeholders.\
    \ Overall, big data has the potential \nto revolutionize the agriculture sector\
    \ by enabling \ndata-driven decision-making, optimizing resource \nutilization,\
    \ and promoting sustainable practices, \nleading to increased productivity, profitability,\
    \ and \nenvironmental stewardship.  \n \nBig data applications are a combination\
    \ of \ntechnology \nand \nanalytics. \nIt \nentails \nthe \ncollection, compilation,\
    \ and timely processing of \nnew data to help scientists and farmers make \nbetter\
    \ \nand \nmore \ninformed \ndecisions \nin \nagriculture. Farming processes are\
    \ increasingly \nbecoming data-enabled and data-driven, thanks \nto smart machines\
    \ and sensors that generate \nlarge amounts of farm data. Traditional tools are\
    \ \nbeing replaced by sensor-equipped machines \nthat can collect data from their\
    \ environments to \ncontrol their behavior – such as thermostats for \ntemperature\
    \ \nregulation \nor \nalgorithms \nfor \nimplementing \ncrop \nprotection \nstrategies.\
    \ \nTechnology, combined with external big data \nsources like weather data, market\
    \ data, or \nstandards with other farms, is contributing to the \nrapid development\
    \ of smart farming.  Data \nmining processes are utilized by Big Data to \ncreate\
    \ \nsuch \nvital \ninformation. \nWith \nthis \nmethodology, you can find the\
    \ important patterns \nin a huge set of data and condense this \ninformation into\
    \ useful forms. There are different \nmodern systems, such as artificial intelligence,\
    \ \nmachine learning statistics, and more, that are \nused in the big data mechanism.\
    \ \n \nBig data in the agriculture industry is completely \nbased on using technology,\
    \ information, and \nanalytics to bring useful information to farmers. \nBig data\
    \ can be utilized for grabbing information \nabout the agriculture industry or\
    \ it can prove \nbeneficial for any specific segment or area to \nimprove its\
    \ efficiency.  \n \nSustainability, global food security, safety, and \nimproved\
    \ efficiency are some of the critical \nissues that are being addressed by big\
    \ data \napplications in agriculture. Undoubtedly, these \nglobal issues have\
    \ extended the scope of big \ndata beyond farming and now cover the entire \n\
    food supply chain. With the development of the \nInternet of Things, various components\
    \ of \nagriculture and the supply chain are wirelessly \nconnected, generating\
    \ data that is accessible in \nreal-time. Primary sources of data include \noperations,\
    \ \ntransactions, \nand \nimages \nand \nvideos \ncaptured \nby \nsensors \nand\
    \ \nrobots. \nHowever, extracting the full potential of this data \nrepertoire\
    \ \nlies \nin \nefficient \nanalytics. \nThe \ndevelopment of applications related\
    \ to risk \nmanagement, sensor deployment, predictive \nmodeling, \nand \nbenchmarking,\
    \ \nhas \nbeen \npossible due to big data.  \n \n4. TYPES \nOF \nBIG \nDATA \n\
    IN \nAGRICULTURE \n \n4.1 Geospatial Data \n \nGeospatial data in agriculture\
    \ refers to the use of \nlocation-based information to understand and \n \n \n\
    \ \n \nChoudhary and Swami; Curr. J. Appl. Sci. Technol., vol. 42, no. 22, pp.\
    \ 40-49, 2023; Article no.CJAST.104159 \n \n \n \n43 \n \nmanage agricultural\
    \ practices. It involves the \ncollection, analysis, and visualization of data\
    \ \nrelated to crops, soil, weather, and other factors \nthat impact agricultural\
    \ productivity. Geospatial \ntechnologies, such as Geographic Information \nSystems\
    \ (GIS), Global Positioning Systems \n(GPS), and remote sensing, play a crucial\
    \ role in \nacquiring and utilizing this data. Here are some \nkey applications\
    \ and benefits of geospatial data \nin agriculture: \n \na) Precision Farming:\
    \ Geospatial data helps \nfarmers make informed decisions by \nproviding detailed\
    \ information about soil \nconditions, moisture levels, and crop \nhealth across\
    \ their fields. This enables \nprecision farming techniques such as \nvariable\
    \ rate application of fertilizers, \npesticides, and water, leading to optimized\
    \ \nresource utilization and increased crop \nyields. \nb) Crop \nMonitoring:\
    \ \nRemote \nsensing \ntechnologies, including satellite imagery \nand aerial\
    \ drones, allow for regular \nmonitoring of crop growth and health. By \nanalyzing\
    \ vegetation indices, infrared data, \nand other indicators, farmers can identify\
    \ \nareas of stress, disease outbreaks, or \nnutrient deficiencies and take corrective\
    \ \nactions in a timely manner. \nc) Soil Analysis: Geospatial data provides \n\
    valuable insights into soil characteristics \nsuch as composition, moisture content,\
    \ \nand fertility. By overlaying soil data with \ncrop yield data, farmers can\
    \ identify soil \nvariations across their fields and adjust \ncultivation \npractices\
    \ \naccordingly. \nThis \ninformation \nhelps \noptimize \nirrigation, \ndrainage,\
    \ \nand \nnutrient \nmanagement \nstrategies. \nd) Pest \nand \nDisease \nManagement:\
    \ \nGeospatial data aids in monitoring and \nmanaging pests and diseases in crops.\
    \ By \nintegrating data on pest populations, \nweather patterns, and crop phenology,\
    \ \nfarmers can predict and mitigate pest \noutbreaks. They can target specific\
    \ areas \nwith preventive measures or localized \npesticide applications, reducing\
    \ overall \nchemical use. \ne) Land Use Planning: Geospatial data \nsupports decision-making\
    \ related to land \nuse and crop selection. By analyzing soil \nsuitability, topography,\
    \ and climate data, \nfarmers can determine the best crops to \ngrow on their\
    \ land. This information also \nhelps optimize field boundaries, plan \nirrigation\
    \ systems, and identify areas prone \nto erosion or runoff. \nf) \nClimate Resilience:\
    \ Geospatial data plays \na crucial role in climate change adaptation \nand resilience.\
    \ By analyzing historical \nweather patterns and projected climate \nscenarios,\
    \ farmers can make informed \ndecisions \nabout \nplanting \ndates, \ncrop \n\
    selection, \nand \nwater \nmanagement \nstrategies. This helps them mitigate the\
    \ \nrisks associated with changing climatic \nconditions. \ng) Supply Chain Management:\
    \ Geospatial \ndata helps improve the efficiency of \nagricultural supply chains.\
    \ By tracking the \nmovement of crops from farms to markets, \nstakeholders can\
    \ optimize transportation \nroutes, reduce post-harvest losses, and \nensure \n\
    timely \ndelivery \nof \nproduce. \nGeospatial data also facilitates traceability\
    \ \nand quality control throughout the supply \nchain. \n \nIn summary, geospatial\
    \ data in agriculture \nempowers \nfarmers \nand \nstakeholders \nwith \nvaluable\
    \ information for better decision-making, \nresource optimization, and improved\
    \ agricultural \nproductivity. \nIt \nenables \nprecision \nfarming \npractices,\
    \ \nsupports \nsustainable \nland \nmanagement, \nand \nenhances \nthe \noverall\
    \ \nresilience of agricultural systems. \n \n4.2 Meta-Data \n \nMetadata in big\
    \ data plays a crucial role in the \nfield \nof \nagriculture. \nIt \nprovides\
    \ \nadditional \ninformation about the data being collected, \nstored, \nand \n\
    analyzed, \nenabling \nbetter \nunderstanding and utilization of agricultural\
    \ big \ndata. Here are some ways metadata is used in \nthe context of agriculture\
    \ and big Data: \n \na) Data Source Identification: Metadata helps \nin identifying\
    \ the source of agricultural \ndata, such as the sensor or device used for \n\
    data collection, location, and time of data \ncapture. This information is valuable\
    \ for \nquality \ncontrol, \ndata \nvalidation, \nand \nensuring data integrity.\
    \ \nb) Data Description and Context: Metadata \nprovides \na \ndescription \n\
    of \nthe \ndata, \nincluding its format, structure, and content. \nIt helps in\
    \ understanding the variables, \nunits of measurement, and any associated \nstandards\
    \ or protocols used in the data \ncollection \nprocess. \nThis \ncontextual \n\
    information is essential for interpreting and \nanalyzing the data accurately.\

    \ \nand \nTraceability: \nMetadata captures the history and lineage \nof agricultural\
    \ data, including its origin, \nprocessing steps, transformations, and any \n\
    associated algorithms or models used. It \nenables traceability and accountability,\
    \ \nensuring \nthat \ndata \nconsumers \ncan \nunderstand the data's journey and\
    \ have \nconfidence in its reliability. \nd) Data \nIntegration \nand \nInteroperability:\
    \ \nMetadata facilitates the integration of \ndiverse agricultural datasets from\
    \ various \nsources, \nformats, \nand \nplatforms. \nBy \ndescribing the data\
    \ structure, schema, and \nsemantics, it enables data interoperability \nand harmonization,\
    \ allowing for seamless \ndata \nintegration \nand \nanalysis \nacross \ndifferent\
    \ systems and applications.  \ne) Data Access and Discovery: Metadata \nprovides\
    \ information about the availability, \naccessibility, and usage restrictions\
    \ of \nagricultural data. It helps in cataloging and \nindexing data, making it\
    \ easier to discover \nand retrieve specific datasets based on \ntheir metadata\

    - Desert Research Centre - Egypt 10.21608/IJMAE.2023.215955.1015 Abstract         Access
    to Information: Technology provides small farmers with access to valuable information
    and knowledge. Through the internet, mobile applications, and online platforms,
    farmers can access weather forecasts, market prices, agricultural practices, and
    crop management techniques. This information enables them to make informed decisions,
    adopt best practices, and optimize their farming operations. Precision Farming:
    Precision farming technologies, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic
    Information System (GIS), and remote sensing, help small farmers optimize resource
    use and improve crop yields. These technologies enable precise field mapping,
    soil analysis, and monitoring of crop health, allowing farmers to apply fertilizers,
    water, and other inputs only where and when needed. This reduces resource wastage,
    enhances efficiency, and minimizes environmental impact.           Farm Management
    Software: Farm management software and mobile applications assist small farmers
    in managing their operations more effectively. These tools help with record keeping,
    financial management, inventory tracking, and farm planning. By automating administrative
    tasks and providing real-time data, farmers can streamline their processes, monitor
    performance, and make data-driven decisions. Mobile Technology: Mobile phones
    and applications have transformed agricultural practices for small farmers. They
    enable farmers to access agricultural information, receive alerts on weather conditions,
    market prices, and pest outbreaks. Mobile technology also facilitates communication
    and networking among farmers, allowing them to share knowledge, learn from each
    other, and access extension services remotely.            Agricultural Machinery
    and Equipment: Technology has improved the availability and effectiveness of agricultural
    machinery and equipment, even for small-scale farmers. Small agricultural projects
    can benefit from compact and affordable machinery, such as mini-tractors, tillers,
    planters, and harvesters, which help increase productivity, reduce labor requirements,
    and improve overall efficiency. Irrigation Systems: Technology has advanced irrigation
    systems, making them more efficient and accessible for small farmers. Drip irrigation,
    sprinkler systems, and sensor-based irrigation technologies enable precise water
    application, reducing water wastage and increasing water-use efficiency. This
    is especially beneficial in areas with water scarcity or unreliable rainfall patterns.
    Post-Harvest Technologies: Post-harvest losses are a significant challenge for
    small farmers. Technology offers solutions to mitigate these losses by improving
    storage, processing, and value addition. Technologies such as solar dryers, cold
    storage facilities, and packaging innovations help extend the shelf life of produce,
    reduce spoilage, and increase the market value of agricultural products. E-commerce
    and Market Access: Technology has opened up new avenues for small farmers to access
    markets and sell their produce. E-commerce platforms, online marketplaces, and
    mobile applications connect farmers directly with buyers, eliminating intermediaries
    and enabling fairer prices. This improves market access, reduces transaction costs,
    and creates opportunities for small farmers to reach a wider customer base.   Keywords

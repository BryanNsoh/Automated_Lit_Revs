    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation

    academia, research institutions, and extension services can facilitate knowledge
    transfer and skill development, addressing the capacity gaps and promoting the
    effective use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation practices. Integration with
    existing agricultural practices Integrating drone technology into existing agricultural
    practices requires farmers to adapt their workflows and decision-making processes
    [119,97]. Farmers need to understand how to interpret drone-generated data and
    incorporate it into their irrigation management strategies. Extension services
    and farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing platforms play a crucial role in facilitating
    this integration. Opportunities for leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    Enhanced water use efficiency and crop yield optimization Leveraging 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation presents significant opportunities for enhancing water use
    efficiency and optimizing crop yields [121,122]. Through the integration of sensors,
    AI algorithms, and real-time data monitoring, smart irrigation systems can precisely
    assess soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop water requirements.
    This data-driven approach enables farmers to apply water resources more efficiently,
    minimizing water wastage and maximizing crop productivity. By ensuring that irrigation
    is tailored to the specific needs of crops and adapting to changing environmental
    conditions, 4IR technologies can significantly contribute to sustainable water
    management and improved agricultural outcomes. Data-driven decision-making for
    improved irrigation practices The use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    facilitates data-driven decision-making processes, enabling farmers to make informed
    choices regarding irrigation practices [121]. By collecting and analyzing large
    volumes of data from various sources, such as sensors, satellites, and weather
    stations, smart irrigation systems provide valuable insights into soil conditions,
    crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. This wealth of information
    empowers farmers to optimize irrigation strategies, adjust watering schedules,
    and apply the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved water
    management and increased crop productivity. Data-driven decision-making also allows
    for proactive responses to changing climate patterns and helps mitigate the risks
    associated with water scarcity and climate variability. Precision irrigation and
    resource conservation Precision irrigation, made possible by 4IR technologies,
    offers the opportunity to precisely target water delivery to crops, thereby conserving
    water resources [121]. By utilizing data from sensors, drones, and satellite imagery,
    smart irrigation systems can identify variations in soil moisture levels, plant
    water stress, and water availability across different areas of the field. This
    information enables farmers to implement site-specific irrigation, providing water
    precisely where and when it is needed. As a result, water wastage is minimized,
    and the overall water use efficiency is significantly improved. Precision irrigation
    also contributes to reducing nutrient leaching, minimizing soil erosion, and optimizing
    fertilizer application, leading to more sustainable agricultural practices. Empowering
    smallholder farmers and rural communities 4IR technologies have the potential
    to empower smallholder farmers and rural communities by democratizing access to
    information, resources, and market opportunities [123]. Through the use of mobile
    applications, remote sensing, and digital platforms, farmers can access real-time
    data on weather conditions, market prices, and best agricultural practices [124].
    This information enables them to make informed decisions, improve productivity,
    and increase their income. Additionally, 4IR technologies facilitate the integration
    of smallholder farmers into agricultural value chains, connecting them with buyers,
    financial services, and extension services. This enhanced connectivity and access
    to markets can contribute to poverty alleviation, economic growth, and the overall
    development of rural communities. Prospects of fourth industrial revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa Scaling up adoption of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation To fully harness the potential of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in smart irrigation, it is crucial to scale up their adoption across

    is a crucial global problem affecting billions of people worldwide. Food security
    is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)
    as “when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access
    to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food
    preferences for an active and healthy life” (Cudjoe et al. 2021). Despite tremendous
    improvements in recent decades, food security remains a key concern, especially
    in developing nations and among vulnerable people (Keesstra et al. 2016). The
    world’s population continues to rise, placing enormous strain on agricultural
    systems to produce enough food to feed everyone effectively. Weather patterns
    that are erratic, severe occurrences, and changing climatic circumstances significantly
    influence agricultural production, resulting in crop failures, lower yields, and
    food shortages (Nathan and Joel Uche 2023; Oseni and Masarirambi 2011). Soil erosion,
    deforestation, and degradation of arable land endanger agricultural production
    and restrict cultivable land availability. Water shortage in many locations impedes
    irrigation and farming practices, resulting in water stress and lower crop yields.
    Much of the world’s food supply is lost or squandered at different points throughout
    the supply chain, from production to consumption, aggravating food poverty (Khanna,
    2018). Sustainable agriculture is an important strategy for addressing global
    food security concerns while minimizing negative environmental consequences. Sustainable
    agriculture seeks to increase production, protect natural resources, promote ecological
    balance, and assure farmers’ economic viability (Herzberg et al. 2022). It entails
    putting practices that promote long-term food production in place while neither
    depleting resources nor damaging the environment (Abubakar 2021). The AIoT has
    emerged as a disruptive technology with enormous promise to revolutionise the
    agriculture industry in recent years. The AIoT is a network of networked devices
    with sensors, software, and data analytics capabilities that gather and share
    data via the Internet. AIoT may be used in agriculture to monitor and manage different
    elements of farming, such as crop health, irrigation, pest control, and animal
    management (Saad et al. 2023). Furthermore, recision farming is made possible
    by AIoT-enabled sensors and data analytics, which allow farmers to monitor and
    optimise inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides, resulting in higher
    efficiency and decreased resource waste (Giuffrida et al. 2022). Weather forecasting
    and monitoring powered by AIoT assist farmers in adapting to changing weather
    patterns, mitigating risks, and making educated crop management choices. AIoT
    enables farmers to monitor their crops and animals from afar remotely, increasing
    output and minimising the requirement for personal presence (Kemmoe et al. 2022).
    AIoT applications in the food supply chain increase traceability, minimize food
    loss, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. AIoT technologies improve efficiency
    and solve problems in agriculture and food supply systems. Food security and sustainable
    agriculture need precision farming, smart irrigation, livestock monitoring, supply
    chain traceability, climate resilience, data-driven decision-making, and sustainable
    resource management (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). The United Nations established the
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to address worldwide social, economic,
    and environmental challenges. These 17 global objectives provide a comprehensive
    framework for promoting sustainable development and improving people’s well-being.
    They cover various issues such as poverty eradication, hunger, health, education,
    gender equality, clean water, sanitation, affordable energy, decent work, industry,
    innovation, climate action, life below water, life on land, peace and justice,
    and strong institutions (Kalu et al. 2021). The SDGs emphasize collaboration among
    governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals to achieve sustainable
    development. By 2030, the SDGs aim to end poverty, hunger, inequality, access
    to quality education and healthcare, promote sustainable economic growth, combat
    climate change, and protect biodiversity (Erin and Bamigboye 2022). Implementing
    the SDGs requires political commitment, adequate resources, and effective policies.
    Governments play a crucial role in setting national priorities, aligning policies
    with the SDGs, and mobilizing financial resources. Businesses are encouraged to
    adopt sustainable practices, invest in innovation, and contribute to the achievement
    of the goals (Khan et al. 2022). In conclusion, the SDGs represent a global roadmap
    for creating a more sustainable and equitable future for all, addressing the root
    causes of poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. Achieving the SDGs
    requires collective efforts and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind.
    The study’s research goal is to look at the role of AIoT in promoting sustainable
    agriculture and tackling food security issues. The research will examine the possible
    advantages and drawbacks of AIoT applications in agriculture, such as crop management,
    water conservation, animal monitoring, and supply chain management. The study
    will thoroughly examine current literature, case studies, and real-world deployments
    of AIoT solutions in agriculture. It will concentrate on the influence of AIoT
    on agricultural production, resource efficiency, and climate change resistance.
    In addition, the research will look at the problems and hurdles to AIoT adoption
    in agriculture, policy implications, and future trends. Overall, this study aims
    to improve knowledge of how AIoT may play an important role in promoting sustainable
    agriculture and maintaining food security in a fast-changing world. The study
    seeks to give significant insights for policymakers, academics, and stakeholders
    to make informed choices and build strategies for sustainable agricultural growth
    by highlighting the prospects and difficulties of AIoT adoption in agriculture.
    This chapter is arranged into nine different sections. In Sect. 2, the related
    works are discussed in detail. The research on AIoT applications in sustainable
    agriculture is presented in detail in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides a discussion
    on AIoT in food supply chain management. Section 5 provides the challenges and
    barriers. Section 6 discusses the policy and regulatory considerations. Section
    7 provides the Case Studies and real-world implementations as well as future trends
    and innovations are provided in Sect. 8. Finally, Sect. 9 concludes the study.
    2 Literature Review Climate change, water shortages, and the need for effective
    resource management are just a few of the many obstacles that agriculture must
    overcome to ensure the world''s food supply. The AIoT has emerged as a potent
    tool to overcome these obstacles and improve agriculture’s long-term viability
    (Praveen et al. 2021). AIoT systems use sensors, data analytics, and real-time
    connectivity to monitor and optimize agricultural operations for higher yields,
    lower resource waste, and safer food supplies (Nwankwoala and Okujagu 2021). This
    section examines current AIoT technologies for sustainable agriculture and food
    security. Using sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels,
    and crop health is at the heart of precision farming, a prominent use in agriculture.
    More informed choices about watering, fertilizing, and controlling pests may be
    made by farmers thanks to this information (Sohel et al. 2022). With real-time
    data from weather stations and soil moisture sensors, AIoT-enabled smart irrigation
    systems can fine-tune watering schedules to meet the precise needs of individual
    crops. These methods help farmers save water and irrigate their crops more efficiently,
    especially in arid areas (Farooq et al. 2022). AIoT devices with sensors and GPS
    may track cattle and monitor their well-being and habits. Better livestock management
    and greater food production result from using livestock monitoring tools that
    assist farmers in identifying health problems early, optimizing feeding patterns
    and enhancing breeding practices (Eze et al. 2022). Due to AIoT-based supply chain
    traceability systems, food goods may be tracked and monitored in real-time through
    the supply chain. These methods improve visibility and tracking, safeguarding
    against food fraud and keeping consumers secure (Farooq et al. 2022; Kazmi and
    Sodangi 2022). Weather patterns, temperature, and humidity data are gathered via
    AIoT-based weather stations and environmental sensors, which are then used for
    climate monitoring and prediction (Al-otaibi 2022). This information is utilized
    to foresee the effects of climate change and harsh weather on crops, allowing
    farmers to make necessary preparations in advance. To keep tabs on pest populations
    in farms, AIoT systems have integrated pest monitoring sensors and data analytics.
    As stated by (Zhao et al. 2022), pests may be managed more sustainably and with
    less reliance on chemical pesticides if their presence is identified sufficiently
    soon. Automated and optimized nutrition and water management is achieved via integrating
    AIoT technology into aquaponics and hydroponics systems. These methods allow for
    year-round farming, reduce water use, and boost the long-term viability of fish
    and vegetable harvests (Yoon 2020). Data on crop health and stress may be gathered
    in real-time via remote sensing technologies like satellites and drones fitted
    with AIoT sensors. This data aids farmers in making early diagnoses of disease
    and nutritional deficits, which leads to more focused treatments and fewer crop
    failures (Abdullahi et al. 2022). AIoT technologies use automated traps, drones,
    and AI for smart pest control (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). This allows for precise
    monitoring and managing of pest populations without harming the ecosystem. Indicators
    of soil health, such as pH, nutrient content, and organic matter, are tracked
    using AIoT sensors and devices. Producing crops sustainably and effectively requires
    this information to implement precision agricultural practices and enhance soil
    fertility (Mishra and Pandya 2021). As a result of optimizing resource utilization,
    increasing productivity, and raising the efficiency of food supply chains, AIoT
    technologies have the potential to revolutionize agriculture and solve food security
    concerns. Current AIoT solutions show how important technology is to attaining
    sustainable agriculture and meeting the needs of a rising global population. 3
    AIoT Applications in Sustainable Agriculture Global food security depends on agriculture,
    yet climate change, water shortages, and resource management pose concerns. The
    AIoT can solve these problems and improve agriculture’s sustainability. AIoT systems
    monitor and optimize agricultural processes using sensors, data analytics, and
    real-time connectivity, improving productivity, resource efficiency, and food
    security (Dibia and Nwaigwe 2017; Herzberg et al. 2022). For precision farming,
    AIoT sensors capture soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and crop health
    data. This data may help farmers optimize irrigation, fertilization, and insect
    management for better resource utilization and crop yields. Smart irrigation systems
    optimize watering schedules based on crop water needs using real-time data from
    weather stations and soil moisture sensors (Ambayea et al. 2022). Livestock monitoring
    systems enhance livestock management and food production by detecting health concerns
    early, optimizing feeding patterns, and improving breeding practices. Supply chain
    traceability systems reduce food fraud and ensure food safety by tracking and
    monitoring food goods in real-time (Oberlack et al. 2021). Farmers can modify
    their practices and safeguard their from bad weather using AIoT-based weather
    stations and environmental sensors. Data analytics and integrated pest monitoring
    devices reduce the demand for chemical pesticides and promote eco-friendly pest
    control (Awofeso and Odeyemi 2021). Aquaponics and hydroponics systems automate
    and optimise nutrition and water management, allowing year-round growing, decreased
    water use, and sustainable fish and vegetable production. Farmers need remote
    sensing for crop health and stress to identify illnesses and nutrient shortages
    early and cure them for maximum development and output (Norton 2016). Farmers
    may plan planting, irrigation, and pest management using weather forecasts and
    predictive analytics. Smart farming and precision agriculture improve crop quality,
    food safety, efficiency, sustainability, data-driven decision-making, labour,
    and time (Ambayea et al. 2022; Voora et al. 2022). However, early investment expenditures,
    data privacy and security issues, and farmers’ technical knowledge are obstacles.
    Smart farming may be vital to global food security and environmental sustainability
    as technology advances. Thus, components of precision agriculture are illustrated
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 The components of precision agriculture (Herzberg et al. 2022)
    Full size image 3.1 Smart Irrigation and Water Management Smart irrigation is
    a cutting-edge technique for managing water in agriculture. It allows farmers
    to save water without sacrificing yield. Smart irrigation systems reduce water
    waste while supplying water reliably to crops depending on individual demands,
    local weather, and other data collected from various sensors and AIoT devices
    (Raghuvanshi et al. 2022). Agriculture uses a lot of water, so finding ways to
    save and reuse that water is essential. Smart irrigation systems determine when
    and how much water should be supplied to crops by monitoring soil moisture and
    evapotranspiration rates (Zhang, Xu et al. 2022b). Smart agricultural practices,
    such as drip irrigation and controlled watering systems, are increasingly used
    to reduce water waste from evaporation and runoff. This technology allows farmers
    to minimize labor by remotely controlling irrigation cycles and maintaining a
    steady water supply. Smart irrigation helps conserve water, grow crops with the
    same amount of water, save money, be more eco-friendly, and be less vulnerable
    to climate change (Neupane et al. 2022; Ning and Liu 2015). However, barriers
    to wider adoption exist, including the need for costly upfront investments, specialized
    knowledge, and consistent access to the Internet (Arubayi 2023). Finally, smart
    irrigation and water management provide a game-changing strategy for environmentally
    responsible farming by helping farmers reduce water waste, maximize crop output,
    and safeguard natural resources. Farmers can help ensure food security in the
    face of climate change by adopting smart irrigation practices like drip irrigation
    and automated watering systems (Merem et al. 2018). Smart irrigation in agriculture
    is predicted to play a crucial role in attaining sustainable water management
    and guaranteeing the resilience of agricultural systems as technology develops.
    3.2 Livestock Management and Health Monitoring Livestock management is an important
    part of contemporary agriculture since it ensures the health and production of
    livestock animals (Ali and Choi 2020). AIoT technology is helping to improve livestock
    management and health monitoring. Farmers may monitor their animals’ health, behaviour,
    and position in real-time by employing wearable sensors and tracking devices,
    allowing for early diagnosis of health concerns or irregularities (Okonofua et
    al. 2021). AIoT-enabled monitoring devices give significant data into cattle movement
    and behaviour, assisting farmers in managing grazing patterns and preventing straying.
    Behavioral monitoring may detect indicators of discomfort or changes in eating
    patterns, resulting in better animal welfare (Kochovski and Stankovski 2018).
    One of the most important advantages of AIoT in livestock management is illness
    diagnosis and prevention facilitated by AIoT. AIoT devices may notify farmers
    of any sickness or stress symptoms by monitoring vital signs and physiological
    factors, limiting disease transmission and significant economic losses (Khan and
    Ahmad 2022). Furthermore, AIoT-based data analytics may aid in identifying illness
    patterns and trends, hence contributing to the creation of effective disease preventive
    programmes. AIoT technology increases animal welfare, productivity, labour costs,
    resource management efficiency, illness control, and biosecurity. However, there
    are hurdles to using AIoT in livestock management, such as initial expenses for
    AIoT devices and infrastructure, dependable connection in remote locations, and
    data privacy and security issues (Abdullahi et al. 2022). Finally, AIoT technology
    has revolutionized livestock management and health monitoring in agriculture,
    allowing farmers to carefully monitor the health and behavior of their animals,
    resulting in enhanced animal welfare and production. AIoT-enabled early disease
    detection and prevention improve biosecurity measures and minimize illness-related
    economic losses (Mishra and Pandya 2021; Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). To ensure the
    well-being of animals and farmers, the AIoT integration in livestock management
    will be crucial as technology develops, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Livestock
    management and health monitoring (Darem et al. 2022) Full size image 4 AIoT in
    Food Supply Chain Management The AIoT has changed the logistics and supply chain
    management industries by enabling real-time monitoring and tracing of items in
    transit. Sensors and gadgets enabled by the are built into things, containers,
    and vehicles to track and record data such as location, temperature, and humidity
    (Praveen et al. 2021). This real-time information allows businesses to streamline
    their supply chains and reduce wasted time and money. Due to AIoT-enabled smart
    logistics, companies can improve inventory management, save operating costs, and
    boost customer satisfaction with on-time, precise delivery (Kamble et al. 2019).
    Perishable items’ quality and safety, including fresh fruit, medicines, and vaccinations,
    depend on effective cold chain management and food preservation (Zhong et al.
    2015). Cold chain management powered by the helps keep goods fresh and secure
    across the supply chain, which helps cut down on food waste and boosts food security.
    Assuring the quality and security of goods via sensors and monitoring is crucial.
    Sensors enabled by the can check food for pH, moisture, and pollutants to ensure
    it''s safe and up to standards (Nozari et al. 2022; Rehman Khan et al. 2022).
    The AIoT makes supply chain visibility, transparency, efficiency, cost savings,
    product quality and safety improvements, sustainability, and environmental impact
    possible (Ezenwa 2019). Data privacy and security, standardization and interoperability
    of AIoT systems, and dependable and continuous connection are just a few hurdles
    that need to be cleared before widespread adoption can occur in supply chain and
    food management (Bertin et al. 2022). AIoT-enabled smart logistics and supply
    chain monitoring, cold chain management, and quality and safety assurance are
    revolutionizing how organizations operate and ensuring that supply chain operations
    are efficient and sustainable (Zakeri et al. 2022). Companies can improve logistics,
    protect the freshness of perishable items, and guarantee their products’ safety
    by using real-time data and insights (Zhong et al. 2015). To keep up with the
    demands of the current business environment and ensure the delivery of high-quality
    goods to customers, supply chain management must increasingly use AIoT technologies,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 AIoT in food supply chain management (Zhong et
    al. 2015) Full size image 5 Challenges and Barriers The technological difficulty
    of establishing and maintaining AIoT systems is a major obstacle to their widespread
    use in agriculture. Integrating sensors, devices, and networking technologies
    may be difficult, particularly for small-scale farmers in rural places with little
    infrastructure (Lu 2018). AIoT applications demand real-time data transfer, which
    might be difficult in rural areas. Data security and privacy are crucial as AIoT
    devices create massive volumes of data. Farmers must secure their crop production,
    soil health, and market data against unauthorized access and cyberattacks (Abdullahi
    et al. 2022). Data encryption, access limits, and secure communication protocols
    protect farmers’ vital data. Small-scale farmers and underdeveloped areas may
    struggle to use AIoT technology due to their high upfront costs. AIoT devices,
    sensors, and connection solutions are costly, making it hard for resource-constrained
    farmers to use them (Zimba 2022). Technical support and maintenance may also strain
    finances. Lack of awareness and understanding of AIoT, limited access to technical
    competence, and cultural opposition to new technology may hinder small-scale farmers
    in developing nations. These areas may additionally struggle to embrace AIoT technologies
    due to language and digital literacy issues (Al Qartah 2020). 5.1 Solution and
    Mitigation Technical constraints, data security concerns, financial issues, and
    acceptance hurdles might prevent the broad adoption of AIoT in agriculture, especially
    in small farms and developing nations. Stakeholders, including governments, commercial
    enterprises, and non-profits, must work together to solve these problems (Hammi
    et al. 2022). By promoting accessible and user-friendly AIoT solutions, guaranteeing
    data security, giving financial incentives, and helping farmers with capacity
    development and training, the agricultural industry can maximize AIoT’s potential
    for sustainable and efficient farming (Ouechtati et al. 2021). Simplified and
    User-Friendly Solutions: Small-scale farmers may use AIoT solutions that are user-friendly
    and cost-effective. Plug-and-play AIoT devices and straightforward interfaces
    may help farmers set up and employ AIoT technology (Jayashankar et al. 2018).
    Public–Private Partnerships: Government agencies, private firms, and NGOs may
    work together to deliver AIoT solutions in poor countries. Joint projects may
    overcome financial and technical constraints and give farmers with training and
    assistance (Hammi et al. 2022). Data Security: Encryption and authentication help
    secure farmers’ data from cyberattacks. To protect data privacy, farmers must
    be educated about data security (Bertin et al. 2022). Subsidies and Incentives:
    Government subsidies or financial incentives for adopting AIoT technology might
    encourage small-scale farmers to invest in these solutions. Implementation costs
    may be reduced via cost-sharing and tax incentives. Training and capacity development
    may improve farmers’ digital literacy and technical abilities. Extension programmes
    and training may assist farmers in grasping AIoT devices (Hammi et al. 2022).
    6 Policy and Regulatory Considerations Agriculture might become more sustainable,
    efficient, and productive using AIoT technology. Through different programmes,
    governments worldwide have supported AIoT adoption. These include financial support,
    research and development funding, capacity building and training, regulatory frameworks,
    public–private partnerships, testbeds and demonstration farms, digital infrastructure
    development, data analytics, and decision support, market linkages and e-commerce
    platforms, and policy advocacy (Lu 2018). These projects have helped farmers use
    AIoT to solve agricultural problems, boost production, and adopt sustainable and
    efficient farming methods. International partnerships and standards are critical
    to developing and accepting AIoT-based food security solutions since governments,
    organisations, and stakeholders must work together to solve the agricultural and
    food sectors’ complex problems (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). The widespread use of
    AIoT technology in agriculture has led to sustainable, efficient, and more productive
    farming. Governments worldwide have been actively pushing and supporting the adoption
    of AIoT due to its critical importance (Fang et al. 2012). Governments provide
    financial assistance, grants, and subsidies to encourage farmers and agricultural
    enterprises to invest in AIoT technology. These rebates reduce the out-of-pocket
    expense of implementing an AIoT system or device, making them more feasible for
    farms of all sizes. Government funding for research and development (R&D) programs
    that provide specialized AIoT solutions for agriculture, such as precision agriculture,
    remote sensing, and livestock monitoring, has led to the developing cutting-edge
    tools and methods (Zhang, Li et al. 2022a). Governments host training programs
    and seminars to improve farmers’ and agricultural employees’ familiarity with
    digital literacy and technical abilities. They set up legislative frameworks that
    make it easier for farmers to use AIoT. Governments create standards for AIoT
    devices and data privacy rules to guarantee the safety of AIoT solutions and protect
    farmers’ data. They work with businesses, universities, and NGOs to promote the
    use of AIoT in farming via public–private partnerships, resulting in increased
    opportunities for information exchange, access to cutting-edge technology, and
    the creation of industry-specific AIoT solutions (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Governments
    also invest in constructing and updating digital infrastructure, such as high-speed
    internet access and mobile networks, to guarantee uninterrupted data transfer
    and communication between farm AIoT devices. They provide data analytics and decision
    support systems that use information gathered from AIoT devices to advise farmers
    on improving their operations (Yin et al. 2022). Governments also develop e-commerce
    platforms that link farmers with customers or purchasers, improving market connections
    and maintaining produce quality and traceability throughout the supply chain.
    Governments advocate for policies that encourage the use of AIoT in farming, such
    as lowering taxes, fostering cross-institutional research partnerships, and lobbying
    for more lenient rules (Godager et al. 2021). The extensive use of AIoT technology
    in agriculture can be attributed to various factors, including financial incentives,
    R&D funding, capacity building, regulatory frameworks, public–private partnerships,
    and the growth of digital infrastructure (Yang et al. 2021). Sharing knowledge
    and best practices helps advance AIoT-based food security solutions. International
    cooperation and standards are essential for food security. Sharing knowledge,
    harmonizing standards, aggregating data, fostering research and development, aligning
    policies, pooling resources, and building capacities can help countries and organisations
    develop cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions for the global agriculture
    and food sectors (Kumar et al. 2020). These agreements allow data exchange and
    aggregation, improving AIoT-based food security solutions. Cross-border research
    and development projects bring together professionals from various nations to
    solve food security issues, resulting in cutting-edge technology and novel solutions
    (Yin et al. 2022). Funding and resource allocation, capacity development and training,
    scaling up successful projects, and addressing data privacy and security issues
    are all examples of ways in which policy alignment and collaboration may be fostered.
    Thus, AIoT-based food security solutions can only be fully realised via international
    cooperation and standardization. Sharing information, harmonizing standards, gathering
    data, promoting research and development, aligning policies, pooling resources,
    and creating skills may help governments and organizations handle global food
    security issues. These combined efforts will lead to sustainable and resilient
    food systems for everybody (Chilaka and Chilaka 2019). 7 Case Studies and Real-World
    Implementations The ability of AIoT solutions to tackle difficult problems and
    propel good change has been shown by their widespread adoption in some countries.
    AIoT technology may enhance productivity, sustainability, and resource management,
    as shown by the featured case studies in precision agriculture, fisheries management,
    and smart grids. Guidelines for future AIoT implementations may be derived from
    the lessons gained and best practices in interoperability, data security, user-centric
    design, and local context concerns (Yin et al. 2022). In order to create a more
    sustainable and interconnected society, AIoT solutions must continue to develop
    and cooperate. Many sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, transportation,
    and more, have been radically altered by AIoT development. This section looks
    at real-world deployments of AIoT technologies in various areas to draw up lessons
    and best practices (Yin et al. 2022). Some globally effective solutions are (Cliff
    et al. 2023; Godager et al. 2021). Accurate farming methods in the USA: Precision
    farming has become more popular in the United States. Farmers use the devices
    like soil sensors, weather stations, and drones to monitor their crops and ensure
    everything is running well. Farmers may improve their irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest management methods with real-time data from these sensors. Sustainable
    agriculture has benefited from increased agricultural yields and more effective
    use of available resources. Norwegian Smart Fishery Management: Norway has introduced
    -based solutions to encourage responsible fishing practices in its fisheries sector.
    AIoT technologies like GPS trackers and sensors are installed aboard fishing boats
    to keep tabs on catch rates, fish stocks, and environmental factors. By using
    this information, authorities can better enforce fishing limits, curb overfishing,
    and safeguard marine ecosystems, assuring the fishing industry''s continued success.
    South Korean smart grids: South Korea''s energy industry has made great efforts
    towards implementing technology. (AIoT) sensors are used in smart grids for real-time
    monitoring of energy usage, distribution optimisation, and problem detection.
    Improved grid efficiency in South Korea has resulted in lower energy costs and
    greater sustainability through lowering energy waste and increasing energy dependability.
    7.1 Best Practices and Real-World Lessons The practices and real-world lessons
    include (Janabi and Kurnaz 2023): Standardisation and Compatibility: Successful
    systems need standardized communication protocols and the ability to easily integrate
    new hardware and software. The easy sharing of data and compatibility across various
    AIoT components are made possible by establishing interoperability. Data Privacy
    and Protection: Sensitive data must be collected and sent securely in AIoT implementations.
    To defend against cyber risks and preserve user privacy, implementers should prioritize
    data encryption, user authentication, and data access restrictions. User-centered
    design: Users are the focus of good design. To increase user adoption and engagement,
    it is important to provide user-friendly interfaces, clear representations, and
    intuitive functionality. Flexibility and scalability: The data volume and the
    number of connected devices are expected to grow over time. Therefore, AIoT implementations
    must be flexible. As a result of its adaptability, new technologies, and future
    growth may be easily included. Consideration of the Local Context: Successful
    installations need adjustments for each unique situation. To provide successful
    solutions, it is essential to appreciate various geographical areas’ specific
    difficulties, cultural subtleties, and infrastructural limitations. Coordination
    and Cooperation: Governments, businesses, universities, and communities all have
    a stake in a successful rollout of the Partners may pool their knowledge, skills,
    and resources through collaboration to create long-lasting improvements. Control
    and Assessment: To determine how successful an AIoT solution is and where it may
    be enhanced, constant monitoring and assessment are required. Insights derived
    from data analysis support continual optimization and enable evidence-based decision-making.
    Instruction and Capacity Development: The knowledge and proficiency of end-users
    and implementers of AIoT technologies may be improved via training and capacity-building
    programs. Building people''s abilities is crucial to ensuring that the solutions
    have the desired effect. 8 Future Trends and Innovations The AIoT has advanced
    swiftly and is continuing to drive innovation. In the not-too-distant future,
    AIoT technologies will merge with AI and machine learning, resulting in unheard-of
    levels of efficiency and automation. The introduction of 5G technology and the
    development of edge computing will also usher in a new era of AIoT applications,
    particularly in the agricultural industry (Saad et al. 2023). Improvements in
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, and edge computing point to a bright
    future for AIoT in agriculture by fueling substantial gains in efficiency, sustainability,
    and production. 5G and edge computing will improve connection and data processing,
    and combining AI and machine learning with AIoT will allow for predictive analytics
    and autonomous systems. Precision farming, smart irrigation, remote monitoring,
    and evidence-based decision-making are just some ways the AIoT will revolutionise
    agriculture and strengthen the foundations of sustainable agriculture worldwide
    (Seyyedabbasi et al. 2023). The potential for innovation and beneficial influence
    on the agricultural business is limitless as these technologies continue to advance.
    The potential impact of 5G and edge computing on AIoT applications in agriculture
    and future trends and breakthroughs in AIoT are discussed. 8.1 Future Trends and
    Innovations in AIoT Increasing connectivity among AIoT devices will provide simple
    two-way communication and data sharing. Because of this enhanced connectedness,
    data analysis and decision-making will become more holistic and integrated. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms will be included into AIoT
    devices, allowing them to analyse and anticipate trends and patterns in real-time
    data (Garg and Goyal 2020). As a result of this capacity, procedures and resource
    allocation may be optimised for greater efficacy. With edge computing, processing
    may be done closer to the data source, which speeds up processing and decreases
    latency. Edge intelligence-equipped AIoT devices will be able to do sophisticated
    tasks locally, cutting down on demand for cloud computing. The AIoT, AI, and ML
    will merge to generate fully autonomous systems. As a result, production will
    rise, human errors will decrease, and efficiency will improve. AIoT will revolutionize
    urban planning and infrastructure management, leading to the construction of smart
    cities with linked transportation, electricity, waste management, and more systems
    (Mousavi et al. 2021). 8.2 Integration of AIoT, AI, and Machine Learning AI and
    ML algorithms will analyze massive volumes of data the AIoT creates. This will
    allow for enhanced knowledge of agricultural procedures and more efficient use
    of available resources (Olan et al. 2022). Precision agriculture will become a
    reality in which farmers administer inputs like water and fertiliser with pinpoint
    accuracy using real-time data and analysis made possible by AI-driven AIoT apps.
    By taking this course of action, both yields and environmental impact may be improved.
    With AI, devices can anticipate when agricultural machinery and equipment need
    repair (Olan et al. 2022; Pan and Zhang 2021). 8.3 The Possible Effect of 5G and
    Edge Computing on Applications in Farming With the increased bandwidth and decreased
    latency that 5G networks provide, the AIoT can communicate with one another in
    near real-time. With the help of 5G and edge computing, farmers can keep an eye
    on their crops and animals without leaving their homes (Rathod et al. 2023). Data-intensive
    AIoT applications, such as high-resolution image and video analytics, will be
    supported by 5G’s fast data rates and the processing capabilities of edge computing,
    enhancing agricultural monitoring and analysis. AIoT-enabled irrigation systems
    with 5G connection and edge computing can optimize water consumption and save
    waste by adjusting the amount of water supplied depending on real-time data, soil
    moisture levels, and weather predictions (Varsha et al. 2021). 9 Conclusion This
    chapter examines the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices via data-driven
    decision-making and precision agriculture on the path to sustainable agriculture
    and food security. Agricultural output, resource effectiveness, and supply chain
    management benefit greatly from AIoT-enabled systems. AIoT improves agricultural
    operations by helping farmers and stakeholders make better choices based on real-time
    data and analytics. Due to the AIoT, farmers can track and manage their crops
    with pinpoint accuracy, improving efficiency, lessening environmental damage,
    and boosting agricultural yields. By allowing farmers to adjust water distribution
    in response to current weather and crop circumstances, smart irrigation systems
    improve water efficiency while decreasing water waste. Better illness diagnosis,
    health assessment, and livestock management contribute to happier, healthier animals.
    A well-oiled supply chain guarantees that food is safe to eat, cuts down on post-harvest
    losses, and speeds up the delivery of crops to consumers. AIoT plays a crucial
    role in developing sustainable agriculture and attaining global food security
    by using real-time data and analytics and closing the information gap between
    farmers, agribusinesses, and consumers. With the ongoing development of AIoT,
    AI, and 5G technologies, the future of AIoT in agriculture seems bright. Data
    security, privacy issues, high implementation costs, and accessibility for small-scale
    farmers in underdeveloped countries are only some of the obstacles that must be
    overcome. Understanding AIoT''s societal and economic effects on agriculture requires
    a study conducted by agronomists, environmentalists, and social scientists. Investing
    in AIoT-related research and development may lead to a future where agriculture
    is more sustainable, productive, and ecologically aware. References Abdullahi

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In Recent decades, modern agriculture
    has grappled with the need to balance the growing demand for high-quality food
    with the preservation of the environment and natural resources. A crucial step
    in this direction is represented by the adoption of new digital technologies,
    which serve as essential tools for addressing the challenges posed by this complex
    intersection of needs [1], [2]. The emergence of sensors and smart equipment has
    particularly revolutionized the agricultural sector, opening up new prospects
    for enhancing the sustainability of production processes and mitigating environmental
    impacts [3]. In this context, precision agriculture (PA) emerges as a fundamental
    pillar, offering innovative solutions to enhance agricultural production [4],
    [5], [6], [7]. PA aims to address the variability within cultivated fields with
    the goal of standardizing yields and maximizing overall efficiency [8]. This approach
    represents a synergistic integration of computer science and agronomic management,
    paving the way toward quality and sustainable production. The goal of PA is to
    become a decision-support tool for comprehensive and sustainable farm management
    [9]. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical PA scenario. Fig. 1. PA ecosystem. Show All
    Within the realm of PA, precision viticulture (PV) is a specific application area
    in vineyards [10], [11]. Viticulture holds a significant position within both
    the agricultural and food industries due to its considerable economic impact.
    It stands out as one of the most extensively cultivated crops, spanning approximately
    7.3 million hectares. This vast area is dedicated to cultivating various grape
    varieties, encompassing those specifically for wine production, table consumption,
    and raisin production. Addressing these challenges requires a profound recognition
    of the dynamic nature inherent in agricultural systems. This dynamism stems from
    substantial temporal and spatial variations in responses to various production
    factors. Consequently, implementing site-specific management strategies becomes
    essential. The progression of PV is intricately linked to technological advancements
    that have enabled tailored management practices for specific sites. Significant
    strides have been made in developing user-friendly software capable of handling
    spatial and geographic data. Furthermore, there has been a proliferation of remote
    sensing platforms boasting high spatial and temporal resolutions. The emergence
    of proximal sensors has further facilitated focused and continuous monitoring
    of crops within specific areas [12]. The objectives of PV encompass achieving
    finer control over crop yields, minimizing the occurrence and spread of grapevine
    diseases, and elevating the overall quality of produce. PV involves a cycle of
    activities that begins with the collection of accurate data related to vine cultivation,
    proceeds to the interpretation of such data, and culminates in the application
    of targeted agronomic techniques. Incorporating wireless sensor networks and remote
    sensing technologies constitutes a crucial aspect of PA, leveraging the potential
    of data acquisition, analysis, global positioning systems, and the Internet of
    Things (IoT) for optimized solutions [13], [14], [15]. These methods enable remote
    monitoring of production processes, providing a wide range of real-time information
    about the surrounding environment. The variety of available sensors is remarkable,
    ranging from measuring basic parameters, such as temperature and humidity, to
    more sophisticated elements, such as images, acoustic data, and microradars, among
    others. Variables, such as temperature, atmospheric humidity, and soil conditions,
    are aspects that PV particularly focuses on. This approach plays a central role
    in frost prevention thanks to continuous climate monitoring that allows for the
    anticipation of potential critical situations. At the same time, soil moisture
    analysis is fundamental to optimizing irrigation systems, enabling the delivery
    of the right amount of water in the most targeted manner possible. Another significant
    challenge is the prevention of grapevine diseases, where climatic factors exert
    a significant influence on the development of plant pathologies. As a result,
    anticipating the conditions of the vineyard and constant monitoring of every part
    of it are concrete tools to prevent the onset of pest infestations, or at least
    to intervene in the early stages [16]. In the abovementioned context, a significant
    point concerns the application of artificial intelligence (AI) [17], [18], [19].
    The ability demonstrated by machine learning (ML) to solve a wide range of challenges,
    regardless of the context, has highlighted it as one of the most significant and
    promising research fields. When the problem can be adequately formulated as input,
    ML algorithms exhibit surprising flexibility in recognizing underlying rules and
    hidden connections among the provided information. This range of applications
    spans from categorizing data into specific classes (classification) to predicting
    numerical values (regression). Recently, even in the viticulture sector, the use
    of ML methodologies to address various challenges has been observed [20], [21],
    [22]. In many parts of the world, traditional farmers have historically relied
    on the experience and wisdom of industry professionals to make operational decisions.
    However, this method exposed them to the uncertainty of weather conditions, which
    have become increasingly unstable due to climate changes and variations in precipitation.
    Manual and indiscriminate pesticide use, for example, led to resource waste and
    environmental damage. The introduction of AI and IoT in agriculture has ushered
    in a new paradigm, eliminating the random factor. This new era provides farmers
    with tools to optimize every phase of the process, surpassing the randomness of
    a tradition-based approach. This lays the groundwork for more informed and targeted
    decisions. Based on these premises, this study explores the use of a series of
    regression models capable of learning from historical data collected from weather
    stations. These datasets include various parameters, such as air temperature,
    relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and solar radiation. Information
    from time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probes, such as soil temperature and moisture,
    is also considered. The main goal is to generate valuable information and data
    to equip agronomists with predictive tools aimed at enhancing land yield and product
    quality. Therefore, the main contributions can be summarized as follows. Mitigating
    potential frost damage by accurately predicting the minimum temperatures for the
    following day. Optimizing irrigation scheduling through soil moisture forecasts,
    ensuring the efficient utilization of water resources for the highest crop yield.
    Proactive grape disease management by developing a classification model that forecasts
    the onset of key factors contributing to the spread of major pathogens, including
    downy mildew and powdery mildew. This prediction considers current weather conditions.
    The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II provides a comprehensive
    review of the related literature, and Section III outlines the test vineyard area
    along with a comprehensive overview of the available data. Section IV details
    the experimental protocol employed for each forecasting module. Section V presents
    and analyzes the results obtained. Section VI critically examines the current
    limitations of this study, providing a foundation for future research directions.
    Finally, Section VII concludes this article. SECTION II. Literature Review This
    section provides an overview of the technologies and concepts relevant to frost
    prediction and protection systems. The concepts of soil moisture forecasting for
    smart irrigation (SI), along with an examination of current algorithms for predicting
    diseases in vineyards, are also discussed. A. Frost Prediction The crop damage
    caused by frost constitutes a significant economic challenge for farmers globally.
    In the viticulture industry, frosts introduce a significant threat, capable of
    causing extensive damage to wine production across expansive regions or entire
    territories in a single occurrence. Such damage can have adverse and long-lasting
    effects on plant growth and yields for multiple growing seasons. The severity
    of the damage is contingent upon the lowest temperature recorded and the duration
    of exposure to critical temperature thresholds. During winter, dormant plant buds
    can withstand temperatures as low as −10 ∘ C (down to −20 ∘ C), but in spring,
    they can sustain damage even at temperatures slightly below 0 ∘ C. Numerous studies
    have drawn attention to the role of climate change in altering the growth patterns
    of various plant species. For example, grapevines are exhibiting a propensity
    toward earlier spring budbreak due to milder winter temperatures. Common strategies
    to address frost-related issues include the use of wind turbines, fuel combustion,
    and heating enclosed environments, such as greenhouses. However, these methods
    come with a significant cost in terms of installation and management, potentially
    eroding the grower''s profits. In addition, to avoid unnecessary expenses, it
    is essential for farmers to accurately recognize when a frost episode poses an
    actual threat. In this context, access to precise meteorological data and frost
    risk forecasts assumes an invaluable role [23]. Predicting the next day''s minimum
    temperature based on key indicators, such as solar radiation, dew point, wind,
    rainfall, and humidity, could help mitigate frost damage [24]. However, it should
    be emphasized that climate prediction is a complex process due to its numerous
    dynamic and chaotic variables. Addressing this complexity requires the use of
    advanced computer models, field observations, and an understanding of meteorological
    patterns-aspects that have garnered the attention of researchers from a wide range
    of scientific disciplines [25], [26]. Most research regarding frost prediction
    relies on simulating partial differential equations or conventional statistical
    models to anticipate weather conditions. These methods are computationally intensive
    and necessitate constant theoretical refinement to incorporate meteorological
    and atmospheric assumptions. The use of ML models is now widely adopted for detecting
    frost episodes, as well as being applied in various other meteorological fields
    [27]. Employing ML techniques trained on specific data from a given area has enabled
    the creation of tailored models for local situations. In contexts, where factors,
    such as terrain complexity or other elements, could compromise the accuracy of
    existing meteorological models, these approaches prove particularly valuable.
    Previous studies have achieved encouraging results in complex scenarios, and further
    research has highlighted how integrating data from nearby weather stations can
    further improve the models'' predictive capabilities. However, adopting such algorithms
    poses some challenges. For instance, variable local frost-related conditions make
    it difficult to obtain detailed information from weather stations. Furthermore,
    to obtain effective results, data must be collected over an extended period of
    time (greater than 7 years). In addition, the paucity of specific data on frost
    events makes modeling a challenging task. All these considerations have led to
    preferring the use of temperature regression-based models rather than those based
    on frost classification (frost/no frost) [28]. B. Soil Moisture Prediction Soil
    moisture content plays a fundamental role in regulating water balances and ecological
    processes in various ecosystems [29]. These processes encompass phenomena, such
    as evaporation, transpiration, biological diversity, and rainfall runoff. Within
    the viticulture industry, soil moisture levels hold crucial importance in preventing
    water stress situations for crops and in monitoring drought conditions [16]. Insufficient
    moisture can impede plant growth, reduce production, intensify sugar content,
    and lead to an acidity deficiency in wines. Conversely, excessive moisture adversely
    affects grape growth, yield, and quality, heightening susceptibility to winter
    damage and diseases. Therefore, prudent irrigation management is essential for
    achieving high-quality grapes, underscoring the significance of continuous soil
    moisture monitoring and understanding the spatial and temporal patterns that underlie
    predictions. In the past, onsite detection technologies were both expensive and
    unreliable. Consequently, this prompted the adoption of indirect methods, which
    estimated water consumption by considering plant evaporation and transpiration,
    with precipitation as the primary water source. However, with the emergence of
    the IoT, the era of SI began, allowing for more precise direct measurements and
    automated monitoring. SI systems utilize wireless sensor networks to precisely
    control irrigation operations. This emerging field employs data-intensive methodologies
    to enhance agricultural productivity while simultaneously mitigating environmental
    impacts. Leveraging a variety of sensors, contemporary agricultural practices
    collect large amounts of data, providing meaningful information in operational
    contexts. As a result, this promotes more accurate and precise decision-making.
    Through the application of SI strategies in response to real-time soil and weather
    conditions, farmers can efficiently meet their water needs while preserving water
    consumption for the irrigation process [30]. SI has demonstrated its capacity
    to enhance water utilization, decrease energy consumption, and increase crop yield
    [31], [32]. These advancements have revolutionized the process of soil moisture
    monitoring and prediction, offering a viable alternative to indirect methods reliant
    on water balance. Moreover, given the various data sources available, the application
    of ML has emerged as a promising approach for soil moisture prediction [33], [34],
    [35], [36]. Over the years, various studies have compared conventional methodologies
    with ML techniques, including linear regression (LR), support vector machines
    (SVM), random forests (RF), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Despite
    the variances in applications across different investigations, accounting for
    factors, such as input data, locations, and specific crop types, the results presented
    in Section V align cohesively with the existing literature. C. Grapevine Diseases
    Prediction Downy mildew and powdery mildew represent the main microbial diseases
    that devastatingly affect grapevines (see Fig. 2). Plasmopara viticola is the
    pathogenic agent responsible for downy mildew in grapevines. This microorganism,
    native to the United States, causes a reduction in the photosynthetic efficiency
    of the affected green tissues, contributing to early leaf drop. At the same time,
    Uncinula necator, responsible for powdery mildew, also originates from North America
    and affects green tissues, including the berries, causing significant losses in
    yield and a decrease in the wine quality [37]. In Italy, the effects of downy
    mildew are becoming increasingly severe. Due to heavy spring rains that are affecting
    several Italian regions, the Italian Wine Union Observatory has anticipated losses
    in some areas of up to 40% in the upcoming imminent grape harvest season. According
    to [38], these infections can destroy 40% –90% of plants in the field at optimal
    humidity and temperature. Fig. 2. Example of powdery mildew (left-hand side) and
    downy mildew (right-hand side) infection. Show All Downy mildew and powdery mildew
    can manifest severe symptoms in grapevines in the early stages of infection, prompting
    farmers to resort to fungicide treatments. However, concerns regarding the negative
    impacts of chemicals on the environment and human health have led to the implementation
    of restrictions to regulate the use of such fungicides. Weather conditions emerge
    as one of the main threats capable of triggering diseases in crops [39]. Adverse
    climatic conditions, such as frequent precipitation and high humidity levels,
    increase the risk of fungal disease development. In Table I, a summary of the
    main factors favoring the growth and spread of P. viticola and U. necator diseases
    in grapevines is provided, with particular attention to climatic conditions and
    the time interval necessary for the onset of infection. Therefore, continuous
    monitoring of weather conditions is of fundamental importance in detecting indicative
    signs of potential infections. In response to these challenges, various models,
    both empirical and based on climatic parameters, have been developed to predict
    grapevine diseases and assist farmers in making decisions regarding crop protection
    [40]. TABLE I Overview of the Key Elements That Favor the Proliferation and Dispersion
    of P. Viticola and U. Necator Diseases in Grapevines, Along With the Timing of
    Infection [37] Expanding computing capacity is revolutionizing data collection
    and processing. By employing ML techniques, it becomes possible to investigate
    a wide range of factors, integrating different real-time data sources to evaluate
    interactions among the pathogen, host plant, and climatic variables, often before
    any visible signs of disease emerge [41], [42], [43], [44]. This in-depth analysis
    aims to guarantee the efficient and sustainable management of fungicidal treatments.
    Nevertheless, the efficacy of statistical models and ML algorithms in forecasting
    the onset of grapevine diseases has received limited attention in the current
    literature. SECTION III. Materials and Methods A. Data Acquisition and Overview
    The test vineyard is located within the Taurasi DOCG area, in the province of
    Avellino (Campania, Italy), specifically in the municipality of Montemiletto,
    at the Donna Elvira Estate (Latitude: 41.0118, Longitude: 14.9323, Elevation:
    328 m). The dataset employed in this research is categorized into two primary
    categories: meteorological data and soil moisture data. Data were collected over
    a span of approximately 2 years, from 2021 to 2023, with a frequency of 5 min.
    The professional Davis Vantage Pro2 Plus wired weather station is responsible
    for the collection of meteorological data, including key parameters, such as air
    temperature, air humidity, dew point, wind speed and direction, precipitation,
    and solar radiation. Three TDR probes (Acclima TDR-315H model) have been positioned
    at varying depths of 30, 60, and 90 cm, enabling precise data acquisition (soil
    temperature and moisture) at multiple levels. WeatherLink serves as the specialized
    software for managing data from Davis weather stations. One of WeatherLink''s
    notable features is its capacity to present meteorological variables in standardized
    formats, facilitating data interpretation and thereby simplifying the comparison
    and analysis of information. B. Data Processing During the preprocessing phase,
    the data were grouped into daily 24-h intervals. Subsequently, it was necessary
    to perform certain statistical operations, including calculating the mean, maximum,
    and/or minimum of the climatic variables, along with determining the total daily
    precipitation by summing the daily values. The soil moisture content was also
    adjusted to its daily average. In terms of data cleaning, NaN values were introduced
    to replace missing values, and outliers were removed. Additional details can be
    found in the following sections. 1) Frost Forecast Due to the significant variability
    in minimum hourly temperature and the common practice of developing frost mitigation
    strategies in viticulture on a daily scale, a rolling 24-h window was introduced
    to forecast the minimum temperature for the next day. The meteorological variables
    included are temperature ( ∘ C), humidity (%), dew point ( ∘ C), solar radiation
    (W/m 2 ), wind speed (km/h), wind run (km), and precipitation (mm). Table II provides
    the complete list of parameters. The input data for each of the ML models are
    structured into an array featuring eight distinct columns. The first column indicates
    the daily mean temperature (TAVG), followed by parameters, such as solar radiation
    at 14:00 h (RAD14), dew point and humidity at 23:00 h (DP23 and H23, respectively),
    daily averages of wind speed and wind run (WSAVG and WRAVG), along with the accumulated
    daily precipitation (RSUM). Finally, the last column contains the minimum air
    temperature for the next day (TMIN). The rows of each array correspond to the
    daily temporal evolution from 2021 to 2023. TABLE II Variables Used as Input Features
    in ML Models for Frost Prediction 2) Soil Moisture Forecast For effective predictive
    irrigation scheduling, a one-day-ahead (D + 1) forecast of soil moisture is essential
    [29]. In this context, the involved variables encompass the daily mean temperature
    (TAVG), accumulated daily precipitation (RSUM), daily average humidity (HAVG),
    the daily average of each sensor in relation to soil temperature and soil moisture
    (STAVG and SMAVG, respectively), and finally, the overall daily average for soil
    moisture of the next day. The parameters'' details are presented in Table III.
    TABLE III Variables Used as Input Features in ML Models for Soil Moisture Prediction
    3) Grapevine Diseases Forecast Grapevine disease prediction plays a crucial role
    in promoting sustainable vineyard cultivation and the production of high-quality
    grapes. In the proposed model, data collected from sensors serve as input for
    ML algorithms, while the presence (or absence) of conditions that favor grapevine
    diseases acts as the target variable. Consequently, in the preprocessing phase
    of the time series, it was necessary to label the database. This process led to
    the creation of three columns, each with 24-h sliding windows, including meteorological
    factors contributing to the development of grape diseases, namely, precipitation,
    temperature, humidity, and wind speed. In accordance with the conditions outlined
    in Table I, two additional columns are introduced: “DownyMildew” and “PowderyMildew,”
    respectively. The assigned value in these columns is 1 when the initial infection
    conditions are met; otherwise, it is 0. Variables involved include the highest
    daily temperature (TMAX), maximum solar radiation (RADMAX), highest wind speed
    (WSMAX), maximum humidity (HMAX), and cumulative daily precipitation (RSUM). For
    further details, refer to Table IV. TABLE IV Variables Used as Input Features
    in ML Models for Grapevine Disease Prediction During database labeling, it is
    important to analyze the imbalance between the two classes. This imbalance can
    significantly impede model accuracy, increasing the chances of misclassifying
    an instance as part of the majority class. To mitigate this issue, utilizing data
    oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE [45], is fundamental, as it balances class
    distributions by oversampling minority-class data. This approach results in a
    significant enhancement of ML models performance, allowing them to adeptly handle
    the minority class with precision and dependability. SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup The experiments were conducted utilizing the free version of the PyCharm
    integrated development environment software on a MacBook Pro 2.6 GHz Intel Core
    i7 6 Core, 16 GB, 2667 MHz DDR4 Intel UHD Graphics 630, 1536 MB, with Python 3.7.6.
    The algorithms employed for model training were sourced from the scikit-learn
    repository, a Python module equipped with useful functions for ML. During the
    experimental phase, several well-known ML algorithms were applied to address regression
    and classification tasks. For regression, the algorithms included LR, RF regressor,
    XGBoost (XGB), support vector regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP)
    regressor. In the domain of binary classification, the models considered were
    RF, SVM, and XGB. To enhance performance, the grid-search tuning technique was
    employed to identify the most effective hyperparameters for the considered models.
    For each database, a random dataset split was performed, allocating 80% for training
    and reserving the remaining 20% for constructing the test set. A. Evaluation Metrics
    To assess the performance of regression models, four performance measures are
    utilized, including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE),
    mean squared deviation (MSE), and the coefficient of determination (R-squared,
    R 2 ), according to the following equations: MAE= MSE= RMSE= R 2 = 1 n ∑ i=1 n
    | y i − y ^ i | 1 n ∑ i=1 n ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 1 n ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 −
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 1− ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ¯ )
    2 . (1) (2) (3) (4) View Source In the given formulas, y ^ i denotes the forecasted
    value, y i stands for the actual value, and y ¯ represents the mean of the observed
    value. The MAE evaluates the average of absolute prediction discrepancies, where
    lower values indicate superior model performance. The MSE measures the mean squared
    errors. Its square root, known as the RMSE, is particularly sensitive to outliers.
    A lower RMSE implies higher model accuracy. R 2 quantifies the proportion of total
    data variability attributable to the model. Values close to 1 suggest that the
    model adeptly accounts for observed data variations. When dealing with classification
    tasks, the results are classified into four distinct groups: true positives (TP),
    true negatives (TN), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP). Accordingly,
    each algorithm''s performance was evaluated using different metrics, specifically
    accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are defined mathematically
    as Accuracy Precision Recall F1-score = TP+TN TP+TN+FP+FN = TP TP+FP = TP TP+FN
    = 2⋅Precision⋅Recall Precision+Recall . (5) (6) (7) (8) View Source Accuracy quantifies
    the percentage of correct predictions among the entire prediction set. Precision
    evaluates the percentage of correctly predicted positive outcomes relative to
    all predicted positives. Recall computes the percentage of correctly predicted
    positive outcomes in comparison to the total instances within that class. The
    F1-score considers both precision and recall, enabling an analysis of FP and FN
    values. SECTION V. Results and Discussion A. Results for Regression Problem Frost:
    Table V provides the one-day-ahead forecast results for the minimum temperature.
    It can be observed that for all configurations, both MAE and RMSE are lower, at
    1.28 ∘ C and 1.72 ∘ C, respectively. These values are clearly inconsequential
    when compared with the current thermal variability. Specifically, during the test
    phase, the LR and RF regression models yielded the most promising outcomes. The
    R 2 values indicate strong correlations between the models and observations (0.91–0.93),
    underscoring the effectiveness of the algorithms employed in capturing the variability
    of the minimum temperature. Importantly, the LR model excels in performance relative
    to more intricate algorithms, offering a distinct advantage in terms of model
    interpretability. Fig. 3 illustrates the prediction error plot, allowing for a
    visual comparison between the model''s projected outcomes and the actual results;
    the closer the data points align with the regression line, the more accurate the
    model proves to be. Finally, Fig. 4 shows the LR model prediction results, while
    Table VI reports some forecasted minimum temperature values compared with the
    actual ones. TABLE V One-Day-Ahead Forecast Minimum Temperature: ML Algorithms
    Results TABLE VI One-Day-Ahead Forecast Minimum Temperature: Comparisons of Actual
    and Predicted Values—LR Fig. 3. One-day-ahead minimum temperature: Prediction
    error plot. Show All Fig. 4. One-day-ahead minimum temperature: Actual versus
    prediction values. Show All Table VII provides the evaluation metrics obtained
    from employing the LR model across different forecast lead-days. The D + 2 prediction
    horizon yielded a temperature forecast with an RMSE of 2.22 ∘ C, whereas the D
    + 3 time horizon produced an RMSE of 2.82 ∘ C. As expected, the model''s performance
    worsened as the prediction lead-time increased. When dealing with longer forecasting
    periods for minimum temperature, encountering a low R 2 value is not unusual.
    This can be attributed to multiple factors, including variability in weather patterns,
    the impact of seasonal shifts, and the potential for unforeseen events. Although
    the model may not explain as much of the variation, it can still provide valuable
    insights for planning and preparation. TABLE VII Minimum Temperature: LR Model
    Prediction at Various Lead-Days The RF regression model assesses feature importance
    to identify the key parameters contributing to the frost forecast model''s accuracy.
    Results reveal that predicting minimum temperatures greatly depends on the dew
    point (0.8), which represents the temperature at which air reaches saturation
    and water vapor condenses. When the minimum temperature aligns closely with or
    matches the dew point, it indicates nearing air saturation, paving the way for
    dew or fog formation. Hence, in weather forecasting, the dew point is pivotal
    for accurate predictions concerning temperature lows. Soil moisture: The soil
    moisture prediction results presented in Table VIII are high across all models,
    with R 2 values surpassing 0.96. By incorporating precipitation, climatic factors,
    as well as current-day soil moisture and soil temperature as inputs, ML models
    can accurately foresee soil moisture average levels for the next day. Although
    MLP and SVR exhibit superior performance, the preference is for LR due to its
    interpretability and ease of explanation. This choice facilitates direct comparisons
    with more complex models and enables an evaluation of the model''s complexity
    in relation to the inherent nature of the regression problem. Fig. 5 demonstrates
    the LR model''s ability to capture soil moisture dynamics, with very few outliers
    in the predictions. The predicted soil moisture values compared with the actual
    target are shown in Fig. 6. Table IX reports some forecast soil moisture values
    and the effective observed measurements. TABLE VIII One-Day-Ahead Forecast Soil
    Moisture: ML Algorithms Results TABLE IX One-Day-Ahead Forecast Soil Moisture:
    Comparisons of Actual and Predicted Values—LR Fig. 5. One-day-ahead soil moisture:
    Prediction error plot. Show All Fig. 6. One-day-ahead soil moisture: Actual versus
    prediction values. Show All The results of the LR model for forecasting at D +
    3 and D + 7 time horizons are also discussed. Predicting soil moisture beyond
    a single day in advance is essential for effectively implementing a precision
    irrigation system. A time frame exceeding one day enables more advanced and strategic
    planning of irrigation activities. In addition, accounting for the inertia of
    hydrological processes within the soil, these projections offer a more precise
    understanding of soil moisture variations over time. As reported in Table X, the
    results exhibit highly satisfactory performance, characterized by an average R
    2 value of approximately 0.93. TABLE X Soil Moisture: LR Model Prediction at Various
    Lead-Days Furthermore, an investigation comparing data utilization from one probe
    (TDR probes 1 and 2) to data from three probes was conducted. Excluding the deeper
    TDR probe 3, which could incur higher replacement costs, did not impact prediction
    accuracy. The R 2 values for TDR probes 1 and 2 are 0.96 and 0.95, respectively.
    While acknowledging the potential benefits of using more probes for better insights,
    the results emphasize that utilizing data from a single probe can yield exceptional
    predictions and potentially reduce maintenance expenses associated with additional
    probes. B. Results for Classification Problem Grapevine diseases: Tables XI and
    XII give the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) obtained
    during the testing phase for each algorithm utilized in the downy and powdery
    mildew grapevine disease prediction. Specifically, the XGB algorithm accurately
    anticipated the initiation of downy and powdery mildew infection cycles (D + 1
    time frame) with an accuracy of 96% and 97%, respectively. Further experiments
    were performed to assess potential infectious initial conditions using various
    prediction time horizons, i.e., D + 3 and D + 5. Tables XIII and XIV provide the
    results achieved using the XGB algorithm. TABLE XI One-Day-Ahead Forecast Downy
    Mildew Favorable Conditions: ML Algorithms Results TABLE XII One-Day-Ahead Forecast
    Powdery Mildew Favorable Conditions: ML Algorithms Results TABLE XIII Downy Mildew:
    XGB Model Prediction at Various Lead-Days TABLE XIV Powdery Mildew: XGB Model
    Prediction at Various Lead-Days SECTION VI. Limitations AI and IoT-driven PA have
    introduced a level of precision that allows modern farmers to optimize every aspect
    of the agricultural process. Among these technologies, wireless sensor networks
    play a vital role in collecting data, including parameters, such as temperature
    and humidity. These variables are essential for predicting soil properties, meteorological
    conditions, crop yields, and diseases. However, traditional ML models encounter
    some challenges in estimating soil parameters and weather data across different
    ecosystems. They may also be influenced by historical trends, which makes forecasting
    extreme weather events more complex. Advances in image processing and the rise
    of AI, particularly in the field of deep learning (DL), have revolutionized the
    analysis of complex scenarios and the automation of specific tasks [46], [47].
    Compared with conventional remote sensing tools, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
    enable near-real-time field monitoring. The development of remote sensing technology
    has also improved the use of multispectral imagery, which has become an effective
    tool for assessing and monitoring crop health, crop stress, and making yield predictions.
    Looking to the future, further advances in remote sensing technology and the application
    of DL algorithms are expected to continue to revolutionize the field of PA [48],
    [49], [50]. This could lead to even more effective management of agricultural
    resources, enabling a more sustainable and efficient food production process.
    SECTION VII. Conclusion As the agricultural landscape undergoes rapid transformation,
    the integration of IoT and ML in PA emerges as a promising avenue for the future
    of smart and sustainable farming. This study exemplifies the potential of merging
    IoT-generated data with ML techniques to revolutionize agricultural practices,
    particularly in vineyards. This wealth of information empowers us to rely on ML-driven
    forecasts for frost damage and soil moisture, surpassing conventional methods
    for weather monitoring and irrigation planning. To mitigate economic losses and
    reduce environmental impacts, this research also incorporates a predictive model
    for the onset of grapevine diseases. This enables accurate and confident forecasts
    of the initial stages of infections, facilitating timely and effective interventions.
    Despite the data being collected over a limited time period, the results are highly
    promising. In the future, we plan to change the time measurements, analyzing hourly
    rather than daily intervals. The goal is to determine whether this leads to advantages,
    especially for crops that will benefit from a continuous irrigation method. Forecast
    models should be extended to also include rainfall. This will ensure that irrigation
    practices are meticulously adjusted to yield even greater water savings, maximizing
    the efficient utilization of anticipated rainfall volumes. The proposed approach
    has the potential to be seamlessly integrated into an IoT sensor network or a
    localized alarm system. In addition, we intend to incorporate UAVs for near-real-time
    field monitoring, alongside advanced DL algorithms, to further improve efficiency
    and diversify data sources. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    Preview 1. Introduction It’s very difficult for you to check out any sector of
    the economy without noticing the use of drones. Drones are employed in the agricultural
    industry for a wide range of duties, including spraying fertilizer, aerial surveillance,
    crop monitoring, land inspection, mapping, looking for damaged or rotting crops,
    and many others. The potential of different drone types in farming, agriculture,
    and gardening is being investigated. Drones like quad copters are the greatest
    option for crop fertilization because of their multi-rotor design. The massive
    construction of fixed-wing drones, which requires a large landing area, makes
    them impractical for agricultural fertilization. Some reports revealed that they
    expect the drone industry in the agricultural sector to grow from USD1.2 billion
    in 2019 to a whopping USD4.8 billion in 2024. All data obtained by the drones
    in farmlands is mostly used to make better agronomic decisions, which makes it
    part of the “precision agriculture” sector. Large-scale precision farming operations
    have become increasingly dependent on the usage of drones in a number of regions.
    Farmers may plan planting and treatment strategies to produce the best harvest
    possible using the information obtained from the drones'' recordings. According
    to some reports, using precision farming technologies has the potential to boost
    yields by up to 5%, which is a substantial increase in a market with narrow profit
    margins. One of the most popular uses of drones in agriculture is their swift
    movement to their desired locations. Drones with this skill can apply fertilizer
    and insecticides to crops to hydrate and provide them with the nutrients they
    need. Such additives can help crops thrive and stay healthy. To prevent worms,
    pests, and insects and prolong crop life, drone commanders have complete control
    over the drone spraying nutrients. Powerful drone capabilities help with the time-consuming
    procedure of evaluating the soil''s health. The character and health of the soil
    may be monitored, modified, and maintained using UAVs, which collect and analyze
    data from monitoring systems. The soil can benefit from drone technology by receiving
    the nutrients it needs to become healthier. Through data processing and 3D mapping,
    drones carry out the role of monitoring the condition of the soil. Agriculture
    is by definition a labor-intensive and time-consuming sector because it requires
    a high level of skill to do its tasks. Particularly seeding requires human labor
    because it is a lengthy procedure. To make this strenuous operation easier, drone
    technology is employed to sow the seeds of several crop species. They can quickly
    and efficiently plant seeds thanks to the drones'' built-in lasers, sensors, tanks,
    and other functions. Drones'' great ability to evaluate, diagnose, and survey
    crops for any deficiencies is another fantastic benefit of employing them to fertilize
    crops. Their laser-equipped sensors and high-resolution cameras help with the
    quick completion of a variety of activities. These defects are also mapped in
    real-time by unmanned aerial vehicles, and crop management decisions can be made
    using the data that is gathered and processed. In general, the time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization has been made easier thanks to drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their entrepreneurism and
    strong personalities for a variety of tasks and operations. The time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization in general has been made simpler by drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their strong will and entrepreneurial
    spirit in a wide range of tasks and operations. For one thing, drones are excellent
    for monitoring and sensing methods since they can swiftly cover a region to examine
    crop development and soil health. The majority of drones are utilized for this
    because their sensors can identify the absorbance of a particular wavelength,
    producing a color contrast image that clearly depicts potentially problematic
    areas. Ranchers have used drones to track cattle on ranches and inspect fences
    for damage, proving that this monitoring capability does more than just enable
    quick processing of spatiotemporal data. To further monitor livestock, rangers
    have also used night cameras and thermal imagers to find any animals disrupting
    or attacking herds. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Abdullahi, H.

    Location: Chennai, India SECTION I. Introduction In the realm of agriculture,
    where innovation meets necessity, the fusion of traditional farming practices
    with cutting-edge technology has ushered in a new era of sustainable and efficient
    crop cultivation. The pivotal role played by agriculture in sustaining global
    populations necessitates continuous improvements in cultivation methods, crop
    selection, and yield optimization. In this context, the integration of Machine
    Learning (ML) techniques[1]to agriculture has emerged as a transformative force,
    empowering farmers and researchers alike with data-driven insights and predictive
    models. This paper delves into the dynamic intersection of agriculture and artificial
    intelligence, focusing specifically on the paradigm shift brought about by “Crop
    Selection and Cultivation Using Machine Learning.” Agriculture, the cornerstone
    of human civilization, faces unprecedented challenges in the 21st century. Climate
    change, fluctuating market demands, and depleting natural resources demand innovative
    solutions. Machine Learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, stands as a
    beacon of hope in this scenario, offering unparalleled opportunities to optimize
    agricultural processes. By harnessing the power of ML algorithms, farmers can
    make informed decisions regarding crop selection, irrigation, pest control, and
    yield prediction. These algorithms, trained on vast datasets encompassing weather
    patterns, soil quality, historical crop performance, and market trends, enable
    precise predictions and proactive measures. This paper explores the multifaceted
    applications of Machine Learning in agriculture. We delve into the intricacies
    of crop selection, analyzing diverse factors such as soil composition, climate
    conditions, and market demands to recommend the most suitable crops for specific
    regions. Additionally, we examine how ML algorithms [2] facilitate real-time monitoring
    of crops, enabling early detection of diseases and pests. Through predictive analytics,
    farmers can optimize irrigation schedules, thereby conserving water resources.
    Moreover, we explore the economic implications, discussing how ML-driven agricultural
    practices [3] can enhance yield, reduce wastage, and bolster farmers'' incomes.
    The significance of our research extends beyond theoretical exploration; it has
    tangible implications for sustainable agriculture. By amalgamating traditional
    wisdom with modern technology, we pave the way for a future where agriculture
    is not only productive but also environmentally conscious and economically viable[4].
    As we unravel the nuances of “Crop Selection and Cultivation Using Machine Learning,”
    we embark on a journey toward a greener, more prosperous planet. SECTION II. Related

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belagavi, India SECTION I. Introduction Contemporary
    farming practices exhibit increased efficiency in agricultural development compared
    to earlier periods. The early indications of significant transformations in daily
    life and agricultural supply chains are becoming evident, particularly in the
    networks for food, fiber, and bio-energy distribution. This article delves into
    the current state of industrial agriculture, drawing insights from patterns at
    the farm level, production techniques, and agri-food supply within the industrialized
    context. To realize Agriculture 4.0, we explore the integration of artificial
    intelligence, big data, and blockchain. Our proposed approach facilitates the
    continuous monitoring and management of agricultural operations via remote observation,
    underpinned by IoT, AI, and related technologies. The article hones in on key
    research challenges and applications of these emerging technologies in the agriculture
    sector, aimed at introducing novel research opportunities to industry professionals.
    Anticipating the development of foundational IoT and technological tools for agricultural
    production, we envision a future characterized by interconnected, dependable,
    and productive agriculture [1]. Traditionally, predicting crop yields was a task
    undertaken by farmers who relied on their personal experience and knowledge of
    the specific field and crop cultivation and disease identification [17], [18].
    Nevertheless, the challenge of accurately forecasting agricultural crop prices
    persists, necessitating a more data-driven approach. This challenge can be effectively
    addressed through the utilization of statistical data analysis, pattern tracking,
    visualization techniques, and other data mining methods facilitated by computer
    applications. This study presents a comprehensive model for forecasting crop prices
    by leveraging the past decade''s worth of data on agricultural field crop prices
    and incorporating detailed weather information, including rainfall data. The objective
    of this research paper is to develop a robust framework for predicting future
    crop prices that takes into account various interdependent factors. By harnessing
    a decade''s worth of historical data on agricultural field crop prices and coupling
    it with pertinent weather data, a structured approach to classifying crop prices
    emerges. In summary, this research endeavor aims to provide an innovative solution
    to the complex challenge of forecasting crop prices. Through a meticulous analysis
    of historical agricultural field crop prices and the incorporation of relevant
    weather data, this model endeavors to empower farmers with valuable insights into
    future crop pricing trends [2]. Fig. 1 Rapid growth of agriculture. Show All Agriculture
    involves the application of modern data analysis techniques to enhance decision-making
    and crop management practices. This approach leverages various advanced technologies,
    including automated steering systems, Geomapping, remote sensing, satellite positioning
    systems, and variable rate technology. The overarching goal of precision agriculture
    is to incorporate automation into the agricultural domain. However, it remains
    crucial for farmers to acquaint themselves with these technological advancements.
    Overcoming these obstacles can lead to streamlined agricultural processes and
    improved outcomes. The rapid advancement of computational methods has opened doors
    to the integration of data mining principles in agriculture. This research paper
    seeks to shed light on both the merits and demerits of precision agriculture,
    thereby offering insights to guide its effective implementation. By addressing
    the challenges and benefits, this study aims to facilitate the progress of agricultural
    practices in the right direction [3]. Agriculture''s significance as a crucial
    foundation in China is unwavering, and the constant progress in science and technology
    has consistently been accessible to all. Enhancing the scientific precision and
    convenience of farming for a broader community through intelligent technology,
    while concurrently tackling challenges and predicaments in agricultural practices,
    remains an enduring concern deserving thoughtful consideration and practical action.
    This study''s objective is to establish an innovative paradigm within the agricultural
    landscape. By harnessing the structural framework of this emerging agricultural
    knowledge base, the aim is to establish a standardized and systematic repository
    of knowledge. This encompassing repository includes an extraction corpus for agricultural
    planting data, intended to be a vital resource during data mining and model creation.
    The ultimate aspiration is to offer an effective and specialized solution in the
    form of an extensive big data corpus for crop planting. This resource is poised
    to serve as a proficient catalyst for applications involving agricultural knowledge
    graphs [4]. In agricultural fields, predominantly situated in desert areas, face
    significant climatic impacts on both crops and workers. These expansive fields
    often lie far from residential zones, posing challenges for effective monitoring
    and management. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative smart
    irrigation system employing Zigbee technology for wireless monitoring and control.
    The system takes into account crucial parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    moisture, and gas concentration. Real-time assessment of farm conditions occurs,
    prompting automated adjustments to irrigation and cooling systems. The acquired
    data is communicated wirelessly to farmers. A unique aspect of this research involves
    modeling the system as an Agent-based framework, portraying the dynamic state
    of the agricultural field. Practical implementation and testing took place on
    a small-scale farm, effectively tracking farm status, depicting system behavior,
    and promptly responding to abnormal data. Notably, the results indicate that the
    system''s implementation enhances crop quality, leading to increased production
    levels [5]. Fig. 2 presents the existing agricultural technologies and the models.
    Fig. 2 Agricultural technologies and models. Show All The Indian agricultural
    sector has symbolized rural development movements such as the green, yellow, white,
    and blue revolutions. Serving as the driving force of the economy, a significant
    portion of the population is directly or indirectly engaged in farming. The overarching
    objective is to enhance both crop quality and quantity while optimizing labor
    input. The emergence of smart farming and the integration of the Internet of Things
    into agriculture are propelling a potential Third Green Revolution. Given the
    current circumstances, the adoption of smart agriculture has become an imperative.
    This research was conducted in the delta districts of Tamil Nadu, aiming to assess
    farmers'' characteristics and their knowledge regarding the adoption of smart
    agricultural practices. Furthermore, the study delved into identifying the significant
    challenges that farmers encounter when adopting smart agricultural techniques.
    Ultimately, the insights from this study can serve as valuable guidance for policymakers
    in comprehending farmers'' perceptions toward embracing smart agriculture. Enhancing
    the well-being of farmers not only benefits them individually but also contributes
    to the overall growth of the country [6]. SECTION II. Related Work With the continuous
    advancement of the Internet of Things, the realm of smart agriculture is undergoing
    a rapid evolution. Leveraging IoT-based solutions presents farmers with the opportunity
    to augment profits and decrease manual labor demands on their agricultural fields.
    Intelligent agricultural systems harness efficient, cost-effective sensors strategically
    positioned around crops and within fields, gathering real-time data on crop status
    and environmental factors. This data serves dual purposes: immediate decision-making
    and long-term planning for improved outcomes. However, there exist hurdles such
    as communication delays, bandwidth usage, sporadic internet connectivity in rural
    locales, and cost implications that warrant attention. This article delves into
    our ongoing endeavors concerning a three-tier smart agriculture system founded
    on LoRa technology: (i) Sensing, (ii) Fog, and (iii) Cloud layers. Our primary
    focus lies in harnessing LoRa''s characteristics of low-power consumption and
    extended range to convert traditional rural Indian farmlands into hubs of intelligent
    agriculture. This initiative holds the potential to revolutionize agriculture
    in rural settings, aligning with the broader global trend driven smart agriculture
    while being tailored to address the specific challenges faced by Indian farmers.
    [7]. This study takes a focused approach towards leveraging technology to forecast
    fertilizer requirements, thereby amplifying crop yields and financial gains. The
    task of fertilizer prediction, a cornerstone of agriculture, involves the intricate
    determination of the most suitable type and optimal amount of fertilizers for
    specific crops. Despite its pivotal role, this task presents formidable challenges,
    directly impacting both crop yields and the overarching goal of environmental
    sustainability. To transcend these challenges, the research harnesses the Random
    Forest machine learning technique, selected for its demonstrated superiority in
    accuracy when compared to methods like linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbours.
    By assimilating historical conditions and insights from farmers through Kaggle
    datasets, this study establishes a predictive framework capable of suggesting
    appropriate fertilizers based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, soil,
    and plant-related factors. As a result, the research contributes significantly
    to the realm of fertilization strategy forecasting, tailored to the unique conditions
    encompassing each agricultural scenario. In the larger context, this undertaking
    exemplifies the marriage of traditional agricultural wisdom with cutting-edge
    technology, promising a future where precision agriculture thrives and yields
    are maximized in harmony with ecological sustainability [8]. This research delves
    into the realm of smart agriculture powered by Internet of Things technologies,
    which have significantly transformed conventional farming methods. The infusion
    of sensors and devices into the agricultural landscape has generated copious amounts
    of data, driving the need for effective data management and transfer due to challenges
    in data volume and storage. The study''s primary objective is to examine and contrast
    diverse data reduction methods aimed at optimizing IoT data transmission within
    smart agriculture. The evaluation of these techniques employs a specialized real-time
    dataset tailored for smart agricultural systems, encompassing five key features:
    ambient air temperature, ambient air moisture, soil temperature, soil moisture,
    and soil pH. The assessment of the techniques is based on three core metrics:
    information loss, computational cost, and energy consumption, while factoring
    in the size of each transmitted sample. The implementation of the three data reduction
    methods is realized using the Python programming language. The findings emphasize
    the existence of a delicate balance between information loss, computational expenditure,
    and energy usage, warranting meticulous consideration when selecting an appropriate
    data reduction technique for IoT nodes in the context of smart agriculture applications.
    This analysis furnishes valuable insights for informed decision-making that effectively
    balances these factors, duly accounting for distinct application prerequisites
    and constraints [9]. Precision agriculture deploys sensors to monitor vital environmental
    factors like temperature, humidity, and water levels. Despite infrequent update
    needs for these attributes, sensors continuously transmit data, causing significant
    redundancy. This inefficiency wastes network resources and unnecessary energy.
    To tackle this, the LEACH routing protocol is introduced as a self-regulating,
    energy-efficient solution. Optimizing data aggregation, it aims to improve network
    efficiency and energy conservation. LEACH organizes sensor nodes into clusters
    with designated cluster heads that collect and summarize data before transmitting
    it to a central base station. This approach drastically reduces redundant data
    transmission, aided by the dynamic selection of cluster heads, which balances
    energy distribution among nodes. Traditional data aggregation methods directly
    transmit raw data to a central base station, causing redundancy and energy drain.
    In contrast, LEACH''s emphasis on aggregating data at its source mitigates network
    congestion and wasteful energy use. The study evaluates LEACH''s effectiveness
    against conventional data aggregation through energy efficiency, network durability,
    and data accuracy metrics. Simulations and empirical analysis provide insights
    into the protocol''s benefits and limitations across diverse scenarios. Overall,
    the LEACH protocol offers a promising solution to the challenge of redundant data
    transmission, contributing to energy-efficient precision agriculture [10]. In
    the contemporary era, the proliferation of IoT devices and emerging technologies
    has led to an exponential surge in data creation. Novel strategies are emerging
    to effectively manage such extensive data volumes. Leveraging this data to make
    informed decisions in agriculture, in tandem with the integration of smart agricultural
    techniques, holds the potential to revolutionize traditional farming practices.
    The efficacy of smart agriculture hinges on the seamless synchronization of diverse
    devices, where pivotal tasks include data retrieval, storage, and analysis. Traditional
    approaches, however, grapple with challenges such as data security, privacy concerns,
    real-time decision-making, and the handling of semi-structured and unstructured
    data when confronted with substantial data generation. In the realm of smart agriculture,
    Probabilistic Data Structures have emerged as a potent and efficient solution
    for managing data and facilitating real-time responses. This study is dedicated
    to thoroughly analyzing the implementation of PDS applications within the domain
    of smart agriculture. Delving into the foundations, challenges, unexplored research
    avenues, and potential trajectories of smart agriculture, this paper aims to comprehensively
    elucidate the role of PDS. It caters to readers and researchers eager to broaden
    their understanding of this domain and seeks to identify uncharted research opportunities
    within this evolving field [11], [12]. With the global population on the rise,
    the demand for increased crop production is becoming more pressing. Despite current
    efforts where farmers cater to global food requirements, challenges like dwindling
    horticultural space, resource depletion, and a growing population underscore the
    necessity to enhance agricultural yields. This has sparked the emergence of smart
    farming, a term encompassing a range of innovations by startups, technology pioneers,
    and governments aimed at bolstering overall crop output. SF involves integrating
    data, communication technologies, hardware, and sensors into agricultural systems
    to yield more insightful information. Detecting plant diseases efficiently using
    advanced algorithms becomes a crucial task in this context. The research paper
    addresses three key dimensions: firstly, an effective approach for disease detection
    and cavity area identification through the Image Segmentation Algorithm; secondly,
    the application of diverse data analysis methods tailored for improved crop management,
    including the use of an optical transducer for detecting Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potash levels in soil, as well as soil moisture content assessment through
    sensors; and thirdly, the utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict
    fertilizer quantities based on soil sample features, thereby aiding farmers in
    accurate amount estimation [13], [19], [20]. Drones, also recognized as unmanned
    aerial vehicles , have predominantly been linked with military and industrial
    functions. Nevertheless, recent strides in sensor and information technology have
    broadened their applications, encompassing sectors like agriculture. With the
    world''s population set to reach 9 billion by 2055, addressing the surge in agricultural
    demand is imperative. While agriculture holds immense promise, it grapples with
    multifaceted challenges—labor scarcity, erratic weather, inadequate fertilization,
    and health risks from chemicals and pests. Leveraging advanced technologies, particularly
    drones, holds the potential to tackle these hurdles. Drones play pivotal roles
    in irrigation, crop supervision, soil analysis, field evaluation, and pest management.
    Their evolution incorporates open-source solutions, advanced sensors, extended
    flight durations, and versatility in tasks spanning crime prevention to disaster
    monitoring. This research seeks to underscore the pivotal role of drones in agriculture
    and assess the finest drones available for crop and field monitoring. The objective
    is to elevate crop quality, forestall field deterioration, and foster sustainable
    agricultural practices. [14] New Agricultural Financial Entities encounter obstacles
    in their advancement due to financial constraints stemming from information disparities
    among financiers, limited collateral choices, and internal limitations. To mitigate
    these challenges, a pioneering strategy is put forth in this study. It harnesses
    the tamper-resistant and decentralized attributes of Blockchain technology in
    combination with the robust capabilities of Big Data for data mining, analysis,
    and processing. This inventive framework seeks to institute a reliable mechanism
    aimed at effectively tackling the financial barriers. By leveraging Blockchain''s
    transparency and data integrity, and utilizing Big Data''s analytical power, this
    approach intends to foster a secure and credible environment for financing transactions.
    The proposed solution addresses the lack of information symmetry by ensuring transparency
    and immutability of financial records through Blockchain. This empowers financiers
    alike with accurate and accessible information, reducing risks and enhancing trust.
    Furthermore, the integration of Big Data technology enhances risk assessment,
    enabling more informed lending decisions while expanding collateral options through
    comprehensive data analysis. Through this novel framework, can potentially access
    the funding they require, overcoming their financial impediments. By establishing
    a secure and efficient financing ecosystem, this approach aims to not only boost
    the progress contribute to the broader growth of the agricultural sector. As a
    result, this study''s innovative fusion of Blockchain and Big Data technologies
    presents a promising avenue for transforming the landscape of agricultural finance
    [15], [16]. SECTION III. Research Gap A significant challenge in the field of
    agriculture is the lack of integration and interconnectedness among various domains
    within the sector. This lack of synergy between different aspects of agriculture
    poses several drawbacks and limitations. Additionally, the slow adoption of advanced
    algorithms and combinational methods further compounds these challenges. Figure
    3 presents however, the isolation of these domains can lead to fragmented information
    and siloed decision-making. Farmers and stakeholders may lack a comprehensive
    view of their operations, making it difficult to optimize resource allocation
    and respond effectively to changing conditions. Without effective integration
    of agricultural domains, potential synergies between different aspects of farming
    remain untapped. For instance, if weather forecasts could be combined with soil
    data and crop growth patterns, farmers could make more informed decisions on irrigation
    and planting schedules. The absence of such interconnectedness hampers the ability
    to leverage valuable insights and seize opportunities for improved efficiency
    and productivity. Fig. 3. Interconnection of domains and revealing significance.
    Show All The lack of integrated data and algorithms contributes to inefficient
    resource management. For instance, fertilizers and pesticides might be applied
    uniformly across a field, regardless of variations in soil conditions or pest
    prevalence. This leads to unnecessary expenses, environmental impact, and reduced
    profitability. Sustainable agriculture requires careful consideration of environmental
    factors, resource use, and economic viability. Integrating algorithms and combinational
    methods could help identify optimal approaches for minimizing environmental impact
    while maintaining profitability. The absence of such integration could hinder
    the adoption of sustainable practices. Addressing these drawbacks necessitates
    a concerted effort to bridge the gaps between different agricultural domains and
    to accelerate the adoption of advanced algorithms and methods. Collaboration among
    researchers, technologists, policymakers, and farmers is essential to develop
    holistic solutions that optimize agricultural operations and contribute to a more
    resilient and sustainable future. SECTION IV. Proposed system Table 1 presents
    the gradations of disputes by incorporating Edge Computing into the IOT framework
    for climate determination in agriculture, we can leverage its advantages of real-time
    analysis, reduced data transmission, immediate responses, enhanced data privacy,
    scalability, and efficient handling of data volume. This innovative approach empowers
    farmers with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions promptly
    and effectively manage climate conditions for optimal agricultural outcomes. Edge
    Computing is a paradigm that involves processing data closer to the data source,
    at the ''edge'' of the network, rather than sending all data to a centralized
    cloud server for analysis. In the context of agriculture and climate determination,
    this means that IOT devices equipped with sensors can process and analyse data
    locally, on-site, without the need to transmit all data to a distant cloud server.
    This reduces latency and enables faster decision-making. Table 2 presents the
    summary of various techniques especially Big Data analytics empowers stakeholders
    to make data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights based on comprehensive
    analyses. This can result in more informed market strategies and risk management.
    Probabilistic Data Structures might not offer the same level of data-driven decision
    support due to their limitations in handling complex, multidimensional data. In
    conclusion, while Probabilistic Data Structures have their place in specific data
    manipulation tasks, the intricate and multifaceted nature of Global Trade and
    Market Dynamics in agriculture benefits significantly from the capabilities of
    Big Data analytics. With its ability to handle comprehensive datasets, identify
    patterns, provide real-time insights, scale to accommodate growth, offer contextual
    understanding, and drive data-driven decisions, Big Data analytics stands as the
    preferred choice for efficiently determining global trade and market dynamics
    in agriculture. TABLE I. Comparison of several methods As compared with time taken

    CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE In conclusion IoT-driven smart agriculture is revolutionizing
    the farming landscape, bolstering productivity and minimizing labor through the
    power of data-driven solutions. The seamless integration of real-time data capture
    and strategic sensor deployment empowers agile decision-making and strategic long-range
    planning. However, it''s important to confront hurdles like communication bottlenecks,
    financial implications, and connectivity challenges head-on. The convergence of
    machine learning with agriculture, as evidenced by techniques such as Random Forest,
    holds the potential to revolutionize crop yields through precise fertilizer predictions.
    This is particularly pivotal in meeting the global demand for sustenance. The
    strategic adoption of LoRa technology within the realm of intelligent agriculture
    opens doors to innovative breakthroughs, especially within rural Indian settings,
    presenting transformative solutions to age-old agricultural obstacles. Drones
    stand as indispensable tools, playing a pivotal role in overseeing crops, alleviating
    labor scarcities, and mitigating pest-related concerns. By incorporating Probabilistic
    Data Structures, the management of the copious data generated by IoT devices in
    agriculture gains efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, the fusion of Blockchain
    and Big Data technologies has the capacity to overhaul agricultural financing,
    instilling transparency and fostering exponential growth. This amalgamation of
    technological prowess and agricultural acumen propels efficiency, sustainability,
    and advancement within the realm of farming, ushering in an era of unprecedented
    progress implementing the real time. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    India SECTION I. Introduction Water is a scarce and valuable natural resource
    and especially an essential component, it needs to be developed, planned, managed,
    conserved, and in particular, effectively utilized [1]. Optimum management of
    presented water resources in the agriculture sector is obligatory because of limited
    resources and increasing demands. It is vital to rise agricultural yield under
    limited water resources for optimum agricultural crops to satisfy upcoming food
    production requirements [2]. The constraint water supply must be efficiently utilized
    for irrigating additional areas with a similar quantity of water [3]. Lately,
    various research workers have employed the Internet of things (IoT) and artificial
    intelligence (AI) to manage irrigational problems accurately via linear models.
    Precision irrigation scheduling is directed towards effectual water usage for
    all the plants, when and where it is essential, to reimburse for water loss over
    evapotranspiration, deep percolation, or erosion when preventing over- and under-irrigation
    [4]. With appropriate irrigation management through and optimum control efficient
    monitoring, water could be saved, along with providing a reduction in other indirect
    costs experienced from energy usage through fossil fuel or electricity for pumping,
    for optimum cost-efficiency [5]. Fig. 1 depicts the overview of IoT-based smart
    irrigation system. Fig. 1. Iot-based smart irrigation system Show All More recently
    used irrigation system is depends on cyclic water application notwithstanding
    the plant''s real requirement for irrigation water, which is a bigger problem
    [6]. An appropriate irrigation schedule helps to produce better crop production.
    But while surface irrigation system is employed, it is impossible to change the
    frequency and depth of irrigation water because of the implementation complexity.
    Variations in irrigation depth are quite unclear for the producer to diverge the
    irrigation scheduling [7]. Defining the optimal quantity of water isn''t an easier
    task; it relies on several factors namely wind speed, air temperature, average
    relative humidity, solar radiation, and sun hours. Consequently, the irrigation
    depth is unevenly projected to save the interval constant and the irrigation depth
    over the rising period [8]. The precise description of irrigation scheduling is
    a time-consuming and challenging method. The computer program has made it more
    available, and now it is likely to irrigation scheduling the water quantity exactly
    based on the water essential for crop production [9]. Sensor-based irrigation
    schedule system is an effective tools personalized to field characteristics that
    could considerably facilitate irrigation scheduling decisions [10]. Because of
    the development of sensors and the massive revolution of IoT for smart agriculture,
    the application presents a substantial helpful effect on irrigation water conservation
    and plants. Khan et al. [11] examine a new integration of optimizing intelligent
    smart irrigation methods for improving efficiency of the energy management. At
    this point, an optimum CH formation and selection were carried out by Hierarchy
    Shuffled Shepherd Clustering (HSSC) approach. Besides, the finest routing path
    and energy regulation are offered by the projected Emperor Penguin Jellyfish Optimized
    (EPJO) approach. In [12], a new method “Enhanced CH based Data gathering” (ECHGS)
    was projected to effort the energy and delay in IoT related smart irrigation methods
    for cultivation. During this presented method, the CH for the set of sensor nodes
    is chosen dependent on the residual energy (RE) and workload. The node is a higher
    RE and lesser workload was chosen as a CH for collecting and delivering the data
    to server node efficiently. Ullah et al. [13] projected an energy-efficient water
    management platform (EEWMP), an enhanced version of SWAMP. Quimbita et al. [14]
    examine a smart irrigation method energized by microgrid. The suggestion comprises
    2 steps namely the primary creates the daily irrigation profile dependent upon
    an adept method for sufficient utilization of water. Afterward, assuming the irrigation
    profile, the power needed for the water pump was measured-an optimum daily profile
    of current demand was defined in the second step. The microgrid is handled through
    the energy managing scheme that depends on prediction control model. Sangeetha
    et al. [15] include the smart agriculture management method for producing crop
    production and agricultural benefits. The hybrid remote-controlled device utilized
    the Global Positioning System (GPS) with Radial Function Network (RFN) has been
    introduced for controlling the irrigated scheme, forecasting the temperature,
    reducing the humidity in water content, and maintaining the air pressure. It employs
    the Internet of Everything (IOE) environmental factor and IoT sensors for monitoring
    and managing irrigation systems. This study develops an Arithmetic Optimization
    Algorithm with Machine Learning based Smart irrigation system (AOAML-SIS) technique
    in an IoT environment. Initially, the AOAML-SIS technique exploits the IoT sensors
    for data collection process. For determining the need for irrigation, the AOALM-SIS
    technique utilizes multilayer perceptron (MLP) classification model. Since the
    MLP parameters play a vital role, the parameter tuning process is carried out
    by the AOA algorithm. The experimental assessment of the AOAML-SIS technique takes
    place on agriculture data. The simulation values inferred the effectual irrigation
    classification efficacy of the AOAML-SIS technique over other models. SECTION
    II. The Proposed Smart Irrigation System In this study, an automated smart irrigation
    system using AOAML-SIS technique has been developed in IoT environment. Initially,
    the AOAML-SIS technique exploits the IoT sensors for data collection process.
    For determining the need for irrigation, the AOALM-SIS technique utilized the
    MLP classification model. Since the MLP parameters play a vital role, the parameter
    tuning process is carried out by the AOA algorithm. A. Irrigation Classification
    Using MLP In this work, the MLP model is applied to irrigation management. ANN
    is non-parametric method that consists of a sequence of processing components
    named neurons [16]. The feedforward neural network is a class of supervised ANN
    that usually has 3 layers of nodes, such as hidden, input, and output layers.
    The MLP is the more common and well known feedforward network. The MLP node was
    arranged hierarchically in various FC layers. Especially, MLP has input, output,
    and hidden layers (HLs) that reside among the input and output layers. In this
    work, the HL provides the processing and computation power for producing the network
    output. The connection is characterized using the network weight that is are real
    number within[1, 1.]. In this work, two stages are implemented for yielding the
    output value of all the nodes in every layer. Initially, the weighted sum of the
    input value is evaluated by: S j = ∑ i=1 n ( w ij I i + β j ) (1) View Source
    In Eq. (1), l i indicates the i−th input parameter, n indicates the overall amount
    of nodes (neurons) from the input layer w ij shows the weight connection amongst
    the hidden nod j and I i and β i indicates the bias (threshold) weight of i th
    hidden nodes. Next, the resultant value of every node in the HL was calculated
    according to the weighted sum. Here, activation is utilized for triggering the
    output according to the value of summation function. Then, distinct kinds of activation
    function are stored. The sigmoid activation function is widely employed for mapping
    the HL outcome value that is evaluated by: f j (x)= 1 1+ e − s j (2) View Source
    Lastly, the network output is attained by the following expression: y ^ k = ∑
    j=1 m ( w kj f i + β k ) (3) View Source The MLP performance depends on the value
    of weight and biases connection determined in the trained stage. Thus, the major
    aim of trained MLP is to discover a collection of optimum connection weights and
    biases for minimizing predictive error. B. AOA Based Parameter Tuning For tuning
    the parameters of the MLP model, the AOA is used. AOA primarily imitate the usage
    of numerical operator in the numerical problem-solving technique [17]. Arithmetic
    is the previous part of mathematics which is used to deal with the properties
    of the function and numbers. The arithmetic operator is an operation symbol that
    implements necessary arithmetic, viz., a symbol exploited to 4 techniques. During
    the optimization, this operator was exploited to select the better solution for
    the candidate. At first, the searching range of candidate outcomes was widely
    secured for breaking the deadlock of method falls into searching stagnation. Next,
    enhance the search efficiency of solution through the deep search. The sequence
    of feasible solutions has been randomly produced at the earlier step of optimized
    technique of AOA, as follows. X=[ χ N−1,1 χ N,1 χ 2,… 1 χ 1,1 χ N−1,j χ N,j χ
    2,j χ1,j χ N,n−1 χ 1., ′ n−1 χ N−l,n χ 1,n χ N,n χ 2,….n ′ ] X= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢
    ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ x 1,1 x 2,1 … ⋮ x N−1,1 x N,1 … … … ⋮ … … … … … ⋮ … … x 1,j x 2,j …
    ⋮ x N−1,j x N,j x 1,n−1 … … ⋮ … x N,n−1 x 1,n x 2,n … ⋮ x N−1,n x N,n ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (4) View Source Formerly, the AOA implements the optimization
    technique, it is essential to resolve the search technique according to the values
    of Math Optimizer Accelerated (MOA) method that is evaluated using the subsequent
    expression: MOA( C − Iter)=Min+ C − Iter×( Max−Min M − Iter ) (5) View Source
    From the expression, MOA (C _Iter) denotes the function values in C ‘_Iter iteration;
    C _Iter characterize the existing iteration. M “_Iter indicates the highest amount
    of iterations; Min and Max are augmented function lower and higher values. The
    exploration stage in the AOA system was generally recognized by operators such
    as Multiplication (M) and Division (D). The position of candidate result was considerably
    upgraded during the exploration process in the following: x i,j ( C − Iter+1)
    ={ best ( x j )/(M0P+ε)×((U B j −L B j )×μ+L B j ) (best( x j )×MOP ×(U B j −L
    B j )×μ+L B j r 2 <0.5 otherwise (6) View Source From the expression, χ i,j (
    C − 1ter+1) represents the j th position of i th solution in (CIter+11 th iteration;
    E designates the smaller value; U I j and LB designate the upper as well as lower
    boundaries of positions of candidate result: μ is exploited to regulate the exploration
    phase are static as 0.5; the MOP shows the math optimizing possibility of AOA
    that is defined below: 1 MOP( C − Iter)=1− C − Ite r 1 α M − Ite r 1 α (7) View
    Source In Eq. (7), α denotes the accurateness of exploitation on iteration, α
    = 5. The employment of exploitation technique mainly relies on Addition (A) and
    Subtraction (S) operators are easy to create minimum distribution, for candidate
    solution was implemented a deep search with large probability to evaluate the
    optimum solution: x i,j ( C Iter +1) ={ best( x j )−MOP×((U B j −L B j )×μ+L B
    j , best( x j )+MOP×((U B j −L B j )×μ+L B j , r 3 <0.5 otherwise } (8) View Source
    The adaptive conversion amongst the exploration as well as exploitation steps
    are reinforced AOA technique that determines the better solution and endures the
    multiplicity of potential solutions for performing the study. Algorithm 1: Pseudocode

    the AOAML-SIS technique are well studied here. Table I. Classification outcome

    output of the AOAML-SIS technique with several epochs. The obtained values demonstrated
    that the AOAML-SIS technique has reached improving values under each epoch. For

  description: This article presents the current state-of-the-art research on applying
    artificial intelligence (AI) technology in smart greenhouses to optimize crop
    yields, water, and fertilizer use efficiency, to reduce pest and disease, and
    to enhance agricultural sustainability. The key technologies of interest were
    robotic systems for pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting, bio-inspired
    algorithms for the automation of greenhouse processes, energy management, machine
    path planning and operation of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), resolution of
    scheduling problems, and image signal processing for pest and disease diagnosis.
    Additionally, the review investigated the cost benefits of various energy-management
    and AI-based energy-saving technologies, the integration of photovoltaics and
    dynamic pricing based on real-time and time-of-use metrics, and the cost benefits
    of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and RFID (radiofrequency identification)
    technologies. The review established that commercially viable AI technologies
    for agriculture had increased exponentially. For example, AI-based irrigation
    and soil fertilizer application enabled farmers to realize higher returns on investment
    on fertilizer application and gross returns above the fertilizer cost, higher
    yields, and resource use efficiency. Similarly, AI image detection techniques
    led to the early diagnosis of powdery mildew. The precise operation of agricultural
    robots was supported by the integration of light imaging, detection, and ranging
    (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras in place of the traditional GPS (geographic
    positioning systems) technologies, which are prone to errors. However, critical
    challenges remained unresolved, including cost, disparities between research and

    Versions Notes Abstract This article presents the current state-of-the-art research
    on applying artificial intelligence (AI) technology in smart greenhouses to optimize
    crop yields, water, and fertilizer use efficiency, to reduce pest and disease,
    and to enhance agricultural sustainability. The key technologies of interest were
    robotic systems for pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting, bio-inspired
    algorithms for the automation of greenhouse processes, energy management, machine
    path planning and operation of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), resolution of
    scheduling problems, and image signal processing for pest and disease diagnosis.
    Additionally, the review investigated the cost benefits of various energy-management
    and AI-based energy-saving technologies, the integration of photovoltaics and
    dynamic pricing based on real-time and time-of-use metrics, and the cost benefits
    of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and RFID (radiofrequency identification)
    technologies. The review established that commercially viable AI technologies
    for agriculture had increased exponentially. For example, AI-based irrigation
    and soil fertilizer application enabled farmers to realize higher returns on investment
    on fertilizer application and gross returns above the fertilizer cost, higher
    yields, and resource use efficiency. Similarly, AI image detection techniques
    led to the early diagnosis of powdery mildew. The precise operation of agricultural
    robots was supported by the integration of light imaging, detection, and ranging
    (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras in place of the traditional GPS (geographic
    positioning systems) technologies, which are prone to errors. However, critical
    challenges remained unresolved, including cost, disparities between research and
    development (R&D) innovations and technology commercialization, energy use, the
    tradeoff between accuracy and computational speeds, and technology gaps between
    the Global North and South. In general, the value of this review is that it surveys
    the literature on the maturity level of various AI technologies in smart greenhouses
    and offers a state-of-the-art picture of how far the technologies have successfully
    been applied in agriculture and what can be done to optimize their usability.
    Keywords: greenhouses; agriculture; artificial intelligence; intelligent; algorithms;
    robotics 1. Introduction The AI systems of interest include bio-inspired ecological
    and swarm intelligence algorithms, unmanned UAVs (Unmanned aerial vehicles) for
    pesticide application, and robotic systems for harvesting, irrigation, soil treatment,
    fertilizer application, and seeding [1,2]. In addition, the study critiques the
    role of swarm intelligence (genetic optimization algorithms and related algorithms)
    in agricultural parameter optimization, machinery path planning, robotic flight,
    resolution of scheduling problems, system identification, power systems, and image
    and signal processing [1,2]. The multidimensional view of AI (artificial intelligence)
    technologies in smart greenhouses would provide a nuanced understanding of the
    recent milestones in research and development and their implications for commercial
    and smallholder agriculture in the developed global north (North America, Western
    Europe, Mediterranean region, China, Japan, and South Korea) and underdeveloped
    global south (Africa, Latin America, and South Asia) [3]. Emerging technology
    companies, such as Blue River Technology, Harvest CROO Robotics, Trace Genomics,
    and Autonomous Tractor Corp were leading in the commercial deployment of self-driving
    agricultural tractors, AI-based weed control systems, pest diagnostics, soil analysis,
    and crop health monitoring [4,5]. In line with [4,5], Karnawat et al. [6] acknowledged
    the immense role played by Blue River Technology in the advancement of robotics
    and AI systems in agriculture in California and the US in general. These emerging
    trends of AI and machine learning (ML) in agriculture need to be summarized to
    provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art (i.e., maturity levels
    of various AI applications in agriculture, including barriers and facilitators)
    and insights into future developments [7]. Many factors dictate the need to review
    the maturity levels of various AI applications in agriculture. First, there is
    increasing demand for technological solutions to address global food insecurities,
    especially in the Global South. Currently, at least 810 million people are food
    insecure. The actual ratio would increase over time in line with the global population
    growth. By 2050, the global population will surpass 9 billion [8,9]. The higher
    population growth within a generation would strain the already fragile agricultural
    systems and ecosystems that are being gradually destroyed to create additional
    land for farming. Iddio et al. argued that controlled environment agriculture
    (CEA) using greenhouses might help to offset the pressing concerns about agricultural
    sustainability [10]. The case for greenhouse-based CEA was validated by the fact
    that greenhouse crop cultivation improves yields and reduces the need for excess
    pesticides, water, land, and transportation of crops over extended distances.
    The case for CEA advanced by [10] was in tandem with Afzali et al. [11], who supported
    the intensification of agricultural technologies. The need for a paradigm shift
    in agricultural cultivation was premised on the increasing risk of global starvation
    [12]. The AI-mediated improvements in crop yields may help avert the forecasted
    global food crises. Second, a large body of knowledge, including the evidence
    presented by Senavirathne et al. [13] and Haque et al. [12], suggested that the
    satisfaction of future food needs would be achieved by optimizing the existing
    crop production technologies, given there was limited arable land for agricultural
    expansion [14]. In line with [14], Lakshmi and Corbett [15] estimated that smart
    technology in agriculture may help boost yields by 60% before 2030. Conservative
    estimates indicate the EU market for precision agriculture systems will surpass
    11.8 billion by 2025 [16]. The projected market growth and higher yields catalyzed
    the current greenhouse boom. As of 2020, there were 3.6 million hectares of greenhouse
    crops globally [17,18,19,20,21,22]. Third, current climate projection models forecast
    suppressed rainfall, land degradation, desertification, flooding, and other weather
    phenomena triggered by climate change and increased release of greenhouse gases
    [23,24]. The projections documented by [23,24] reflected the current realities
    in Sub-Saharan Africa [25]. The expansion of open-field agriculture to offset
    climate-related challenges is no longer a viable option. The European Commission
    Joint Research Centre estimated that three-quarters of the useful land on earth
    was already degraded, and the proportion of degraded land would surpass 90% by
    2050 [26]. The challenge is most pronounced in developing countries that experienced
    the highest dryland desertification rate between 1982 and 2015. During this period,
    at least 5.4 million km2 of land was degraded [27]. In theory, losing traditional
    farming dryland was a sufficient motivational factor for transitioning to smart
    greenhouses powered by AI technologies. However, the contrary phenomenon is true
    for climate-smart agriculture worldwide [28]. The current pace of transition does
    not match the challenges. On a positive note, the transition to precision agriculture
    would enable farmers to optimally use water, soil, and energy resources to minimize
    the negative effects of climate change on farming [29]. The rational use of agricultural
    resources would reduce the pressure on the natural environment, resulting in higher
    sustainability. The article critiques recent research on smart greenhouses and
    artificial intelligence technologies, including the favorable factors and the
    challenges that have impeded the growth of AI and smart greenhouse technologies.
    The study emphasized smart farming technologies, mechanization of farms, smart
    micro-irrigation, rapid soil analysis, pest prediction, and autonomous modification
    of the greenhouse microclimate, and LIDAR (light Imaging, detection, and ranging),
    optical and electro-optical cameras for robotic system motion and object identification
    (see Figure 1) [30]. The specific scope was supported by the gaps in research
    and the breadth of information relating to the impact of AI and IoT (Internet
    of Things) and data-driven agriculture, intelligent crop planning, and farm gate-to-fork
    systems [31,32]. More particularly, no review has so far comprehensively mapped
    the state of AI and IoT application in smart greenhouse farming to help researchers
    and farmers of plant factories to solve the imminent problems related to global
    food insecurities and climate change, despite the fact that technological innovations
    have been centrally placed in the development of effective and sustainable solutions
    to these challenges. Thus, this review will enable farmers of factory plants to
    understand the extent to which AI and IoT can be combined to improve farming efficiency
    and productivity and will enable researchers to advance knowledge on this subject
    domain by building on the research achieved so far. Figure 1. Smart farming and
    other emerging innovations in the agricultural sector [30]. Method for Systematic
    Review The review of Incorporating Artificial Intelligence Technology in Smart
    Greenhouses was aligned with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and
    meta-analyses (see Figure 2). PRISMA Flowchart shown in Figure 2 below provides
    detailed information about how the 174 articles cited in this review were identified
    and selected. All data were sourced from published articles. The peer-reviewed
    data were sourced from the following primary databases: MDPI, Elsevier, Springer
    (including Nature Springer) and Taylor and Francis, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
    More databases would have been searched, but a quick literature survey revealed
    that that they mostly publish duplicated content, such as between Frontiers and
    Springer.,Emphasis was given to literature published after 2019, since technological
    advancements, especially AI and IoT, are rapidly evolving. The choice of articles
    published from 2019 onwards was therefore motivated by the need to review only
    recent studies in this field. This motivation was also appraised as valid owing
    to the many research studies on the application of AI in agriculture that have
    been published within the past three years. The primary keywords were AI, greenhouses,
    smart, IoT, and agriculture. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were characterized
    by a title and abstract screening, followed by a full-text and abstract screening
    process, which focused on the subject’s relevance. Articles were excluded if they
    did not discuss the role of various AI technologies in agriculture. Studies were
    also excluded if they did not use any methodological approach to analyze and synthesize
    data before making conclusions. Studies published in non-English languages were
    also excluded to avoid translation errors and associated financial costs and factual
    consequences. The research design of the studies did not matter, but primary studies
    with experimental design were given priority over others during the selection
    process. Figure 2. PRISMA diagram. 2. Artificial Intelligence Technologies for
    Smart Greenhouses 2.1. Historical Background of AI and ICTs in Agriculture Using
    AI and ICT in precision agriculture is not a new phenomenon. Rao et al. [33] traced
    the use of ICTs in precision agriculture back to the 20th century. In 1958, psychologist
    Frank Rosenblatt first formulated and proposed artificial neural networks as mathematical
    models of artificial intelligence whose mathematical structure attempted to mimic
    the functionality of biological neurons [34]. More specifically, in this first
    work, the well-known mathematical simulant of Perceptron, which is the first structure
    of the artificial neural network, was successfully employed to simulate how the
    human brain processes optical data and learns to recognize objects. The first
    structure of Perceptron is the main basis and architecture of the neural networks
    that have been extensively used in precision agriculture and other disciplines.
    Perception marked a historic key point in artificial intelligence research and
    commercial adoption with the coining of a phrase that embodied an entire field
    within AI. AI techniques have developed because of the complexity of the technological
    era, where a plethora of complex problems with a strongly non-linear nature cannot
    be solved using classical deterministic techniques, such as regression analysis
    and least-squared methods. Despite their novelty, it took four decades (until
    the early 1990s) for artificial neural networks to be used widely in medical applications
    [35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42], computational engineering [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53],
    and precision agriculture. The historical analysis of ICTs in agriculture by Rao
    et al. [33,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53] aligns with the broader trends in
    the global demand for AI, ML, and IoT, as noted by Misra et al. [33]. On the downside,
    the true potential of AI and ICTs has not been fully exploited. The observation
    was validated by the fact that the transition of ICT technologies from computing
    to agriculture was delayed, considering the field of artificial intelligence was
    first proposed in 1955 and expanded in subsequent years [8]. During the early
    phases of precision agriculture, the key focus was improving crop yields and productivity
    by monitoring soil nutrients. However, the scope of precision agriculture has
    broadened to encompass artificial pollination using robot bees, autonomous operation
    of farm equipment, and optimization of different agricultural processes using
    bio-inspired algorithms [1,54,55]. The technology patterns demonstrate a peak
    in AL technologies from 2016 onwards. The convergence of new technologies in precision
    agriculture ushered in the Industry 4.0 revolution and the Internet of Plants
    (IoP) [56] (see Figure 3). The figure demonstrates how the availability of digital
    sensors and IoT can be used to collect environmental data, such as light, temperature,
    humidity, nutrition, and water, and then be stored in a cloud-based server, which
    can supply information for various farm work operations. However, there is growing
    criticism of AI technologies in agriculture due to their higher energy demand,
    high initial capital outlay, and variable accuracy [17]. These concerns have been
    discounted in view of the immense benefits of AI systems, including better crop
    yields, lower labor costs, and improved efficiency [57]. Figure 3. Core attributes
    and the link between IoP and IoT [56]. The current scope of AI and IoT in smart
    greenhouses encompasses artificial lighting using LEDs [58], air ventilation,
    water and nutrition pumps, plant nutrition, humidity control, moisture control,
    and temperature control subsystems with a unique combination of sensors and controls
    with distinct attributes [13]. The impact of weeds, pests, diseases, and water
    stress on crop yields validated the broadening scope of AI in precision agriculture.
    Egorov et al. [59] noted that livermore was a pervasive weed across the US, impacting
    the germination and growth of plants. In line with Egorov et al., [8,59] noted
    that improper management of weeds could potentially reduce crop yields by 48–60%.
    However, the projected reduction in crop yields due to pest infestation observed
    by [8] contrasts with Raatz et al., who reported up to 60% losses in harvests
    due to pest infestation [60], but attributed the phenomena to biotic culprits,
    including weed growth. Despite the contrasting observations made by Raatz et al.
    [60] and [8], poor management of crop pests and diseases had a detrimental effect
    on crop yields. The devastating impact of South American tomato pinworm on sweet
    pepper and tomato in Almería, Southeastern Spain, was a case in point [61]. In
    the latter case, the Spanish farmers had to rely on toxic pesticides, such as
    Chlorpyrifos-methyl, to manage the pests [61,62]. Reducing human exposure to toxic
    pesticides through the mechanization of greenhouse spraying activities yielded
    significant benefits in the long term [63]. Additionally, intelligent IPM (Integrated
    pest management) practices may offset the emerging pesticide resistance threats.
    2.2. Current AI Technologies for Agriculture The AI technologies available for
    smart greenhouses and precision agriculture are diverse, ranging from ecological
    bio-inspired algorithms, such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System–Particle
    Swarm Optimization (ANFIS-PSO), ANFIS-GA (ANFIS with Genetic Algorithm) and ANFIS-ACO
    (ANFIS with Ant Colony Optimization), swarm intelligence algorithms (Artificial
    Bee Colony (ABC), Flower Pollination algorithm (FPA), Firefly algorithm, Krill
    Herd algorithm, and genetic optimization algorithms) [64] to UAV (drones) pesticide
    application and robotic systems for harvesting [9], irrigation, soil treatment,
    seeding, fertilizer application, seeding, and other tasks [1,2]. The current body
    of knowledge linked the demand for robotics, UAVs, and bio-inspired algorithms
    in agriculture to distinct factors. On the one hand, scholars argued that the
    growth was catalyzed by the need to enhance yields and operational efficiency
    and reduce costs [8,29,33]. In line with [5,29,33], Cao et al. reported a 10%
    improvement in tomato yields with the iGrow intelligent greenhouse system and
    92% higher profits [18]. On the other hand, AI assimilation in smart agriculture
    was triggered by natural events, including higher levels of pesticide resistance
    and forest fires, which compromised agricultural production [65,66]. The following
    sections critiqued the two worldviews to yield better insights into the favorable
    factors and barriers to AI-system adoption in smart greenhouses and precision
    agriculture at large. 2.2.1. Cost Benefits of AI Technologies for Agriculture
    The focus on the role of AI systems in smart greenhouses and the agricultural
    sector, in general, was validated by the unique challenges and the enormous contribution
    in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA). Agriculture provided direct employment to
    approximately 4.4% of the population in Europe, and its GVA exceeded €181 billion
    [67]. The scenario was not specific to the EU; at least 70% of the Indian population
    depended on agriculture for employment and sustenance [68]. Despite the enormous
    contribution, the future of agriculture in Europe and across the world is threatened
    by population dynamics; most European farmers are older (>80%), while a minority
    are below 40 years [67]. In contrast to the European Economic and Social Committee’s
    report [67] on the impact of demographics on agricultural technology adoption,
    Loudjani et al. [69] argued that the primary barriers were time and costs. The
    average cost of installing AI systems on farms was enormous and beyond the reach
    of smallholder farmers [70]. The contrary was true for large commercial farms
    with a higher capacity to absorb costs and risks and a higher tendency to allocate
    resources for capital-intensive investments [71]. The concerns raised by Kendall
    et al. [70] were supported by the Cisco and the International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU) report [72], which noted that agricultural sensors for AI systems
    with greater functionality are expensive ($150–$1000+ per sensor). The initial
    capital outlay was a key impediment to technology adoption, considering that multiple
    sensors are required for monitoring greenhouse microclimate (humidity, temperature,
    soil nutrient, water levels, and pH). From another dimension, the expenses were
    relative, given that local production of smart greenhouse components may offset
    costs [73]; this view was corroborated by Chung’s study [73] on South Korean companies
    Hyundai Metal Farming Company, Sewoon, DaeSungHione, and Dae Ryun and local production
    of precision farming systems, such as sensors, actuators, fans, heaters, dehumidifiers,
    and window motors. In contrast, there was insufficient production capacity in
    developing countries. The cost-centric worldview advanced by Kendall et al. [70]
    and Loudjani et al. [69] negated the role of externalities. Lakshmi and Corbett
    [18] argued that the effectiveness of AI systems was largely dependent on the
    willingness of the local stakeholders to “modify, generate, and extend their operational
    capabilities to improve efficiency” (p. 5209). Additionally, the processes, AI
    resources, and tools (including drones, sensors, and robots) employed by commercial
    farms profoundly impacted the effectiveness of AI systems. Drawing from Lakshmi
    and Corbett’s study [18], the cost was not a primary barrier to AI technology
    adoption. 2.2.2. Water and Fertilizer Use Efficiency and Crop Yields with AI Systems
    The success of the GOSSYM (a combined simulation model for plant growth and decision)
    aid for cotton crop management mode influenced the iterative development of other
    AI systems, including the HortiMED-AI-powered Decision Support Systems (DSSs)
    [74]. On a positive note, the barriers to the transition from labor- and input-intensive
    agriculture to knowledge-based farming would be eliminated over time; this is
    evident with the recent innovations in AI systems for smart/precision agriculture.
    In 2022, Otazua reported the successful development of the HortiMED-AI-powered
    decision support systems (DSSs) that facilitated autonomous greenhouse control
    using sensors, “multilayer hierarchical control architecture,” smart algorithms,
    “hybrid modeling combining well-known mechanistic models with AI techniques,”
    IoT, and machine learning (p. 1) [74]. The HortiMED-DSS was capable of facilitating
    cost-effective automation of greenhouse heating, ventilation, and fertigation,
    and providing expert services relating to nutrient, crop, and climatic conditions
    (fertilizer and water application rates and timelines). The observations made
    by [74] regarding the benefits of automating greenhouse were in tandem with Cui
    et al. [75]; precision irrigation and fertilizer application led to higher nitrogen
    use and water use efficiency, and in turn, a lower risk of pests and diseases
    in greenhouse cucumbers in China’s Yangling region. The observations made by Cui
    et al. [75] about AI-mediated water-use efficiency corroborated the study by Lin
    et al., which noted that AI technologies provided water to crops within their
    demand ranges [76]. From a theoretical point of view, Cui et al. [75] and Lin
    et al. [76] advanced a simplistic view of sensor operation, which did not align
    with Briciu-Burghina et al. [77]. In the latter case, Briciu-Burghina et al. [77]
    argued that the accuracy of the soil moisture sensors was dependent on hardware
    components and environmental degradation of the sensor components. In line with
    Briciu-Burghina et al. [77], there were cases when the dielectric soil moisture
    sensors failed to accurately measure periodic changes in the soil moisture levels;
    this had a negative domino effect on demand irrigation. The faulty measurements
    were linked to either corrosion or hardware malfunction. The outcome reported
    by Briciu-Burghina et al. [77] negated the impact of soil type on sensor malfunction—an
    issue that was extensively investigated by Shamshiri et al. [78]. The study confirmed
    that the “resistive sensor operates defectively in sandy loam and clay loam soils
    owing to low bulk density and high organic matter” (p. 5) Emerging research recommended
    the adoption of capacitive soil moisture sensors to counteract the limitations
    of the resistive sensors. From the researcher’s perspective, the risk of corrosion
    was disproportionately higher, considering the dielectric sensors were buried
    in situ and the soils were humid [77]. The risk of sensor malfunction highlights
    the potential drawbacks and limits of demand-driven agriculture. Despite the mounting
    evidence on the risk of a sensor malfunction, the technology issues are often
    disregarded due to cost considerations and the anticipated cost savings. Cui et
    al. [75] reported a 17.5% higher cucumber yield following the introduction of
    AI-based irrigation, while the partial factor productivity of applied nitrogen
    increased by 29%. Similarly, with AI-based systems, Sharma et al. [79] reported
    a 17% improvement in wheat grain yields. Considering the outcomes were statistically
    significant (p < 0.005), AI-based irrigation and fertilizer application yielded
    tangible benefits compared to traditional drip irrigation and manual soil fertilization.
    The positive outcomes reported by Cui et al. [75] were consistent with the Sharma
    et al. case study in Saudi Arabia, where superior partial factor productivity
    of applied nitrogen with ANN (Artificial neural network) models was established
    [79]. Since no experimental data contradicted the positive findings made by Cui
    et al. [75] and Sharma et al. [79], it appears that the AI technologies were cost-effective
    and may enable farmers to achieve higher returns on investment on fertilizer application
    and gross returns above the fertilizer cost. The use-efficiency-related benefits
    that emerged from applying fertilizers were comparable to pesticide-use efficiency.
    Facchinetti et al. [80] reported a 50% reduction in the use of pesticides based
    on an initial theoretical mixture of 1000 L/ha. The introduction of computational
    algorithms helped to reduce the demand for pesticides to 470 L/ha. The study confirmed
    that the pesticide application rates could be further reduced to 300 L/ha [80].
    Facchinetti et al. hypothesized a 33% reduction in pesticide use [80], which does
    not match Claver’s research, which noted it was possible to reduce pesticide usage
    by up to 78% using the state-of-the-art algorithm systems developed by Israel-based
    Greeneye Technology [81]. Similarly, Shankar et al. postulated that intelligent
    technologies enabled farmers to practice variable rate application (VAR), which
    provided real-time data on the areas most infested with pests and diseases [82].
    The utility of the VAR was further reinforced by the xarvio Spray Timer and SprayWeather,
    which enabled farmers to establish the most appropriate window for spraying. Drawing
    from the empirical data provided by [82], VAR eliminated the need to apply excessive
    fertilizers in areas least affected by pesticides, and was an ideal alternative
    compared to the system proposed by Facchinetti et al. [80]. The use of fewer pesticides
    in the production of freshly cut salads had a beneficial effect on human health,
    considering pesticide residues in foods were risk factors for myriad non-communicable
    diseases. On the downside, the benefits that accrue from DSS, VAR for pesticides,
    xarvio Spray Timer and SprayWeather, AI-based fertilizer, irrigation, and other
    systems may be less relevant to remote areas with limited IT infrastructure and
    technical expertise [8]. However, these challenges may not persist in the long
    term, considering the high pace of IT infrastructure deployment in rural and urban
    areas, previously classified as unprofitable for such ventures [83]. From another
    perspective, the deployment of IT infrastructure would only provide a partial
    solution, given the aging of the population was also a major issue of concern.
    2.3. AI Systems for Integrated Pest Management Despite the concerns raised about
    the prohibitive costs, the proponents of AI argue that the long-term benefits
    outweigh the short-term costs [84,85]. The reliable use of AI systems to predict
    rice production was a case in point [85]. Beyond the prediction of crop production,
    AI systems facilitated the development of intelligent IPM systems capable of detecting
    early infestation of white flies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum and Bemisia argentifolii)
    and thrips (Thrips tabaci, Frankliniella intonsa, Thrips hawaiiensis, and Thrips
    tabaci) [57]. The observations made by Rustia et al. [57] reinforce earlier observations
    made by Karar et al. [14] on the suitability of deep learning systems in the management
    of pests and diseases. From a commercial perspective, the findings reported by
    Rustia et al. [57] and Karar et al. [14] were compelling, but inadequate for catalyzing
    a paradigm shift in the market; this view was reinforced by the fact that the
    existing stock of Al systems for pest identification and management focused on
    insect pheromone identification [86]. The pheromone-centric ANN and wireless sensor
    network (WSN) technology cannot control all insect types, considering there is
    a limited number of commercially available pheromones for IPM [86]. Despite the
    reservations reported by Singh et al. [86], the ANN–WSN system for pest identification
    accurately categorized harmful and beneficial insects; these data guided the calculation
    of the volume of pesticides for IPM. The limits of WSN technology highlighted
    by [86] were in tandem with [87], who noted that variable monitoring ranges, complex
    typologies, and environmental conditions compromised the operation of WSN systems.
    However, recent R&D evidence suggests otherwise. The shortcomings of WSN identified
    by [86,87] negate recent milestones achieved by Sacaleanu et al. [88] with wireless
    sensors and actuators networks (WSAN). WSAN is an upgrade of WSN developed to
    resolve most of the limitations of WSN using actuators for better monitoring and
    control. The advances made using WSAN have not been accompanied by greater market
    adoption, owing to the newness of the technology; most studies still focus on
    WSN technologies for smart greenhouses [19,89]. Beyond the concerns about the
    pace of market adoption, the body of knowledge, including Rustia et al. [57],
    Singh et al. [86], and Karar et al. [14], was informed by small-scale experiments
    under controlled conditions. Real-life applications of AI systems (IRIS scout
    robots and robot scouts) in identifying pests and diseases in agriculture yielded
    false positive data after analyzing pheromone trap images and powdery mildew [90].
    Since the latter findings were based on market data, the IRIS scout robots and
    robot scouts were not ready for market adoption. Inaccurate assessment of pests
    and disease infestation using AI and ML (machine learning) image analysis techniques
    would result in the excessive application of pesticides. Further research and
    development efforts were necessary to minimize false positive rates. 2.4. Robotics
    and Algorithms for Precision Agriculture and Smart Greenhouses Recently, commercial
    farms have deployed robotic systems to selectively harvest fragile fruits and
    vegetables such as broccoli and tomatoes [91]. The findings by [91] were in agreement
    with Lee et al. [92], who documented the increased use of robotic systems to sort
    tomatoes based on color, size, shape, and mass and to identify all defects during
    the harvesting process. The case for AI robotic systems in smart farming advanced
    by Kootstra et al. [91] was corroborated by Vidwath et al. [93] and Navas et al.
    [94], who highlighted the benefits of soft robotic grippers in fruit and vegetable
    harvesting. In contrast to Vidwath et al. [93] and Navas et al. [94], Tianhua
    et al. [95] argued that AI robotic systems could perform a wide range of unsafe
    greenhouse tasks beyond harvesting. Such applications include pesticide spraying
    and UV-C treatment of crops to mitigate the spread of powdery mildew. From a human
    health perspective, Tianhua et al. [95] perspective on the use of robotic systems
    for pesticide application was validated by pesticide toxicity studies [61,62,96].
    For example, Chlorpyrifos-methyl, a common pesticide employed in integrated pest
    management of the South American tomato pinworm, caused cholinesterase inhibition
    in humans and death in severe cases [62]. In other studies, mechanical AI systems
    enabled farmers to reduce their labor requirements by up to 90% [13]. However,
    the actual reduction rates can be contested, considering robots cannot entirely
    replace human labor. Empirical data supported the arguments concerning costs and
    operational efficiency of AI systems in farms. Hou et al. [97] used Dynamic Artificial
    Bee–Ant Colony algorithm (DABACA) to optimize agricultural machinery plant operational
    cycle and route planning. The study reported better optimization, convergence
    accuracy (>90%), and reduced operational cycles, which translated to significant
    cost savings. The observations made by Hou et al. [97] using DABACA were in line
    with Cao et al. [98], whose bio-inspired algorithm-mediated task assignment of
    agricultural machinery, which employed ant colony algorithm-based B-patterns to
    improve the operational efficiency of agricultural equipment, including the fuel
    used and non-working distance covered during routine farm operations. However,
    critics argue that the positive outcomes drawn from experimental studies, such
    as the observations made by Hou et al. [97] and Cao et al. [98], did not justify
    the widespread adoption of AI systems in greenhouses. The concerns were premised
    on the following factors. First, AI systems in agriculture lacked standardized
    accuracy rates. The system accuracy varied depending on the local environmental
    conditions and operational factors. Second, the risk of error remained regardless
    of the algorithm’s robustness [99,100]. However, the higher risk of errors was
    not ubiquitous. Proietti et al. established that RNN (Recurrent neural network)-based
    decoder–encoder systems exhibited great potential in the early detection of anomalies
    [101]. Similarly, Aytenfsu et al. noted that Elman Recurrent Neural Network (ERNN)
    was 98% accurate in predicting greenhouse temperature and humidity levels. The
    case-specific error theory provided better context concerning the benefits and
    limits of AI systems in smart greenhouses. Even though [99,100] raised valid concerns
    about the constraints, commercial adoption should be encouraged. The positive
    assessment of AI systems in commercial agriculture was validated by successful
    commercial adoption. For example, Gao et al. [102] used an ANN model to quantify
    crop evapotranspiration rates in Saudi Arabia. The ANN model yielded better estimates
    than traditional approaches to estimating evapotranspiration. Accurate determination
    of the plant evapotranspiration rates provided useful data for automated irrigation
    algorithms. Beyond the estimation of the crop evapotranspiration rates, the ANN
    and WDNN algorithms were equally proven useful in predicting the photosynthetic
    rates of plants, among other physiological indices that predict plant growth rates
    and yield [103]. In other cases, hybrid algorithms were proven reliable in weed
    prediction/optimization [104,105], and the determination of the soil cation exchange
    capacity [106]. The positive assessment of ANN technologies reinforces earlier
    observations by Proietti et al. [101] on the fusion of deep learning and artificial
    intelligence (RNN encoders and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)) to facilitate learning
    patterns in time series and modeling data sequences using monitored parameters
    to predict crop growth indicators in greenhouses. The case for RNN advanced by
    Proietti et al. [101] negated critical shortcomings identified by Codeluppi et
    al. [107]; NN systems were inferior to LSTM owing to the long time series and
    vanishing gradient problem, which made it difficult to train the model on long-term
    dependencies. The latter findings validate the emerging transition from LSTM to
    RNN. Gao et al. [102] and Hu et al.’s [103] bias toward new algorithms for greenhouses
    was validated by the following considerations. First, modern greenhouses are complex;
    there are dynamic relationships between different greenhouse parameters, and the
    data mining ability of traditional models is insufficient to facilitate the extraction
    of all useful information. Second, the traditional models’ low precision and convergence
    speeds made them incompatible with modern intelligent greenhouses. On the downside,
    the research of Gao et al. [102] and Hu et al. [103] negated the fact that the
    transition from traditional to modern algorithms does not automatically translate
    to higher prediction accuracy and sensitivity. The hybrid algorithms must be combined
    with the appropriate classifiers to yield better accuracy and specificity [105].
    For example, Tao and Wei achieved a 92% accuracy with the CNN (Convolutional Neural
    Network)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for weed recognition [104]. However,
    SVM coupled with the ANN algorithm proved inferior compared to the emerging class
    of deep learning models. CNN was paired with SVM because the former exhibited
    satisfactory results in computer pattern recognition, but unsatisfactory results
    in artificial differentiation of weeds. The SVM model helped to address this challenge
    [104]. In contrast to Tao and Wei [104], Emamgholizadeh et al. [106] proposed
    a three-model algorithm integrating particle swarm, integrated invasive weed optimization,
    and support vector for accurate weed recognition. Drawing from the latter study,
    the development of algorithms for evaluating greenhouse parameters should be customized
    to match local conditions and requirements. The findings of Emamgholizadeh et
    al. [106] were corroborated by Ibrahim et al., who noted that the integrated particle
    swarm algorithm was ideal for selecting discriminant features [108]. On the downside,
    widespread adoption is constrained by a paucity of temporal data for precise predictions
    and training of AI and ML systems. Karnawat et al. argued that the lack of suitable
    historical data would be a critical impediment to the adoption of AI systems in
    agriculture. The latter findings contradict the positive narratives advanced by
    Emamgholizadeh et al. [106] and Ibrahim et al. [108] concerning the immense potential
    of CNN and ANN algorithms in intelligent farming. The increased reliance on bio-inspired
    algorithms in crop irrigation is justified, given traditional irrigation methods
    resulted in a 60% waste of water resources [38]. The suitability of different
    algorithms in predicting the evapotranspiration rates is depicted in Table 1.
    The data show that ELM-GA, ELM-CSA, ELM-ACO, and ELM PFA were ideal models for
    determining the evapotranspiration rates, since the R2 (coefficient of determination)
    values were close to unity. In addition, the relative mean, standard error, and
    mean of absolute value of errors (MAE) values were within the acceptable range
    [109]. The performance of ELM-GA/CSA/CSO/PFA raises questions on whether bio-inspired
    algorithms are better than traditional ones. Such concerns were informed by the
    study of Chahidi et al., which achieved comparable R2, RSME (Relative Standard
    Mean Error), and MAE values using ANN, SVM, and Gaussian process regression techniques
    [110]. Following the comparison of the validation and test performance, it was
    deduced that the choice of ANN/SVM, GPR vis-à-vis ELM-GA/CSA/CSO/PFA should consider
    other variables beyond R2, RSME, and MAE. The observations were justified by the
    model-specific training time and performance in the validation phase [110]. The
    selection of the appropriate algorithm is key to collecting reliable real-time
    data using sensors to help eliminate excessive waste of water, pesticides, and
    fertilizers. Table 1. Evapotranspiration data collected using ELM statistical
    methods and bio-inspired algorithms [109]. AI-based irrigation techniques offer
    additional benefits, including reduced risk of powdery mildew and Botrytis and
    fungal pathogen spores caused by excess humidity in greenhouses (due to inadequate
    regulation of water molecule condensation during sunrise and sunset and on cold,
    cloudy days) [111]. Proactive prevention of crop pests and disease directly impacts
    crop yields, considering powdery mildew and Botrytis limit chlorophyll formation
    through conidia and conidiophores on the leaf surfaces. Recent advances in AI
    technology for agricultural production facilitated autonomous monitoring of chlorophyll
    formation using the SPAD value, which is a proxy measure for wavelength absorbance
    [112]. However, the reliability of the measurements is contingent on the chloroplast
    movements and light intensity. Liu et al. [111] employed long short-term memory
    neural network systems to effectively manage powdery mildew in greenhouse structures.
    The findings reported by Liu et al. [111] were in line with the research of Abdulridha
    et al. [113] and other experimental studies, which supported using AI technology
    to prevent pests and diseases in greenhouses. In particular, Abdulridha et al.
    relied on UAV-based hyperspectral imaging and artificial intelligence to accurately
    diagnose the presence of powdery mildew [113] (see Figure 4). However, the case
    made by Abdulridha et al. [113] and Liu et al. [111] was not aligned with Pane
    et al. [114], who noted that machine learning techniques were equally effective
    in the management of powdery mildew. Figure 4. Hyperspectral imaging and artificial
    intelligence detection of powdery mildew in squash plant leaves. Images labeled
    (a–c) demonstrate different developmental stages of the powdery mildew disease
    in in-house leaves; (e,f) represent disease severity in outdoor squash plants.
    (a) Powdery mildew was not detected in the regions of interest. (b) Low severity
    of the powdery mildew disease (in-house photos). (c) High severity of the powdery
    mildew disease. (d) Powdery mildew was not detected in the regions of interest
    (outdoor plants). (e) Low severity of the powdery mildew disease (outdoor plants).
    (f) High severity of the powdery mildew disease (outdoor plants) [113]. The concerns
    raised by Abdulridha et al. [113], Liu et al. [111], and Pane et al. [114] about
    the reliability of the algorithms for powdery mildew diagnosis are but a microcosm
    of the limits of image detection techniques. Future R&D is anticipated to resolve
    these challenges. 2.4.1. Role of AI Technologies and Biological Pesticide Compounds
    in IPM The use of AI technologies in place of chemical products (including Prestop®,
    Microflora PROTM, and Active Flower™) and biological powdery mildew management
    techniques was validated by ecological and cost considerations [115] and the mixed
    benefits of bio-pesticide formulations (such as succinic acid and methanolic extract
    of Rosmarinus officinalis) [96]. The case for the biological control interventions
    by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96] was in line with the research of Arnaouty et al.
    [116], which affirmed that biological control agents were effective compared to
    the traditional chemical agents (including Radiant 12% SC, Kanemite 15% SC and
    Actra 25% WG) in the management of pests, including whitefly, Frankliniella occidentalis,
    and flower thrips [116]. In addition to the superior efficacy of the biological
    control agents, the sweet pepper plants exhibited superior yields (35% better)
    following treatment with the biological control agents. Despite the positive observations
    made by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96] and Arnaouty et al. [116], one must acknowledge
    that the effectiveness of the biological control agents is contingent on the seasons
    and the intensity of the pests and disease. The biological control agents might
    be less effective if there is a high intensity of pests and diseases. Other major
    issues of concern with biological control agents include the mixed performance
    of the biological control agents. Despite the reservations, the emphasis on biological
    rather than commercial IPM technicals by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96] and Arnaouty
    et al. [116] represents an emerging pattern in commercial agriculture, guided
    by the need to conserve the environment and reduce pesticide resistance—a phenomenon
    that is most common with commercial pesticides [75]. For example, studies conducted
    in the Russian Federation established that mites gradually became resistant to
    avermectin pesticides in the past 20 years [117]. The observations made by [117]
    in the Russian Federation were comparable to the research of Kirisik and Dagli’s
    [118] and Solmaz et al. [66] in Turkey, where farmers recorded higher Tetranychus
    Urtic resistance to Bifenazate and Abamectin. The observations made by Kirisik
    and Dagli [118] and Solmaz et al. [66] concerning the growing pesticide resistance
    in Turkey were affirmed by Alpkent et al. [119], who attributed the arrhenotokous
    reproduction and high fecundity of Tetranychus urticae populations in greenhouses
    to acaricide resistance. However, in the latter case, the pesticides were resistant
    to a wide range of pesticides, bifenthrin, and hexythiazox. From a globalist perspective,
    Tetranychus urticae resistance to pesticides would create a monumental challenge
    for Turkey and the larger EU. Acaricides purchases represented 14% of the pesticide
    expenditure in the continent [120]. Higher expenditure on acaricides denotes greater
    dependence, which has catastrophic effects on crop yields if widespread pesticide
    resistance is documented. Even though there was compelling evidence to catalyze
    the industry transition to biopesticides and intelligent IPM, the rate of biological
    agent adoption was inadequate [121]; this was despite favorable legislation and
    regulations, including Regulation (EC) No. 1107/2009 and 2016/2903 (RSP) [122].
    Current research does not provide clear-cut reasons why biological agents have
    not outpaced chemical control agents in the market. On the one hand, Liu et al.
    attributed the phenomenon to risk aversion among farmers coupled with an unfavorable
    marketing environment for biological pesticides in China [121]. On the other hand,
    the low adoption was linked to the variable effectiveness of the biological control
    agents relative to chemical pesticides, and the longer duration needed to secure
    financial returns following years of R&D investment [123]. The operational challenges
    highlighted by leading biological pesticide manufacturers supported this narrative.
    From another dimension, the limited uptake of biological pesticides could be linked
    to adopting a wide range of complementary interventions, including crop diversification
    and growing advocacy for pesticide-free agriculture [124,125]. Statistics compiled
    by the EU confirmed that farmers were assimilating pesticide-free agriculture
    policies; this was evident from the consistent reduction in the level of pesticide
    dependence—the most notable improvement was observed in the Czech Republic, where
    pesticide use reduced by 38% between 2011 and 2020. A similar downward trend was
    observed in Denmark, Portugal, and Romania, with each country recording a 20%
    drop in pesticide demand [120]. The pesticide use patterns documented by [120]
    were in agreement with Facchinetti et al. [80], who documented a marginal change
    in pesticide use from the 1990s to the late 2000s as a result of the stringent
    regulatory measures imposed by the EU, including Directive 2009/128/CE. A contrary
    trend was observed in Latvia and Austria, where pesticide demand increased by
    77% and 61%, respectively. In contrast to the statistics provided by Eurostat
    [120], Neumeister noted that EU farmers were locked into pesticide use [126],
    creating an eternal lose–lose situation for all stakeholders. The lose–lose situation
    was evident from the declining genetic diversity, impaired crop yields due to
    lower insect-assisted pollination, and the destruction of local ecosystems. The
    contrasting observations about pesticide use and the rates and barriers to biopesticide
    market entry affirm the complexity of phasing out chemical pesticides from the
    market. On a positive note, the scenario is forecasted to change with the gradual
    introduction of AI technologies in pest management. Karar et al. deployed cloud-based
    solutions and CNN networks to target red spider, flax budworm, cicadellidae, aphids,
    and flea beetles [14]. Early detection of pesticides using AI technologies would
    facilitate timely responses using AI and IoT infrastructure. The observations
    made by Karar et al. [14] were corroborated by Rustia et al., who integrated both
    AI and IoT systems in developing a new and intelligent system of IPM (see Figure
    5). The IPM system shown in Figure 5 shows the use of sensors and image data during
    the data collection phase, which are then stored in a database and processed within
    the same server, using analytics to provide useful outputs, such as hotspot detection
    and other models that can aid decision-making on the farm. The system was > 90%
    effective in managing thrips and whitefly [57]. In both cases, intelligent IPM
    techniques had the potential to reduce pesticide usage, resulting in significant
    cost savings. However, the short-term investment costs are a major impediment
    [121,123]. The observations made by [60,62] reflect the broader concerns about
    the future of Al in agriculture highlighted by Karnawat et al. [6]. However, in
    the latter case, the researchers argued the challenge might be addressed by developing
    affordable interventions in open-source platforms to ensure higher penetration
    among farmers. Figure 5. Key attributes of the intelligent IPM system [14]. The
    proponents of intelligent IPM coupled with biopesticides argue that there were
    immediate short-term benefits. For example, the crop yield was higher with intelligent
    and biological IPM compared to traditional chemical pesticides [116]. Moreover,
    the domino health benefits for humans and cost savings in commercial farming are
    unquantifiable. The latter evidence affirms there were justifiable grounds for
    the transition from traditional to intelligent IPM methods. The paradigm shift
    would benefit global agriculture, considering that pests and diseases accounted
    for up to 40% of global crop losses [14]. In contrast to the cost-related issues
    highlighted by Ni and Punja [115], continuous and excessive pesticide use has
    a detrimental impact on pest management, given the high risk of pesticide resistance.
    Pesticide resistance and incompatibility have partly led to the spread of the
    South American tomato pinworm Tuta absoluta [61] and mites. The current strains
    of the South American tomato pinworm can only be eradicated using strong and toxic
    pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos-methyl and Spinosad [61]. Even though pesticide
    toxicity and resistance risk can be mitigated with biopesticide formulations,
    adoption has remained low owing to their variable effectiveness across different
    classes of pests and diseases. For example, succinic acid and methanolic extract
    of Rosmarinus officinalis were only proven effective against Aphis gossypii in
    cucumber grown in greenhouses [96]. The lack of broad-spectrum biopesticides may
    partly explain why the demand for chemical pesticides remained unchanged; this
    phenomenon introduced new constraints, considering industrial greenhouses cannot
    be used in isolation. Glinushkin et al. proposed an alternative approach, focusing
    on less-potent chemical pesticides, such as Confidor Extra and Nocturne. On the
    downside, these pesticides were only effective against the phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus
    barkeri Hughes, and their efficacy was limited to approximately 25% [117]. According
    to the data in Table 2, the mortality rate for the mites was notably higher for
    avermectin pesticide (>93%) (see Table 2). The application of Confidor, Actellic,
    Scelta, and malathion did not yield mortality rates comparable to avermectin.
    The data suggested that pest mortality rates were proportional to the strength
    of the pesticides [117]. The estimates provided by [117] were comparable to experimental
    data drawn from Turkey [118,119]. Turkish farmers had recorded high levels of
    red spider mite (Tetranychus Urtica) resistance to Bifenazate and Abamectin (acaricides)
    [118,119]. Higher mite mortality rates (>90%) were observed with the adoption
    of aggressive pest management techniques, including mite-dipping and leaf dipping.
    The widespread pesticide resistance further validates the need for intelligent
    IPM systems. Table 2. Potency of different classes of pesticides against mites
    [117]. Drawing from the IPM management practices for Aphis gossypii and phytoseiid
    mite Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes reported by [96,117], farmers with commercial greenhouses
    were faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, law regulations advocated using less
    toxic pesticides [127]. However, ecologically benign biopesticides were not broad-acting.
    On the other hand, chemical pesticides with broad-spectrum activity against pests
    and diseases were toxic to the environment [117,121,122,124]. In light of the
    critical shortcomings of traditional pesticides in greenhouse agriculture, the
    proactive management of powdery mildew and Aphis gossypii, among other pests and
    diseases, using AI and other smart technologies might yield enormous benefits
    to farmers. Complementary techniques for disease detection are needed, considering
    that the research of Abdulridha et al. [113], Liu et al. [111], and Pane et al.
    [114] confirmed that AI-based disease detection systems had critical shortcomings.
    For example, the detection of powdery mildew was impacted by the UV wavelength,
    the camera properties, and the location of the infected leaves in relation to
    the non-infected leaves. The shortcomings of AI-based disease detection systems
    in greenhouse and open-field agriculture raise pertinent questions about sustainable
    IPM practices. Two theories were advanced in the literature. On the one hand,
    proponents of the current status quo supported the continued use of pesticides
    to manage aggressive pests and diseases, including Orius laevigatus, Nesidiocoris
    tenuis, Tuta absoluta, and Amblyseius swirskii [61]. However, persistent pesticide
    use increased the risk of crop pesticide resistance [61,113]. Moreover, the concentration
    of pesticides diminished over time, contributing to the resurgence in the population
    of Nesidiocoris tenuis (see Figure 6); this phenomenon informed the need for frequent
    pesticide applications. Figure 6. (A,C) show the average population of Nesidiocoris
    tenuis and Tuta absoluta per leaf inside a commercial greenhouse in 2016, and
    (B,D) show the average population of the same pests in 2017 after the pesticide
    was applied twice in 2016 [61]. On the other hand, the proponents of smart farming
    advocated using Al and IoT-based solutions in pest management. The high detection
    accuracy validated the case for AI in pest management. The UAV-based hyperspectral
    imaging and artificial intelligence system had 82% and 99% classification accuracy
    for the asymptomatic and late development of powdery mildew [113,127]. Asymptomatic
    detection was critical to the early management of crop diseases and the improvement
    of crop yields. In line with Abdulridha et al. [113], Pane et al. [114] demonstrated
    the utility of intelligent solutions in managing pests and diseases. Following
    delineating the cost-benefits of traditional pesticides versus smart farming solutions,
    the latter was encouraged despite the significant capital requirements in the
    short term. In light of the unique benefits and constraints of AI-based IPM techniques,
    complementary solutions were needed moving forward; this view was corroborated
    by Agarwal and Verma’s [128] assessment of pest behavior-modifying chemicals;
    genetic engineering and plant immunization; CRISPR-based genetic manipulation
    of pest populations; controlled introduction of predators, parasites, and diseases
    to reduce the population of plant pests and diseases; and microbial pesticides.
    Even though RNA interference and genome editing were supported by Agarwal and
    Verma [128], the gene editing of crops has not gained traction, and there is strong
    opposition from bioethicists [129]. The ethical concerns are valid, since CRISPR-based
    gene manipulation may trigger undesirable changes in the crop genome; these shortcomings
    validate the emphasis on AI in IPM. 2.4.2. Commercial Development of Robotic Systems
    for Smart Agriculture (Inhouse and Outdoors) In 2022, John Deere Company (one
    of the world’s leading farm machinery manufacturers) released fully autonomous
    tractors for precision agriculture featuring the next generation optical and electro-optical
    cameras. The cameras helped to detect obstacles and calculate distances in real
    time [130]. The utility of advanced computer vision systems in robotics was affirmed
    by Beloev et al. [131]. However, in the latter case, performance was augmented
    by the integration of image processing algorithms. The robotic system accurately
    distinguished tomatoes, leaves, and wood support structures (see Figure 7). Figure
    7. Object classification, localization, detection, and instance segmentation using
    image processing algorithms in agricultural robots [131]. Despite the milestones
    recorded in recent years, a major concern was the lack of consensus on the most
    effective method for robotic automation and mobility. Drawing from Beloev et al.
    [131] and John Deere [130], LIDAR and optical cameras yielded superior outcomes.
    However, not all scholars support the case for LIDAR and optical cameras. For
    example, Rahmadian and Widyartono [132] argued that satellite-differential GPS
    (geographic positioning systems) (S-DGPS) connected to a John Deere tractor (ground
    station) proved to be reliable and accurate in facilitating autonomous mobility.
    The John Deere-S-DGPS system had an accuracy of up to 2 cm from the target. In
    other cases, the robotic systems achieved an accuracy of less than a centimeter
    [132]. In contrast to other AI and ML systems, which recorded variable results
    under different environments and operating conditions, the G-DGPS had consistent
    accuracy in Israel, Georgia, and the US (California) [132]. The mixed observations
    of Rahmadian and Widyartono [132] and Beloev et al. [131] about the utility of
    GPS systems in agricultural robots show that contextual factors and technological
    improvements were important moderating factors. Additionally, one cannot disregard
    the legitimate concerns raised about robotic system accuracy. The issues raised
    by Zha [8] concerning the inconsistent accuracy of AI systems in smart greenhouses
    were in agreement with Aghelpour, Bahrami-Pichaghchi, and Kisi’s [133] research,
    which reported a low prediction accuracy for the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
    System (ANFIS) coupled with bio-inspired optimization algorithms. However, Aghelpour,
    Bahrami-Pichaghchi, and Kisi [133] and Zha [8] contradict Soheli et al. [134],
    who reported a >93.6% prediction accuracy using ANFIS and IoT. The higher accuracy
    reported by Soheli et al. [134] reinforces the perspectives of Howard et al. on
    achieving an optimal balance between scalability, computational speed, and accuracy
    of the AI systems. The inconsistencies in the accuracy of ANFIS-AI systems with
    bio-inspired algorithms can be partly linked to the distinct operational parameters
    and optimum operational conditions. The later claims aligned with the research
    of Salam et al. [135] on optimal target identification using multiple unmanned
    UAVs guided by bio-inspired algorithms to identify crop diseases. On a positive
    note, the lower prediction accuracy reported by Aghelpour et al. [133] and Zha
    [8] could be resolved using digital models based on model predictive control.
    Howard et al. confirmed that the MPC (model predictive control) digital models
    improved accuracy without compromising the computational speed [136]. On the downside,
    the positive assessment of MPCs by Howard et al. [136] negated the fact that the
    classical controller systems had critical shortcomings and accurate operations
    depended on the mathematical models’ accuracy [10]. In most cases, closed-loop
    control algorithms, such as MPC, may impose new constraints on manipulating variables
    and often on computational resources [10]. Despite the strain on computational
    resources, the continued use of MPC was validated by unique benefits and capabilities,
    including rolling optimization, which provided the operators with sufficient time
    to initiate inverse responses, address sensor failure, change the computing objectives,
    and address time delays between sensors. The MPC system could help streamline
    the performance and accuracy of the UAV systems, which are affected by light intensity,
    soil moisture, relative humidity, pH, and the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorous,
    and potassium [103,113,135]. The observations made by [103,113,135] concerning
    the regulation of the greenhouse microclimate were in agreement with the research
    of Jiang et al. [137] on the factors predicting the economic return and fruit
    quality of greenhouse-grown-table grapes in Northern China. Proper regulation
    of greenhouse parameters was a key prerequisite for higher table grape yields
    and profit margins. The observations reinforce current research on the benefits
    of greenhouse microclimate control. For example, the DynaLight system and dynamic
    climate control in InfoGrow improved the quality of greenhouse crops [136]. Similarly
    to [136], Afzali et al. [11] confirmed that predictive modeling for greenhouse
    light management could yield significant cost savings. In contrast to [136] and
    Afzali et al. [11], Bersani et al. noted that cost savings in predictive modeling
    were largely dependent on the choice of the algorithm and MPC [138]. The latter
    study preferred particle swarm algorithms. On the downside, the selection of bio-inspired
    algorithms may not suffice to offset the existing challenges. Even in cases where
    the dynamic climate control in InfoGrow was present, and it was challenging to
    mitigate the impact of local environmental conditions, the benefits associated
    with timely detection of powdery mildew and management of pests outweighed the
    drawbacks [13,103,111,113,135]. The variable test set accuracy (85–90%) of the
    Adam, RMSprop, Adamax, and Nadam optimizers depicted in Table 3 should not be
    perceived as a major impediment to the adoption of algorithms for smart farms
    [69]. The test accuracy can be improved in subsequent training of the algorithms.
    Moreover, new computational approaches have been employed to enhance the training
    and test set accuracy. Table 3. Relationship between optimizers, learning rates,
    the training set accuracy, and test set accuracy [111]. 3. Digital AI Models for
    Energy Management in Greenhouses 3.1. Energy Demand in Smart Greenhouses and Energy
    Optimization Algorithms The adoption of digital models (such as MATLAB/Simulink)
    to regulate the insulated and transparent greenhouse microclimate is an emerging
    area of research [139]. The materials for greenhouse structures, such as fiberglass,
    PVC, polycarbonate, and reinforced plastics, had a domino effect on energy use
    [140]. Intelligent greenhouse structures are energy-intensive—a factor that may
    impede commercial adoption of AI technologies [141,142]. The claims made by [77,78]
    concerning the energy-intensive nature of greenhouse cultivation were in tandem
    with Iddio et al., who noted that energy costs accounted for 25% of the greenhouse
    overhead costs [10]. Energy is needed to heat and cool greenhouse structures and
    regulate light, humidity, and soil moisture. The disproportionate use of energy
    in greenhouses relative to other sectors in the agricultural industry may explain
    why there was renewed interest in developing the next generation of AI-based energy-saving
    technologies to reduce energy expenditure and improve yields. Nguyen et al. documented
    various bio-inspired interventions for energy optimization in smart grids, smart
    homes, and the internet of energy [55]. The study suggested that swarm and evolutionary-based
    optimization algorithms were ideal for optimizing the use of traditional and renewable
    energy sources to achieve higher user comfort and energy demand aligned with the
    production capacity and grid demand. In contrast to Nguyen et al. [55], Zhang
    et al. [142] proposed an AI-based mode based on a particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) scheme. The latter reduced the cost of greenhouse energy through integrating
    photovoltaics and dynamic pricing (real-time and time-of-use). The algorithm enabled
    seamless communication between the external power grid (EPG) and the PV system.
    For example, the supply of power from the external power grid was only required
    when sunlight was low. If there was sufficient light and load, the EPG supply
    was disconnected. In real-life greenhouse operations, the proposals made by Nguyen
    et al. [55] and Zhang et al. [142] may be relevant or less relevant depending
    on the local operating conditions, energy sources, the scale of greenhouse agriculture,
    and specific circumstances; this is in line with Iddio et al. who recommended
    the use of evolutionary algorithms to address the shortcomings associated with
    proportional–Integral–derivative (PID) control of greenhouse structures. Traditionally,
    PID was preferred owing to its great performance, simplicity, and flexibility
    [10]. However, there were certain tradeoffs, including time-consuming computing
    and the inability to handle abrupt and external disturbances [10]. The case for
    the PID greenhouse control strategy advanced by [10] corroborates [20], who noted
    it was a low-cost alternative. However, there were alternative systems with comparable
    performance, including GA-based model predictive control systems. The PID-related
    shortcomings partly explain why AI bio-inspired algorithms, such as EA (Evolutionary
    Algorithm), were used to modify PID controllers in greenhouses. Similarly to Iddio
    et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [142], Jia et al. [143] confirmed that bio-inspired
    algorithms, particularly adaptive chaotic ACO algorithms, could achieve significant
    energy savings. However, the use of bio-inspired algorithms to reduce energy demand
    in isolation would not suffice, considering energy expenditure in greenhouses
    was a complex non-linear, multi-input and output process; this may explain why
    CFD (computational fluid dynamics) modeling coupled with mathematical transformations
    and systematization of greenhouse design parameters were appealing alternatives
    [144,145,146]. Rasakhodzhaev et al. employed mathematical models in the design
    of adjustable solar greenhouse structures with optimal height for better regulation
    of heating and cooling. In contrast to Zhang et al. [142] and Jia et al. [143],
    Chen et al. [144] employed computational fluid dynamics to regulate surplus air
    thermal energy in greenhouses. The data were employed in the operation of the
    fan-pad evaporative cooling system. Even though the latter system did not rely
    on bio-inspired algorithms, it demonstrated the effectiveness of modeling and
    simulations in regulating greenhouse cooling. In line with Chen et al. [144],
    Mirzamohammadi et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of mathematical simulations
    using the Monte Carlo model. However, the effectiveness of the modeling system
    was largely dependent on the level of uncertainty. The ACOA proposed by Jia et
    al. [143] regulated energy demand in smart sensor networks. However, it remained
    unclear whether the optimal performance of the bio-inspired algorithms in controlled
    environments would yield satisfactory performance in real-world scenarios. Such
    concerns were premised on the fact that the performance of the bio-inspired algorithm
    was influenced by the dynamic relationship between biological interactions and
    physical conditions (atmospheric, weather, soil, and humidity). The concerns raised
    by Jia et al. [143] were partly in agreement with the assessment by An et al.
    [147] of system optimization under non-deterministic weather conditions. The unpredictable
    weather patterns impaired the performance of sensors and actuators for heating,
    lighting, and CO2 dosing and the development of a climate and irrigation strategy.
    3.2. Alternative Energy Saving Measures—LoRa Transmission, PCOA-Lighting Management,
    PCMs, and LEDs Drawing from earlier case study data, the pilot experiments may
    not be practical for regions with diverse climatic conditions and unique energy
    requirements. The above concerns partly contributed to the diversification of
    AI approaches for energy management. In the meantime, the researcher posits that
    it would be prudent for smallholder farmers to make incremental changes for better
    energy management; these may include selecting connectivity technologies with
    lower energy requirements. For example, a comparison of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    ZigBee, mobile, and RFID technologies established the following. Leading connectivity
    technologies for AI systems with higher transmission ranges (20–100 m) had higher
    energy input requirements; Wi-Fi is a case in point. In contrast, LoRa had very
    low energy requirements and high transmission ranges (<30 km) [148]. The claims
    made by Bersani et al. [148] on the low energy requirements were in tandem with
    Placidi et al. [84], who noted that the system’s typology reduced the energy demand
    while enhancing data transmission over long distances. Beyond the selection of
    communication channels, Bersani et al. [138] reported 54% to 83% energy savings
    in incandescent and fluorescent lamps after incorporating a parallel particle
    swarm algorithm for optimal location of lighting. The case for LoRa networks in
    agriculture made by Bersani et al. [148] and Placidi et al. [84] aligned with
    the research of Chen et al. [149] on the market integration of LoRa technology
    in greenhouses. In one case, the LoRa transmission module was used to transfer
    data collected from sensors to the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer). In contrast
    to Chen et al. [149], Henningson [150] observed that the accuracy of the Raspberry
    Pi system was higher when paired with Canon camera systems to improve the resolution
    of the images detected. After integrating the two systems, each plant had a resolution
    of 0.006 pixels. On the downside, farm-based data show that high transmission
    ranges and low energy requirements of LoRa did not automatically translate to
    greater commercial adoption in relation to -Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and
    RFID. For example, Siskandar et al. [151] preferred fuzzy-guided RFID-based communication
    channels for smart greenhouses featuring DHT22/ DS18B20 sensors for temperature
    and humidity regulation. In contrast to Chen et al. [149], Bersani et al. [148],
    and Placidi et al. [84], Mu et al. [152] and Elsayed et al. [153] recommended
    alternative methods for managing energy resources, including the use of phase
    change materials for energy conservation and agricultural residue to generate
    biofuels and energy. However, the application of PCMs recommended by Mu et al.
    [152] represents but a tiny fraction of the potential applications in smart farming.
    For example, Kong et al. [154] noted that PCMs were appropriate materials for
    cold chain logistics [154]. However, not all scholars support the use of PCMs
    in greenhouses and related applications due to the high risk of leakage during
    the phase change process [155]. The researcher supports the use of PCMs, considering
    they can be coupled with solar systems for maximum energy saving. On the downside,
    incremental changes, such as selecting less energy-intensive communication systems,
    cannot suffice; they must be paired with other interventions, including the adoption
    of renewable energy systems in greenhouses [156,157]. Solar and geothermal energy
    are the most viable renewable energy systems [158]. Even though the transition
    to renewable energy was widely encouraged, the reliability of the energy source
    was not guaranteed, especially in regions with intermittent solar radiation [159].
    Even in regions where the supply of solar energy was guaranteed, mass utilization
    of renewable energy resources was a challenge, owing to the significant disconnect
    between the use of AI in the greenhouse and the deployment of AI in energy saving;
    this was a paradoxical phenomenon, considering smart greenhouses (featuring predictive
    light control systems) could reduce energy expenditure by 14–33.85% [11]. The
    improvements in lighting achieved by [11] were in tandem with [58], who documented
    a 19.4% cost saving following the introduction of a predictive control strategy
    and innovative greenhouse lighting system. The light prediction model is illustrated
    in Figure 8. Figure 8. Sunlight prediction models and lighting strategies for
    the predictive light control systems [11]. PPFD was measured with units of µmoL
    m−2 s−1. Following the comparison of the heuristic versus application-specific
    models, the former yielded accurate predictions with minimal variations from the
    baseline. Beyond the lower prediction accuracy, the case against the heuristic
    systems was further corroborated by the high cost of heuristic-based predictions
    compared to the prediction-based method (PBM). On average, the heuristic-based
    predictions cost $5.96/m2, while the PBM cost $0.73/m2 per day [11]. The notable
    disparities in the cost validate the PBM approaches. Proper energy management
    in greenhouse structures remained a priority, considering that the current rates
    of energy expenditure were unsustainable in the long term. For example, US-based
    greenhouse operators utilize $600 million worth of electricity per year [160].
    Regulating energy use using AI was a practical option, since small-scale and large
    commercial farms had to spend additional resources on IPM. On average, US farmers
    spend $1 billion on pesticides per year. Similarly, commercial farming in Europe
    was pesticide intensive—farmers utilized an estimated 346,000 tons of pesticides
    in 2020 alone [120]; nearly half of the expenses were on fungicides and bactericides.
    4. Barriers to Incorporating Artificial Intelligence Technology in Smart Greenhouses
    Current research on AI and IoT in agriculture advances distinct claims on the
    potential barriers to incorporating AI technology in smart greenhouses. One school
    of thought claimed that the inconsistent adoption of AI could be linked to the
    slow commercialization of R&D innovations, barriers to technology acceptance,
    and information asymmetry. This school of thought was corroborated by Zha [8]
    and Senavirathne et al. [13]. The second school of thought suggested that demographics
    were a major determinant. Research from Europe suggested that demographics directly
    affect progressiveness and technology adoption in agriculture [67,161]. Younger
    generations are more highly motivated to adopt new farming technologies than older
    generations. In contrast to the scenario observed by [67,161] in Europe, Asian
    studies highlighted the aging of the population as a barrier [162]. Drawing from
    the latter studies, each continent had unique barriers and drivers for precision
    technology adoption in greenhouses. The issues raised by Zha [8] and Senavirathne
    et al. [13] concerning the pace of technology adoption were discounted by emerging
    research on the immense benefits of augmented reality, such as the GRETA application
    in promoting technology adoption among hobby farmers, and those with limited knowledge
    about farming technologies, and even professional farmers using unique human-computer
    interactions [24]. The case for AR advanced by [24] corroborates Yaqot and Meneses’s
    study [163], which noted AR would help transform rural and novice farmers into
    experts while providing agronomists with a real-time and holistic view of farm
    and crop health. The benefits afforded by AR-based systems such as GRETA suggest
    that poor understanding of technology should not be an impediment to the automation
    of greenhouse operations. The low pace of AI technology adoption in the global
    agricultural sector has remained unresolved. For example, the first AI-powered
    system for agriculture was the GOSSYM cotton crop simulation model developed in
    1985 to regulate water and fertilizer application, weed control, and local climate
    for better cotton yields [8]. The GOSSYM model was key to developing the Artificial
    Intelligence Automated Greenhouse System (AIAGS), processing systems, and web
    applications [13]. On the downside, there was limited R&D in the subsequent years
    to build on the GOSSYM model. In 1996, researchers developed an autonomous AURORA
    greenhouse robot to replace manual labor. The historical slow adoption of precision
    farming technologies documented by [8,13] was in line with Maloku’s appraisal
    of precision farming technology integration in the US and EU [71]. Until the late
    2000s, only 22% of the farmers had integrated precision farming technologies in
    the West [71]. On a positive note, there was a notable improvement in the pace
    of technology adoption post-2013. In the past two years, researchers have developed
    multi-application AI systems for intelligent IPM [15,86,128], seeding and harvesting,
    and weed recognition [104,105], and digital twins for autonomous greenhouse operation
    using traditional sensor data, IoT, big data analytics, and AI [136]. However,
    the pace of R&D innovations does not match commercial adoption—the digital twin-based
    GHI4.0 project in the Danish horticultural industry was in the pilot phase. On
    a positive note, 80% of Danish farmers attempted to integrate precision farming
    technologies in the production of maize and barley crops [71]. Presently, it is
    challenging to determine the cost-benefits of technological innovation and underlying
    motives for the transition to AI in agriculture [18]. For example, even though
    digital twins offer immense potential to balance accuracy, accuracy, and computational
    speeds in agriculture, there are limited data on their applications. Howard et
    al. noted that “state-of-the-art for DTs is limited to specific sub-processes
    modeled with highly specialized models” [136] (p. 7). Further experimental data
    on the cost-benefits of digital twins was needed before deploying the systems
    in greenhouses to simulate and optimize production. The issues relating to digital
    twins are but a microcosm of the broader gaps in the body of knowledge, which
    does not sufficiently delineate the impacts of AI and IT in agriculture. Drawing
    from experimental data compiled by researchers in Europe, North America, and Asia
    [86,90,104,105,108], there were region-specific barriers and enablers for AI integration
    in agriculture depending on the pace of knowledge and technology transfer. The
    intermittent integration of R&D innovations could be due to the higher costs,
    knowledge and resource gaps between advanced and developing countries, the inability
    to entirely replace human labor on farms with robots, and variations between the
    simulated and actual outcomes in the field/smart greenhouses [8]. The criticism
    of AI systems in smart greenhouses and farms by [8] was corroborated by Beloev
    et al. [131], who claimed that mechanical robots were unreliable because they
    relied on satellite triangulation to guide movement—this technology was less reliable
    compared to LIDAR and camera sensor innovations. On a positive note, the constraints
    associated with satellite triangulation have been addressed using light imaging,
    detection, and ranging (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras [131]. The
    advances highlighted by [131] were consistent with [162], which noted that algorithm
    systems had led to the development of advanced sensor systems, including fusion
    algorithms that facilitated the separation of colors into the hue, saturation,
    and value formats. However, the case for electro-optical cameras made by [131,162]
    was not in line with the research of Saddik et al. on latency issues in an image
    collection using multispectral cameras [164]. The latter concerns reinforced the
    case for LIDAR systems in agricultural robots [162]. The technology milestones
    in robotics shaped industry trends in the adoption of robotics for harvesting
    and greenhouse management. 4.1. Training and Test Accuracy of AI Systems in Smart
    Greenhouses and Precision Agriculture The inclusion of different computational
    methods to attain higher accuracy rates was confirmed by Siskandar et al. in their
    assessment of the fuzzy logic system’s accuracy (~95%) in smart greenhouses (see
    Table 3) [151]. Even though the observations of Siskandar et al. were specific
    to the long short-term memory neural network for predicting the occurrence and
    development of powdery mildew in greenhouse cucumber plants, they were relevant
    to other AI systems for greenhouses. On the downside, these claims contrast with
    Lakshmi and Corbett [15], who argued the current barriers to technology adoption
    must be resolved. Traditionally, it was challenging for Al systems to reconcile
    the images and measurements taken under controlled conditions with those in the
    field due to variations in the background complexity, imaging angle, and interferences
    in the natural environment. The constraints have been partly resolved with bio-inspired
    algorithms customized for fault prediction, image recognition, and pest identification
    [165,166]. The use of AI to prevent root rot diseases and fusarium wilt among
    cucumber plants in greenhouses was a case in point [167]. The broad application
    of IoT, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture
    can be partly linked to technological advances in computing. 4.2. Impact of Demographics
    and Socioeconomic Factors on AI Technology Adoption in Agriculture The shortage
    of young, progressive EU farmers raises legitimate concerns regarding the actualization
    of Eurozone agricultural innovation policies, and by extension, the ability to
    sustain higher food demands [67]. The issues raised in the European Economic and
    Social Committee’s report [67] were partly in line with Mohr and Kühl’s research
    in Germany, where age predicted technology adoption [161]. For example, smartphone
    use and access decreased with age among the German farmers sampled. Similarly
    to Mohr and Kühl [161], Maloku [71] noted that less educated and older farmers
    were less inclined to adopt precision farming technologies. However, the observations
    by Mohr and Kühl [161] concerning the rate of technology acceptance in agriculture
    were not aligned with the European Economic and Social Committee’s report [67].
    Most of the sampled German farmers were young (mean age = 33 years), and there
    was more than an 80% assimilation of smart farming technologies among old and
    young farmers. The contrasting observations from Mohr and Kühl and the European
    Economic and Social Committee’s report raise fundamental questions on whether
    demographics were a barrier to adopting AI on smart farms across Europe and the
    world. In contrast to the European Economic and Social Committee’s report [67]
    and Mohr and Kühl [161], Maloku [71] claimed multiple externalities aided and
    impeded smart farming technology adoption; these variables included farm size,
    financial status, technology factors, information resources, social, economic
    issues (age, experience, and education), and farm size. The latter argument provides
    a more representative picture of the dynamics that led to higher or lower technology
    adoption that is more applicable to developing and developed countries in the
    North and the South [137]. Further research on the role of demographics, farm
    size, financial status, technology factors, and information resources was necessary,
    considering achieving and sustaining exponential growth in AI technology adoption
    in agriculture is a prerequisite for tangible global impact on crop yields, pest
    and disease management, and optimization of agricultural resources [168]. Despite
    the overwhelming evidence in support of AI, particularly robotics in harvesting,
    critics argue that AI cannot entirely “replace/replicate humans. Machines do not
    have the multi-perspective skills of humans, as they are typically programmed
    to perform specific tasks in constrained conditions” [69] (p. 9). The issues raised
    by [69] do not consider recent milestones with bio-inspired algorithms that improved
    the precision and reliability of AI and ML infrastructure in agriculture [169].
    The use of bio-inspired hybrid algorithms for weed optimization was a case in
    point [14,105,135]. The role of AI algorithms highlighted by [14,105,135] was
    corroborated by Beloev et al. [131], who used image processing algorithms to improve
    the ground-based accuracy of a robotic system. The selection of advanced algorithms,
    including Hierarchy/Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer
    (GWO), Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Direct Artificial Bee Colony (DABC), and Hybrid
    Genetic Algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO) among others involves
    a tradeoff between computational speed, path planning, fitness, root means squared,
    and mean absolute errors [85]. For example, the ANN algorithm had lower MAE and
    RSME values compared to the GEP testing and training evolutionary algorithm (see
    Table 4). However, the ANN required higher computational resources [14,170]. On
    a positive note, the technical constraints were short-term and should not be considered
    a critical impediment to the adoption of AI systems. Table 4. Gene expression
    programming (GEP), ANN RSME, and MAE [85]. Beyond the technically related barriers
    to the widespread adoption of AI systems in smart farming, there were emerging
    concerns about the impact of farmer demographics on the adoption of AI systems.
    For example, the aging of the farmers was a major issue in Europe [67,161]. In
    light of the observations made by critics and proponents of AI in smart greenhouses
    and precision agriculture, the following fundamental issues emerge. First, AI
    technology critics negate smart agriculture’s immense contribution to farming.
    Second, the proponents of AI technology disregard the enormous capital requirements
    and the barriers to technology transfer in developing countries. On a positive
    note, there were successful cases in the developing countries in the global south.
    For example, Ethiopian scientists had developed an ERNN system to monitor humidity
    and temperature variations in greenhouse structures; the system had additional
    capabilities for wind velocity and carbon dioxide concentration measurement [170].
    Proper temperature regulation and monitoring were necessary, considering a majority
    of the greenhouse crops; tomatoes were particularly susceptible to temperature
    variations [171]; the effect of chilling stress on greenhouse tomatoes in China
    was a case in point [171]. In practice, incorporating artificial intelligence
    technology in smart greenhouses should be supported by prior data on actual farm
    applications and short and long-term benefits vis-à-vis the costs and potentially
    detrimental environmental impacts. The dynamic natural and physical conditions
    (including atmospheric, weather, soil, and humidity) and biological interactions
    between plants, pests, and diseases in greenhouses and open-field agriculture
    increase the complexity of the decision-making processes [6,15,57]. The sophisticated
    relationship between these variables would predict the utility of AI in agriculture
    and agricultural sustainability. On a positive note, emerging research on bio-inspired
    algorithms and selected applications of AI systems in agriculture confirmed that
    the benefits outweighed the risks [14,108,121]. Moreover, the ongoing R&D projects
    would resolve most of the shortcomings. 4.3. Sensor Signal Failure and Communication
    Barriers The growing advocacy for the integration of AI in precision agriculture
    negates the technology-related challenges to commercial adoption. Singh et al.
    established that interferences often compromised communication between sensor
    nodes. There were multiple sources of interferences for sensor signal transfer
    in greenhouses, including crop canopy, soil, and temperature [87,164]. Similarly
    to Singh et al. [87], Shamshiri et al. [78] observed that the accuracy of the
    soil moisture sensors was notably low in regions with high vegetative diversity.
    Sensor accuracy was impaired by different hydrological properties and geography,
    especially in real-world conditions dissimilar to the training datasets. On a
    positive note, most of the constraints identified by Singh et al. [87] and Shamshiri
    et al. [78] have been addressed using AI technologies. In particular, Vanegas-Ayala
    et al. demonstrated the importance of fuzzy clustering techniques in the humidity
    prediction modules. The fuzzy logic controllers enabled the AI systems to model
    and predict the behavior of key greenhouse parameters. The system was appealing
    to the farmers because it was inexpensive and easy to use. A major concern was
    that these issues were often disregarded in research in favor of the mass transition
    to an intelligent greenhouse system. The risk of impaired transmission identified
    by Singh et al. [87] may be resolved using the hardware configuration proposed
    by Serale et al. [58]. The configuration featured Siap+Micros t055 pyranometers
    and Apogee SQ-515 Quantum sensors with a 1.2 mV sensitivity of 1.2mV. The configuration
    proposed by Serale et al. [58] bears semblance to Afzali et al., who deployed
    Apogee instruments to measure the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) over
    the plant canopy in a greenhouse structure [14]. The observations made by Serale
    et al. [58] and Afzali et al. [11] do not take into account the variable accuracy
    of the Apogee solar radiation sensors. According to Zamora-Izquierdo et al., the
    Apogee sensors had a mean accuracy of ±5% [172]. The accuracy of the sensor systems
    could be enhanced using the Remote Sensing Assisted Control System (RSCS), which
    offered multidimensional benefits, including the measurement of CO2 emissions,
    soil moisture, irrigation control, and agricultural production capacities. New
    experimental data have confirmed that using plastic mulches with sustainable remote
    sensing and AI technology systems is practical. In particular, Jim et al. [173]
    reported the successful use of Landsat-5 thematic mapper and hyperspectral airborne
    sensors to map plastic mulched farmlands and plastic-covered greenhouses. The
    data were, in turn, employed to identify regions where plastic mulches can be
    gradually replaced with biodegradable alternatives. The claims made by Jim et
    al. [173] concerning the role of technology in mapping plastic mulches were in
    tandem with Hasituya et al., who deployed remote-sensing aperture radar systems
    to map plastic mulches [174]. 5. Future Perspectives The critical review of the
    current body of knowledge supporting the integration of AI systems in agriculture
    yielded new insights and perspectives on how best to enhance the efficiency of
    smart greenhouses. However, certain issues should be addressed in upcoming studies.
    For example, the current body of knowledge did not establish a consensus on whether
    automated agricultural machinery manufacturers and commercial farms should transition
    from satellite triangulation to light imaging, detection and ranging (LIDAR),
    optical and electro-optical cameras [131], or Satellite-Differential GPS (S-DGPS).
    The mixed observations by Beloev et al. [131], John Deere [130], and Rahmadian
    and Widyartono [132] warrant further research inquiry considering there were different
    technical requirements for open space and indoor (greenhouse) robotic systems.
    Future research on LIDAR and optical camera systems for open space and greenhouse
    robotic tractors would provide better insights into the cost-benefits of available
    technologies to guide commercial adoption. Empirical and farm-based data are important,
    considering John Deere and other companies were commercializing new autonomous
    tractor models fitted with optical cameras [130,132]. Moreover, there was a growing
    acceptance of soft robotic systems for fruit and vegetable harvesting and pesticide
    application. Beyond systems for robotic structures, current data on the suitability
    of different variants of bio-inspired algorithms (swarm intelligence, genetic
    and evolutionary) for pesticide application, and robotic harvesting, automated
    regulation of irrigation, soil treatment, fertilizer application, and seeding
    are specific to the Global North [105,135]. Future research should explore the
    suitability of bio-inspired algorithms to support the automation of greenhouses
    in developing countries. Isolated case studies of milestones in developing countries
    support the recommendation. For example, ERNN systems augmented temperature and
    humidity measurements in Ethiopia’s greenhouses [170]. However, there were gaps
    in the knowledge, which may impede decision-making among stakeholders in the future.
    Future research should investigate whether the LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    mobile, or RFID communication technologies were best suited for specific bio-inspired
    algorithms and the influence of local conditions and variables on performance
    and accuracy. At present, researchers are focusing on different algorithms to
    refine algorithm performance. For example, most studies focused on solar radiation
    intensity, transpiration, and CO2 concentration to predict crop yields, even though
    the approach yielded inaccurate results [18]. The standardization of input variables
    would improve accuracy and performance. Upcoming studies should help establish
    whether intelligent IPM was a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical
    pesticides and biopesticides, considering pesticide resistance and the need to
    adopt sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, there is a growing demand
    for technological solutions to address climate change and global food insecurity,
    which urges the integration of AI technologies like light imaging, detection and
    ranging 1128 (LIDAR), optical and electro-optical cameras [131] or satellite-differential
    GPS (S-DGPS). Apart from the technological aspect, there is also a need to develop
    agricultural production policies that favor the funding of these technologies
    and their integration to agricultural production. Such policies can include setting
    aside grant funds for institutions and companies involved in their development.
    Such policies should also include solving the cost barriers that have consistently
    been highlighted in previous research. Most studies have also demonstrated the
    potential application of AI in large scale agricultural production. Policy incentives
    to facilitate their integration in small-scale farming may also encourage younger
    populations to participate in agricultural production, because most farmers today
    in Europe and North America are older. If the problem is not addressed in a timely
    manner using potential technological solutions, the issues of food insecurity
    are likely to worsen in the future. 6. Conclusions The findings drawn from this
    research had practical consequences for commercial agriculture, considering a
    large body of knowledge focused on applying AI and IoT in traditional applications,
    and the emphasis on the benefits of the technology negated critical concerns about
    energy demand, sensor failure, accuracy, and long-term use. The findings broadened
    current knowledge on the cost benefits of sensors, robotic systems, algorithms,
    renewable energy systems for greenhouses, and support infrastructure. For example,
    users of soil and humidity sensors paired with fuzzy clustering techniques in
    the humidity prediction modules should be conscious of the fact that the accuracy
    of the measurements may be impaired by corrosion or hardware malfunction. Additionally,
    the new generation of new agricultural robotic systems largely depends on replacing
    GPS systems with LIDAR and optical camera systems, given the former exhibited
    poor object recognition. The performance of LIDAR systems was enhanced with image
    processing algorithms. The commercial readiness of AI technologies was demonstrated
    by John Deere company, Blue River Technology, Autonomous Tractor Corp, and other
    companies that had developed intelligence systems for monitoring crop and soil
    health, weed control, and self-driving agricultural tractors. Despite the commendable
    milestones achieved so far, there were multiple barriers to the use of the technology.
    The barriers included the cost of AI technology, variable performance of the algorithm
    in real-world conditions vis-à-vis training, the financial status of the farmers,
    lack of information resources, aging, and lack of prior experience with technology.
    Despite the shortcomings, adopting AI systems should be encouraged, given they
    improved crop yields, water use, and fertilizer use efficiency, and reduced the
    effects of pesticide resistance through intelligent IPM. Moreover, bio-inspired
    algorithms improved energy management by integrating photovoltaics and dynamic
    pricing and autonomous communication between the greenhouse system and EPG supply.
    The emerging climate change risks further reinforce the case for smart greenhouses
    powered by AI systems. In summary, most AI applications in agricultural production
    are in the development phase because they have not fully matured for commercialization
    purposes. The few AI solutions that have so far reached maturity and have been
    rolled out for commercial use despite challenges (e.g., accuracy) include the
    use of drones, sensors, and robots for harvesting crop yields. Although these
    technologies have been applied commercially, the challenge of accuracy and sustainability
    persists. For example, underground sensor hardware can be damaged by moisture
    and other unpredictable environmental conditions, leading to inaccurate data,
    which can easily mislead decisions in commercial farms, leading to huge losses.
    Therefore, although they have reached the commercial maturity, they still need
    further development to optimize their effectiveness in solving the identified
    problems and challenges. Furthermore, considering that many studies are currently
    being undertaken on this topic, it is also imperative to perform a similar mapping
    of the literature every three years to determine the current state of the art
    from time to time, because technological advancements are fast and imminent. Finally,
    more research is needed on overcoming the challenges of integrating AI applications
    into farm input in the Global South, which must include solving the cost barriers
    and knowledge and skills gaps. Funding This research received no external funding.

    communication 1. Introduction Crops are essential for human life because they
    provide food, animal feed, fuel, and raw materials for clothing and shelter. Crop
    yield has to be doubled in 2050 compared to 2009 in order to meet the demand of
    a growing population while increasing the food quality and reducing production
    inputs (Fukase and Martin, 2020). Potential solutions to enhance global food security
    include closing crop yield gaps, reducing food waste, changing dietary habits,
    and reducing inefficiencies in resource use (Foley et al., 2011). Reducing inefficiencies
    in input resources (such as water and nitrogen) can be achieved by continuously
    monitoring crops, soil, and microclimate, and then properly controlling inputs
    without sacrificing the yield and quality of the crop. Internet of Things (IoT)
    becomes a key technology that enables continuous monitoring and control in this
    scenario. The ability to generate (near) real-time quantitative data with high
    spatiotemporal resolution is a major advantage of IoT systems (Liao et al., 2017).
    IoTs are considered big data systems due to volumes, velocities, and varieties
    of data they generate. These data are mined and modeled to elucidate the relationships
    between inputs and outputs (Tsai et al., 2014). Correlation, trend analysis, classification,
    and numerical prediction are implemented on the data to reach meaningful control
    decisions. Compared with the conventional wireless sensor networks, the holistic
    approach of IoT technology allows users to incorporate data analytics on the big
    data collected by IoT sensor devices. Generally, connected actuators are enabled
    to control the inputs to achieve desired application rates. For example, an internet-connected
    soil water content (SWC) sensor network measures the plant water deficit and uploads
    data to a cloud-based data analysis platform. The analysis will find the trend
    of soil water deficit to determine the best time and quantity to apply irrigation
    water. There has been a boom in IoT application development in agriculture (Ag-IoT)
    in the last two decades, particularly around crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.
    However, the application of Ag-IoT at the commercial scale is still at its early
    stages. A deeper and more holistic understanding of the existing IoT system development
    is important for various stakeholders to sketch the future landscape of Ag-IoT.
    Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the key components of
    Ag-IoT including sensors, actuators, data processing, and data transmission, summarize
    its usage in crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring, and identify the research
    needs for successful IoT implementation in the future. Though Ag-IoT is proliferating
    in both crop and animal monitoring and management, Ag-IoT for crop production
    is the focus of this paper. IoT platforms for livestock production, as well as
    other sectors of agriculture (such as postharvest) are not included. IoT can be
    found in the manufacturing industry, consumers products, retail, finance and marketing,
    healthcare, transportation and logistics, smart city, military applications and
    supply chains (Islam et al., 2022). Fig. 1 shows the three main layers of a generic
    IoT architecture: the perception layer, network layer, and application layer (Jabraeil
    Jamali et al., 2020). The perception layer consists of gateways, mobile devices,
    sensors, actuators, power, and energy storage components. Activities in the perception
    layer include sensing, controlling, actuation, energy harvesting, energy storage,
    data transmission, and power management. The perception layer of the Ag-IoT faces
    challenges including harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneity of the applications,
    nonavailability of communication infrastructure, and lack of continuous power
    supplies, to just mention a few. This review therefore emphasizes the perception
    layer of Ag-IoT. The network layer consists of network devices and data transmission
    and processing functions. The application layer is responsible for user-specific
    applications such as data visualization, actuator control dashboards, as well
    as data storage, analysis, and decision making. This three-layer architecture
    of IoT can be expanded to five layers by including transport layer after network
    layer and adding business layer after the application layer (Banu, 2018). The
    transport layer is responsible for data transmission while the business layer
    manages the whole IoT system according to the user''s business model. Download

    Three- and five-layer architectures of generic IoT systems. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The method of the literature review is presented in Section
    two. Section three details the major elements of Ag-IoT technology. Section four
    describes the challenges that Ag-IoT systems face with emerging solutions. In
    Section five, supporting technologies for Ag-IoT are discussed. How the information
    from Ag-IoT can benefit farm systems analysis and management is discussed in Section
    six. The final section concludes the review article with future research directions.
    2. Review methodology We have come up with a list of eleven research questions
    to guide the literature review and analysis in Ag-IoT. These questions, along
    with the motivation to ask these questions and our initial hypotheses, are listed

    Ag-IoT systems are more popular with perennial crops To find the answers to questions
    in Table 1, a thorough literature review was conducted. The main approach was
    to find the answers based on the recent research carried out in the field of Ag-IoT.
    We have searched for the recent Ag-IoT research published in scientific journals
    and conference proceedings between 2011 and 2021, using keywords through Google
    Scholar and Scopus web search. Keywords used in the search were Internet of Things,
    IoT, Crop Monitoring, Wireless Sensor Network, Smart Agriculture, and Crop Sensing.
    This search resulted in 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings
    papers. After reading the abstracts, 115 papers were determined to be relevant
    to the topic of Ag-IoT. The selected articles are listed in the Appendix, and
    they were used for in-depth analysis. Research papers selected covered countries
    in all six continents (except for Antarctica, Fig. 2a). Asia presented the largest
    number of papers (Scotford and Miller, 2004), whereas Australia had the smallest
    number of papers. In terms of countries, India (Coleman et al., 2022) and China
    (Chen et al., 2014) had the highest numbers of research outcomes. Fig. 2b presented
    the yearly distribution of the research papers. The number of research papers
    published related to the topic increased over time, with the highest in 2019.
    Demographics of the collected data set provided the answer to question 1 in Table
    1, that Ag-IoT has received global attention. More Ag-IoT research has been completed
    in countries with smallholder farmers such as India and China. The selected papers
    were read carefully and analyzed for the technical specification of the IoT systems,
    including the sensors and actuators in each study, communication technologies
    used, environment the system implemented, and the IoT service provider used. Download

    In Section 3, we have thoroughly reviewed the major components of Ag-IoT. To conduct
    this review systematically, we have divided this section into multiple subsections.
    These subsections are sensors, IoT platforms/main control board, wireless communication
    technology, IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and energy management, and actuators.
    3.1. Sensors Sensors play a major role in Ag-IoT systems because they serve as
    the converter between real-world signals and their digital representations. This
    section begins with an introduction and categorization of sensors used to measure
    crop, soil, and microclimate parameters. General purpose sensors such as temperature
    sensor, light intensity sensor, accelerometers, soil moisture sensor, etc., can
    be integrated into Ag-IoT systems (White, 1987). Table 2 gives sensor categories
    along with sensor measurands and provides some examples found in the literature.

    et al., 2017) Proper selection of sensors to an application is essential for IoT
    systems developers as well as for users to best use the sensors. The advancement
    of sensor technologies has a major impact on the popularity of IoT. Low energy
    consumption, compatibility in data transmission between the microcontroller and
    the sensor, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and robustness are major considerations
    to select a sensor for IoT system development. To address research question 2
    in Table 1, we marked and counted the sensors in the 115 research papers reviewed,
    with the total count of each sensor given in Fig. 3. Soil moisture sensors were
    used for the largest number of applications (Ivanova et al., 2016) followed by
    humidity sensors (Hurst et al., 2021) and then air temperature sensors (Haque
    et al., 2021). The reason these sensors were integrated most in Ag-IoT so far
    is likely because of the need for continuous in-situ soil moisture monitoring
    for decision making in irrigated agricultural production. Water scarcity is a
    global issue, and the amount of arable land can be expanded significantly if growers
    can apply water efficiently (Aroca et al., 2018). On the contrary, soil water
    tension measured via soil water potential sensors only appeared in three papers.
    This lower interest in soil water potential sensors is likely due to (1) less
    understanding of the relationship between soil water tension and crop growth,
    (2) less availability of low-cost soil water potential sensors, and (3) the difficulty
    in interfacing the available soil water potential sensors to the IoT platforms.
    Next, we will discuss the Ag-IoT sensors found in the literature according to
    the measurand category it belongs to. Download : Download high-res image (192KB)

    measurement sensors and microphones are the most common acoustic property measuring
    sensors. Direct use of acoustic measurements is limited in Ag-IoT. Hardwood borer
    identification IoT sensor network is a direct application of microphone used in
    pest detection in forestry (Potamitis et al., 2019). Ultrasonic wind speed and
    direction sensor is an important meteorological sensor used in agriculture to
    estimate evapotranspiration (Kameoka et al., 2017). Compared with the mechanical
    anemometer, an ultrasonic anemometer requires less maintenance due to fewer mechanical
    parts involved. Furthermore, an ultrasonic anemometer can capture sudden changes
    in wind speed and direction very accurately. Acoustic sensors were used indirectly
    to measure biological measurands. Crop canopy height estimation by ultrasound
    sensor is an indirect approach to measure biological parameters (Yuan et al.,
    2018; Elci et al., 2018). IoT-enabled ultrasound distance sensors are widely used
    in irrigation systems to estimate the water volume in tanks, wells and reservoirs,
    and it is an essential sensor for irrigation scheduling in automated irrigation
    systems. Recently ultrasound flow meters replaced the mechanical flow meters due
    to their high accuracy in flow rate measurement with less maintenance. Underwater
    ultrasound scanning is possible for aquatic plant growth monitoring purposes such
    as lotas and seaweed and has a huge potential to determine the harvest stage and
    growth rate monitoring (Kool and Bernard, 2019). Fruit ripeness estimation is
    an interesting example of the indirect use of acoustics in agriculture. Daosawang
    et al. (2020) demonstrated that watermelon ripeness could be estimated by a sound
    generator and receiver. In summary, acoustic sensors advanced in recent years
    while replacing some traditional mechanical Ag-sensors and introducing new applications
    in agriculture. 3.1.2. Biological sensors Above-ground biomass of plant, plant
    height, plant density, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI), count of plant organs
    (leaf, fruit, flower), chlorophyll concentration, sap flow, and stomata conductance
    are useful biological parameters in crop monitoring. Crop yield and the growth
    stage can be estimated from the plant''s mass (biomass). Loadcells are used in
    indoor farming pots to measure the plant weight directly (Long and McCallum, 2015).
    Almost all the field crop biomass estimations have been measured by indirect sensing
    techniques such as biomass-sensitive vegetation indices (VI) or by image processing-based
    techniques. However, both techniques require time-consuming ground truth data
    collection for model calibration. The accuracy of these techniques is subject
    to lighting conditions, sensor type, crop type, model parameters, and training
    data set. Just like crop biomass, many other biological measurands are also estimated
    indirectly. For example, stomata conductance can be quantified through optical
    measurands, and plant height through acoustic sensors. Therefore, most of the
    biological measurands will be discussed as indirect applications under other measurands.
    3.1.3. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors can be categorized into two main types:
    photochemical and electrochemical. Photochemical sensors measure chemical reactions
    or chemicals by their spectral signature, and electrochemical sensors measure
    the electrical properties due to chemical reactions or the presence of chemicals
    (Angkawinitwong and Williams, 2021). Soil pH, soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen
    (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), pH and conductivity of irrigation water,
    and photosynthesis are the parameters that often measured by chemical sensors.
    Knowing the pH of water and soil is important because pH affects the solubility
    of nutrients and therefore plant nutrient uptake and growth. Soil and irrigation
    water pH measurements with IoT-enabled sensors were demonstrated in the literature
    in nine studies. Spatial variability and the dependency of sensor accuracy on
    soil condition are the issues to address to promote them in agriculture (Chen
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). The soil salinity sensor and custom-made nitrate
    sensor were counted only once, which highlighted the difficulty of measuring soil
    chemical properties continuously and in a non-destructive manner. The measurement
    of the real-time nutrient content in the soil, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K) are essential for fertigation. These sensors are still
    at the rudimentary stage (Burton et al., 2018) of development. Real-time soil
    nutrient sensing has a huge potential in future agriculture as nutrient leaching
    and groundwater pollution are serious issues people are facing now. Nitrate sensors
    can be fixed to groundwater pumps to monitor the nitrate status of groundwater,
    or installed in leaching water collectors in fields to get reasonable estimation
    about nitrate leaching (Hooper et al., 2019). Soil salinity can be derived from
    the soil''s electrical conductivity (EC), and it was demonstrated three times
    in the literature. This is a very important parameter to measure as soil salinity
    is one of the main soil degrading factors in irrigated agriculture. None of the
    research in the literature highlighted the importance of using EC sensors in soil
    or irrigation systems to ameliorate the soil salinity build-up due to irrigation.
    CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases attributed to climate change and agriculture
    is considered a major source of their emission. Accounting for the sourcing and
    sinking of CO2 and CH4 from soil and crops is important to understand the budget
    of greenhouse gases in agriculture. Research suggested that elevation of CO2 can
    increase crop yield as well as improve water use efficiency (Hatfield et al.,
    2011). Therefore, it is essential to measure CO2 and CH4. There are two types
    of gas sensors available. Metal oxide gas sensors increase the electric resistance
    of the sensor when it contacts certain gas. Optical gas sensors measure the absorption
    spectra to detect spectral signatures unique to the gas. O2 sensors can be used
    to monitor the crop respiration rate. Electrochemical sensors can be used to estimate
    dissolved oxygen as the increased dissolved oxygen in water can improve the quality
    and the yield of the aquatic plants (Shi et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). Another
    interesting parameter to measure is stomatal conductance. Plant stomatal openings
    regulate the exchange of water vapor and CO2 between a leaf and the surrounding
    atmosphere. So far, no IoT-enabled sensor has been developed to measure this parameter
    even though handheld sensors are available (Lamour et al., 2022). Chemical sensors
    can be used to monitor the quality of fruits during harvesting. As an example,
    IoT-enabled Ethelene gas sensors have a huge potential to use in fruit production
    to identify the best time to initiate harvesting (Esser et al., 2012). Although
    chemical sensors improved rapidly in the past decade, applications developed based
    on them in agriculture are still at an early stage. More research is needed to
    incorporate these sensors with Ag-IoT. 3.1.4. Electric sensors Electric sensors
    play a key role in Ag-IoT as they have been used in many industries for a long
    period. The main principle is to measure the change of electrical properties due
    to physical or chemical changes in plants, soil, and the environment. Some electrical
    parameters are charge, current, potential difference, electric field, resistance
    (or conductance), capacitance, and inductance. Soil moisture sensors via IoT systems
    were the most tested sensor in the literature. As most of the agricultural lands
    face water shortages and climate change has heavily affected the water availability,
    most of the studies attempted to address this requirement. We found that electrical
    resistance, capacitance, and permittivity of bulk soils were used to estimate
    soil volumetric water content (VWC). Furthermore, soil water tension was measured
    by the electrical resistance of gypsum blocks. For better irrigation scheduling,
    both VWC and soil water tension are important: VWC quantifies the amount of water
    in the soil whereas soil water tension is a better indicator of how difficult
    plant roots can extract water from the soil matrix. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors are the other two dominant sensors researchers have tested. There are
    three types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive, and thermal. Crop ET and
    pest or disease forecasting are the potential applications of the air temperature
    and humidity sensing requirements. But 90% of the research just demonstrated the
    capability of plug play these sensors; only 10% of IoT researchers demonstrate
    the capability of using those sensors for a meaningful task like disease forecasting.
    Humidity is an important environmental parameter directly related to ET calculation,
    crop quality, and pest growth forecasting. Sensors can be deployed to measure
    absolute, relative, and specific humidity. For example, the best time to start
    grain harvesting is highly dependent on grain moisture content and if harvested
    without considering the optimal moisture level it may cause extensive post-harvesting
    damage and economic loss (Zoerb et al., 1993). IoT-based ET modeling and irrigation
    scheduling enable low water usage and low irrigation energy consumption. IoT also
    opened the path for non-conventional VWC measurement. Aroca et al. (2018) presented
    the use of RFID to estimate VWC with a received signal strength of the tag with
    R2 > 0.9. A rain sensor based on the electrical conductivity principle was demonstrated
    as an IoT sensor that could detect the start and end of the rain (Andrey Rivas-Sánchez
    et al., 2019). Based on these literature outcomes it can be concluded that electric
    sensors are mature compared to acoustic and chemical sensors and have been used
    in the industry for a long time and have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT.
    3.1.5. Mechanical sensors Mechanical sensors convert a physical parameter of interest
    through a mechanical system to an electrical signal. Parameters such as flow rate,
    acceleration, velocity, direction, orientation, and pressure can be measured by
    mechanical sensors. Examples of IoT-enabled mechanical sensors found in the literature
    include rain gauges, mechanical flow meters, air and liquid pressure meters, and
    anemometers. Rain gauge is important to capture the precipitation accurately to
    determine the timing and quantity of irrigation when combined with soil water
    content sensors and evapotranspiration modeling (Kameoka et al., 2017). Tipping
    bucket rain sensor converts water volume it captures to an electrical signal through
    a simple mechanism. Measuring pressure is important for air, liquid, and soil
    pressure calculation. Air pressure is relevant to measure crop transpiration as
    the opening and closing of plant stomata are partially regulated by vapor pressure
    deficit. Soil compaction can be measured by the pressure sensors inserted into
    the soil, which are useful for measuring the impact of heavy agricultural machinery.
    Irrigation line pressure sensors are critical to monitor the irrigation process
    as the wetting pattern of irrigation systems highly depends on the irrigation
    line pressure. High pressure causes loss of irrigation energy while low pressure
    does not allow maximum irrigation area through sprinklers. Anemometers can be
    used to measure the wind speed which is required for calculating ET and detecting
    high-speed wind that could be hazardous to plants. Gas and liquid flow rate are
    significant parameters for crop, soil, and environmental monitoring. Conventionally
    crop and soil inputs in the liquid or gaseous form, such as water input (including
    rain), leaching water, liquid fertilizer, liquid or gaseous insecticides, are
    measured using flow sensors. Some cash crops or niche crops such as wasabi (Sultana
    and Savage, 1970) and lettuce (Sultana and Savage, 1970) need highly precise environmental
    conditions and flow monitoring sensors are important for meeting those conditions
    in the future if climate change imposes challenges to grow them. Overall mechanical
    sensors play a key role in Ag-IoT systems, but most of the mechanical sensors
    are replaced by non-mechanical sensors due to the fact mechanical sensors need
    frequent maintenance and have long response time. 3.1.6. Optical sensors Optical
    measurands play a key role in modern agriculture. There should be a light source
    and an optical sensor to take the measurements. Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and
    near infrared (NIR) are the main wavelength regions where optical sensors are
    operated. It is important to note that optical sensors appear to have the least
    applications as IoT sensors according to the literature. Typical RGB images were
    used to derive RGB image-based vegetation indexes while multispectral sensors
    were used to derive vegetation indexes such as NDVI and NDRE (red-edge NDVI).
    Most of the optical sensors that generate spectral signatures or images of the
    target produce larger volumes of data and consume a higher amount of power compared
    to other sensors in Fig. 3. This appears to be a significant discouraging factor
    to incorporate these sensors into IoT. Naturally, signals in the visible region
    were used as indicators for many crops and environmental parameters such as maturation
    time, crop quality (Long and McCallum, 2015), crop nutrient requirement, pest
    pressure, as well as water and nutrient level in the soil. Historically people
    used their eyes (only responsive to the visible lights) to evaluate the color
    intensities somewhat qualitatively (e.g., comparing those to standard color cards).
    The introduction of these sensors has significantly improved optical measurements
    of crop and environmental parameters by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) enabling quantitative
    assessments and (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001) extending the spectral regions from
    visible only to UV and NIR. Fruit spectral signature was used to identify defects
    in the fruit that could not be revealed via visible light. NDVI and NDRE were
    used to quantitatively determine crop density as well as the nitrogen and water
    requirements (Scotford and Miller, 2004). We would like to highlight that more
    research is needed to demonstrate the optical measurand use in Ag-IoT as they
    can be used in a wide range of applications in agriculture. 3.1.7. Thermal sensors
    Thermal measurands have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT, and most of them
    are measured indirectly with optical and electrical means; for instance, measuring
    crop canopy temperature with infrared radiometers. In the literature, the frequent
    use of air and soil temperature sensors highlighted their importance in crop ET
    modeling and disease forecasting (Symeonaki et al., 2020). These sensors are cheap
    and readily available as off-the-shelf items and support a wide variety of IoT
    platforms (Mohanraj et al., 2016). Thermal parameters have the potential to indirectly
    measure biological measurands. One such example is the sap flow sensor, which
    was described in one study as a transpiration measuring sensor compatible with
    the IoT system (Villalba et al., 2017). The sensor consisted of a flexible tree
    stem heater and a temperature sensor while the IoT platform calculated sap flow
    based on the applied heat and temperature. This sap flow measurement is proportional
    to transpiration (sap movement in the xylem) and therefore useful in crop ET modeling
    (Villalba et al., 2017). Sap flow monitoring is essential in some crops to understand
    the physiological behavior of plants. Rubber, maple, coconut, and palmyra palm
    sap are the output of the harvest, and in these cases, sap flow monitoring is
    useful to estimate yield, optimize production, and develop high-yielding crop
    varieties. Indirectly measured canopy temperature through infrared radiometers
    estimates the transpiration rate and crop water stress index, which is important
    for water stress detection and irrigation scheduling (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001).
    Identification of pests such as wild boar through thermal measurement is an interesting
    application in agriculture. Furthermore, the temperature is found to affect the
    quality of grapefruits (sugar content) and flowering time of several crops (Pérez-Expósito
    et al., 2017). Temperature sensors can also record the temperature variation in
    plant leaves and flowering buds and give a warning about frosting time (Barker
    et al., 2017). This listing of thermal measurand applications concluded that thermal
    sensors are very important in Ag-IoT and have been demonstrated in the past literature.
    3.2. Sensing platforms and main control board Section 3.2 summarizes the statistics
    of the Ag-IoT sensing platforms and control boards in the literature. The answer
    for Question 3 in Table 1 was derived from Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (196KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main control boards
    of the Ag-IoT systems present in the reviewed papers. 3.2.1. Sensing platforms
    Sensing platforms consist of sensor node including sensors, power supply, energy
    storage, actuators, main control board or the data processing unit, and structural
    components. Structural components determine the sensor node establishment in the
    field. There are two main types of IoT platforms available for crop monitoring.
    Stationery IoT platforms can collect continuous crop data or telemetry data targeting
    a single plant or a group (plot) of plants. The main advantage of stationery IoT
    is the high temporal resolution of the data. Mobile IoT platforms can collect
    data over some areal coverage and with high spatial resolution, but with limited
    temporal resolution. Kumar et al. (2016) presented the development and testing
    of a crop monitoring mobile robot. It is capable of automatically planning the
    path to find crops, recognizing plants using neural networks, applying fertilizer
    timely, and applying water based on the feedback from soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and humidity sensors. 3.2.2. Main control boards The communication and
    data processing hardware for IoT systems reported in the reviewed papers could
    be broadly categorized into three kinds: commercial platforms, custom build, and
    DIY (do-it-yourself) development boards. The commercial platforms are reliable
    but have limited support for integrating different or additional sensors. IPex12
    (Odin Solutions SL, Peru), Particle Electron (Particle Industries, Inc., USA),
    MICAZ (MICAS AG, Germany), IRIS (IRIS IoT Solutions, UK), and Telosb (Advantic
    Sistemas y Servicios S.L., Spain) are commercial IoT systems. In the last decade,
    commercial IoT platforms were still at their development stage, explaining their
    lower use in the reviewed papers. Custom build hardware is designed by researchers
    based on their own requirements. Researchers have the flexibility to decide on
    the number and types of sensors, interfacing connections, microprocessor clock
    speed, IoT node memory capacity, input voltage, and the communication technology
    used in the node. Furthermore, the technical complexities present in developing
    customized sensor interfacing may also discourage researchers from using commercial
    systems. The custom build hardware platforms have high levels of customization
    but require extensive knowledge of embedded system development to design them.
    DIY platforms are IoT nodes designed based on commercially available development
    platforms, including Arduino, EasyPIC v7, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Wapmote. DIY
    development board based IoT systems are popular among researchers because of their
    low cost, high availability, compatibility, and easy programmability. The percentage
    of different hardware platforms used in the reviewed articles is given in Fig.
    4. There were 52 identifiable hardware designs in the list of 115 research. Out
    of them, 29% of the platforms had Arduino only, 8% had Arduino and Raspberry Pi
    hardware jointly, and 2% used Arduino and Arducam hardware together. Ag-IoT research
    was dominated by Arduino-based development systems. Availability, reliability,
    easy programmability, and the option of supporting multiple communication protocols
    made Arduino-based systems popular among Ag-IoT researchers. Raspberry Pi systems
    were demonstrated in 12% of the IoT systems, likely due to their capability of
    capturing images and high computing power compared to Arduino. Selection of the
    IoT platform and the main control board is an important activity in IoT system
    design. The mainboard must support the communication protocols and the power requirement
    (e.g., voltage) of the sensors and actuators. Often voltage and communications
    protocol converters are needed to interface sensors with the main control board.
    Mainboards support three types of digital memories. Volatile memory holds the
    instructions and data of the currently running program until the power is on.
    Volatile memory influences the system''s performance. A larger volatile memory
    is needed for IoT nodes with a large amount of data generated via sensors like
    RGB cameras or spectral sensors. Nonvolatile memory stores data and the program
    when the IoT node power is turned off. The operating system, device identification
    data, and system settings are common data types stored in the nonvolatile memory.
    External nonvolatile memory (e.g., SD cards) can be used to store data or system
    settings, greatly expanding the data storage capability of the Ag-IoT system.
    3.3. Communication technologies and IoT protocols Section 3.3 produces the answers
    to research questions 4 and 5 in Table 1 while discussing findings on the literature
    related to wireless communication technology and IoT protocols. 3.3.1. Wireless
    communication technology Wireless data transmission is a key function of an IoT
    system. To design a successful Ag-IoT system, it is essential to understand the
    radio frequency (RF) contributing factors that impact signal strength, interference,
    system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Also, understanding of pros and
    cons of wireless communication technologies is essential for a better Ag-IoT device
    selection. Received power (Pr) of wireless data transmission in an unobstructed
    line of sight in a radio signal-free area depends on the transmitter power (Pt),
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains (GTX, GRX), the distance between the transmitter
    and the receiver (R), and the wavelength (λ) of the radio. This relationship is
    expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, long wavelength radio signals such as LoRa in 900
    MHz are suitable for long-distance data transmission compared to short wavelength
    signals such as Wi-Fi operated in 2.4–3.2 GHz without changing other variables.
    For long-distance communication, the plane earth loss formula is used to account
    for the curvature of Earth for signal strength (Nadir et al., 2008). Equation
    1 Friis transmission equation (Shaw, 2013). Furthermore, radio signals are subject
    to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These phenomena are illustrated in
    Fig. 5. In open flat agricultural fields, reflection, scattering, and diffraction
    may not occur unless there are large agricultural structures. In hilly areas and
    forests, the effects of wireless signal propagation properties may need special
    attention when placing IoT devices. The Fresnel Zone is the area around the visual
    line-of-sight that radio waves propagate out once they leave the antenna. Blockage
    of Fresnel Zone >40% causes severe signal losses (Tate et al., 2008). Therefore,
    factors such as the height and density of the crop canopies nearby, the presence
    of agricultural structures (e.g., irrigation pivots and storage silos), the locations
    to place IoT nodes, and the antenna height and position are important to account
    for in ensuring the signal transmission quality. In fact, the research on wireless
    communications in rural and agricultural landscapes has raised a lot of interest
    recently (Vuran et al., 2022). The signal quality is also affected by channel
    noise, interference, multipath fading, and attenuation. The success of data transmission
    is measured by a parameter called bit rate error (BRE). Based on the above discussion
    we would like to suggest that it is important to use wireless signal strength
    mapping tools during IoT system installations. Such tools will help to select
    the optimum IoT communication technology (for example, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Mobile Communication)
    suitable for each case, accounting for data transmission rates and signal losses.
    This practice would help farmers to reduce the capital and operational costs involved
    with IoT systems. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download

    In the literature, we found that a wide variety of wireless communication technologies
    were used by the researchers. Out of the 35 studies where communication technology
    was clearly mentioned, 34% used Wi-Fi, 17% were conducted using LoRa, and 14%
    used Zigbee. Also 11% of the studies used ethernet or the wired internet connection.
    Less attention was received for mobile communication technologies such as 4G (3%),
    NB-IoT (3%), and GSM (3%). In some cases, researchers used two or more technologies
    to connect different areas in the fields such as LoRa / Wi-Fi, LoRa / TV white
    space (TVWS), and GSM / Zigbee. According to the findings, Wi-Fi and ethernet
    were common in greenhouses while others were favored in outdoor farming practices.

    Fig. 6. Communication technologies in Ag-IoT applications. 3.3.2. IoT protocols
    IoT protocols are data transmission standards that allow communication between
    the endpoint and services with the internet being the common network. IoT protocols
    are broadly classified into two major groups: IoT data protocols and IoT network
    protocols. The data protocols correspond to the application layer whereas network
    protocols correspond to the perception and network layer in the standard IoT architecture
    (Fig. 1). IoT network protocols create networks of device connections. Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth are such network protocols, and the same term is
    used to represent wireless communication technology. Some common IoT protocols
    are listed in Table 3 with specifications such as frequency, data rate, and range
    (Triantafyllou et al., 2018; Farooq et al., 2019). Table 3. Common IoT Network

    and privacy protection, easy to install and connect, faster data transfers Each
    IoT network protocol/wireless communication technology has its advantages (Table
    3). Bluetooth is a popular short-range wireless communication technology standard
    convenient to create personal area networks. It is possible to use Bluetooth in
    indoor applications such as mobile phone-connected soil water sensors and sensor
    networking in small greenhouses. ZigBee is useful in large indoor growing spaces
    and LoRa is suitable for field crop monitoring senor networks. Cellular technology
    is useful for indoor or outdoor spaces where the network coverage is available.
    Wi-Fi is suitable for both small or large indoor spaces as well as outdoor applications
    where there is infrastructure support available to setup Wi-Fi gateways. Cellular
    and Wi-Fi allow transmitting images, videos, and other larger data files such
    as 3D point cloud data. Bluetooth shares the same advantage but is limited to
    a short distance. Compared to LoRa, Zigbee, and cellular technology, Wi-Fi has
    high reliability in data transmission, but power consumption is high too. All
    these protocols were tested in real crop growing environments (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016; Codeluppi et al., 2020). 3.4. Cloud platforms and service models
    3.4.1. Cloud platforms Cloud is an essential part of any IoT system. IoT devices
    are not useful without cloud connectivity. Data gathered via individual IoT sensors
    become useful when connected with other relevant sensors. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling
    ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
    computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
    that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
    service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance, 2011). Essential expected characteristics
    of a cloud system are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,
    rapid elasticity, and measured service. Out of the 115 papers we reviewed, only
    25 papers discussed cloud platforms in detail. Among them, 28% of the researchers
    used the ThingSpeak cloud platform developed by MATLAB as the service provider,
    12% used Microsoft Azure, and 12% used Ubidots platform. Furthermore, 12% of the
    researchers built themselves a local data server with the required functionality.
    Google-based Firebase had 8% usage. Other cloud platform service providers including
    Amazon Web Services, cloud sense, generic cloud, sensorDB, SEnviro, and Huawei
    Cloud had 4% use each. The percentage distribution of these cloud platforms is
    given in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download

    Public, private, and hybrid cloud In terms of privacy policies, cloud platforms
    can be divided into three major models: 3.4.2.1. Public cloud Services are offered
    over the public internet and available to anyone who needs to purchase them. Third-party
    cloud service providers own and operate the cloud resources such as servers and
    storage in the public cloud model. Users do not need to spend any capital expenditures
    to scale up; applications can be quickly provisioned and terminated; and users
    pay only for what they use. These are the advantages of the public cloud. Amazon
    Web Services and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud services. 3.4.2.2.
    Private cloud A private cloud comprises computing resources used exclusively by
    users from one business or organization therefore hardware must be purchased for
    start-up and maintenance is required. In the private cloud model, infrastructure
    is not shared with users outside the organization. A private cloud can be physically
    placed at a data center owned by the user organization, or it can be hosted by
    a third-party service provider. But the organization has complete control over
    resources and security. 3.4.2.3. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud is a computing environment
    that combines a public and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to
    be shared between them. The organizations determine where to run their applications
    while they control security, compliance, or legal requirements. Some organizations
    use a hybrid cloud model to keep sensitive data in the private cloud whereas frontal
    services and web portals are serviced in the public cloud for scalability. Furthermore,
    the public cloud can act as a supporting system if the data and usage exceeds
    the capacity of the private cloud. 3.4.3. Cloud service model Cloud-based services
    provided to the users can be categorized into three major classes based on the
    hierarchy of the service offered. Typical cloud architecture has nine layers.
    They are from bottom to top in order: network, storage, server, virtualization,
    operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. The next section
    will explain cloud service models in detail with hardware and software layers
    they belong. 3.4.3.1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IaaS was the original
    cloud services model. For IaaS, the cloud service provider will provide the hardware
    and keep it up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration
    are up to the client. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational
    in Microsoft datacenters. The main advantage of the IaaS model is the rapid deployment
    of new computing devices. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure are some
    examples of IaaS. 3.4.3.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) In this cloud service
    model, the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources,
    and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
    For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers
    can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical
    hardware and software requirements. 3.4.3.3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) In the
    case of SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment,
    such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
    The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by
    the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working
    version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. 3.4.3.4. Network-as-a-Service
    (NaaS) Software-defined networking and software-defined perimeters are services
    that belonged to NaaS. NaaS is a cloud model that enables organizations to easily
    operate the network and achieve the outcomes they expect without owning, building,
    or maintaining their infrastructure through the cloud. NaaS can replace hardware-centric
    VPNs, load balancers, firewall appliances, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    connections. Users can scale up and scale down as demand changes, rapidly deploy
    services, and eliminate hardware costs. 3.4.4. Fog and edge computing Edge computing
    is the moving of data processing close to where the data is generated. Wireless
    communication-enabled sensors with microcontrollers can be considered edge computing
    devices. The introduction of the edge computing paradigm was due to issues related
    to centralized cloud computing architecture. Data and control signal transmission
    latency and delays in centralized system data analytics are some disadvantages
    of cloud computing. Therefore, network designers proposed architectures where
    the computing power is distributed more evenly around the network. Fog and edge
    computing push the processing capability out to the edge of the network, closer
    to the source of the data. Such techniques are called fog computing and edge computing.
    Fog computing is a computing layer between the cloud and the edge where edge devices
    send large amounts of data to the cloud. The fog computing layer can get the data
    from the edge layer before it reaches the cloud and filter what is relevant and
    what is not. The filtered data gets stored in the cloud, while the unrelated data
    can be deleted, or analyzed at the fog layer for remote access or to use in localized
    learning models. Precision herbicide applications become popular with field crops.
    There, a moving platform that has a camera, carries and applies the herbicide
    at the exact location of the emerging weed. The image processing hardware and
    software in the moving platform do the image processing instantaneously to reduce
    the delay of cloud-based image processing in larger fields (Coleman et al., 2022).
    The centralized cloud-only needs the weed density from the moving IoT platform
    to forecast the future herbicide need to maintain the required quantity in the
    stocks. Therefore, edge computing is all about placing computing power on the
    very edge of the network, on the actual sensors of the device. Low power consumption
    and low processing power microchips or micro-controllers embedded in the devices
    provide the power for edge computing. For that reason, their processing capacity
    is much more limited but sometimes can be adequate to process images (Chamara
    et al., 2021). 3.4.5. Data analytics in IoT Data analytics is one of the most
    important activities in any IoT system, as the decision-making of an IoT system
    depends on hundreds of sensors and events, which is difficult to analyze manually.
    Data generated by IoT devices fall under three categories. They are structured
    data (such as SQL storage), unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), and semi-structured
    data (like social media feeds). Ag-IoT systems can generate both structured and
    unstructured data (Lea, 2020). Stream processing and batch processing are the
    two main types of data processing techniques. Stream processing is useful for
    mobile Ag-IoT platforms since it allows real-time data processing. Batch processing
    can be applied in irrigation, chemigation, and fertigation applications as data
    are processed as a batch to make the decision. Common data analytics activities
    for IoT platforms are listed in Table 4. Below are some examples how they are
    used in Ag-IoT for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. Alerting allows growers
    to receive an alert message when soil water use exceeds the maximum allowable
    depletion (Gamon et al., 2015). Sensors in the field environment are susceptible
    to problems like physical damage, pest attack, misalignment, and breakdown, which
    cause errors in data streams. These problems can be effectively alleviated by
    error finding. Using time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    or Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to determine the next irrigation or fertigation
    time belongs to trend analysis. Triggering sprinklers in a field based on SWC
    sensor values is an example of signaling. More complex decisions can be formed
    by combining several analytical activities. For example, in automated crop disease
    detection, an average daily temperature above 20 to 25 °C followed by 1–2 in.
    of rain, together with sugar beet leaf color change indicated a sugar beet pathogen
    outbreak (Wolf and Verreet, 2002). This analysis was enabled by data joining,
    tracking, and trend analysis. Table 4. Data analysis activities commonly found
    in Ag-IoT applications. Data analysis activity Function Preprocessing Filter out
    data with little interest to reduce data complexity and duplication Alerting Raise
    an alert if data exceed certain boundary condition Windowing Apply rules on data
    in a predefined time window Joining Combine multiple data streams into a new single
    data stream Error finding Find missing values and anomalies in data streams Tracking
    Identify when or where an event has occurred Trend analysis Quantify change or
    trend of data as a function of time Signaling Send control signal when a decision
    is made 3.5. Power and energy management Power and energy storage are the two
    major driving forces for IoT systems, especially for Ag-IoT located in remote
    fields. In the literature, we found 3 main categories of power management systems.
    Direct main power connected nodes is the first type and most common with indoor
    applications. A rechargeable battery with a recharging option such as solar, hydro,
    or wind is the second option. The third one has a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable
    battery but is designed to consume very low power by sending a very low amount
    of data intermittently. Among the 115 pieces of research we have reviewed, only
    27 of them discussed the IoT system power and energy storage features. Out of
    these 27, 11 platforms used solar power as the main power supply while Lithium
    Polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries were used as the energy storage solution.
    Out of 11 indoor farming applications which explained the power management options,
    9 used the main grid power supply. Research that focused on IoT system setup under
    high dense canopies used high power density and high-capacity battery-only solutions
    such as 12 V lead-acid batteries. Two studies mentioned they used battery with
    solar but did not disclose details about the specifications. It revealed that
    there are very limited power supplies available for in-field IoT implementation
    and the findings are highlighted in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    selection of the Ag-IoT systems in the reviewed studies. Unlike edge-computing
    devices, typical IoT end nodes are designed to be less power-hungry. This power
    consumption goes high due to certain reasons such as connected high throughput
    sensors, significant data processing, and massive data transmission. However,
    these power consumptions can be minimized by exploiting different techniques such
    as the semi-active phase and sleep phase (Zhang and Li, 2019). The edge computing-enabled
    devices need more power. It is essential to standardize the IoT power management
    based on the crop and geographical location of the devices. For example, solar
    power is not a very promising solution for locations with large trees such as
    rubber, pepper, and spices that have a dense crop canopy 5–10 m above the ground
    (Villalba et al., 2017). 3.6. Actuators Monitoring and controlling are two agricultural
    operations closely related to each other. Monitoring by itself is an open-loop
    operation; whereas monitoring, controlling, and again monitoring the effects of
    controlling make a system closed loop and can improve the efficiency of the system.
    Efficient controlling of the actuators based on the monitoring is a key feature
    in the agricultural domain for optimizing inputs, maximizing crop yield and quality,
    and reducing the negative environmental impacts. Fig. 9 depicts the number of
    actuators controlled via IoT systems that were reported in our reviewed papers.
    Out of the 115 studies, 54 mentioned IoT-enabled actuation. Some studies used
    more than one actuator, whereas most of the in-field IoT sensor monitoring systems
    did not mention the use of actuators. Download : Download high-res image (130KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Count of actuators controlled via
    IoT systems found in the reviewed papers. Since water is the largest input by
    volume applied to farms, actuators related to water have been mostly discussed
    in the research work. Such controllers are pumps and solenoid valves. Controlling
    these two actuators were demonstrated in 22 and 8 instances, respectively. After
    irrigation, controlling lighting was the most occurred application in indoor farming
    followed by ventilation, fertigation, alert, and air conditioning. Ventilation
    allows outdoor air to come inside the greenhouse while air conditioning includes
    heating or cooling of the air. Alert meant the system sent an email or message
    to the farmer or the operator of the farm when a parameter exceeded a threshold
    value. An IoT-controlled insect repellent actuator was demonstrated twice among
    the 115 case studies evaluated. Automation of soil bed preparation was achieved
    by utilizing stepper motors in one instance of IoT-based indoor farming. According
    to Figure 9, water pumps and valves were the most frequently used actuators, and
    all these systems were closed loop control systems with soil moisture sensors
    and ET modeling. From the study of the above actuator-related research, it can
    be said that there is enormous potential to automate the controlling of the indoor
    crop''s required environment and soil preparation. (See Fig. 9.) 3.7. Ag-IoT for
    crop monitoring Out of the 115 publications reviewed, 71 systems were demonstrated
    in a real environment. Among them, 65% were implemented in the fields, 24% were
    demonstrated in indoor environments, and 11% were simulations. This is an interesting
    finding that reveals the huge potential of implementing outdoor or in-field IoT
    applications. Typically, it is easy to set up indoor IoT sensor networks due to
    fewer technological barriers, such as extreme environmental conditions and sensor
    connectivity issues. Since real applications were available only in 65% (71 out
    of 115) instances, further real implementations can be done to demonstrate the
    capability of Ag-IoT applications. Considering the 71 systems that demonstrated
    the real applications, 49 were practically demonstrated with certain types of
    crops and 22 did not mention the specific crop they used. 15% of these systems
    were demonstrated with grapes while cereal crops accounted for 26%. One research
    was based on both grapes and oranges. In total 50% of the IoT studies focused
    on perennial specialty crops of higher value including grape, moringa, orange,
    citrus, sugarcane, silver maple, apricot, cashew, and olive (Fig. 10). This result
    indicates that IoT can be implemented with diverse crop types to achieve various
    purposes. Ag-IoT systems are easy to set up on perennial croplands as there is
    less soil preparation for the IoT system installation. It is important to develop
    techniques that allow easy IoT implementation to the annual crops as they contribute
    more to global food security. It is also worth to note only one research demonstrated
    the economic viability of IoT implementation (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, future
    research to assess and understand the economic viability of IoT applications in
    various situations is needed. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download

    crop types. 4. Challenges of Ag-IoT systems and potential solutions Ag-IoT faces
    challenges that are unique compared with IoT applications in other industries.
    In this section, we briefly discuss those challenges that are of utmost importance
    for Ag-IoT system researchers and developers. Ag-IoT challenges can be mainly
    classified into three sections: technical challenges, sectoral challenges, and
    business challenges (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.1. Technical challenges Limitations
    of the advancement of technology are the reasons for technical challenges. They
    would likely be effectively addressed as tools and technologies advance with time.
    The Ag-IoT technical challenges are discussed under the three layers of the IoT
    architecture (Fig. 1), namely, perception layer issues, network layer issues,
    and application layer issues. 4.1.1. Perception layer issues Ag-IoT systems''
    perception layer faces unique challenges, because of the requirements it needs
    to meet during crop and environmental monitoring in harsh environments (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Agricultural lands have limited electricity and communication infrastructure.
    It is not practical or cost-effective to use wired power and communication media
    to connect IoT nodes in the field. Therefore, power management, device longevity,
    and ergonomic design are major challenges related to the Ag-IoT perception layer.
    Power management includes Ag-IoT node-level power generation, strategies to reduce
    power consumption, and energy storage. Section 3.5 Power and Energy Management
    revealed that most of the researchers were interested in solar with rechargeable
    batteries as the power source in agriculture. However, there is a challenge to
    introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under the tall and dense
    crop canopy. Micro wind turbines have the potential as an Ag-IoT power source
    but receive less attention in the literature (Jawad et al., 2017). Continuous
    improvements have been made to rechargeable batteries due to the demand for high
    energy to weight ratio batteries. There are several approaches available to reduce
    power consumption. One approach is to select sensors, actuators, and wireless
    protocols with low energy consumption. Selection of a node duty cycle that turns
    the sensor or actuator on when it reads, sends, or receives signals is another
    viable approach (Estrada-Lopez et al., 2018). Harsh environmental conditions such
    as wind and rainfall, continuous high solar radiation, sub-zero temperatures in
    winter, chemicals commonly used in agriculture, and animal attacks make it difficult
    to keep Ag-IoT nodes in the field in operable conditions for a long time (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Sensors, cables, and enclosures should be designed to withstand
    such conditions. Standards are available to follow in most cases, but the cost
    becomes high when required standards need to be escalated. Analog signals (Analogue
    voltage or current), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), Serial Data Interface at
    1200 baud rate (SDI-12), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
    are the common sensor to microcontroller data transmission techniques. The microcontroller
    development boards and commercial IoT platforms are designed to work with different
    voltage levels, such as 3.3 V, 5 V, 7 V, and 12 V. These different communication
    protocols and operation voltages have created barriers to the interoperability
    of the devices in Ag-IoT implementation. Research and development to standardize
    data communication and power supply in Ag-IoT systems would substantially increase
    the scalability, upgradability, and interoperability in the perception layer.
    Improving ergonomic design and reducing the labor intensiveness for deploying
    Ag-IoT systems in the field are urgently needed. IoT-based soil water content
    monitoring is a good example to show this issue. Often soil sensors are buried
    underground for continuous measurements during a season. These sensor nodes also
    have an aboveground section to allow wireless communication, which could interfere
    with farm operations such as tillage, fertilizer application, and chemical spraying,
    and should be closely monitored. For annual crops, the need to remove the sensors
    when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a significant
    logistic issue for using them effectively. Research on underground wireless communication
    technology (Akyildiz et al., 2009) and Internet of Underground Things (Vuran et
    al., 2018) is ongoing, bearing the promise to alleviate this challenge associated
    with Ag-IoT node installation and maintenance. No standards are currently available
    on Ag-IoT installation as agricultural fields and practices are highly heterogeneous.
    Novel solutions are necessary to encourage Ag-IoT users. 4.1.2. Network layer
    issues The most common Ag-IoT network layer issues are internet coverage, standard
    interception, interference, propagation losses, communication range, wireless
    link quality, network expansion, network management, communication protocols,
    latency, and throughput. As most farms are in rural areas, remote locations, or
    mountain regions, it is a huge challenge to get internet connectivity to them
    since these underpopulated areas have limited internet infrastructure. One solution
    could be creating a local network, a concept similar to a hybrid cloud. This type
    of system does not connect to the internet but still allows local servers to perform
    the basic IoT functionality (Akyildiz et al., 2009). Due to the recent advancement
    in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it would soon be possible to have internet
    connectivity via satellite as illustrated in Fig. 11 on a commercial scale (Ivanova
    et al., 2016). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the future, many agricultural
    fields will rely on satellite-based connectivity to connect their gateways to
    the internet. This system consists of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) type
    ground antenna which is connected to the nodes through multiple gateways. Gateways
    can follow different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, or Zigbee.
    One disadvantage of satellite-based internet connectivity is that it needs a clear
    sky to make a successful connection. Therefore, it is logical to have a local
    server for data storage and decision-making when the connection is interrupted.

    Fig. 11. Future Ag-IoT system with satellite connected internet. Standard interception
    refers to difficulties in using the full potential of a communication technology
    due to standards imposed by regulatory authorities to limit the use. Recent advancements
    on long-range low throughput communication technologies such as LoRa become widely
    known communication protocols in Ag-IoT. To promote fair use of LoRa bandwidth,
    governments can regulate the use of wireless frequencies. For example, in Europe,
    the duty cycle or the transmitter uptime of the LoRa node is between 0.1% to 10%.
    This is a challenge in most Ag-IoT applications as there are higher volumes of
    data to transmit and many sensors and actuators to connect. When many IoT nodes
    are deployed, the interference may occur because the data transmission could use
    the same frequency, especially in unlicensed spectrums, such as ZigBee, Sigfox,
    LoRa, and Wi-Fi. Signal interference causes data loss and reduces the reliability
    of the systems (Elijah et al., 2018). Wireless signal propagation strength, communication
    range, and wireless link quality depend on the humidity, temperature, crop growth
    status, and crop morphological characteristics in agriculture fields (Tzounis
    et al., 2017; Cama-Pinto et al., 2019; Vuran et al., 2022). Thus, wireless signal
    propagation strength simulation and visualization software are essential in the
    future for the mass installation of Ag-IoT sensor nodes. Such software will reduce
    the complexity of node placement issues. 4.1.3. Application layer issues Data
    security, data privacy, and data analysis are application layer issues. Ag-IoT
    data is important for a country''s food security as well as for the Ag business
    model security. In the modern competitive world, data breaching could lead to
    a competitive disadvantage on Ag-business model over a competitor as well as risk
    the food security of a country. Therefore, more focus should be put into improving
    the security and privacy of data generated via Ag-IoT systems. 4.2. Sectoral challenges
    4.2.1. Regulatory issues Data ownership creates another business challenge. Companies
    that provide Ag-IoT services can use the data for improvements in their systems,
    but farmers do not receive compensation for that. There is a challenge to implement
    such a system to prevent data monopoly (Misra et al., 2020). Therefore, regulation
    and legal frameworks about the control and rights of data between farmers and
    IoT companies need to be established (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.2.2. Interoperability
    issue According to Elijah et al. (2018), interoperability involves the ability
    to have technical, synthetic, semantic, and organization interoperability. Technical
    interoperability involves the effortless communication among IoT devices using
    protocols. Data interchanging between systems is semantic interoperability. Synthetic
    interoperability deals with IoT system-generated digital data exchange with humans,
    while organization interoperability involves information sharing among different
    regions, infrastructures, and cultures (Elijah et al., 2018). Here we would like
    to introduce a challenge associated with Ag-IoT system interoperability. As most
    of the farmers have crop rotations and multi-cropping systems, it is essential
    to have Ag-IoT systems with context awareness that allows them to work with different
    cropping systems. The heterogeneity of agricultural systems imposes the system
    interoperability challenge. 4.2.3. Business issues The cost and non-availability
    of skilled personnel in Ag-IoT is a business issue. Cost is a challenge for Ag-IoT
    implementation. There are three types of costs involved with Ag-IoT systems: the
    setup cost or the capital expenditure, running cost or operational cost, and upgrading
    cost. Due to the nature of IoT business models and being a relatively new technology,
    analysis on return on investment of Ag-IoT systems is not yet discussed considerably
    in the literature. Chen et al. (2019) highlighted that application of IoT systems
    on irrigation controlling in turmeric turned out to be profitable. Several factors
    increase capital expenditure. Remote and harsh environmental conditions that Ag-IoT
    systems must bear increase the production cost of Ag-IoT systems. Ag-IoT end nodes
    require materials that do not wear and tear due to sun, rain, and chemicals applied
    during crop cultivation. Communication cost is usually a standard rate, but the
    initial investment is required to set up the internet connection, and this cost
    depends on the infrastructure availability where the farms are located. Theoretical
    knowledge and practical experience about the sensing/actuating system and parameters
    of interest are essential to set up a successful Ag-IoT system. Sensor data interpreters
    need an overall understanding of the agroecological principles to reach a decision
    (Duff et al., 2022). Reluctance to use new technology and unskilled manpower are
    apparent obstacles to implementing Ag-IoT in commercial production crop monitoring
    systems. More extension programs are needed to solve this issue while standards
    are necessary for Ag-IoT system development to improve the common Ag-IoT platforms
    that have interoperable qualities. 5. Supporting technologies 5.1. Augmented reality
    and IoT applications Data visualization and real-time decision-making are important
    to IoT. Based on past literature this sector is the least explored area. Wearable
    augmentation devices improve crop monitoring and control. Smart glasses have the
    real-time data visualization capability to indicate the status of crops, soil,
    or environment (Hurst et al., 2021). An irrigation activity can be controlled
    manually by a farmer if he can visualize the real-time soil water content change
    in the field. The conditions within a greenhouse can be controlled in real-time
    and actuators can be controlled via voice command through a smart glass. Harvesting
    can be more enjoyable and more efficient (lower loss) based on image processing
    capable smart glasses. Vegetable or fruit pickers can be assisted through a smart
    glass by viewing what it detects in the fruit to decide whether to pick it or
    not. Untrained labor usage-related losses can be reduced by augmented reality
    related training. 5.2. Big data Big data generated by Ag-IoT are mostly of heterogeneous
    types. The most common IoT agricultural big data are machine-generated data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). These data are generated from a massive number of sensors and smart
    machines used to measure and record farming processes; which are in turn boosted
    by the IoT. Machine-generated data range from simple sensor records to complex
    computer logs. Big data in agriculture are generated mostly when we introduce
    smart sensing and monitoring with the help of IoT. The main sources of big data
    in Ag-IoT are: sensors, robotics, open data, data captured by airborne sensors
    (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014; Cole et al., 2012), weather/climate data, yield data,
    soil types, agricultural census data (Chen et al., 2014) and so on. Typically,
    telemetry data is generated by sensors such as temperature, rotary, or linear
    encoder. These data are well-structured in contrast to imagery data which need
    post-processing. Such unstructured data have issues in terms of availability,
    quality, and formats (Liu et al., 2015) and can be a concern. As the number of
    sensors is increasing and data volumes are growing rapidly, it is becoming a matter
    of utmost importance to store and process big data. Some approaches to handle
    big data are data shrinking, scale up, scale out, and high-performance computing.
    Data shrinking is the process of throwing away some less important data and still
    being able to reconstruct the original data. Scale-up (vertical scalability) is
    adding additional storage and RAM to store and process the big data in the processing
    node. But this technique has its capacity limit. Scale out (horizontal scalability)
    is the concept of using parallel computers to store and process that big data.
    High-Performance Computing is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to handle
    big data, where computers with multiple cores are grouped to create an efficient
    network to deal with the big data. These techniques are essential for successful
    data handling in Ag-IoT. 5.3. Artificial intelligence in Ag-IoT Techniques that
    enable machines to mimic human behavior are artificial intelligence (AI), while
    a subset of AI that gives machines the ability of learning without being explicitly
    programmed is machine learning. Deep learning techniques are a subset of machine
    learning techniques with multilayer neural network feasibility. The data generated
    from the Ag-IoTs are often used to train machine learning models for specific
    agricultural use cases such as yield forecast, crop stress detection, and pest
    spreading prediction. To be more specific, for the agricultural IoT applications,
    raw sensing information such as field and weather conditions and crop status can
    be collected and used for model training locally or in the remote end that has
    more computational resources. These trained models can later be used to control
    actuators for variable rate irrigation and site-specific pesticide/ herbicide
    applications. Deep learning techniques are heavily used with image processing
    applications in agriculture. Trained deep learning models are available for crop
    type detection (de Filho et al., 2020), plant phenotyping (Pound et al., 2017),
    fruit (Patel et al., 2011), flower (Dias et al., 2018), and leaf detection (Chamara
    et al., 2021), and weed detection for herbicide applications (Coleman et al.,
    2022). AI becomes an integral part of IoT due to its capability of using it as
    a data analytics tool. 6. Ag-IoT for farming systems analyses and management In
    this section, we briefly discuss and envision how Ag-IoT would benefit and potentially
    transform farming systems analyses and management, enabled by its unprecedented
    data, analytics, and connected sensors and actuators. Perhaps the most obvious
    advantages of Ag-IoT come from the high spatiotemporal resolution of farm-level
    data it generates concerning crops, soil, and microclimate (Kagan et al., 2022).
    The high spatial resolution data would quantify the the spatial variability of
    crop parameters (such as yield and leaf area index) and soil parameters (such
    as pH, organic matter, and water holding capacility), and elucidate the relationships
    between them to identify yield-limiting factors at different parts of the field
    (Alfred et al., 2021). This is the underlying principle of site-specific crop
    management, which will be greatly enhanced through Ag-IoT. Modern Ag-IoTs take
    measurements at hourly and sub-hourly intervals. This high temporal resolution
    data allow us to observe the crop responses to environmental cues at finer time
    steps, and enhance our understanding on how basic plant physiological processes
    such as transpiration and photosynthesis vary due to short-term environmental
    fluctuations. Process-based crop and soil models, which are widely used to evaluate
    the economic and environmental consequences of farming practices, usually suffer
    from the lack of site-specific data to parameterize and calibrate them, especially
    the in-season crop data and soil data. These data are exactly what Ag-IoT sensors
    are good at generating, and therefore would improve the accuracy of these models
    for farm-level management assessment. Networked sensors and actuators of Ag-IoT,
    along with the real-time data processing, transmission, and modeling, would greatly
    improve the decision-making cycle of farm-level management practices (Chaterji
    et al., 2021). The traditional crop management decision-making has several limitations.
    First, the decision is usually based on a single set of data, because other datasets
    are unavailable or expensive to obtain. Second, there is usually long latency
    between data generation and decision-making (e.g., several days or weeks). This
    long latency is in contrast to the fact that many stresses in the field (such
    as pest outbreak) occur and develop quickly and need real-time intervention to
    prevent substantial loss. Thirdly, the present management practice only addresses
    one factor at a time whereas in reality crops can undergo multiple stresses simultaneously.
    Altogether, these limitations reflect our inability to capture the complexity
    of the farming system. Ag-IoT has the potential to transform farm-level decision-making
    by enabling multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategies, powered by real-time
    data processing and relevant models run in the cloud to shorten the latency. For
    example, crop, soil, and microclimate sensors can simultaneously measure the crop
    water and nitrogen status, soil moisture content and nitrate content, and weather
    variables. These multi-source inputs can be fed into the models to output two
    variables: a nitrogen sufficiency index and a water sufficiency index. These two
    variables can further be converted to a nitrogen and water application rate for
    site-specific fertigation. This paradigm has several advantages. First, it is
    a multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategy that accounts for the interaction
    between the water and nitrogen stresses. Second, it reduces the cost of implementation
    and shortens the management cycle because two actions are combined into one (one
    pass of field equipment instead of two). In a similar fashion, decisions such
    as pesticide applications and other chemicals (fungicides, growth regulators)
    could potentially be further stacked to make crop production more efficient. Traditionally,
    farm system analyses and management happen at the individual farm level (Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2019). In other words, data are usually not shared or co-analyzed
    across the farm boundary. In the era of Ag-IoT where farm data are shared and
    stored in the cloud, there represents an opportunity where the analysis and modeling
    of Ag-IoT data can cover a group of farms or at a regional scale. These regional
    analyses would answer other important questions such as regional yield forecasting,
    pest tracking, or agricultural resource prioritization. These questions are not
    necessarily important for individual growers, but are at the heart of other stakeholders
    such as policy makers and input suppliers. Data ownership and privacy, covered
    in Section 4, are two big issues that should be resolved before this type of analysis
    may occur. 7. Conclusions and future directions 7.1. Conclusions Ag-IoT is a promising
    technology that would increase resource use efficiency in agricultural systems,
    and is an essential tool for digital agriculture transformation. In this paper,
    we have overviewed impactful research related to Ag-IoT in the past decade. The
    data collected from these papers were categorized and analyzed under six main
    Ag-IoT system design parameters namely sensors, sensing platforms and main control
    board, communication technology and IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and
    energy management, and actuators. According to the analyzed data, it is revealed
    that there is an increased global attention towards the Ag-IoT system-related
    research in the recent years. However, there are certain research gaps found in
    the literature. One of them is that the implementations of the sensors and the
    actuators seem to be limited to soil and environmental parameter monitoring and
    irrigation controlling. Furthermore, crop macro and micronutrient demand analyses
    are still at the infant stage due to the non-availability of sensors that can
    measure nutrients in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to improve the sensor
    and actuator applications in crop monitoring and controlling. In addition, heterogeneity
    of the system parameters (such as data, platforms, required power) is a major
    challenge to the Ag-IoT systems implementation, to which the improvement of the
    context-awareness could be a solution. Power harness options for Ag-IoT nodes
    need more exploration as there are limited options available and it would be a
    big advantage for the perennial crop monitoring. The perception and the network
    layers of Ag-IoT systems require more improvements to meet the sensor implementation
    ergonomics and long-range high-throughput data transmission, respectively. Edge
    computing can be a replacement of the high throughput long-range communication,
    but to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of practical applications
    have been developed based on edge computing to date. Mobile Ag-IoT platforms such
    as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have a huge potential to increase the spatiotemporal
    resolution in Ag-IoT-based monitoring and controlling. 7.2. Future directions
    From the finding of this review, authors would like to highlight some important
    future requirements for Ag-IoT. The entire Ag-IoT research community needs to
    propose a complete system design for Ag-IoT that will be viable, open, and interpretable.
    The objective is to enable the interconnectivity of heterogeneous systems and
    sharing resources to obtain more detailed and specific agricultural data. Furthermore,
    in the future research work, there is a need to develop complete information perception
    standards and design multi-protocol compatible gateways. With some significant
    efforts in the above-mentioned future research directions, the entire research
    community will be able to solve the problems of inconsistent device interfaces
    and protocols, making the system faster, robust, and more convenient. Making full
    use of long-range low throughput communication technology, virtual reality/augmented
    reality, and big data/AI for Ag-IoT is yet to be thoroughly explored. Declaration

  description: In information technology, Big Data is a collection of data sets so
    large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database
    management tools or traditional data-processing applications [74]. The trend to
    larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis
    of a single large set of related data, as compared with separate smaller sets
    with the same total amount of data [26,51,68]. Scientists regularly encounter
    limitations due to large data sets in many areas, including meteorology, genetics,
    complex physics simulations, and environmental research [9,35]. Wireless technology-based
    automated data gathering from the large environmental sensor networks have increased
    the quantity of sensor data available for analysis and sensor informatics. Next-generation
    environmental monitoring, natural resource management, and agricultural decision
    support systems are becoming heavily dependent on very large scale multiple sensor
    network deployments, massive-scale accumulation, harmonization, web-based Big
    Data integration and interpretation of Big Data. With large amount of the data
    availability, the complexity of data has also increased hence regular maintenance
    of large-scale sensor are becoming a difficult challenge. Uncertainty factors
    in the environmental monitoring processes are more evident than before due to
    current technological transparency achieved by most recent advanced communication
    technologies [47-49]. The other challenges include capture, storage, search, sharing,
    analysis, and visualization. Data availability from a particular environmental
    sensor web is often very limited and data quality is subsequently very poor. This
    practical limitation could be due to difficult geographical location of the sensor
    node or sensor station, extreme environmental conditions, communication network
    failure, and lastly technical failure of the sensor node. Data uncertainty from
    a sensor network makes the network unreliable and inefficient. This inefficiency
    leads to failure of natural resource management systems such as agricultural water
    resource management, weather forecast, crop management including irrigation scheduling
    and natural resource-based crop business model systems. The ultimate challenge
    in environmental forecasting and decision support systems, is to overcome the
    data uncertainty and make the derived output more accurate. It is evident that
    there is a need to capture and integrate environmental knowledge from various
    independent sources including sensor networks, individual sensory system, large-scale
    environmental simulation models, and historical environmental data [13,33,36,41,56,58]
    for each of the independent sources). It is not good enough to produce efficient
    decision support system using a single data source. So there is an urgent requirement
    for on demand complementary knowledge integration where different sources of environmental
    sensor data could be used to complement each other automatically [1,17,37,38].

    irrigation 1. Introduction Given the advancements in the field of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) as well as in the miniaturization of such sensor systems, new
    trends have emerged in the field of precision agriculture (Zhang et al., 2002,
    Srinivasan, 2006). Reviews of wireless sensor technologies and applications in
    agriculture and food industry have been given by Wang et al. (2006) and by Ruiz-Garcia
    et al. (2009).Wireless networks allow the deployment of sensing and actuation
    infrastructure at a much finer granularity than has been available before. Sensors
    and actuators can be used to precisely and autonomously control, for example,
    the concentration of fertilizer in the soil, based on information gathered from
    the soil itself, the ambient temperature, and other relevant environmental factors.
    Incorporating feedback into the system through the use of sensors and actuators
    allows for a more fine-grained analysis that can adjust flow rate and duration
    in a way that is informed by local conditions. Significant economic gains are
    expected by applying such precise information to control the growth of particularly
    delicate and high value crops such as wine grapes, citrus fruit and strawberries.
    Sensors that are able to monitor the crop itself, for example, leaf temperature
    in strawberries, or sugar-levels in grapes, or the photosynthetic activity of
    the crop plant, to provide location-specific data could also prove to be very
    effective. In particular, the use of WSN technology to optimize irrigation in
    agriculture is of benefit to both the farmers and the environment. According to
    recent reports, agriculture irrigation accounts for 50–60% of freshwater usage
    from sources in the natural environment and up to more than 90% in some developing
    countries (UNESCO, 2009, pp. 106–115). Given the increasing worldwide shortage
    of water caused by a combination of a changing climate and pressure resulting
    from high demand of agricultural products, it is of primary importance to develop
    new irrigation control strategies that allow the minimization of water wastage
    while keeping associated costs at an affordable level. In this paper we describe
    the design of an intelligent decision support system and its integration with
    a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN) to implement closed-loop zone specific
    irrigation control in greenhouses via wireless communication. Our research focuses
    on the provision of proactive applications by deploying sensor networks and connecting
    sensor data with actuators through an adaptive and able to learn decision-making
    layer. The system developed provides real-time monitoring and control of both
    agricultural inputs and outputs (irrigation control). A rule editor with a graphical
    user interface (GUI) is used by the domain-expert to initialize the knowledge
    base. The system is optimized to adapt to changes in crop development by configuring
    the rule parameters in the system ontology. In addition, machine learning is employed
    to enrich systems’ knowledge base. The remaining of the paper is organized as
    follows. Section 2 gives an overall description of the developed system. The topics
    covered in this discussion include the layered modular architecture of the system,
    the WSAN platform, the supported sensors and their interfacing to the platform,
    the ontology-based decision making layer and the machine learning process followed
    to extend system knowledge. Section 3 details the technological and agronomic
    results. It provides an evaluation of the developed system in terms of a prototype
    deployment, the derivation of new rules from the machine learning experiments
    performed, the WSN performance analysis and the mote lifetime estimation by using
    analytical models, the agronomic impact of the system and also provides a discussion
    of related work and lessons learnt. Finally, Section 4 presents a summary of this
    work. 2. Materials and methods The overall goal of the research and development
    work described in this paper is to design a new plant growth monitoring and control
    system comprising: • a distributed network of sensors for accurately sensing the
    plant growth activity and environmental conditions, and plant growth control actuators;
    • ontology-based decision support mechanisms that associate sensor data with actuator
    commands; • a machine learning process for enhancing plant state diagnosis based
    on logged data; and • a set of tools that facilitate the specification of applications
    and the visualization of measuring parameters and assessed states. As an application
    example of the above system we have considered an intelligent irrigation control
    strategy applied to protected agricultural crops that can improve the environmental
    and economic sustainability of the greenhouse sector. 2.1. System overview The
    system is organized in a layered modular approach to allow flexibility and extensibility.
    A layered system architecture decouples the low-level sensory communication from
    the application business logic; the former gathers raw data from sensors, while
    the latter can be captured as an hierarchy of rules (Goumopoulos et al., 2007).
    In this way, applications do not depend on a specific sensor or a protocol that
    this sensor uses to transfer data values. Therefore, new sensor devices that emerge
    for a selected plant parameter can be integrated to the system without disturbing
    the other modules. Similarly, a different wireless communication protocol can
    be used without affecting the application business logic. This approach allowed
    us to develop and evaluate precision agriculture applications with diverse system
    and technology configurations (Goumopoulos et al., 2007, Goumopoulos et al., 2009,
    Goumopoulos, 2012). Fig. 1 illustrates the system architecture in a high level
    view. In yellow color are shown the components that are discussed in this paper.
    In the lower layer various sensors/actuators that can collectively form composite
    WSANs, provide the raw data and the means to activate devices associated with
    agricultural inputs (e.g., irrigation). In the driver’s layer, a specific driver
    is designed and implemented for each WSAN implementing the hardware communication
    protocol. The coordinator of the WSAN is connected to the corresponding gateway
    at the backend system which collects all sensor measurements before forwarding
    them to populate a relational database. The system architecture embraces the use
    of standalone devices that communicate directly with a driver through a device-specific
    communication protocol. These devices are usually complex sensors such as an infrared
    (IR) imaging system, and the PAM meter. The latter which is used in our prototype
    employs the so-called Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation (PAM) measuring principle to
    provide a selective measure of the relative chlorophyll fluorescence quantum yield
    for determining the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant. This parameter acts
    as a general plant health indicator and provides a reference for the classification
    process of the machine learning algorithm applied. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. High-level system architecture. The functionality of the backend
    system is supported by the following main components: Ontology, Decision Support
    System (DSS), and Machine Learning (ML). The ontology specifies all the rules
    that support the decision-making process in the form of a knowledge base. The
    DSS provides all the synthetic information, acquired from the analysis of the
    stored data, needed to make operative decisions for the plant growth management.
    The purpose of the ML component is to analyze the structured information using
    machine learning and data mining techniques in order to find interesting new correlations.
    A number of tools have also been developed to support the application development.
    2.2. WSAN platform and sensor/actuator interfacing The hardware platform used
    is the 25 mm mote developed at Tyndall (Bellis et al., 2005, Tyndall, 2014). The
    hardware platform is analogous to a Lego™-like 25 mm × 25 mm stackable system
    (Fig. 2). The module contains an Atmel ATMega128L 8-bit microcontroller and a
    Chipcon CC2420 ZigBee RF chip both of which are combined on one layer. The microcontroller
    is equipped with 128 KB in-system flash memory and can be programmed to handle
    analogue to digital conversion (ADC) of sensor data and the communication networking
    protocols for interfacing with the RF transceiver to achieve communication with
    other nodes. The CC2420 transceiver used is 802.15.4 compliant – and as such can
    cover 16 channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Current consumption is very low with transmit
    and receive currents typically 17.4 mA and 19.7 mA and 1 μA in sleep mode. Stacked
    upon this RF microcontroller layer is our custom sensor/actuator interface layer,
    which allows any combination of eight different sensors or actuators to be connected
    to the 25 mm module. On the software side, the microcontroller runs a tailored
    version of TinyOS, an optimised operating system that allows fast configuration
    of the sensor nodes. The power layer may include batteries or other energy supply
    or power harvesting mechanisms, i.e., solar cells or piezo electric power generation
    mechanisms. An 25 mm Li-ion battery layer is also provided with built-in USB charger
    capability. In an early version of the system the authors have investigated an
    alternative configuration of the Tyndall25 mote regarding the communication layer
    (Nordic VLSI nRF2401 2.4 GHz RF transceiver) and the network topology (peer-to-peer)
    (Goumopoulos et al., 2007). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Tyndall25
    mote modular platform. 2.2.1. Communication protocol and topology The communication
    protocol used in our case is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE 802.15.4
    Standard, 2006) which specifies the physical layer and the Medium Access Control
    (MAC) layer of the protocol. IEEE 802.15.4 combined with the ZigBee open specification
    specify a protocol stack for the development of short-range and low power communications
    for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs). The basic configuration of the IEEE
    802.15.4 permits a transfer rate of 250 Kbps to a distance range of 10–100 m in
    the 2.4 GHz frequency band depending on the antenna, the environment and the power
    consumption permitted by a given application. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard supports
    two addressing schemes, either short (16 bit) or long addresses (IEEE 64 bit)
    so theoretical network size is up to 65536 or 264 nodes. A maximum frame size
    of 127 bytes is supported with a payload of up to 114 bytes (assuming short addresses).
    An IEEE 802.15.4 network consists of one PAN coordinator and a set of devices
    which are classified as reduced functionality devices (RFD) and full functionality
    devices (FFD). The interconnection of these devices allow the creation of three
    types of topologies: star (the PAN coordinator is in the transmission range of
    all other devices resulting in single-hop communication), mesh or peer-to-peer
    (a node may communicate with any neighbor enabling multi-hop communication) and
    cluster-tree (a combination of the previous topologies where the PAN coordinator
    is the root of the tree and all the non-leaf devices are defined as coordinators
    with the ability to forward the packets to/from the root). The physical layer
    of IEEE 802.15.4 uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) with Collision Avoidance
    (CA) to access the radio channel (IEEE 802.15.4 Standard, 2006). The MAC layer
    enables two different operational modes: non beacon-enabled mode and beacon enabled
    mode. In the former case the access control is governed by non-slotted CSMA/CA,
    where as in the latter case the network coordinator broadcasts a special frame
    (a beacon) periodically that permits the synchronization of the associated devices.
    In our current system we use the non-beacon mode and thus our network topology
    is a star topology. Selecting the non-beacon mode was mandatory due to the unavailability
    of a beacon-mode implementation for our WSAN platform. In the star topology the
    coordinator and the actuator controlling motes are powered from the mains source,
    where as the sensor motes are battery powered. Given that the plant processes
    we want to monitor and control (e.g. plant dehydration) are slow, the use of low
    sampling intervals (in the order of 5–30 min) is acceptable to save energy. In
    addition, the data to be transmitted is of low complexity resulting in limited
    payloads on the IEEE 802.15.4 data frames. A sampling rate of 5 min with a payload
    of only 18 bytes (total data frame size 33 bytes) gives a sampling rate of 0.88
    bps which is very low compared to the medium transmission rate (250 Kbps). This
    low sampling rate affects the collision probability and allows achieving a high
    successful packet delivery rate for a sufficient number of nodes provided that
    nodes can awake in a random manner during the specified sampling interval to take
    measurements and transmit their values, as we will explain in the evaluation part
    of the sensor network. The protected environment of greenhouses provides also
    the possibility of using a range of facilities like mains power for certain devices
    (e.g. controlling of water pumps). By using the star topology we have avoided
    well known complications that are related with the use of the beacon-enabled mode
    such as clock drifts between coordinators in cluster tree topologies, dynamic
    network resynchronization in the case a cluster joins/leaves the network and the
    need for dynamic rearrangement of duty cycles in the case of a coordinator failure.
    2.2.2. Sensors The interfacing of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors generally
    requires special hardware for each sensor. This is because different sensors may
    have different power requirements and output type and range. Three types of sensors
    had to be interfaced for the Tyndall25 mote: soil moisture sensors, humidity sensors
    and thermistors for determining leaf/air temperature. The main properties of these
    sensors are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Sensors interfaced to the 25 mm mote.

    http://www.sensirion.com http://www.cantherm.com 2.2.2.1. Soil moisture sensor
    Soil moisture can be measured by electromagnetic sensors which determine volumetric
    water content (VWC) and occasionally electrical conductivity in the soil under
    consideration. The correlation between the electromagnetic signals measured and
    VWC is attributed to the high permittivity of water which can be inferred by the
    sensors through various means (e.g., time, frequency and capacitance). In our
    case the ECHO EC-10 soil moisture probe by Decagon was selected. It uses the capacitance
    technique to measure the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium which
    can then be related to the VWC of the soil. The ECHO EC-10 sensor provides fast
    measurements with very low power consumption, giving the ability to take many
    measurements over a long period of time (e.g., a growing season) with minimal
    battery usage. Regarding the accuracy of the measured VWC the manufacturer recommends
    establishing soil-specific calibration functions (Campbell, 2004). The soil used
    in our applications was a peat substrate. A series of soil/water mixtures were
    used and the corresponding sensor responses were recorded. The process was performed
    for different sensors and the average values of 3 repetitions were used to obtain
    the following equation: (1) Soil moisture sensor outputs could be input directly
    into the analogue to digital converter because they are in the voltage range of
    the microcontroller. 2.2.2.2. Humidity sensor For measuring humidity we have selected
    the SHT11 component from Sensirion which also provides temperature measurements.
    A capacitive sensor element is used for measuring relative humidity while temperature
    is measured by a band-gap sensor. The device also integrates signal processing
    and provides a fully calibrated digital output. To obtain the relative humidity
    we used the accuracy enhancement formula that is provided by the manufacturer
    (Sensirion, 2011): (2) where SORH is the humidity readout value (12-bit length),
    C1 = −2.0468, C2 = 0.0367 and C3 = −1.5955 * 10−6. The humidity sensor provides
    its output in a digital format which can be input directly into the microcontroller.
    2.2.2.3. Temperature sensor There are different types of sensors that are used
    for temperature measurement in greenhouses. Of the sensors available, thermistors
    were chosen as they have high sensitivity to minute changes in temperature (change
    in resistance vs. temperature on a scale of −3%/°C to −6%/°C for NTC thermistors),
    low thermal mass, high thermal conduction, low cost and are small enough to be
    placed on the plant leaf. Two important parameters that must be taken into account
    when designing a temperature measurement system are resolution and accuracy. The
    temperature resolution is the smallest detectable incremental change of temperature
    that can be detected by the system. Thermistors’ inherent high sensitivity can
    provide high resolution measurements. The temperature accuracy is the maximum
    difference that will exist between the real temperature (which must be measured
    by a reference thermometer) and the measured value by the system. In our case,
    we have selected a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor (i.e. resistance
    decreases as temperature increases) with high resistance tolerance (±0.5%) and
    a nominal resistance of 10 kΩ at 25 °C (Cantherm, 2006). The measurement system
    we have designed achieves a temperature resolution of 0.02 °C and an accuracy
    of ±0.05 °C over a temperature range of 5–45 °C. The resolution and accuracy of
    temperature measurement is critical for the precision irrigation application we
    developed and therefore we have carefully designed the corresponding system. Moreover,
    higher resolution and accuracy are required for the machine learning experiments
    that will be described later in the paper. A characteristic of thermistors is
    the non-linear relationship between thermistors resistance (Rth) measured in ohms,
    and temperature (T) measured in Kelvin, as given by the well-known Steinhart–Hart
    thermistor equation or the simpler B-parameter equation: (3) where R0 is the resistance
    value at reference temperature T0 (typically 25 °C/298.15 K), B is the B or Beta
    value, which is an indication of the slope of the Rth–T curve (the higher the
    Beta value the greater the change in resistance per degree C). Both R0 and B are
    specified in the sensor data sheet. R∞ is the thermistor resistance as the temperature
    approaches infinity. Eq. (3) solved for T is written as: (4) The measurement system
    provides temperature values in three steps: 1. Measurement of the conditioning
    circuit output voltage by means of the ADC module. 2. Calculation of the thermistor
    resistance from the ADC value. 3. Calculation of the temperature using Eq. (4).
    In order to obtain both high precision and high resolution temperature values
    by the measurement system several design choices have to be made in the above
    three steps. A conditioning circuit is used to interface thermistors to the ADC
    module of the Tyndall25 mote working with an external reference voltage of 2.5
    V (Vref) for 12-bit ADC. The conditioning circuit includes four high precision
    resistors (0.1% tolerance) and a high precision operational amplifier (op-amp)
    with low noise and low offset voltage that scales and shifts the analog signal
    of the thermistor voltage in order to correctly map the required thermistor resistance
    range to the voltage range (0–2.5 V) supported by the ADC module. To overcome
    the impact of the circuit component uncertainties and get highly accurate measurements
    careful calibration was performed, matching the output of the measuring system
    to a set of known reference values. Details of this calibration process are omitted
    due to lack of space. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the calibration data and also the
    thermistor resistance variation compared to the temperature variation. The figure
    shows also the linear fit of the curves that could be used for applications that
    can afford lower accuracy measurements. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Calibration data plot. 2.2.3. Irrigation system Fig. 4 shows the schematic
    layout of the irrigation distribution unit. In principle, the mote’s controlling
    software, via a transistor switch, activates a relay that in turn activates the
    pump device. The interface layer sits on top of the Tyndall25 mote as additional
    layers cannot be placed above it due to the size of the connectors attached to
    it. In order to toggle the external relay, which is part of the actuator portion,
    12 V must be supplied at the interface layer output. The heart of the actuator
    portion of the interface layer is a simple transistor switch that is controlled
    by the microcontroller. When the software running on the microcontroller toggles
    the appropriate output a voltage is supplied to the base of the transistor and
    the switch is turned on and 12 V is supplied to the relay which is connected to
    a Harwin M30-610 connector. The 12 V supply voltage is used not only for the actuators
    but also to power all possibly connected sensors and the entire Tyndall25 mote.
    The interface layer contains a Torex XC6202 voltage regulator to regulate the
    12 V supply down to 3.3 V in order to power the mote and connected sensors. Download

    unit. In order for this system to work the mote has to take commands from the
    coordinator node so as to know what section to irrigate and for how long. The
    coordinator sends a command via its radio link to the associated node controlling
    the actuator. This command is sent to the module in the irrigation distribution
    unit that converts the signal to a voltage level that the microcontroller can
    read. Once the microcontroller receives a valid command according to the decision
    making output it will actuate the pump valve and open a particular solenoid in
    order to irrigate a specific section of the crop layout. The solenoid operated
    water valves distribute the watering supply in four distinct zones of plants.
    A fifth water valve provides humidity control. The pumps used in the system are
    the Whale Whisperflo UP0815 pressure pump with a flow rate of 8 L min−1. The solenoids
    are manufactured by Bermad, model S-390-2-R. 2.3. Ontology-based DSS and tools
    At the heart of the back-end system (Fig. 1) lies the DSS component which is build
    on top of an ontology. An ontology is a tool that can conceptualize a world view
    by capturing general knowledge and providing basic notions and concepts for basic
    terms (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). The ontology developed defines domain concepts
    and relations among them. It provides a vocabulary for expressing the decision-making
    rules based on plant and environmental sensing parameters which are related with
    a set of sensors and actuators as well as correlated biological information (Fig.
    5). The specification of the ontology was performed using the Protégé ontology
    development tool (http://protege.stanford.edu/) based on the OWL standard language.
    An in depth discussion of the ontology design is provided by Goumopoulos et al.
    (2009). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Part of the system ontology
    hierarchy. In this context, the decision-making process is based on a set of rules
    in operational representation forms, which are applied on existent knowledge and
    allow the use of the ontology for reasoning providing inferential and validation
    mechanisms. For example, there is a need for a set of rules that will take into
    account both plant and environmental parameters and the description of a plant
    in order to diagnose a plant’s state. Other rules would take into account the
    plant’s state, its description and user defined policies to determine the possible
    actions of the system, such as the request for a resource. An inference engine
    is used for the decision-making process. The inference engine module exploits
    the Jess (Java Expert System Shell) rule engine (http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/).
    The execution of this module starts based on the initial facts and the rules stored
    in the rule base using CLIPS format. The concepts that appear in the rules have
    emerged from the ontology. Essentially, this is an approach of building rules
    on top of ontologies. Therefore, the reasoning is based on the definition of the
    ontology, by using first-order predicate calculus. The user, however, can define
    or update existing rules using a front-end tool and expressing the rules with
    simple if-then-else logic. A number of tools have been developed to facilitate
    the development, configuration and monitoring of applications. For each node in
    the WSAN we provide a driver operator configuration software that specifies the
    actions to setup the properties of the WSAN in order to make it functional for
    the agricultural application. This configuration provides also the definition
    of certain parameters that will allow the proper interpretation of the data received
    by the device operator. Fig. 6 illustrates the interface defined for configuring
    the Tyndall25-based WSAN. Options include setting the mote to be configured, its
    frequency channel and position in the field, the active ADCs and the type of the
    associated sensor/actuator. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Tyndall25-based
    WSAN driver configuration software. Fig. 7 shows the design of the ‘Heat Stress’
    calculation rule for the irrigation application using a simple rule editing tool
    targeted to the domain expert, which provides a visual interface based on a node
    connection model. The rule consists of three conditions combined with a logical
    AND node. An expression builder facilitates the definition of the condition relying
    on concepts stored in the ontology. The rule, as designed, states that when all
    conditions are met then the heat stress state of the RC area must be set to active
    (HeatStress ACTIVE). The Supervisor Logic and Data Acquisition (SLADA) tool is
    another tool used to view knowledge represented into the ontology, monitor and
    log plant/environmental parameters and manage dynamically the rules taking part
    in the decision-making process in co-operation with the rule editor. The rule
    editor and the SLADA tool are described in detail in Goumopoulos et al. (2007).

    agriculture it is feasible to extract new knowledge from stored data in the form
    of models that are in an easy to manage form by the decision making system and
    understandable to the domain expert involved in the crop production process (Dimitriadis
    and Goumopoulos, 2008). Elaborating on our previous research work, we used classification
    algorithms, which produce a classifier as a set of rules or decision trees that
    can be then exploited to predict the classification of new data cases and can
    insert new rules to the domain model. Before that, the application of clustering
    algorithms based on particular proximity criteria-attributes can create hypotheses
    about the relationships that can be found in the dataset and identify the natural
    groupings in the input data. We devised a machine learning process model that
    guides machine learning experimentation with an aim to incorporate derived rules
    and attributes into the decision-making mechanism (Fig. 8). This process is an
    expanded form of the process model for machine learning application in agriculture
    that was created by the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) group
    in University of Waikato in New Zealand (Witten and Frank, 2005). The close cooperation
    between the data mining expert and the plant science field expert is required
    in several phases. In the pre-processing and analysis phases, their collaboration
    will shape the datasets upon which the machine learning algorithms shall operate.
    The responsibility of the field expert is to review and interpret the appropriateness
    of the data and suggest possible transformations and/or relaxations. The responsibility
    of the data mining expert is to guarantee that the inferred rules correspond satisfactorily
    to the evaluated measures (e.g., overall success rate and false positive rate)
    from the machine learning perspective. Regarding the data mining process, algorithms
    provided by the WEKA workbench are used. At the post-processing phase the field
    expert could indicate which subset of the derived rules establishes new valuable
    knowledge, and which part describes common knowledge. To estimate the performance
    of classifiers generated from the entire data set of example cases, the 10-fold
    cross validation approach to training and testing was used. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Machine learning process model. 3. Experiments and results
    Strawberry plants (Fragaria ananassa) have been selected for system validation
    and evaluation because the delivered technology can be relevant to the commercial
    production of this crop, while on a practical level, the size of the leaves enables
    easy attachment of sensors. In addition, irrigation control on strawberry plants
    is important as they have a shallow root system making them particularly sensitive
    to water stress. On the other hand, controlling excessive irrigation is significant
    for avoiding nutrient leaching and disease development that affect negatively
    the crop yield. The most effective balance needs to be achieved between these
    two requirements. The irrigation treatments, controlled by our system, were imposed
    from the beginning of the flowering to the end of the fruit maturity from early
    June to late July in a greenhouse establishment at the University College Cork
    in Ireland (Fig. 9) in the context of the PLANTS project (daisy.cti.gr/plants/)
    funded by the European Community under the Information Society Technologies Programme.
    A subset of this experiment was performed using a different WSAN platform (Crossbow
    MICAz) and the results regarding this configuration are discussed in Goumopoulos
    (2012). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Experimental setup (left);
    drip-feed into a pot (right). 3.1. Plant signals and environmental parameters
    The primary plant signals and environmental parameters explored during application
    development are: Plant’s leaf Temperature (PT), Chlorophyll Fluorescence (CF),
    Ambient Temperature (AT), Humidity (H) and Soil Moisture (SM). PT was chosen as
    it indicates drought and heat stress (Mannini and Anconelli, 1993). The former
    is due to lack of water and will be reflected in the stomata (leaf pores) closing
    when the plants are under water stress and with the shutdown of transpiration
    the leaves will begin to heat up (i.e., monitoring the temperature of the leafs
    to determine drought state). On the other hand, heat stress can occur independently
    of water stress when the environmental temperature gets very high and transpiration
    cannot maintain leaf cooling. By comparing PT and AT one can deduce an indication
    of plant stress. The addition of the SM parameter enables the system to decide
    between heat stress (i.e. plant has adequate water but temperature is high) and
    drought stress (i.e. both water content is low and temperature is high). The CF
    parameter serves as the feedback mechanism to determine the state of the photosynthetic
    rate of the plant and from this determine how productive or stressed the plant
    is under the current conditions (Norikane et al., 2003). We use this parameter
    for the machine learning process. A healthy plant absorbs light from the sun and
    directs a proportion of the energy absorbed (slightly above 80%) to photosynthesis,
    through chlorophyll a. This proportion can be determined by providing a very bright
    pulse of light and determining the difference between minimal and maximal fluorescence.
    Any decline in this proportion indicates a reduction in the efficiency with which
    light is converted to photosynthetic product, and such a decline is often seen
    when a plant is stressed. So when plants become dehydrated or are otherwise stressed,
    they are often less able to convert sunlight into photosynthetic product and this
    stress can be detected using fluorescence (Razavi et al., 2008). Fluorometers
    that use the PAM technique (PAM meter) work by rapidly sending brief pulses of
    light to a plant. A healthy plant responds to this light very quickly (within
    microseconds) by re-emitting some of the light energy as fluorescence which is
    detected by the fluorometer. CF measurements are taken using a standalone sensor
    device (Junior PAM1), whereas PT, AT, H and SM measurements are taken by the WSAN.
    3.2. System deployment The experimental setup consists of an array of 96 plants
    placed in a glasshouse, arranged in an array of 12 by 8. Four different zones
    are defined: Left-Edge (LE), Right-Edge (RE), Left-Center (LC), Right-Center (RC).
    Also, there is one zone selected for misting which overlaps with the RC zone.
    The setup integrates 36 thermistors (8 ambient and 28 plant temperature thermistors)
    and 8 soil moisture probes into one system that when required can irrigate and
    also determine when to stop the irrigation. This deployment takes into account
    differences in the location of the plants in the overall area and will allow for
    independent irrigation of edge or centre zone plants as required. Eight Tyndall25
    motes are used for connecting the various sensors, one mote is sensorless and
    is used as a gateway with the backend system, and one mote is used for controlling
    the irrigation system. The motes are placed in IP-67 rated water-proof packaging
    to endure the field conditions (Fig. 9). Sensor mapping to the zones is managed
    with the WSAN configuration tool (Fig. 6). Sensor nodes are taking measurements
    at user-defined intervals. For this experiment the rate was 5 min. To reduce random
    noise each measurement is the average of ten sensor readings. SM, PT and AT values
    are calculated from measurements taken by multiple sensors deployed in a zone.
    For the SM and AT parameters the average is calculated since a few sensors are
    involved (up to 3). In case of PT, where more sensors are involved (up to 10),
    both the mean and the median values have been considered and finally the median
    has been selected because of its robustness to outliers. The PAM meter sensor
    has been used for collecting data only from the RC area. The timewindow for measuring
    the photosynthetic activity is set between 9 am and 5 pm. The sensor uses a magnetic
    clamp to hold the plant leaf about 1 mm from the end of the light pipe. In order
    to receive readings from the PAM meter, successive measuring cycles must be initiated
    by the corresponding device driver. Each cycle starts with illuminating the leaf
    of the plant with an actinic light, followed by a saturation pulse, followed by
    a measurement. Then the driver pulses the leaf with increasing quantities of actinic
    light to get characterisation curves that contain information on the state of
    the leaf. A sequential protocol to communicate with the PAM meter has been implemented.
    The communication is done via the COM port connected to the PAM meter using a
    standard cable. The PAM meter uses a series of ASCII commands that are sent from
    the controlling device in a binary format. Some of these commands control the
    saturation pulse (i.e. ‘s’) and the actinic light intensity (e.g., ‘ai3’, ‘ai4’,
    etc.) and others like the ‘etr’ command request specific readings from the sensor.
    In particular, actinic light intensity commands also request PAR (photosynthetically
    active radiance) readings transmitted from the PAM meter. For example, actinic
    intensity ai3 will have a PAR value of 50, ai4 a PAR value of 70, etc. A delay
    of at least 100 ms is required between character transmissions, whereas a delay
    of up to 10 s is necessary between commands. Table 2 contains the application
    rules for the RC zone with thresholds specialized for the reproductive phase of
    strawberries. It is possible the threshold values to vary depending on the growing
    phase of the crop. In the strawberry fruiting stage, for example, more irrigation
    is required for quality production. In Table 2 we have shown a separate rule that
    defines the variable RCSMThreshold to the proper threshold value during the reproductive
    phase of the crop. Similarly, another rule defines the variable IrrigationThreshold
    with the proper value in the same growing phase. Note that the SM threshold can
    be defined to be both zone-specific and growing phase-specific, where as the irrigation
    threshold is defined to be the same for all zones. Existing knowledge from the
    horticulture literature can be easily integrated into our system through the ontology
    and rule editing tools discussed earlier. The uncertainty of the decisions can
    be modeled with confidence factors that can be integrated into the rules (Goumopoulos
    et al., 2007). Table 2. Application rules. Rule Body RCDroughtStress IF RCLeafTemperature
    – RCAmbientTemperature > 0.9 °C THEN RCDroughtStress ← TRUE ELSE RCDroughtStress
    ← FALSE RCHeatStress IF RCDroughtStress AND RCSoilMoisture > RCSMThreshold THEN
    RCHeatStress ← TRUE ELSE RCHeatStress ← FALSE RCNeedIrrigation IF RCDroughtStress
    AND NOT RCHeatStress THEN RCNeedIrrigation ← TRUE ELSE RCNeedIrrigation ← FALSE
    RCNeedMisting IF RCDroughtStress AND RCHeatStress THEN RCNeedMisting ← TRUE ELSE
    RCNeedMisting ← FALSE RCSMThreshold IF GrowingPhase = REPRODUCTIVE THEN RCSMThreshold
    ← 0.6 IrrigationThreshold IF GrowingPhase = REPRODUCTIVE THEN IrrigationThreshold
    ← 1800 s Two additional parameters must be defined for the prototype to be properly
    working: the duration of irrigation/misting and an idle time, which specifies
    the amount of time the rules should be disabled, after the action is performed.
    This is to allow the ecosystem to absorb the changes. The values used for the
    example application were 30 min/1 min and 4 h respectively. The irrigation system
    uses a reservoir, a pump system, standard pipe work, nipples and drippers which
    emit water directly into the plant pot. Flow rate depends on the pump pressure.
    The emitter flow rate per pot is regulated at 1 L h−1 with an application efficiency
    of 95%. In the misting system the drippers are replaced by nozzles that are designed
    to produce a fine spray. 3.3. Machine learning experiments For the machine learning
    experiments datasets collected by the deployed system were used. The attributes
    involved are: CF, PT, SM, AT, PAR, and the derived properties ETR (electron transport
    rate), QE (quantum efficiency of photosynthesis), InfPAR (inflection PAR), and
    the learning goals DS (DroughtStress) and HS (HeatStress) categorized with values
    TRUE/FALSE. The ETR is calculated within PAM meter by combining the CF (represented
    by several fluorescence quotients) and PAR measurements (Pfündel, 2007). InfPAR
    is calculated on the ETR vs. saturated PAR curve (Fig. 10); the curve is calculated
    using a second degree least squares algorithm. The point of inflection is calculated
    as the intersection point between the asymptotic lines of the curve’s first derivative.
    QE is the slope of the above curve. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.
    ETR vs. saturated PAR curve. Data gathering was performed for a period of seven
    weeks corresponding to the reproductive phase of the crop. For analysis purposes
    we have divided this process into two stages. The first stage is represented in
    a dataset called “ETR_Photosynthetic Activity” which includes only the properties
    related to the plants photosynthetic activity and a characterization of the plant
    DS state, used as the classification parameter of the applied learning algorithms,
    within 234 instances (half of them were characterized as stressed and half as
    not stressed). The classification was done manually by domain experts. The aim
    was to acquire rules that determine the DS status of the plant based on its photosynthetic
    activity (rules #1 and #2 in Table 3). The second stage leverages on the knowledge
    acquired by the previous stage and is represented in a dataset called “MultiParameterCorrelation”
    which includes all attributes, the HS class assessed by the built-in rules (Table
    2) and the DS class assessed by both built-in and inferred rules from the first
    stage, within 4032 instances. The aim was to find new correlations between plant
    stress states and sensor measurements (rules #3–#7 in Table 3). The attribute
    Δtmp denotes the difference between plant and ambient temperature. By examining
    the list of the inferred rules it is obvious that rules #4 and #5 can collide
    with rule #1. Consequently, the rules that have been inferred might not be in
    a fully operational form. To alleviate this specific issue we need to conjugate
    the condition part of rules #4 and #5 with the term “SM > 60” in order to differentiate
    between DS and HS assessment. Table 3. Part of the rules derived by running machine
    learning algorithms. # Inferred rule Correctly classified (%) 1 IF (InfPAR ⩽ 319)
    THEN DS = TRUE 100 2 IF (QE < 0.87) THEN DS = TRUE 100 3 IF (AT ⩾ 18.5 AND AT
    ⩽ 28.5 AND PT ⩾ 20.8 AND PT ⩽ 29.9 AND Δtmp ⩾ 3.3 AND Δtmp ⩽ -1.3) THEN HS = TRUE
    100 4 IF (InfPAR ⩽ 243) THEN HS = TRUE 95 5 IF (PT ( 19 AND InfPAR ⩽ 313) THEN
    HS = TRUE 95 6 IF SM ⩽ 0.62 THEN DS = TRUE 91 7 IF Δtmp ⩾ 0.84 THEN DS = TRUE
    85 Based on the suggested machine learning process model (Fig. 8) and by using
    the WEKA feature selection tools we analyzed the relation between the parameters
    of lower informational value and the learning goals, and we created new data sets
    for each classification goal. This methodology disqualifies the appearance of
    complicated rules with many parameters not related to the classification class.
    Furthermore, we see in Table 3 that the rules for the prediction of the DS can
    be based on 3 different parameters. By having such a pluralism, the failure of
    a sensor may not be critical for the assessment of a state. Rules #6 and #7 in
    Table 3 are particularly interesting as they indicate a possible refinement on
    the threshold values of the corresponding rules for the assessment of the DS state
    with respect to the ones used by the built-in rules. Although the horticulture
    literature suggests a Δtmp value of 1 °C (Mannini and Anconelli, 1993) our machine
    learning experimentation indicates that this could be refined to 0.84 °C. Such
    an update can benefit the adaptation of the system in the current environment
    and improve the precision of the applied rules. This refinement has been also
    explored by the application of the Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm
    of the WEKA workbench in terms of the PT, AT and SM attributes. The result was
    a four cluster set which is graphically depicted in Fig. 11. As the plot depicts,
    each cluster is generally allocated in one of the four areas separated by the
    dotted vertical and horizontal lines. The different colors indicate the cluster
    a data instance belongs to. Black, blue red and cyan refer to cluster C0, C1,
    C2 and C3 respectively. Cluster 3 contains approximately 95% of the instances
    marked as healthy (DS = FALSE and HS = FALSE). All instances belonging to clusters
    1 and 2 needed irrigation treatment. For cluster 0, 82% of the instances required
    misting treatment and the rest were healthy. Finally, 9% of the instances belonging
    to cluster 3 requested irrigation and 3% requested misting. All other instances
    were stated as healthy. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Clustering
    of the “MultiParameterCorrelation” dataset. 3.4. WSN performance In this section
    we analyze the WSN performance focusing mainly on the estimation of the packet
    loss rate in terms of the number of motes and the duty cycle of the system. The
    duty cycle is defined as the ratio of the time required to sense and transmit
    a sample of the sensors attached to the mote to the sampling period. We assume
    a star topology formed by a set of sensor motes and a coordinator powered from
    the main source. We assume a steady state network where child nodes have already
    been associated to the coordinator node. The unslotted CSMA/CA protocol is used
    for the channel access, briefly described next. Two variables are used for each
    transmission attempt: number of backoff retries (NB) and backoff exponent (BE).
    In the beginning these variables are initialized as NB = 0 and BE = macMINBE (default
    value is 3). NB represents the number of backoff retries before assuming a channel
    access failure having a range between 0 and 5. The 802.15.4 MAC layer uses BE
    to choose a random backoff between 0 and 2BE – 1 to delay the Clear Channel Assessment
    (CCA) phase. BE has a range between 0 and 5 (setting BE to 0 means CSMA/CA is
    switched off). After the backoff period the MAC layer issues a CCA and if the
    channel is clear transmission can start. If the channel is found to be busy, both
    NB and BE are incremented by 1 and a new backoff is attempted. If NB exceeds the
    maximum threshold (macMaxCSMABackoffs = 5) then transmission is aborted. After
    the transmission the node waits for an ack frame. If the ack is successfully received,
    the transmission is considered successful. Our analysis is based on the analytical
    models developed by Timmons and Scanlon (2004) to describe the performance of
    the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol focusing on the estimation of the lifetime of an 802.15.4
    network of sensors in a star topology. For a network of n sensors the probability
    that the channel is clear in the CCA phase after the first backoff interval is
    given by the following formula: (5) where q is the probability of a node transmitting
    at any time. This probability depends in our case on the sampling period interval
    (SPI) defined for taking measurements and the payload size of the data frame.
    We do not take into account the polling messages from a sensor node to the network
    coordinator since these messages are very sparse (a pooling message is sent every
    measurements, approximately three times a day). The total size of the data frame
    is 33 bytes (18 bytes payload, 9 bytes MAC headers and 6 bytes PHY headers). So
    q is calculated as follows: (6) where TDF is the data frame transmission time.
    To estimate the packet loss rate we need to take into account the cumulative probability
    to find the channel clear so that packet transmission can happen (Ptr) by taking
    into account up to five backoff intervals as defined in the 802.15.4 CSMA/CA protocol
    and the probability of packet collision due to the fact that two or more nodes
    can select the same delay and transmit simultaneously. Ptr is defined as follows
    (Timmons and Scanlon, 2004): (7) Given that the probability of selecting the same
    backoff delay leading to collision is we can approximate the packet loss rate
    as follows: (8) The analysis shows that for a large number of sensors (up to 1000)
    with a low duty cycle (0.04% corresponding to an SPI of 5 min) both the probabilities
    of the channel being free for transmission and of not having a collision are greater
    than 99%. This means that the loss of packets is negligible. For the rather small
    number of devices used in our application it would be also more efficient to remove
    the CSMA/CA technique to avoid the initial backoff period and thus save more power.
    Fig. 12 shows the effect of the duty cycle of the system (determined by the selected
    SPI) on the packet loss rate for a constant payload size of 100 bytes. The results
    demonstrate that for a sufficient number of sensors duty cycles up to 1% give
    an acceptable packet loss rate in the range of 5%. Download : Download full-size

    The sensor motes operate according to the duty cycle in order to achieve the monitoring
    requirements of the application and conserve power by entering as much as possible
    to the sleeping mode. The energy consumption can be modeled by the following equation:
    (9) where ESense, ETx, ERx, EInit and ESleep represnt the energy consumed for
    sampling the sensors attached to the mote, transmitting data frames and receiving
    ack frames, initializing the mote and sleeping. Energy ESense is calculated as
    follows: (10) where V is the battery voltage (3.3 V), Ic is the current consumption
    to sample a sensor and ts is the total time to sample a sensor during a time interval
    T. Assuming a sampling period interval SPI then where tm is the measurement time
    for each sampling. For each sensor the Ic and tm values are defined in Table 1.
    Assuming SPI = 5 min Table 4 summarizes the energy consumption for the mote. In
    every cycle the sensing and the transmission operations are taking place only
    once. The duty cycle (DC) of the service is measured at 0.04% and the average
    power consumption is approximated by the following equation: (11) where Pactive
    is the sensing and transmission power consumption and Psleep is the sleep mode
    power consumption. From Table 4 the average power consumption is estimated to
    151 μW. Lifetime of the mote can be computed as where CBATT is the battery capacity
    (expressed in mAh) and E is the average energy given in Table 4. Using a 3.3 V
    Li-ion battery of 500 mAh the lifetime of the mote will be 1.2 years whereas a
    battery of 1200 mAh will achieve a 2.9 years lifetime. Therefore, the mote lifetime
    can easily satisfy the full crop agronomic cycle of strawberries which is 200
    days. Table 4. Energy consumption measurements. Empty Cell Energy (mJ) Power (mW)

    of the strawberry field with the WSN and the plant-driven irrigation resulted
    in a notable reduction in water consumption (∼20%) with respect to traditional
    agricultural practices involving user defined timed irrigation based on rules
    of thumb (twice or thrice a week for 1–2 h). The latter was applied in a parallel
    setup for the same growing period of the crop. The irrigation treatments were
    imposed from the beginning of the flowering to the end of the fruit maturity from
    early June to late July. Since the objective of any crop cultivation is to achieve
    the highest yield, crop yield is the most effective way to evaluate the benefits
    of crop growth systems. Therefore we compared the plant-driven irrigation system
    with the traditional irrigation scheme, regarding strawberry growth, in terms
    of crop yield, water use efficiency and other yield parameters. In our experiment,
    the strawberry harvesting stage started about 28 days after flowering and there
    were ten harvests that took place every 3 days. The highest quality of the crop
    was noticed in the first rounds. At each round of the harvest period the yield,
    the number of strawberries and the average weight per strawberry were recorded.
    The dry weight of strawberries was also determined by drying them at 80 °C in
    an oven. Water use efficiency was also determined for each case as the ratio between
    yield and the water amount used. Statistical analysis of the collected data was
    performed by standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Statistical Package
    for the Social Sciences for Windows. The irrigation treatments were run as one-way
    ANOVA. Table 5 summarizes the comparison of the two irrigation treatments. There
    was no statistically significant difference between the yields achieved by the
    two irrigation treatments. Traditional irrigation produced a slightly higher yield
    than the plant-driven irrigation, which can be explained by the excess amount
    of water provided. Dry strawberry yields were similar as were the average number
    and average weight of strawberries. On the other hand, the water use efficiency
    of the plant-driven approach was significantly better than of the traditional
    approach. Therefore the plant-driven approach with the system configuration discussed
    in this paper was successful in providing the proper amount of water for the physiological
    growth of the crop producing similar crop yield with the traditional irrigation
    system. Table 5. Crop quality indicators for the different irrigation treatments.

    Related work and discussion Over the years there has been a tremendous progress
    on the application of WSN technology in the precision agriculture domain at various
    forms. In the work of Peres et al. (2011), for example, an Intelligent Precision
    Agriculture Gateway was developed that can provide middleware services between
    on site deployed WSNs and remote locations. Data are gathered by ZigBee operated
    WSNs that feed a local database which can be then queried by authorized remote
    clients. Usability and scalability issues are in the focus of their research.
    As another example, in the work of Garcia-Sanchez et al. (2011) an integrated
    WSN-based system for crop monitoring and video surveillance was developed in a
    distributed environment using cost effective communication technology (IEEE 802.15.4).
    Energy consumption, end-end transmission delays and network synchronization are
    some of the main features that have been addressed during system design by the
    authors. Irrigation scheduling based on WSNs has been proposed by Vellidis et
    al. (2008), by Kim et al. (2008) and by Pardossi et al. (2009). Coates et al.
    (2013) have integrated a commercial WSN with valve control software and hardware
    for agriculture irrigation based on soil moisture monitoring. The design of the
    actuator hardware and the development of the actuator firmware implementing a
    custom communication protocol are discussed in detail. A stress-test of the system
    was conducted with successful results. In a similar setup, Li et al. (2011) report
    a WSAN prototype deployed in a crop field for precision irrigation. While our
    system presents some common features with systems such as the above mentioned
    (e.g., the design and deployment of a WSAN for monitoring the crop and controlling
    irrigation), our overall solution is different in concept. We propose a new proactive
    computing model by looping sensor data with actuators through an adaptive and
    able to learn decision-making layer. In addition, the use of an ontology-based
    knowledge representation scheme for the organization of concepts and definition
    of operational semantics provides system flexibility and adaptability and supports
    the application of automatic inferential and validation mechanisms. Several implementations
    of WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses focusing mainly on crop and climate
    monitoring (Ahonen et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2008, Jimenez et al., 2012). The
    common characteristic of these implementations, independently of their state-of-the-art
    approaches in communication networking or hardware and software integration or
    their theoretical foundation, is that they tend to be simple prototypes which
    lack long-term evaluation. On the other hand, implementations that integrate wireless
    sensors with actuators for automatic control of greenhouse processes are limited.
    Park and Park (2011) developed a monitoring and control prototype that uses a
    WSN deployed in a greenhouse with a goal to gather environmental and plant based
    data. The data are used by a decision support system that attempts to optimize
    the greenhouse climate in order to improve crop productivity by controlling the
    HVAC system. The application logic is encoded in a set of rules which take into
    account current sensor values and actuator states. This prototype presents common
    features with the system we have developed but also has significant limitations
    regarding the size of deployment, the accuracy of measurements (no calibration
    of the used sensors is performed), the lack of supporting tools for application
    development and the lack of an overall system evaluation. Rule-based systems for
    irrigation management have been proposed in the field of agriculture in the form
    of expert systems (Thomson and Ross, 1996, Mohan and Arumugam, 1997). Knowledge
    acquisition is a basic building block of any expert system. Knowledge acquisition
    tools have been developed to help with building and maintaining the required knowledge
    (Rafea et al., 2003). Besides managing the existing knowledge acquired from the
    domain experts and literature using a handy rule editing tool, we have demonstrated
    in this paper the use of machine learning techniques to enhance the knowledge
    base with new rules for irrigation management. Two key parameters explored in
    the proposed rule-based irrigation control system are the plant leaf temperature
    (PT) and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF). Even though experimenting with strawberries
    we have not noticed significant differences in PT and CF between the leaves of
    a plant, this may not be true for other plants and other parameters. It is well
    accepted that plant-based techniques monitoring physiological responses require
    much replication for reliable data (Jones, 2004). In our prototype, for example,
    to get a representative measurement of the plant temperature in a specific zone,
    multiple sensors are used, scattered among multiple plants. Thermistors are used
    in our case because of their low cost, easy installation and high accuracy. Other
    solutions, such as IR imaging, which can scan the canopy of several plants, provide
    alternatives that have their own advantages and shortcomings (Wang et al., 2010).
    IR imaging may not provide as much as accuracy we require at an affordable cost,
    non-leaf objects can create noise and environmental factors such as reflectance,
    heating pipes and suspended light can significantly affect the results returned.
    Frequently, a manual image processing method is required for better accuracy.
    Regarding the CF parameter, this is mainly used for the machine learning process
    and works as a proof of concept that new rules can be learned based on this parameter.
    Irrigation decisions can then be based on multiple parameters and this, in principle,
    can improve system fault tolerance in case of a sensor failure. Undoubtedly, the
    robustness of the system can be improved by replicating the CF sensor. Our modular
    architecture allows the replacement of the current CF sensor with a more affordable
    one, which can be easily replicated, whenever such a sensor is available. We argue
    in this paper that deploying a WSN in a greenhouse to monitor both plant and environmental
    parameters in a way that takes into account space variability, in order to control
    irrigation, constitutes an efficient approach. One advantage of this approach
    is that the solution can be easily scaled to include more inexpensive sensors,
    without disturbing the other system modules, and likely improving the decision-making
    process. On the downside, the WSN maintenance and the calibration of sensors are
    tasks that must be taken into account. Regarding the machine learning process
    important conclusions have been drawn. Firstly, it has been verified that applying
    machine learning strategies in precision agriculture applications is a useful
    and efficient method, although not simple, for learning rules and relationships
    automatically from diverse datasets that simplifies the often tiresome and error-prone
    process of acquiring knowledge from the gathered data. Validation of the inferred
    knowledge, however, will require an iterative approach where the situation observed
    is repeated and thus a safe conclusion can be reached. Secondly, there is a need
    of a two-way interaction between the domain expert and the domain modeler. Their
    collaboration is crucial to transform the raw data received from the sensors into
    the final datasets to be used by the machine learning algorithms. Additionally,
    new rules inferred must be validated for their relevance by the domain expert
    and checked for consistency and redundancy with the existing ones. In principle,
    part of the consistency and integrity checks could be managed automatically through
    the rule-based reasoning engine by defining special conflict detection rules.
    An upgrade of the agronomic evaluation performed would be a comparison of our
    system with modern irrigation scheduling practices based on the estimation of
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc.). Here, the main idea is to balance the amount of
    water taken away through evapotranspiration with the amount of water to be applied.
    ETc. can be calculated using various weather parameters obtained by a weather
    station, statistical data and models developed for predicting ETc. Such models
    are integrated in relevant decision support systems for the daily management of
    irrigation. A more simplified approach to calculate ETc. is by using a Class A
    evaporation pan which relates the measured evaporation to crop water use. In that
    case, an appropriate crop coefficient (Kc) must be applied to determine ETc. Accurate
    Kc values, however, depend on various site-specific parameters (e.g., soil characteristics,
    crop physiology, development stage, etc.) and are often difficult to establish.
    The additional complexity of developing an ETc.-based irrigation scheduling system
    from scratch prevented us from making such a comparison. Plant-based methods for
    irrigation scheduling do not indicate directly the amount of water to be applied
    and experimentation is required to determine control thresholds (Jones, 2004).
    Accordingly, it is not possible to use the plant temperature to stop irrigation
    due to the time lag between applying the irrigation, the permeation through the
    substrate and the subsequent uptake of the water by the plant. To alleviate this
    shortcoming, plant-based sensors are combined with soil moisture measurement sensors
    that can indicate when to stop the irrigation. Thresholds then are established
    through experimentation where irrigation treatments are tested over a range of
    sensor values to identify the best case. In such experiments the thermistors were
    used to commence the irrigation, and the soil moisture probes were used to determine
    when adequate water had been added to the substrate. After experimentation the
    average irrigation time to reach the ideal 60% of water content after the identification
    of a water stress was found to be 30 min. 4. Conclusions We have been involved
    with a facet of precision agriculture that concentrates on plant-driven crop management.
    By monitoring soil, crop and climate in a field and providing a decision support
    system that is able to learn, it is possible to deliver treatments, such as irrigation,
    to specific parts of a field in real time and proactively. We have presented in
    this paper an integrated framework consisting of hardware and software components
    as well as tools that support efficiently the development of an autonomous WSAN-based
    system for precision irrigation in greenhouses. Fertilizer and pesticide treatments
    are other examples of applications in agriculture that could benefit from such
    proactive approaches.The integration of a chlorophyll content meter sensor would
    allow system upgrading to incorporate fertigation (supply of fertilizer via the
    irrigation system). In that case the system ontology will need to be updated with
    appropriate rules to determine where/when exactly a fertilizer (e.g. nitrogen)
    is required. The availability of sensors for the detection of plant-emitted volatile
    organic compounds (VOCs) including ethylene (which signals general stress), esters
    of jasmonic acid (which signal pest attack), and esters of salicylate (which signal
    pathogen attack) would allow the issue of infection alerts and actuate a pathogen
    or pest-specific response as appropriate. By integrating to our platform electronic
    nose technology it is possible that volatile sensor arrays could detect the presence
    of specific pathogens or pests. Moving our research towards a more autonomous
    system with self-adaptation and self-learning characteristics, we have been exploring
    ways of incorporating learning capabilities in the system. Our experiments have
    shown that machine learning algorithms can be used for inducing new rules by analyzing
    logged datasets to determine accurately significant thresholds of plant-based
    parameters and for extracting new knowledge and extending the system ontology.
    To deal with the uncertainty of data, work is in progress to define a model describing
    the uncertainty aspects. Quality indicators can be specified so that the end-user
    (either an application or a person) can make judgements on the confidence level
    that the information entails. Uncertain context mechanisms such as probabilistic
    logic, fuzzy logic and Bayesian networks can be evaluated and applied accordingly.

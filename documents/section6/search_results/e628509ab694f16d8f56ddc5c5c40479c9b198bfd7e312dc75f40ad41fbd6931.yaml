    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\

    countries that have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\

    \ irrigation per country.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n4 of 48 \nIt is remarkable that\
    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\
    \ scarcity problems. Again, there \nare some countries with regions affected by\
    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\

    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\
    \ 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation\nsystem, the other six\
    \ only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those\
    \ 83\ninclude diﬀerent levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only indicate\
    \ that there are motor/pumps in\ntheir system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers)\
    \ without more detail. From those papers which oﬀer more\ndetails, 19 of them\
    \ include sprinklers (the most used system) [28–46], eight use drip irrigation\
    \ [4,47–54],\ntwo propose the utilization of sprayers [4,55], and the rest use\
    \ a very speciﬁc irrigation systems\n(robots [56], pivot [14], rain gun [57] or\
    \ it can be applied to multiple systems [58]). In conjunction with\nthe principal\
    \ irrigation system, three papers propose the use of a fogging system [41,43,51]\
    \ and two\npapers propose the use of fertigation in their systems [42,52].\nSensors\

    \ \nMost of the included papers in this section do not describe the target agriculture\
    \ system of their \nproposal. Nevertheless, there are 38 papers that include this\

    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\

    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\

    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\

    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\

    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\
    \ Taipei, \nTaiwan). The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals\
    \ [51,69]. Only in one case [69] \ndid the authors specify that the used sensor\
    \ is the DS18B20 (Adafruit Industries, New York, New \nYork, USA). No other proposals\

    \ of temperature sensors for the water.  \nOn the other hand, with regard to the\
    \ proposals that monitored the atmospheric parameter, the \ndata is presented\

    \ only the irrigation system as an actuator.\nThere are seven papers (8% of cases)\

    \ The use of three actuators is presented in seven papers, the same percentage\

    \ use four actuators [39,72], and in one case the use of ﬁve\nactuators is presented\
    \ [67].\nNext, we present in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators.\
    \ Since we are considering only\nthe papers that include an irrigation system,\
    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\
    \ not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized\
    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\
    \ periods to increase\nproductivity, but they can also be used for operational\
    \ purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals\nand their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The\
    \ use\nof ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\
    \ least utilized actuators in IoT\nirrigation systems are scarecrows [58,65,66],\

    \ birds and other types of animals to protect the crops, and heaters [28,65],\

    \ and in one case the use of \nfive actuators is presented [67].  \nNext, we present\
    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\
    \ an \nalarm for the farmers or as a dissuasive measure to prevent the entry of\
    \ animals into the farming \nlands. In second position, we found the use of artificial\
    \ light systems. They are used in six cases \n[36,38,50,71,72,75]. The use of\
    \ artificial light is mainly related to the generation of artificial photo- \n\
    periods to increase productivity, but they can also be used for operational purposes.\
    \ Fans are \nincluded in five proposals and their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions \n(temperature, humidity or even the balance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of \nfans are [39,65,68,72,75].\
    \ The use of ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\

    \ in diﬀerent papers included in this\nsurvey, there is an important parameter\
    \ that is crucial for irrigation scheduling. This parameter\nindicates the water\
    \ loss due to the evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the stomata\
    \ of\nplants; it is known as evapotranspiration (ET). Several authors measured\
    \ both terms—evaporation and\ntranspiration—separately, using diﬀerent sensors\
    \ to obtain the ET data [104]. It also can be estimated\naccording to the vegetation\
    \ and the climatic data by several mathematic models [105]. Some web-based\napplications\
    \ can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing\
    \ is the\nbest option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities\
    \ for ET monitoring with sensors,\nthe integration of soil moisture changes can\
    \ oﬀer evaporation data. Nonetheless, the measurement of\ntranspiration is more\
    \ complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,\n\
    leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its\
    \ measurement, it is not\nincluded as a monitored variable in most of the papers\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\

    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\

    \ industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured\nby Sparkfun (SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and\ndirection\
    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\
    \ cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, \nauthors such as Ferrández-Pastor\
    \ [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: \nthings,\
    \ edge, communication, and cloud. In these latest architectural proposals, the\
    \ authors use the \nedge layer to locate critical applications and perform basic\
    \ control processes. Also, as indicated by \n[216], cloud (internet/intranet)\
    \ can provide Web services, data storage, HMI interfaces or analytic \napplications.\

    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\

    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground\ncommunication. It is\
    \ especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture IoT\n\
    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\
    \ and it would\nreduce the amount of physical damage the nodes deployed on the\
    \ ﬁelds may receive. Although WiFi\nsurprisingly allows underground-above ground\
    \ communication in short distances and depths above\n30 cm [222], it would be\

    \ and the citizens themselves are increasing\ntheir awareness regarding sustainable\
    \ consumption. This not only aﬀects their view on the energy\nconsumption of IoT\

    and do not increase severely the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable\
    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    Get rights and content Abstract The projected increases in World population and
    need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions
    in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground
    Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or
    completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge
    from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground
    sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of
    growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art
    communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and
    communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in
    the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported.
    Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified. Previous

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are
    intended to use for permanent storage of the data collected, real-time processing
    of the field condition, crop related decision making, and integration with other
    databases (e.g., weather, soil). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The indoor testbed [133]. Moreover, a testbed
    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard
    [6]. Senet operates two public cloud-based networks, Managed Network Services
    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field
    mapping for precision agriculture. Research challenges in IOUT are presented in

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    to the Internet is experiencing an explosive growth. The interconnection of smart
    objects embedded with sensors enables them to interact with the environment and
    among themselves, forming a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). These network nodes
    perform acquisition, collection and analysis of data, such as temperature and
    soil moisture. Such data can be employed to automate the irrigation process in
    agriculture while decreasing water consumption, resulting in monetary and environmental
    benefits. The high storage and processing capabilities, the rapid elasticity and
    payper-use characteristics makes Cloud Computing an attractive solution to the
    large amount of data generated by the WSN. This paper proposes and evaluates on
    a real deployment a cloud-based Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) communication
    system. This solution monitors and controls a set of sensors and actuators, respectively,
    to assess plants water needs. Published in: 2015 IEEE 2nd World Forum on Internet

    IEEE Conference Location: Milan, Italy SECTION I. Introduction Recent developments
    are enabling the deployment of miniaturized and low-cost electronics in a variety
    of sectors, such as Agriculture. Playing an important role in the economy of most
    nations, agricultural production has been experiencing the continuous improvement
    of its processes and techniques. The objective of Precision Agriculture (PA) is
    to improve products quality, as well as maintaining a sustainable agriculture,
    by collecting real-time data from the environment. So, there is the need for optimizing
    the resources employed in the agricultural processes, mainly in the irrigation
    system. Water plays a crucial role in plants lifecycle, including germination,
    photosynthesis and nutrition processes [1]. Most often, the water provided by
    natural precipitation is not enough to provide the amount of water needed by the
    plants for a healthy growth. Currently, agriculture consumes about 70% of the
    fresh water [2]. This percentage can be decreased performing efficient water management
    when it comes to irrigation. Precision Irrigation applies the water efficiently,
    in the right place, at the right time and in the right amount. It brings wide
    benefits, such as water savings, money savings as well as the improvement of crop
    quality. Precision agriculture involves collecting and interpreting huge amounts
    of data from the field so as to understand the causes of variability, and propose
    strategies for field management. The most important agricultural process, which
    can be controlled and adapted to better suit the plants growth, is related to
    irrigation. First and foremost there is the need to acquire data in order to be
    further analyzed and compared. This amount of data is enormous. If this data is
    not organized and processed, it will become meaningless. Difficulties in the adoption
    of precision agriculture are thus related to data handling and data processing
    [3]. Other adoption issue concerns significant investment costs in hardware solutions
    to store and process this huge amount of data [4]. Hence, it becomes very important
    to provide a system that is economically viable for a single farmer as well as
    to a big farming company. This paper proposes a cloud-based solution for a smart
    irrigation system organized as a Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN).
    A remote web service is employed to optimize the system with weather knowledge.
    SECTION II. Related Work This section reviews relevant previous work in smart
    irrigation systems using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). A. SensorScope SensorScope
    [5] consists of a WSN-based system for environmental monitoring to substitute
    traditional, expensive sensing stations by a low-cost system. Stations transmit
    regularly the gathered data to a sink node. This node forwards the data received
    to SensorScope Database, which in turn makes it available to other servers. Each
    sensor node (Shockfish TinyNodes) is placed in a sensor box, which also contains
    primary and secondary batteries. A sensing station includes a sensor node, a solar
    panel and environmental sensors. Each station contains up to seven sensors, capable
    of measuring up to nine environmental quantities: air humidity, air temperature,
    precipitation, soil moisture, solar radiation, surface temperature, water content,
    wind direction and speed. Indoor and outdoor experimental tests were conducted
    to test SensorScope viability. The most relevant test was on a rock glacier located
    at 2500m of altitude on the Génépi Switzerland, being the source of dangerous
    mud streams during rainfall, which caused accidents by flooding the adjacent road.
    A total of 16 stations were deployed. The collected data comprises rain, wind
    and temperature measurements. The acquired information allowed the identification
    of the region microclimate, which helped predicting the evolution of the frozen
    soils. B. Water Sustainability in Municipal Green Spaces Fazackerley et al. [6]
    describe an irrigation control system deployed in a municipal green space in the
    city of Kelowna, Canada. This space consists on a turf landscape, which is divided
    into zones. A zone is a turf grass area that is watered simultaneously, controlled
    by valves. This system aims to determine the best time to supply water at each
    zone, and the ideal amount. To minimize water waste, the system uses an improved
    adaptive irrigation algorithm. It calculates the amount of water to apply in a
    certain zone, depending on the maximum water volume that the soil can store. A
    wireless sensor node was deployed in each zone. Each node includes two Decagon
    EC-5 dielectric soil moisture sensors, as well as a wireless radio. One of the
    soil moisture sensors was placed in the rooting zone. The other one was placed
    below the rooting zone, and its readings were not used in the adaptive algorithm.
    The readings acquired by the soil moisture sensors are transmitted to the adaptive
    irrigation controller. The latter is coupled with a commercial controller, which
    receives remote updates. These are used to estimate irrigation scheduling based
    on EvapoTranspiration (ET). The adaptive irrigation controller sends the messages
    over a 3G network to a central server using TCP/IP. These messages contain soil
    moisture readings from each zone as well as information regarding irrigation events.
    For evaluating water savings, the system stores both the actual watering events
    as well as the irrigation events as determined by the commercial controller. The
    total amount of water delivered based on soil moisture sensors offered 47% of
    water savings compared to the amount of water only based on the commercial controller.
    C. Vineyard Computing Another work [7] studied the needs and priorities of vineyard
    workers, to provide a Wireless Sensor Network for helping workers. The authors
    studied workers and their practices through interviews, site tours and observational
    work. They concluded that the greatest variability of the vineyard parameters
    occurred during daytime. So, there should be a highest number of readings during
    the day, and less frequently during the night. They also report that during the
    winter the vineyard could be at risk, because there is the possibility of frost
    formation. Due to this problem, there should be frequent readings during cold
    nights, and an alert system to notify the manager whenever the temperatures go
    below a certain threshold. They observed workers often required actionable data,
    i.e., data that helps the workers to suggest the next step. For instance, a map
    evidencing the vineyard areas at risk of powdery mildew (a fungal disease), calculated
    from temperature data readings of the vineyard over a period of time. This way,
    the vineyard manager could apply spray pesticides on the affected area. Data is
    acquired by the sensor nodes in the vineyard every 60 secs. Data mules collect
    and transport this data from the sensor nodes to the central database. Workers
    move up and down the rows of the vineyard several times, so they could serve as
    “mules” by transporting a small device, which would wirelessly collect the data
    from the distributed nodes. Whenever the gathering device was physically close
    to a node, data would be transmitted, whenever new data were available. Data mules
    give networks the capability to emulate distributed nodes through the vineyard,
    since they do not need to communicate with their neighbors. The disadvantage of
    data mules is the energy consumption, since the nodes must be always awake to
    detect and communicate with the data mule. Furthermore, this approach cannot be
    used in applications with real-time requirements (which was not the case, since
    vineyard managers do not need to calculate heat units immediately). The use of
    data mules allows the reduction of equipment costs. D. Discussion All the above
    mentioned systems are very similar regarding the WSN they comprise, except for
    the Vineyard Computing project, which uses the data mules concept. Communication
    between nodes is mainly performed using 802.15.4 or similar, whereas the communication
    between the sink nodes and servers are usually performed through cellular networks.
    These systems use one or more servers to store the data they collect from the
    sensor nodes, implying an initial capital cost investment and the servers maintenance.
    Moreover, as more sensor nodes are added to the network, more data they generate.
    This may cause the servers to have no space for information storage. The SensorScope
    project highlighted the importance of saving all the raw data collected from sensor
    nodes. This information can be further employed to help investigations into a
    variety of topics. For instance, the continuous study for an optimized irrigation
    system, or the improvement of the discovery process of plants diseases. SECTION
    III. System Architecture This work aims to address a variety of distinct scenarios,
    such as agriculture, greenhouses, golf courses and landscapes. The proposed architecture
    (see Figure 1) must be modular to be adapted to each scenario requirements. It
    can be divided in three main components: a WSAN component, a cloud platform component,
    and a user application component. The WSAN contains three different types of nodes:
    a sink node, a sensor node, and an actuator node. Fig. 1. Proposed architecture.
    Show All The communication between the wireless nodes has to be performed by a
    low range communication protocol, such as ZigBee and 802.15.4. The choice of network
    protocol for the WSAN fell on the proprietary SimpliciTI, developed by Texas Instruments,
    due to its simplicity, low power and cost. SimplitiTI provides a simple protocol
    for WSAN implementation in a cluster tree topology. It supplies APIs to easily
    manage messaging between devices. This protocol does not have a formal routing
    mechanism. However, it supports the creation by software of three logical objects
    corresponding to the sensor nodes: End Device (ED), Access Point (AP) and Range
    Extender (RE), corresponding to the End Node, Sink Node and Router Node previously
    described, respectively. A. Sensor Nodes The hardware used for implementing the
    End Device and Range Extender device is the AA battery powered node of the eZ430-RF2500
    Kit. This includes the MSP430F2274 microcontroller and the 2.4GHz CC2500 RF Transceiver,
    shown in Figure 2a. Each ED/RE device has a soil moisture sensor connected to
    it. Fig. 2. a) final ED/RE device and case; b) final access point device. Show
    All Both ED and RE implement the same logical procedure, with the exception that
    the RE device also forwards the packets from other nodes to the Access Point.
    The procedure starts with the initialization of the hardware interfaces and the
    network protocol. The devices then perform soil moisture and battery readings
    with a pre-defined sampling frequency. Each time a measurement is available, the
    device sends it to the Access Point. Devices also receive control messages from
    the AP, for changing the measurements sampling frequency. The initial AP hardware
    implementation makes use of the same board of the ED/RE devices, which provided
    the RF radio capabilities to exchange messages within the WSAN network. This hardware
    was connected with another board (through an UART interface) with GPRS (General
    Packet Radio Service) capabilities, designed by Sensefinity. This board includes
    the MSP430F5419A microcontroller and the SIM908 module. The AP device, depicted
    in Figure 2b, also has the capability to control up to two distinct actuators
    (for performing the actuator turn ON / OFF) through the use of one of the available
    GPIO pins of the microcontroller. The eZ430-RF2500 board starts its logical procedure
    by initializing the hardware interfaces and the network protocol. Afterwards it
    is responsible for receiving the measurement messages from other network devices,
    and forward them to the other board. The board with GPRS capabilities manages
    the measurement messages, storing them in a queue, waiting to be sent to the cloud.
    Whenever the queue reaches a certain threshold, the messages are formatted to
    the Columbus message format (used by the Machinates cloud platform), encoded to
    base64, and finally sent to the cloud platform through HTTP. Whenever the GPRS-enabled
    board receives a measurement message, it stamps it with the current timestamp,
    provided by the on-board RTC (Real Time Clock). Once the board is initialized,
    it gets the timestamp information from the GPS module (included in the SIM908)
    to properly initialize the RTC with the current time. Besides sending measurement
    messages to the cloud platform, this board is also responsible for receiving the
    irrigation instructions from the cloud, activating or deactivating the actuator.
    Whenever the actuator is activated (consequently starting irrigation), a control
    message is sent to the other network nodes to increase the soil moisture sampling
    frequency. The actuator deactivation also results in the modification of the sampling
    frequency to the previous frequency. This adaptive sampling frequency allows to
    better control the irrigation system to optimize it, since more information becomes
    available during irrigation. B. WSAN Infrastructure Every distinct network node
    may, or not, have actuation capabilities. The proportion of actuators comprised
    in the network depends on the application scenario and the type of actuator mechanism
    employed for irrigation. In certain scenarios there is the need to have one actuator
    in each network node, whereas in other scenarios a single actuator can be responsible
    for a zone that may comprise several nodes. Network nodes are organized on a cluster-tree
    topology, due to its high scalability, good energy efficiency, as well as reliability.
    Compared to the cluster-tree topology, the star topology does not provide good
    scalability, and the mesh topology is poor in reliability and energy efficiency.
    Notice however that if the application scenario requires a small-scale network,
    the star topology can be employed instead. Since the network nodes are static,
    adaptive routing is not needed. Hence, it should be used a tree-based routing.
    Whenever joining the network, the nodes establish a parent-child link. Routing
    between the nodes is relatively simple using these parent-child relationships.
    On a cluster-tree topology, the sink node will act as the network coordinator,
    whereas the sensor and actuator nodes can act either as a router node and/or an
    end node. Some nodes may work only as repeaters to extend network outreach, without
    sensing or actuation capabilities. The sink node has two communication interfaces:
    one for interaction with the wireless nodes, and another for communication with
    the cloud platform. Depending on the deployment scenario, the data transmission
    between the sink node and the cloud platform can be performed through a variety
    of technologies (wired or wireless). For instance, if the WSAN deployment occurs
    in an agricultural field, the use of wired links may not be appropriate because
    it can interfere with the workers activities. Regarding wireless links, the more
    appropriate technologies are either Wi-Fi 802.11 or GPRS. The decreasing costs
    of the GPRS communications, along with the deployment of the WSAN in remote zones,
    led to the use of GPRS in this work. In situations where GPRS connectivity is
    poor, 802.11 could be employed for sending the data through a gateway. C. Cloud
    Platform Sensefinity Machinates cloud platform, besides storing all the measurements
    received from the WSAN, is also responsible for: data sources identification,
    performing data validation, partitioning, and processing. The later includes running
    the irrigation algorithm for detecting whenever the plants need irrigation. Other
    functionalities comprise sending messages back to the WSAN nodes to activate or
    deactivate the irrigation system, and interfacing to 3rd party services. D. 3rd
    Party Services-Weather Station In a regular basis, the cloud platform gets weather
    information from a Weather Station regarding the region in which the WSAN is deployed.
    The Wunderground online weather service is used for providing this data in real-time.
    It allows the selection of the closest available weather station to the location
    where the WSAN is deployed. The data is fetched by a HTTP Request and is returned
    in JSON format. The data feature consists of the hourly forecast, which returns
    data such as high and low temperature, wind direction, humidity, PoP (Probability
    of Precipitation), among others, for the next 36 hours. The PoP parameter gives
    the chance or likelihood of precipitation to occur in a certain area. This parameter
    is essential to estimate the best irrigation periods. E. Irrigation Algorithm
    The irrigation algorithm (see Figure 3) uses two distinct pieces of information:
    the soil moisture measurements received from the WSAN nodes, and weather station
    forecasts. Fig. 3. Irrigation algorithm. Show All All the sensing nodes comprised
    in the WSAN send soil moisture measurements frequently. The algorithm uses them
    for taking decisions concerning the need for irrigation. The actuator nodes must
    receive a control message for start performing the irrigation. The sink node of
    the wireless sensor network continuously sends new measurements acquired by the
    sensor nodes. After processing, the received value is compared to a threshold
    value, to decide if the plant in which the sensor node is located needs water.
    If the plant does not need water (soil moisture measurement above a threshold),
    the platform waits for the next measurement in order to double-check if there
    is a need for irrigation. Otherwise, whenever a soil moisture message of any node
    has a value below the defined threshold, the service will check for the weather
    forecast for the next 6 hours to decide whether to irrigate. During imminent raining
    periods, the irrigation should not be performed. Hence, if in the next 6 hours
    the probability of precipitation is higher than 50%, the system will not irrigate.
    Otherwise, the cloud sends a control message to the WSAN to activate irrigation
    in the targeted area. The end of irrigation is triggered whenever network soil
    moisture sensors assume a soil moisture value higher than the defined field capacity
    point. If this condition is satisfied, the cloud sends a message to the WSAN with
    an instruction to stop irrigation. F. Web Application The web application provides
    a User Interface (UI) based on Model-View-Controller software architecture. The
    communication between the UI and the Machinates platform is performed under JSON
    over REST. The UI (see Figure 4) allows the user to visualize the location of
    the network nodes, to access historical data related both to soil moisture and
    battery measurements for each sensor, as well as PoP predictions. For the AP device
    there is a battery indicator in the main page. which shows the battery level of
    that device. Fig. 4. UI dashboard (partial view). Show All SECTION IV. Experimental
    Evaluation The system was deployed in a real case scenario, a local farm located
    near Sortelha (Guarda, Portugal). For these evaluation tests a row of 9 peach
    trees were available for testing the system, in which the devices were distributed.
    The irrigation system initially comprised a manually scheduled drip irrigation
    system. The farm owner proceeded with the manual irrigation based on observation
    of the soil, the cultures itself, as well as the observed meteorological conditions.
    The farms fields contain a large number of different trees cultures and all these
    cultures were irrigated through the same irrigation system. On the drip irrigation
    tubing, the distance between each emitter is one meter. As the spacing between
    the trees was approximately 3 meters, it was possible to place the emitters right
    near the trees stalk and above the roots. A set of drip emitter tubing connected
    with each other was used in the property. The tubing beginning was connected to
    the public water supply. The irrigation would take place once the water tap was
    manually opened. The area comprising the row of the peach trees was isolated from
    the other irrigation systems. It was deployed an individual independent irrigation
    system for evaluating the proposed system, applied to the aforementioned 9 peach
    trees. Fig. 5. Distances between each network device. Show All The field tests
    involved the use of four devices: one Access Point, and 3 soil moisture sensors,
    connected to two End Devices and one Range Extender, following a cluster-tree
    topology. One drip irrigation tube covers the entire row of peach trees. One Electrovalve
    is used as actuator, controlled by the AP device. One entry of the Electrovalve
    is connected to the public water supply, and the other one is connected to the
    abovementioned drip irrigation tubing. The approximate distance between each peach
    tree is 3 meters. The distance between each device is depicted accordingly in
    Figure 5. A. Experimental Methodology The soil moisture sensors were placed within
    the tree roots about 15 to 20 cm in depth as pictured in Figure 6a. It is fundamental
    that the readings are taken at the roots zone. In this zone the plants absorb
    the needed water and nutrients for their healthy growth. Furthermore, this location
    enables more accurate readings, because the soil moisture sensor is less affected
    by external conditions such as the sunlight. Each soil sensor is connected to
    an ED/RE device node, fixed to the tree trunk about 1 meter above the soil (as
    shown in Figure 7). This location is due to soil attenuation, diffraction and
    reflection conditions, which may affect the signals transmission. Fig. 6. a) soil
    moisture sensor placement. b) electrovalve placement. Show All Fig. 7. ED/RE device
    with an attached soil moisture sensor. Show All The electrovalve (Figure 6b) is
    either opened or closed according to AP commands, and controls the water passage
    to the drip irrigation tubing covering the entire row of trees. The devices containing
    soil moisture sensors were configured to perform soil moisture readings every
    30 minutes during non-irrigation periods and every 5 minutes in irrigation periods.
    The battery sampling frequency of each device was configured to 60mins. The AP
    device sends measurement data to the cloud platform every time the packets buffer
    reaches 4 or more packets, or whenever the time spent since the last data transmission
    exceeds 60mins. It was defined a threshold with the value of 400 and a field capacity
    point with a value of 700. The nearest weather station from the experiments location
    was located in Belmonte, within a distance of nearly 10km. B. Results Analysis
    Evaluation tests were realized for three consecutive days, in Summer time. Figure
    8 reports the registered soil moisture variations during experimental tests for
    all the sensors. Fig. 8. Soil moisture rmeasurements by the three devices. Show
    All As the system started operation, the sensors initiated the soil moisture readings
    with values comprised between 500 and 600. From here on the soil moisture readings
    were slowly decreasing to a point whereas there was the need of irrigation (approximately
    15 hours after the system started operating). As the soil moisture sensors were
    placed about 15 to 20 cm below ground, and also due to the utilized irrigation
    system, the variations of the soil moisture sensors were relatively slow, due
    to the time the water needed to penetrate into the soil and reach the soil moisture
    sensors. The irrigation system was enabled during approximately 50mins, the time
    instant all the soil moisture sensors acquired soil moisture readings above the
    defined field capacity point. Even though the field capacity point had the value
    of 700, this value was highly exceeded by all soil moisture sensors. This may
    be due to the fact that even after the irrigation system was stopped, the water
    took more time to infiltrate into the soil, which made the soil moisture readings
    rise up almost until the value of 800, value exceeded by End Device 1. This shows
    that the system should be configured with a lower field capacity point, taking
    into account the time the water takes to infiltrate in the soil. A future study
    of the soil type would be important to adapt the field capacity point to the soil
    type. Once soil moisture readings of the RE device reached values below the defined
    threshold, the probability of precipitation acquired from the weather station
    was below 50% for the next 6 hours (no probability of precipitation for the next
    6 hours) and so the irrigation system had to be activated in order to apply the
    needed irrigation. During these experimental tests, the farms owner manually irrigated
    the other remaining fields once a day, with a duration of approximately one hour.
    If our system were not deployed, the peach trees used in our tests would be irrigated
    following the same scheme as the other remaining fields, i.e., these fields would
    be irrigated 3 times in a period of 3 days with a total of 3 hours of irrigation.
    Using our system the field was only irrigated once during a period of approximately
    50 minutes, evidencing that the other fields were suffering from over irrigation
    and smart irrigation allowed water savings. Indeed, each dripper comprised in
    the drip irrigation tubing issues approximately 2,3 liters per hour. The total
    amount of water issued by the 9 drippers on the 9 trees during the irrigation
    of 50mins is approximately 17,25 liters. Without the use of our system, with a
    total of 3 hours, the water used would be approximately 62,1 liters. Our system
    used about 72% less water than the typical manual irrigation process. C. Communication
    and Processing Latency The time between the measurements acquisition and the time
    the measurements arrives at the cloud platform is variable. After sending a set
    of messages to the cloud, the next measurement stored in buffer will remain there
    until 3 more messages arrive. This way, this first message will have a greater
    delay time relatively to the next 3 messages. The last message received at the
    AP device (before the sending process is started) has the lowest delay time since
    acquisition. The processing times for all messages at the cloud platform are all
    similar. These statistics (Figure 9) take into consideration the measurements
    received in each hour in a 12 hour time interval. Fig. 9. Mean values and standard
    deviation of the communication and processing latencies for each hour of operation.
    Show All The mean value of the Communication Time for all the operational hours
    was 443 seconds (7,38mins). In both periods of analysis, concerning hour 12th
    and 13th, the mean value of the communication time is lower than for the remaining
    periods, because during this time period the irrigation system was turned on and
    so the soil moisture measurements were taken each 5 minutes. Hence, the AP device
    sends more often messages in these two periods given that the buffer reaches faster
    the predefined value. Standard deviation values are high; some close to the correspondent
    mean value. This is expected since the time between acquisition and the instant
    the message is received by the cloud platform is not the same for every message.
    The message with the largest/lowest communication delay took about 31,3mins /
    1,25mins, respectively. Hence, the communication delay is dependent on the measurements
    sampling frequency; a higher frequency implies the buffer gets full more rapidly,
    and hence a smaller transmission delay. The processing time at the cloud was low,
    never exceeding 6secs. There is no statistically significant difference between
    the periods when the cloud platform received more messages (in irrigation periods)
    and the remaining periods of analysis. Fig. 10. Arriving times between periods
    of irrigation and non irrigation. Show All To further investigate the impact of
    sampling rate on communication delays, lets compare 20 continuous samplings for
    each case (irrigation and non irrigation) of soil moisture measurements (results
    shown in Figure 10). As expected, message communication delay during irrigation
    periods is smaller. The mean value for irrigation periods was 3,08 mins, whereas
    it was ∼7,61 mins for non-irrigation. SECTION V. Conclusions The development of
    a system for smart irrigation can greatly benefit from the knowledge of the soil
    and water dynamics. A comprehensive study of such topics was performed which allowed
    the authors to have a clearer vision of the plants water needs. This information
    was then employed for the development of the proposed solution. Besides the soil
    moisture monitoring, to assess the plants water needs for its proper and healthy
    development, it was also important to assess the possibility of natural resources''
    usage optimization. In this context it was introduced the integration of weather
    forecast parameters to optimize the usage of natural resources. Experimental tests
    on a real case scenario at a farm allowed the identification of some limitations,
    mainly related to energy consumption. The current scheme, although significantly
    better than the initial prototypes based on Arduino hardware, is not able to last
    as long as it was desirable. In addition, there is the need to have a better comprehension
    of the distinct soil types, the distinct cultures and irrigation methods applied.
    These factors influence the optimization of the water savings. The collaboration
    with a soil and cultures expert would be important to better assess the soil water
    needs and improve the smart irrigation algorithm. In addition, the inclusion of
    other parameters coming from the weather forecast reports would potentially benefit
    the irrigation performance in water savings. Ongoing developments address the
    storage of historical information on the cloud concerning an agriculture field.
    The availability of a large amount of valuable data on the cloud enables the creation
    of intelligent services with very high potential, such as data correlation between
    different cultures and/or fields, plant disease estimation through the application
    of machine learning techniques, or determination of the most appropriate land
    cultivation according to soil conditions. Authors Figures References Citations

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\

    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\
    \ monitoring methods.\nPlant-Based Measurement\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nPlant\

    \ and difﬁcult to implement in\nhumid climates\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n\
    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\

    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ As fresh water resources become \nscarcer, it is expected that more premium\
    \ will be placed on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture. \nRegulatory agencies\
    \ may also require farmers to continuously demonstrate the efficient use of water.\
    \ \nThese factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    all metrics Abstract Presently, wireless sensor network (WSN) plays important
    role in engineering, science, agriculture and many other field like surveillance,
    military applications, smart cars etc. Precision agriculture (PA) is one of the
    field in which WSN is widely adopted. The aim of the adoption of WSNs in PA is
    to measure the different environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, PH value of soil etc., for enhancing the quantity and quality of
    crops. Further, the WSNs are also helped to reduce the consumptions of the natural
    resources used in farming. Hence, the aim of this review is to identify the various
    WSNs technologies adopted for precision agriculture and impact of these technologies
    to achieve smart agriculture. This review also focuses on the different environmental
    parameters like irrigation, monitoring, soil properties, temperature for achieving
    precision agriculture. Further, a detailed study is also carried out on different
    crops which are covered using WSNs technologies. This review also highlights on
    the different communication technologies and sensors available for PA. To analyze
    the impact of the WSNs in agriculture field, several research questions are designed
    and through this review, we are tried to find the solutions of these research
    questions. Similar content being viewed by others Wireless Sensor Network in Agriculture:

    Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the networks
    which are composed of sensor nodes. These sensor nodes help in sensing, gathering
    and measuring the information from the surroundings where they are deployed and
    transmit the data to the users. A WSN has small or we can say no infrastructure
    and having number of sensor nodes in it from ten to thousands which works together
    to monitor a area where they are deployed.WSN are classified into two categories
    structured and unstructured. Structured WSN are those which are deploy in proper
    manner into a specific area and can be easily configured if there is any problem
    in a senor nodes whereas unstructured WSN are those in which sensors nodes are
    deploy in bulk without any proper architecture these type of WSN are mainly found
    in those area where it is difficult for humans to reach easily and obtain data
    from that area. In unstructured WSN, it is difficult to take care of sensor nodes
    if they stop working or issue of node failure occurs. Wireless sensor network
    are classified into five types to monitor the parameters of surface of earth,
    underground conditions, underwater conditions, multimedia and to monitor the area
    by the help of movement of sensors. These five types of sensors are defined as
    Terrestrial WSN-In this type of WSNs, huge number of nodes are deploy into a surface
    of land that can help to examine the conditions of land. Underground WSN- As the
    name depict underground WSN are networks of sensor nodes which are deployed in
    caves, mines or underground surface for monitoring the condition of soil, moisture
    and military boarder monitoring. Underwater WSN- In this WSNs, sensors are deployed
    in the region of oceans, rivers for underwater surveillance. Multi-media WSN-It
    is a network consists of sensors nodes that have ability to store, process and
    access multi-media data such as video data, audio files and pictures. Mobile WSN-
    In this network, sensor nodes have the ability to move from one place to other.
    The application of such networks is military surveillance, monitoring of area,
    tracking of target, monitoring under water [1]. In WSNs, sensors are integrated
    with a radio transceiver and a set of electronics components which helps in transmission
    of data from source to destination. Sensor nodes have capability to organize themselves
    to create ad hoc, multi-hop network which helps in creating communication link
    between nodes. User can give commands to sensors; as a response of these commands
    sensors can transmit data to the user for example a particular limit of temperature
    is assign to the sensor with the help of embedded language if temperature exceeds
    from that assigned value than sensor provides information to the user [2]. 1.1
    Wireless Sensor Network in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is a crop
    management concept which allows farmers for managing spatial and temporal variability
    with in the agricultural field such as reduction of natural resources, irrigation
    management, production management, fertilizer management, intrusion attacks, and
    real time data monitoring [3]. The aim behind the adoption of sensors in precision
    agriculture is to enhance the overall production of crops. Sensors can help for
    measuring various parameters of agriculture land like humidity, soil moisture,
    climatic condition, intrusion detection, water level which facilitate that can
    lead to better production [4]. Further, sensor can collect the information regarding
    various parameters and process the collected information for better farming. The
    significant role of sensors in agricultural field is listed below (Fig. 1). Fig.

    Full size image 1.2.4 Citation Criteria For this review, the articles published
    in SCI listed journals are considered. To collect the good literature review,
    several search strings are designed which are mentioned in Sect. 2.3. But these
    search strings are not capable to distinguish articles published in SCI listed
    journals and non SCI listed journals. So, the separation between SCI and non SCI
    listed journals are done manually and all the articles published in non SCI listed
    journals and conferences are not included. The search strings also find number
    of articles based on wireless sensor networks, but these articles are not related
    to precision agriculture. These articles include new routing mechanisms, energy
    efficiency in WSNs, topology setup, enhanced WSNs protocols, latency etc. Such
    types of articles are discarded. The articles considered for this review are published
    in SCI listed journals. Table 1 shows the list of journals as well as number of
    articles taken from the individual journal. Table 1 Illustartes the categorization
    of articles with journals Full size table 2 Literature Survey This section of
    paper describes the literature survey of various research articles related to
    precision agriculture using wireless sensor network. This section includes various
    techniques, sensors, algorithms and sensor motes used for collecting information
    from agricultural fields. The literature survey on the usability of sensor nodes
    in PA is divided into three categories. These categories are (1) Monitoring of
    Crops (2) Irrigation Management of Crops (3) Environmental parameters for Crops
    2.1 Monitoring This subsection describes the works reported on monitoring of the
    crops. Sanchez et al. [6] proposed an integrated wireless sensor network as a
    solution for precision agriculture. This model can help to assimilate crop data
    acquisition, transmission of data from the end user and video-supervision task.
    The main objective this model is to secure the crops from intruders and identification
    of same in the agriculture field. The detection and identification of intruders
    are done with help of video surveillance. High consumption of energy and end to
    end delay problems are remain unsolved. The different hardware prototypes have
    been implemented for crop monitoring devices. The detection intruder is measured
    using infrared motion sensors and identification is consummated with the help
    of camera sensors. Zhang et al. [7] proposed a method to monitor vigor of the
    plant with the help of WSNs. In this work, the vigor of the plant is non-violently
    monitored through embedded and image processing technology. If unusual behaviour
    of a plant is identified during monitoring process, then warning message is sent
    to end users. With the help of wireless sensor nodes deployed in the field’s wastage
    of resources which are needed for cultivation of plant are minimised. Proposed
    method based on data fusion of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation helps in providing
    the well-organized way for monitoring the strength of plant in many phases of
    agriculture. Zou et al. [8] proposed an algorithm named as OASNDFA for achieving
    intelligent agricultural monitoring with minimum sensor nodes deploy in the field.
    The selection of location of nodes is difficult in hilly areas due graphical and
    weather conditions. This algorithm helps to find the suitable location of nodes.
    This algorithm works in three phases. The first phase considers the different
    relevant factor. In second phase, a mathematical model is designed with the help
    of relevant factors. The third phase consists of key points with maximum features.
    These features are computed through mathematical model. To address the vulnerable
    dynamic topology problem for monitoring the crops, Jiang et al. [9] proposed an
    algorithm based on tree topology, called dynamic converge cast tree algorithm
    (DCTA). This algorithm is employed within the monitoring system of WSN. The aim
    of the proposed algorithm is to obtain better data attainment for monitoring of
    growth of plant. The DCTA algorithm having three stages i.e. (a) routing which
    is based on dynamic routing (b) adaptable time slot scheduling (c) compilation
    and examination of data. This algorithm provides high data transmission between
    nodes. For real time monitoring of the agriculture filed, Kim et al. [10] proposed
    an WSNs architecture based on beacon mode with autonomous. This architecture provides
    the solutions for the problems like fire, intrusion attack, and lack of availability
    of resources. The proposed architecture is worked on the TinyOS platform and further,
    multiple beacon scheduling in the MAC layer with bop slots is considered. The
    dynamic address allocations and path recovery process for unexpected link is addressed
    on the network layer. The results staed that the proposed architecture having
    reliable transmission ratio for a real-time processing service like fire and emergency
    agriculture monitoring systems under heavy traffic environments. Intrusion attacks
    are one of the major issues faced by farmers. Because, intruders destroy the agriculture
    fields and leads to decrease in productivity. To address the same, Bapat et al.
    [11] proposed a wireless sensor network to protect farms from animal attacks.
    Sensor nodes equipped with PIR sensors, sound sensors, light flashers and RF module
    are deployed in agriculture field. Sensor nodes that are located near to boundaries
    of field detect animal entry and send information to the central base station.
    From the central base station, the information is sent to end users. To monitor
    the variability of nitrogen gas and biomass foe sugarcane crop, Portz et al. [12]
    proposed active crop sensor model based on WSNs. The results revealed that the
    proposed model is capable to indicate demand of nitrogen and biomass in sugarcane
    fields. The nitrogen sensor helps to detect the variability of biomass and nitrogen
    and preventing action can be taken for supplying the biomass and nitrogen into
    sugarcane crop. Reiser et al. [13] proposed WSNs based system for autonomous navigation
    of agriculture field. The proposed system comprises of location of nodes deployed
    in agriculture field and data attainment. The proposed system has advantages over
    the narrow transmission range of nodes. This system is effectively detected the
    faulty nodes. Smiljkovikj et al. [14] proposed an intelligent cloud based system
    named as Smartwine which monitors the wine production process using grapes. It
    works on sensor network platform having centralized server system which allows
    more than one users to use system simultaneously. The Smartwine system helps in
    decrease the cost of energy, water, resources and pesticides use for wine production.
    To monitor the agricultural production process, Diaz et al. [15] proposed a methodology
    which have seven phases that are (1) Study the condition of environment. (2) Design
    of sensor network architecture. (3) Role and Importance. (4) Implementation. (5)
    Simulation (6) Deployment. (7) Maintenance. The designed methodology represents
    the importance of wireless sensor in agricultural field and provides strong foundation
    for building applications with high productivity gain. To monitor the crops in
    green house and orchard, Zhu et al. [16] developed a monitoring system based on
    WSNs. The capabilities of the proposed system are evaluated using three different
    scenarios such as greenhouse, open farmland and orchard. The proposed system gives
    better reliable communication between sensors nodes deployed in agriculture fields.
    Further, it is also seen that rate of packet loss is significantly decreased.
    To attaining less management cost and high productivity in cultivation of crops,
    Srbinovska et al. [17] proposed WSNs based architecture for vegetable greenhouse.
    The developed system analyzes the various environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and light, for optimal conditions of crops. It is revealed that the proposed
    system would be able to improve the productivity and quality of crop. A review
    on infrastructure of WSNs for precision agriculture is presented in [18]. Further,
    in this work, a hybrid WSN model based on terrestrial WSNs and underground sensor
    network for precision agriculture is proposed. The objective of the proposed model
    is to reduce the human efforts for collecting agricultural information. It is
    seen that the proposed model provides information regarding agriculture fields
    more efficiently and accurately than existing sensor networks. To address approximate
    inference problem in agriculture field, Abouzar et al. proposed RSSI (received
    signal strength indicator) based-distributed Bayesian localization algorithm for
    message passing [19]. The proposed algorithm avoids communication overhead and
    minimizes computational complexity. El-kader et al. [20] proposed a precision
    farming solution model for potato crop [20]. In the proposed model, soil testing
    of land is done through sensor nodes whether the land is suitable for cultivation
    or not. This model also provides the facilities of better irrigation and fertilization
    scheduling to reduce natural resources. Further, it is noticed that APTEEN protocol
    is adopted for better routing paths. To monitor the parameters of soil, Georgieva
    et al. [21] designed a WSNs based monitoring model. The proposed monitoring model
    computes the different parameters of soil like temperature, humidity, conductivity
    and amount of acid. The arduino platform is used to integrate the different components
    of the proposed monitoring model. For providing better and qualitative connectivity
    and coverage of sensors in agriculture field, Kaiwartya et al. [22] designed a
    system for multi-metric quality measurement for deployed sensor nodes. In this
    work, seven metrics are designed for the sensor deployment and the optimal connectivity
    between the sensor nodes is measured. Lam et al. [23] developed a wireless sensor
    module for rural monitoring and precision agriculture applications. In their work,
    specification like received signal strength indicator (RSSI), packet reception
    ratio (PRR) of wireless sensor module was tested as compared with commercial products.
    The designed modules have capability to give optimal solution for real-world applications.
    Further, it can provide better applications for precision agriculture like reduce
    energy consumption of nodes, prediction of pest or disease and improved quality
    of crops. For better coverage of agriculture field, An et al. [24] proposed an
    effective technique for sensor deployment based on field information coverage.
    In this work, two polynomial-time algorithms are presented. The work of the first
    algorithm is to find the location of deployed sensors. Whereas, second is to identify
    the locations of relay nodes with minimum number of relay nodes in between source
    to destination. It is seen that the good trade-off between sensor nodes is obtained.
    To fruit recognition and disease detection, Lee et al. [25] designed a sensing
    system integrated with yield mapping system, sensors for detecting disease, devris
    detectors, an N detector for precision agriculture using ground and aerial based
    platforms. The proposed sensing system can measure the soil phosphorus detection,
    detection of nutrient in soil and grain insect detection with the help of NIR
    and RAMAN spectroscopy. To monitor the frost in vineyard, Valente et al. [26]
    proposed a collaborative system based on WSNs and robot. The aerial robot can
    be worked as dynamic node and it can be responsible for communication between
    agriculture field and base station. Further, in this work, UAV and WSN are combined
    for surveying fragmented crop fields. Zhang et al. [27] designed a remote monitoring
    system based on WSNs for collecting agricultural information. This monitoring
    system is based on ZigBee and GPRS wireless communication technologies. The agriculture
    data is collected through CC2430. The ARM9 processors are adopted to design base
    station. The proposed system is more feasible than other existing systems in terms
    of feasibility and it also conserve water content in agriculture field efficiently.
    Li et al. [28] proposed a monitoring system based on WSNs for greenhouse. The
    proposed system includes cluster of sensor nodes, base station and data centre.
    The JN5139 micro-processor is used for designing wireless nodes and further, ZigBee
    protocol is used for communication purpose. The proposed monitoring system is
    a low-cost, expandable and reliable model with better processing capability. Park
    el al. [29] designed an environmental monitoring system to prevent dew condensation
    in greenhouse. The proposed environmental system integrates the Bahrenburg formula
    to compute the dew point of leaves. Further, the dew condensation is prevented
    on the surface of crops which to prevent diseases infection. To monitors the environmental
    parameters, Carrascosa et al. [30] proposed an open source based hardware model
    for precision agriculture. The proposed model contains two main components i.e.
    hardware and software. The hardware component of the model is responsible to record
    environmental parameters, whereas, software component connect the device with
    data server. The characteristics of open source hardware model are low acquisition
    cost and less complexity for customization. Table 2 summarizes the work reported
    on monitoring of different crops. Table 2 Depicts the work reported on crop monitoring
    Full size table 2.2 Irrigation Management This subsection presents the literature
    works on irrigation management for the crops. To optimize the water content in
    agriculture field, Gutierrez et al. [31] proposed an automated irrigation system
    based on WSNs. The proposed irrigation system comprises of distributed wireless
    network of soil-moisture and temperature sensors. It is seen that the proposed
    system is feasible, cost effective and also reduce the amount of water content
    needed to the crops. To address the drought and tolerance issues of crops, Levy
    et al. [32] developed a method for irrigation management and enhancement of tolerance
    for the crops. It is observed that lack of water, drought, heat and salinity can
    affect the production of the crop. With the help of proposed method, all these
    factors are analyzed and it is concluded that required amount of the water is
    supplied through the proposed system to the crops. Further, it is noticed that
    micro-irrigation and drip irrigation systems helps farmer to conserve water. To
    measure the soil variability, Hedle et al. [33] adopted spatio-temporal modelling
    with high spatial resolution electromagnetic and digital elevation method data
    layers for quantify the variability of soil. Wireless sensor network with high
    temporal resolution dataset is used to mould the vibrant nature of soil moisture.
    The proposed approach is more accurate than a multiple linear regression modelling
    because it helps in providing best implementation of a variable rate irrigation
    system. For efficient use of irrigation system, Hellin et al. [34] developed an
    irrigation architecture based on WSNs for agriculture field. The proposed architecture
    helps in describing the design, optimization and development of an application
    to reduce the wastage of water. Sensor nodes which were deploy in fields are of
    good use they helps in reaching the required moisture condition to maintain water
    electrical conductivity level of the irrigation system at desired value through
    which there is a efficient management of water resources in agriculture field.
    To optimize agricultural irrigation, Nolz et al. [35] developed an irrigation
    model for monitoring the status of water in soil. In this work, two types of sensors
    are applied for measuring the potential of water in soil. These sensors are deployed
    under thin layer of soil to evaluate the status of water. It is noticed that the
    proposed irrigation model reduce the necessity of water to the crops effectively.
    A decision support system is developed for effective irrigation management in
    [36]. The proposed system comprises of sensor nodes, actuation network and fuzzy
    logic. The proposed method can reduce the wastage of water using fuzzy logic and
    actuation network. Further, it is observed that productivity of crop can be increased
    using this decision support system. Kim et al. [37] proposed an efficient water
    management system based on WSNs. In this work, the conventional irrigation system
    is replaced through an electronically controllable system for better irrigation
    management in agricultural fields. The proposed water management system is continuously
    monitored using GPS. Zhao et al. [38] designed an irrigation system based on soil
    water content and temporal stability. Further, in this work, water content and
    temporal stability is compared using VRI and URI to identify the location for
    deploying soil water sensors. In this work, temporal stability of soil moisture
    is evaluated regularly. It is seen that proposed irrigation system changes the
    overall similarity of soil moisture spatial patterns. It is also noticed that
    consumption of water is significantly reduced. To investigate the efficiency of
    linear move installed irrigation system, Chavez et al. [39] proposed a method
    for remote irrigation monitoring and control system (RIMCS). The proposed RIMCS
    system contains the pulsing nozzles and solenoids. The proposed system is also
    capable to vary the water rate. It is claimed that the proposed systems can monitor
    the flow of water, pressure of water, location and agriculture field. To control
    the irrigation in agriculture field, Maurya et al. [40] proposed a novel approach
    based on sensor technology. The sensor nodes are continuously sense soil temperature,
    moisture and humidity in agricultural field and transmits this information to
    base station. Further, in this work, region-based static clustering approach is
    used to provide efficient coverage over entire agricultural field. The proposed
    clustering approach uses the fuzzy logic technique to select best cluster head.
    This energy-efficient protocol is also compared with existing protocol like EEHC,
    DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR. To precisely monitor environmental conditions Sawant et
    al. [41] proposed a system. The proposed system helps in addresses the issues
    like standardized way of data discovery, access and sharing of data across various
    distributed sensor networks through the adaptation of a framework based on OGC
    standards for sensor SWE. The proposed system is a cost-effective, standardized
    sensing system which includes functionalities like sensor plug-n-play, remote
    monitoring, tools for crop water req. Estimation and nutrient management. A WSNs
    based irrigation software system is presented in [42]. The proposed system is
    named as WISC. The designed system provides real time monitoring of fields and
    remotes access to in-field information through WSN for irrigation purpose. For
    the proper irrigation in agriculture field, Coates et al. [43] proposed an irrigation
    model based on WSNs with valve control. The proposed model can sense the agriculture
    field for irrigation as well as also control the flow of water. Hence, in this
    work, manual control of irrigation valves is replaced through automatic control.
    To automate the irrigation process, Nikolidakis et al. [44] proposed an algorithm
    with collaboration of integrated system. This algorithm consists of advanced routing
    scheme i.e., ECHERP and provides efficient utilization of energy required for
    sensor motes. Nagarajan et al. [45] designed a sensor mote for sprinkler irrigation
    automation system. In the proposed work, humidity, temperature and PH sensors
    are used to control the water content of the agriculture field. The ZigBee communication
    technology is used for data transformation. Further, the GPRS system is adopted
    for data analyses and storing purpose. The proposed system is capable to perform
    real time monitoring and control water supply. An adaptable decision support system
    is proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [46]. The proposed system integrates sensors
    for monitoring soil, crop and climate in agriculture field. Further, this system
    is implemented in autonomous closed loop zone specific irrigation. This system
    is more effective in terms of agronomic performance as compared to traditional
    agricultural practices. Kim et al. [47] proposed a novel water monitoring system
    for reducing depletion of water resources. It is reported that fine-grained consumption
    of water resources can help farmers to pinpoint waste, and improve efficiency.
    The proposed water monitoring system can conserve the natural resources and also
    to reduce the amount of water needed by a crop. Masseroni et al. [48] designed
    a system for soil water monitoring and irrigation management. The proposed system
    is implemented using Arduino based open-hardware device. This system continuously
    measures the water level in the soil, especially in the root area. Further, this
    information is used to decide the irrigation timings. The proposed system reduces
    the water consumption significantly. An IOT based smart irrigation idea is presented
    in [49]. This irrigation system comprises of environmental sensors, web services
    and IOT devices. The proposal has deployed sampling algorithm successfully which
    will provide constraints for the sensor network. A model driven control strategy
    for irrigation in agriculture field is presented [50]. The aim of the proposed
    strategy is to provide right amount of water at right place in an agriculture
    field. Further, a predictive algorithm is incorporated in the proposed strategy
    for measuring the moisture content in soil. Table 3 presents the work reported
    in literature on different irrigation management system for precision agriculture.
    Table 3 Illustrates the work reported on irrigation system for achieving precision
    agriculture Full size table 2.3 Environmental Parameters This subsection describes
    the recent study reported on various environmental parameters like humidity, temperature,
    soil condition etc., to achieve precision agriculture. Rossel et al. [51] developed
    a soil sensing technique based on characterization of soil and environmental conditions.
    The objective of this technique is to improve the production of the crop and further,
    to reduce the environmental effects on crop. This technique measures and monitors
    the soil physical and biochemical attributes for better productivity. To compute
    and plot the spatial variability of soil, Bernardi et al. [52] developed a decision
    tool based on soil properties, yield and liming. The aim of this tool is to compute
    the fertilizer need and economic return of an alfalfa pasture. The vesper software
    is adopted to measure the spatial variability of soil and site-specific liming
    and fertilizer needed. Further, the information of fertility of soil is computed
    using spring software. It is revealed that it is an effective tool for mapping
    and evaluating the spatial variability of soil. Kuang et al. [53] developed a
    NIR spectroscopy based calibration model to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance
    mode. This model is adopted to examine the different spiking strategies and spiking
    ratios. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using 425 sample
    of soil. The results stated that the proposed model provides more correct and
    accurate information regarding soil OC, TN and MC. To measure the electrical conductivity
    of soil, Parrilla et al. [54] designed a system using electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) based apparent electrical conductivity technique for olive orchards. In
    this work, both wet and dry soil conditions are taken into consideration. Further,
    it is seen that to check the efficiency of proposed model, forty-eight soil samples
    are tested for soil texture and soil water content. It is stated that in both
    situation (wet and dry soil), proposed model gives the same information. The spatial
    variation of soil phosphorus(p), magnesium(mg), potassium(k) have been investigated
    using geostatistics, conventional statistics and a geographical information system
    in [55]. In this study, total five hundred thirty-seven soil samples are collected
    for this experiment. It is observed that this model provides useful information
    for agronomic and environmental management for crops. To design a low water cost
    WSNs, Bogena et al. [56] have tested the applicability of different water sensors
    like EC-5, EC-20 and TDR for measuring soil water content. The experiment is performed
    both in laboratory and field. It is seen that in laboratory, the performance of
    the water sensors are almost same. But, in field, there is significant difference
    between the performances of the different water sensors. Authors claimed that
    EC-5 water sensor gives better accurate results among all other sensors and it
    is best suitable sensor to design low water cost WSNs. To measure the climate
    change mitigation strategies for ecosystem and agriculture, Knadel et al. [57]
    presented a study on the self organic carbon parameter. In this study, two different
    agriculture fields are taken into consideration and mapped using Veris mobile
    sensor platform. Further, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain different field
    of spectra. The objective of this study is to identify either a single sensor
    or fusion of sensors can provide best predictive accuracy for SOC parameters.
    It is seen that the fusion of sensors is obtained best predictive accuracy for
    SOC parameter. Further, it is observed that low cost robust calibration model
    can be developed on the basis of Vires mobile platform. A soil property monitoring
    system based on WSNs is presented in [58]. The proposed system is deployed in
    the wheat field to measure the soil properties. It is seen that proposed system
    provides more than 95% real time information of soil parameters. Ritsema et al.
    [59] developed a stand-alone wireless embed network system for continuous monitoring
    of water contents at different depths. Further, this system is associated with
    web application to display the real time results for end users. To monitor the
    soil moisture dynamics from top depth, Majone et al. [60] presented a multi hop
    WSNs based monitoring system for orchards. In this work, sensors are deployed
    on different depth level i.e. 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80 cm. The proposed system is
    based on independent sensors that can provide both real time and historic data.
    It is revealed that distribution of soil moisture can affect the production of
    orchards. To find the low cost sensor and better frequency range for measuring
    moisture content, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil, Kizito et al.
    [61] evaluated ECH2O sensors family in the range of 5–150 MHz frequencies. The
    results concluded that ECH2O-TE sensor gives the better results at 70 MHz. The
    relationship and precision between volumetric soil water content and volumetric
    soil water content sensed are determined through four commercial soil moisture
    sensor systems in [62]. It is revealed that only the IM and RB systems are identified
    the high corelation between volumetric soil water content and volumetric soil
    water content sensed. Brocca et al. [63] assessed the reliability of soil moisture
    estimations through ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors. In their work, fourteen different
    sites of four different countries is taken into consideration. It is stated that
    AMSR-E sensor provides the high correlation between the observed and modelled
    data using LPRM algorithm. A review on the soil properties using remote sensing
    technique is presented in [64]. To characterize the underground wireless network
    and the basic problems for better communication in agricultural field, Vuran et
    al. [65] derived advance channel models. The proposed model helps in analyzing
    bit error rate for two different networks. The results obtain from field measurements
    used in evaluating parameters of soil and the effects of variation in moisture
    of soil. To measure the temperature of agriculture field, Badia-melis et al. [66]
    evaluate the behaviour of various sensors under the three temperature ranges that
    are 5 °C, 23 °C and 35 °C. Three wireless sensor network devices with different
    sensors are compared with four RIFD tags to get the information of behaviour of
    various sensors. Two alternative methods were used to adjust experimental data.
    For monitoring and modelling temperature variations inside silage stacks, Green
    et al. [67] designed a wireless mote which is deployed at different location.
    The proposed system helps in detection of temperature variation during decomposition
    of silage. To obtain real time information about environmental parameters of greenhouse,
    Jahnavi et al. [68] developed a smart wireless system. The designed system helps
    in giving optimal use of resources and water required for cultivation of crops.
    Microcontroller in designed system helps in transmitting and receiving data from
    sensor nodes to gateway node. Users can get real time information of greenhouse
    through web application where data is transmitted through gateway node. To control
    the eexchange of water and energy of heat between the agricultural field and atmosphere,
    Jackson et al. [69] designed a temperature and moisture sensor. The developed
    sensors are composed of micro machined MEMS cantilever beams which are equipped
    with water sensitive sensors. The variation in resistance of the sensor due to
    moisture depends on the cantilever beam thickness. For measuring temperature of
    agricultural field, Martinez et al. [70] proposed a cost-effective system named
    as LITAS. The designed system evaluates infrared thermometry and thermal imaging
    which supervised water stress level of the plant. The LITAS system tested in the
    field of sugar beet and the measurements of LITAS were compared to canopy temperature(TC)
    which is obtain from thermal images. Pierce et al. [71] deployed a two WSNs for
    agricultural process, one wireless sensor network is designed for regional-scale
    applications, such as weather stations and the second network is designed for
    on-farm applications such as monitoring of temperature for protecting agricultural
    field from frost. To monitor physiological condition of plants, Mahan et al. [72]
    proposed a smart cop IRT. The designed system is cost effective which can be easily
    deployed in large areas and helps in providing wireless operations that are more
    appropriate in various research and applications. To monitor climatic conditions
    such as temperature, humidity and amount of soil moisture. In agricultural field
    Mendez et al. [73] designed a Wi-Fi based network which is capable to intelligently
    monitor the condition of agricultural field in a designed manner. Table 4 summarizes
    the work reported on enviromental parameters to achieve precision agricluture.
    Table 4 Summarizes the work reported on environmental parameters of precision
    agriculture Full size table 3 WSNs Technologies in Precision Agriculture 3.1 Communication
    Technologies In wireless sensor communication various technologies are used to
    transmit the data from agriculture field to central point. The specification of
    these technologies is described in Table 5. Whereas, the WSNs communication technologies
    used in PA is given in Table 6. Table 5 Available communication technologies with
    specification for precision agriculture Full size table Table 6 Communication
    technology reported for precision agriculture in literature Full size table 1.
    ZigBee—ZigBee is low-cost, low-rate, and less-power consumer device as compared
    with other wireless technologies that helps in secure and efficient transmission
    of data from source to destination. By applying a wireless sensor network based
    on ZigBee to an agriculture field data regarding to the conditions of field is
    properly transmitted to the user at high data transmission rate [74]. 2. Bluetooth—Bluetooth
    is a small range, low-power consuming device for wireless sensor network which
    helps in transmit data from one user to other in a range of 100 meters. It operates
    on the frequency band of 2.4 GHz [75]. 3. Wi-Fi—wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) is IEEE
    standard 802.11b for wireless local area network which is operated in frequency
    band of 2.4 GHz deploy in a distributed way to cover the range of hundred meters.
    Wi-Fi is the most successful technology of wireless sensor networks few years
    ago Wi-Fi was only available on laptops but now a day’s Wi-Fi is easily available
    in cell phones, cameras, TV etc. [76]. 4. GPRS—general packet radio service (GPRS)
    provides fast speed of data transmission to the users. It uses the frequency range
    of 2.4 GHz. GPRS provides faster and long distance connection for data transmission.
    Range of GPRS is spread up to kilometres according to the coverage area of GPRS
    [77]. 5. WiMAX—worldwide inter-operability for microwave access (WiMAX) is an
    IEEE 802.16e standard used for a long distance communication technology. With
    the integration of WiMAX technology, the capacity of network can be raised up
    to 70 mbps [78]. 3.2 Sensors Used in PA Sensors provide huge contribution in various
    applications. In agriculture, sensors plays vital role for measuring various parameters
    of agricultural field. Tables 7, 8 show the different sensors that are used for
    precision agriculture. These tables also provide the details of temperature range
    and other capabilities of the sensors. Further, Table 9 illustrates the different
    sensor reported in the literature to monitor and measure the different parameters
    for achieving precision agriculture. Table 10 shows the list of different crops
    which are tested for precision agriculture using WSNs technology. Table 7 Sensor

    weather conditions Full size table Table 9 List of sensor reported for precision
    agriculture in literature work Full size table Table 10 List of crops reported
    for precision agriculture in literature work Full size table 4 Conclusion In this
    study, the adaptability of the WSN is explored in the field of precision agriculture.
    It is observed that there is the incremental growth to adopt the WSN in PA and
    having wide range of the applicability. It is reported that WSNs are widely used
    to monitor agricultural fields, optimize irrigation for the crops, measure temperature
    and soil properties. In this paper, seventy-eight articles are studied and arranged
    these articles into three different categories i.e. monitoring of the crops, irrigation
    management and environmental parameters management. Further, this review also
    discusses the different communication technologies of WSNs available for precision
    agriculture in literature. A list of different sensor used in PA is also given.
    The major contribution of this literature to scientific community is given below.
    RQ1) From literature, it is seen that number of techniques/tools are designed
    by various researchers for PA using WSNs. These tools are IMOTE2, Arduino, EZ430-RF2500,
    MDA300 sensor board, EZ43-RF2500, MDA300, Indriya, MICAZ, ZKOS, MSP430, PIC16F877,
    CVX toolbox, MOSEK, Veris mobile sensor platform, MDA320, MTS400. These tools
    integrate the different sensors on it and collect the information regarding various
    parameters of PA and this information is used for decision making. It is observed
    that Arduino platform is widely adopted as a platform to integrate different sensors
    due to low cost and ease to embed. It is also seen that some algorithms are also
    developed for effective monitoring and smart irrigation of crops. These algorithms
    include OASNDFA, DCTA, BOP, LAA, distributed localization algorithm, range based
    localization algorithms, polynomial-time algorithms for deployment of nodes, electromagnetic
    induction algorithm, MLR, PCR and PLSR methods. Some of new communication protocols
    are also reported in few research articles like APTEEN protocol, Fuzzy based energy
    efficient protocol, ECHERP. It is also revealed that the Tiny OS and Tiny OS 2.0
    are taken as operating system for sensors. RQ2) In precision agriculture, large
    numbers of sensors are adopted for collecting the real time information about
    the growth of crops as well as different environmental parameters like humidity,
    temperature, soil moisture etc. All these information is collected through randomly
    deployed sensor nodes. Further, this information is collected on a central point
    for processing purpose. The processed information is used in decision making and
    action is taken according the processed information. Table 9 shows the list of
    different sensors reported in literature. This table also illustrates the significance
    of each sensor and citation details of these sensors are also given. The working
    of few sensors is discussed as Sensor s8000 measures the PH parameter, HYDRA-PROBE
    II sensor measure conductivity, salinity, soil moisture, and temperature values.
    EC-10HS measure the moisture of soil, EC-5 sensor for measuring soil moisture,
    SHT-11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity, N-sensor for measuring the
    requirement of nitrogen to the crop, VH400 is a soil-moisture sensor which measure
    the amount of moisture present in soil, DS1822 sensor is used to measure the temperature,
    SEN-13322 sensors measure the volumetric content of water in the soil. It is found
    that PA cannot achieve without the help of these sensors. Table 8 illustrates
    the list of sensors used for measuring weather conditions. It is seen that in
    PA, most of works is reported on measuring the soil parameters. RQ3) Large numbers
    of crops are taken into consideration in literature to validate the applicability
    of the WSNs in agriculture. The aim to adopt the WSNs in agriculture is to monitor
    the crops, irrigation management and measure the different environmental parameters
    which are responsible for the growth and improved quality of the crops. Table
    10 demonstrates the list of crops which are considered for experimentation. It
    is found that eighteen different crops are taken by researchers to investigate
    the role of WSNs in agriculture. These crops include broccoli crop, cotton plant,
    orange orchards, orchid greenhouses, vinyl greenhouse, sugarcane field, grape
    farms, pepper vegetable greenhouse, potato crop, citrus and blueberry crop, maize
    field, wheat, peach orchards and many more. Further, it is observed that WSNs
    is widely used to monitor the growth of crops in green houses. RQ4) From literature,
    it is seen that five communication technologies are adopted in WSNs for PA. These
    communication technologies are described in Table 5. These are Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM and WiMAX. Out of these five techniques, only four techniques
    are used. Presently, WiMAX communication technology is not adopted in PA till
    date due to high cost and large size. Table 6 shows the various communication
    technologies cited in different research articles. It is concluded that most of
    researchers works with the ZigBee communication technology due to high transmission
    range and low cost and cited in twenty-seven research articles. The second most
    valuable communication technology is GSM/GPRS and it is cited in sixteen research
    articles. Apart from these, several points can be highlighted from this study.
    Seventy-eight SCI listed research articles are included in this study from thirty-five
    different journals. In PA, lot of works are reported on measuring soil parameters
    including soil moisture, PH value, soil temperature etc., for improving quality
    of crops. For effective monitoring and irrigation management, some algorithms
    are also presented by various researchers in the field of PA. Tiny OS and Tiny
    OS 2.0 are adopted as operating system for sensor nodes due to low complexity.
    It is noted that Arduino platform is widely adopted to integrate the different
    component of WSNs in PA. In PA, some work is also reported on communication protocols.
    Some of new communication protocols are developed for effective communication
    between different components of WSNs. This review also lightens on the communication
    technologies adopted in WSNs for PA. It is found that till date only four communication
    technologies is used. It is seen that widely adopted communication technology
    is ZigBee. A lot of crops have been investigated by using WSNs for precision agriculture.
    It is observed that vineyard crop is examined multiple times. EC-5 senor is widely
    used for measuring the soil moisture. Some works are also presented on the deployment
    of sensor nodes in agriculture filed. In few research articles, automatic irrigation
    model is also proposed and these models also reduce the human effort. Few of articles
    are reported on intrusion detection in the agriculture field. Hence, there is
    a scope of work in this direction. Lack of work is reported on the usability of
    fertilizers in the agriculture field. Abbreviations APTEEN: Adaptive periodic

    \ (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noccurred, tens of applications including\
    \ smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions\nto modernize the\
    \ farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive\n\
    environmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This platform is deployed\
    \ and tested in a real\nscenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period\
    \ of March 2020 to March 2021. The experi-\nmental work fulﬁlls the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental\nparameters using\
    \ both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting\n\
    vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every\
    \ 1 h, after which the\nobtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone\
    \ to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h.\nThis low-cost platform can\
    \ help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental\ndata\
    \ over the geographically large farm ﬁeld, which leads to enhancement in crop\
    \ productivity and\nfarm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ experimental results infer that\nautomated and human-made sets of actions can\
    \ be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative\nintegration between IoT\
    \ sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture,\n\
    which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.\n\

    \ (FAO) predicts that by 2050, the world popu-\nlation will hit 9.73 billion,\
    \ and by 2100, it will be 11.2 billion; with the current population of\napproximately\
    \ 7.84 billion, this shows an increase of approximately 25% [1]. To feed this\n\
    larger population, food production should double by 2050 [2]. For example, the\
    \ current\nﬁgure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production should reach\
    \ approximately 3 billion\ntons [3]. This means there is a serious need to enhance\
    \ productivity and meet the demands\nof nations [4]. However, the current agricultural\
    \ land is restricted by various factors such as\nland and climate patterns, population\
    \ density, and rapid urbanization, which are constantly\nposing threats to the\
    \ availability of arable land [5]. To illustrate, in 1991, the total arable\n\
    area for food production was 19.5 million square miles (39.47% of the world’s\
    \ land area),\nwhich was reduced to approximately 18.6 million square miles (37.73%\
    \ of the world’s land\narea) in 2013 [6]. Thus, the gap between the demand and\
    \ supply of food is becoming\nmore signiﬁcant and alarming as time progresses.\
    \ Therefore, authors in the literature [7,8]\nemphasize the signiﬁcance of enhancing\
    \ farm management by using scientiﬁc strategies\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908.\

    Sustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n2 of 26\nand technology in the agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ which, in turn, drastically boost crop productivity\nand help in saving natural\
    \ resources [9,10].\nIn recent years of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),\
    \ researchers, engineers, and\nIT specialists are striving to participate in employing\
    \ advanced technology to achieve\na better life for our planet, as Figure 1 shows\
    \ [11,12]. One of those pillars of 4IR is IoT,\nwhich is considered as the fuel\
    \ of the 4IR since it contributes effectively by linking trillions\nof objects\
    \ and sensors, all of which generate real-time data. It is expected that around\n\
    100 billion devices have been connected to the internet by 2020 [13,14]. This\
    \ number will\nfurther increase since the IoT is progressively entering a wide\
    \ array of sectors and indus-\ntries, ranging from manufacturing, health, communications,\
    \ and energy to the agricultural\nindustry [15]. In an agricultural environment,\
    \ for instance, IoT technology has been uti-\nlized to deal with distributed data\
    \ collection from farming environments and, important\nfor directing farmers,\
    \ with real-time information of the farming ﬁeld [16]. On the other\nhand, integration\
    \ between IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracts researchers’\nattention\
    \ for various reasons. UAVs’ reliability, ﬂexibility, portability, line of sight\
    \ (LoS)\nconnectivity, efﬁciency, applicability, rapid deployment, and low maintenance\
    \ cost are valid\nreasons for considering such a technology. UAVs cover a wide\
    \ range of platforms, from\ndrones to high altitude platforms (HAPs), low altitude\
    \ platforms (LAPs), or tethered plat-\nforms [17,18]. UAVs have drawn tremendous\
    \ attention, both in the industry and academia,\ndue to their advantages and wide\
    \ applications [19]. For example, telecommunications,\nmonitor disaster-relief\
    \ missions, empowering smart cities, atmospheric studies, service\ndelivery, surveillance,\
    \ high-resolution imaging, and military applications [20,21].\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n2 of \n \nply of food is becoming more significant\
    \ and alarming as time progresses. Therefore, au\nthors in the literature [7,8]\
    \ emphasize the significance of enhancing farm management b\nusing scientific\
    \ strategies and technology in the agricultural field, which, in turn, drast\n\

    \ rapid deployment, and low maintenance cost ar\nvalid reasons for considering\
    \ such a technology. UAVs cover a wide range of platform\nfrom drones to high\

    \ [17,18]. UAVs have drawn tremendous attention, both in the industry and ac\n\

    \ Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa)-based\nIoT platform for Smart Farming Modular\
    \ IoT Architecture called LoRaFarM that aims to im-\nprove generic farms management\
    \ in a highly customizable way. The proposed LoRaFarM\nplatform has been evaluated\
    \ in a real farm in Italy, where it collected environmental data\n(air, soil,\
    \ temperature, and humidity) related to the growth of farm products (e.g., grapes\n\
    and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization\
    \ tool\nfor the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.\n\
    Authors in [27] developed a hierarchical smart farming structure based on the\
    \ collabo-\nration between UAVs and federated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ for crop monitoring.\nTwo important aspects of such collaboration have been\
    \ considered: designing the UAV tra-\njectories for efﬁcient data collection and\
    \ implementing effective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate\
    \ approximation) at the network level to assess relevant\ndata transmission. Experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 5908\n4 of 26\ndifferent crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the collaborative\nUAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both\
    \ smart farming and ecological\nagriculture.\nA smart agriculture management system\
    \ (SAMS) was introduced in [28], which\nproposed an automated system to help farmers\
    \ to increase crop production by crashing\ninto natural resources. The system\
    \ used different sensors to collect data required for the\ngrowth of the crop,\
    \ where these data were fed into the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for\ndata visualization.\
    \ The real-time data were stored on Firebase Database and then used for\ncrop\
    \ prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer.\nResearchers in [29]\
    \ presented an intelligent antifrost irrigation management system\nthat contains\
    \ a climatological station and ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation. The\n\
    solar-powered system interacts with the environmental system through a website,\
    \ allowing\nthe real-time interconnection, acquisition, and monitoring of information\
    \ through mobile\nphone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. Additionally,\
    \ the proposed\nsystem uses an intelligent Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to predict\
    \ the greenhouse temperature\nand control activation of a water pump, considering\
    \ humidity, the temperature of inside\nand outside air, solar radiation, and wind\
    \ speed. The intelligent model gives a prediction\nby determining coefﬁcients\
    \ with the analysis of variance method.\nNestor et al. in [30] developed an application\
    \ for water irrigation called “Agrinex.”\nThis system is an alternative approach\
    \ in collecting and measuring physical parameters\nfrom the environment, particularly\
    \ in smart irrigation systems. Agrinex is connected to\nseveral in-ﬁeld sensors\
    \ such as a water level sensor, paddy temperature sensor, and a\nﬁeld weather\
    \ station. This work aimed to make this information accessible anywhere\nwherever\
    \ there is internet access using a mobile application, which makes Agrinex scalable\n\
    and adaptable to changes. The mesh-based network recorded a maximum transmission\n\
    distance of 11 m from sink to sensor node with a 90% success rate. Data from the\
    \ ﬁeld can\nbe accessed remotely close to real-time when short network delays\
    \ are accounted for. It\nalso gives the additional beneﬁt of equipping lands with\
    \ an automated irrigation system\nthat conserves up to 81% of water consumption.\n\
    Authors in [31] proposed a system that decides whether or not water is needed\n\
    for farms by predicting the rainfall using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.\
    \ In the\nproposed system, voluminous weather and soil moisture data are stored\
    \ inside the cloud\nservers. Based on data collected by a UAV and then fed to\
    \ the GA, water spraying is\nperformed, which can be monitored using a mobile\
    \ application. Cloud servers are used for\nstoring and processing large volumes\
    \ of weather and soil moisture data. Results show that\nthe sensor-based system\
    \ is activated to check whether the GA-based system completes its\nprediction\
    \ correctly or not by sensing moisture levels from the soil. If the moisture level\n\
    of the soil crosses the predeﬁned threshold value, then plant watering is performed\
    \ by\nquadrotor UAV.\nResearchers in [32] developed a framework for monitoring\
    \ pests and diseases of crops\nbased on IoT and UAV that attempts to solve the\
    \ correlation between the occurrence of\npests/diseases and weather parameters.\
    \ The proposed framework is deployed in the\nYangtze River Zone of China, where\
    \ it uses rotary devices based on sun perception to\nobtain solar energy. Results\
    \ infer that low-altitude remote sensing and monitoring through\naerial imaging\
    \ of pests and diseases using UAV is reasonable, while more analyses of\nclimate\
    \ changes would provide some precautions in advance.\nA Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ system is proposed in [33] to collect underground soil\nparameters in potato\
    \ crops using a UAV network. Around 2500 sensors deployed under\nand above ground\
    \ are connected to UAV using Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\n(LPWPAN).\
    \ Simulation results show that due to UAV altitude and path loss, the link quality\n\
    between the ground sensor and UAV is reduced. Another observation is that the\
    \ lifetime\nof sensor batteries was varied depending on the location of the sensor\
    \ under or above\nground. Using LoRa technology and proper path loss model are\
    \ recommended as future\nwork to enhance link accuracy and performance. Regarding\
    \ path loss, authors in [22–25]\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n5 of 26\ndiscussed\
    \ different types of propagation path loss from an aerial platform perspective,\n\
    where Free-Space and Air-to-Ground are typical deterministic propagation models,\
    \ while\nHata and Okumura are typical empirical ones. Results show that an appropriate\
    \ model can\nbe selected based on coverage range, adaption across different terrains,\
    \ and better Quality\nof Service (QoS).\nAuthors in [34] suggested a heterogeneous\
    \ IoT sensor node system to sense acoustic,\nrain, wind, light, temperature, and\
    \ pH levels of the cornﬁelds for smart agriculture applica-\ntions. The system\
    \ aimed to achieve productive corn harvest in large-scale ﬁelds using a\ndrone\
    \ that gathers data and sends it to a gateway. The simulation results that monitored\n\
    at the gateway using the IoT application called Grafana show that it offers maximum\n\
    efﬁciency from the soil and follows the crop development according to the weather\
    \ and soil\nconditions, in addition to reducing the workload and the risk of disease\
    \ and pest, as well\nas optimizing irrigation and obtaining better quality products\
    \ at low cost. As future work,\ncollecting a wider range of climatic data and\
    \ geographical conditions would be useful in\ndesigning a model of smart farming.\n\

    \ integration between IoT and drone\nis also coupled with cloud computing technology,\
    \ which, in turn, helps in building sus-\ntainable smart agriculture and enhancing\
    \ crop productivity and farm management in a\ncost-effective, and timely manner.\n\
    Thus, the paper aims to implement a system that periodically collects data using\n\
    both under- and aboveground sensors on farms and sends them to the gateway; then,\n\
    using a drone with a LoRa module onboard, the obtained data are transmitted to\
    \ the cloud\nfor storage, analysis, and monitor the status of crops and farms.\

    \ farming. Figure 3 shows\nthe conceptual work in a bird’s-eye view of the proposed\

    \ the model when propagating signals from the drone\nto terrestrial sensors and\
    \ using LoS connectivity to improve reliability, increased end-\nuser mobility,\

    \ 2021, 13, 5908\n12 of 26\nwhat exists in models presented in the literature,\
    \ as presented in related works of the\nprevious section.\nHata’s equations are\
    \ classiﬁed into urban, suburban, or rural areas; yet, here, it was\nconsidered\
    \ only in rural areas since it involved farm zones [37,38]. The distance d of\
    \ the\nHata propagation model is computed based on elevation angle (θ), which\
    \ is a notable shift\nfrom existing propagation models. The θ is a vital element\
    \ in calculating path loss from\nspace such as in drone scenarios. Path loss in\
    \ a rural area is given by\nPL(urban) = 69.55 + 26.16 log ( f ) − 13.82 log (ht)\

    \ such as geographic location, soil property, and climate can be referred to the\n\
    map of world climates.\nThe proposed system can be explained in ﬁve steps, as\

    \ these data were stored temporarily on an embedded Secure Digital (SD) card in\n\
    the wireless server gateway. Third, the drone ﬂew and collected data from various\
    \ wireless\nserver gateways located in the farm every 12 h. Fourth, the drone\
    \ sent the data to the cloud.\nFifth, automated and human-made sets of actions\
    \ could be taken to apply smart actions\nfor precision agriculture, which, in\
    \ turn, dramatically boost crop productivity, and help\nin saving natural resources.\
    \ These actions could be obtained from the cloud into the user\ninterface smart\

    \ farming involves the integration of advanced technologies into existing farm-\n\
    ing practices to increase production efﬁciency and quality of agricultural products.\
    \ The\nevolution of IoT and UAVs has enabled the vision of sustainable smart farming,\
    \ where\nthese smart technologies have proven to increase the quality of crop\
    \ yield and reduce the\nenvironmental footprint from the agricultural sector.\
    \ This paper shows a low-cost platform\nfor comprehensive environmental parameter\
    \ monitoring using ﬂying IoT. The proposal is\nbased on experimental work to fulﬁll\
    \ the requirements of automated and real-time monitor-\ning of the environmental\
    \ parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These\nIoT sensors devices\
    \ on a farm collect vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent\nto ground\
    \ gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data are collected and transmitted\n\
    by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This platform is\
    \ deployed\nand tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the\
    \ period of March 2020\nto March 2021, covering open-ﬁeld and greenhouse cultivation.\
    \ This low-cost platform\ncan help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to\
    \ predict environmental conditions\ndata over the geographically large farm ﬁeld,\
    \ which leads to enhancement of crop produc-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n\
    24 of 26\ntivity and farm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ practical\nresults indicate that automated and human-made sets of actions have\
    \ been applied and/or\nsuggested that are smart actions for precision agriculture,\
    \ which, in turn, dramatically\nboost crop productivity and help in saving natural\
    \ resources. Examples of these actions are\nthe following:\n•\nFarmers are advised\
    \ to consider various strategies such as spraying chemicals on\nplants during\
    \ some seasons;\n•\nVarious plantings and quarterly grains are suggested;\n•\n\
    Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to ﬁeld capacity;\n•\nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from high light intensity\n\
    during summer;\n•\nAdjust water irrigation using automated dripping and sprinkling\
    \ based on environ-\nmental parameters;\n•\nUsing solar panels for powering the\
    \ weather station leads to energy efﬁciency.\nFrom a practical point of view,\
    \ the deployed nodes, which are fed by a solar panel-\nrecharged battery, have\
    \ correctly transmitted data for 12 months, with underground and\naboveground\
    \ sensors and despite bad weather conditions. Indeed, even though some\nsamples\
    \ were lost during several rainy days, once their batteries were recharged by\
    \ solar\nlight during the following sunny days, nodes restarted to transmit properly.\n\
    PL and RSS of the Hata propagation model of the distance between the ground station\n\
    and the drone at the cloud layer show reasonable results, in which the obtained\
    \ values\nsatisfy a high level of reception with the smallest attenuated signal,\
    \ besides achieving line\nof sight wireless connectivity in an efﬁcient and timely\
    \ manner. More elaboration can be\ntaken into consideration for future work, e.g.,\
    \ to develop a machine learning algorithm\nto predict environmental conditions\
    \ and then suggest solutions and/or precautions. A\ndecision support system framework\
    \ could be introduced as part of a future project to link\nthe farm’s smart devices\
    \ together to achieve an autonomous system. Moreover, the power\nconsumption of\
    \ the drone can be optimized to enhance ﬂight time, which leads to covering\n\
    wider farm zones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software,\

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\

    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\

    [7]\nSoil Analysis\nLand management offers long-term promise based\non climate,\
    \ geography, and reasonably stable soil\ncharacteristics (like soil texture, depth,\

    \ from\nfarms, Village Tree provides smart pest control\nsolutions. In addition,\

    \ of ﬁeld, keep a\nhistory of growing crops in the ﬁeld (e.g., planting,\nfertilizing,\
    \ harvesting, warehouses, gas station), and\ntrack the location of objects in\
    \ the ﬁeld (e.g., soil\nsampling for agrochemical laboratory) by eFarmer\nApplication.\n\

    \ it\nmay be used to its full potential. It determines the\noptimal fertilizer\
    \ mixture created to cover the\nneeded nutrient suspension and considers the\n\
    demands of diverse yields. In addition, it considers\nthe cost of fertilizer based\
    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\
    Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.\n\
    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\
    \ 4 compares the efﬁciency of several smart agricultural techniques.\nAgronomy\

    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\

    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\

    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\

    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\

    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\
    \ of mobile tools, as\nshown in Figure 7. Other technologies like Bluetooth, WSN,\
    \ RFID, Raspberry Pi, ZigBee,\nLoRa, and GPRS are less popular in the agriculture\
    \ and farming industries. In the agri-\ncultural and farming business comparison,\
    \ the farming sector uses IoT for automation\nslower [42]. The Plant Server and\
    \ User View were created with phpMyAdmin to manage\nMySQL server management. The\
    \ F-RCNN-qualiﬁed model for anomaly detection had\n80% conﬁdence, while the technique\

    \ IoT.\n6. Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe implementation of sustainable\
    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\
    \ agricultural productivity. Many processes throughout the production cycle,\n\
    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    737102, India Abstract: The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) has shown a new
    direction of innovative research in agricultural domain. Being at nascent stage,
    IoT needs to be widely experimented so as to get widely applied in various agricultural
    applications. In this paper, I review various potential IoT applications, and
    the specific issues and challenges associated with IoT deployment for improved
    farming. To focus on the specific requirements the devices, and wireless communication
    technologies associated with IoT in agricultural and farming applications are
    analyzed comprehensively. Investigations are made on those sensor enabled IoT
    systems that provide intelligent and smart services towards smart agriculture.
    Various case studies are presented to explore the existing IoT based solutions
    performed by various organizations and individuals and categories according to
    their deployment parameters. Related difficulties in these solutions, while identifying
    the factors for improvement and future road map of work using the IoT are also
    highlighted. Keywords: Internet of things, smart agriculture, precision agriculture

    Explore all metrics Abstract Precision agriculture (PA) is the use of information
    and communication technology together with best agricultural practices for farm
    management. PA requires the acquisition, transmission and processing of large
    amounts of data from farm fields. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a system
    for monitoring agriculture fields. Several researchers have used WSNs to collect
    the required data from the regions of interest for their intended usages in various
    applications. In a WSN, the energy consumption of the sensor nodes is the main
    issue, due to its direct impact on the lifetime of the network. Many approaches
    have been proposed to address this issue using different power sources and types
    of nodes. Specifically, in PA, because of the extended time period that is required
    to monitor fields, using an appropriate WSN approach is important. There is a
    need for a comprehensive review of WSN approaches for PA. The aim of this paper
    is to classify and describe the state-of-the-art of WSNs and analyze their energy
    consumption based on their power sources. WSN approaches in PA are categorized
    and discussed according to their features. Similar content being viewed by others

    agriculture (PA) is a concept that combines information technology with agricultural
    principles to manage spatial and temporal variability in the agricultural production
    process. This arrangement may boost agricultural yields whilst reducing harmful
    impact to the environment. One of the efficient technologies that is used to monitor
    and collect data in PA is a wireless sensor network (WSN). WSNs collect data of
    essential spatial and temporal variables that are necessary for decision making
    in agricultural farm management (Coates et al. 2013; Díaz et al. 2011; Dong et
    al. 2013; Yu et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2011). WSN is a recent novel technology
    that has prospects for improving many applications as well as creating novel systems
    in PA and several other applications, such as global-scale environmental monitoring,
    pest and disease control and animal tracing (Stankovic 2008; Vellidis et al. 2008;
    Vicaire et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2006). In PA, WSNs have been deployed to acquire
    micro-climatological data in farm fields, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture content and wind speed. For example, in the Luster project (Selavo et
    al. 2007), a WSN was used in an environmental science system for measuring the
    effect of sunlight on plant growth. Furthermore, WSNs have been used to measure
    crop growth, irrigation and several other applications (Baggio 2005; Garcia-Sanchez
    et al. 2011; Shaikh et al. 2010; Vellidis et al. 2008). In a WSN, the lifetime
    of the network is dependent on the power source requirement of the nodes. Thus,
    selecting a suitable power source for a PA application is essential. The main
    types of power sources are battery or solar power; however, each has its own issues.
    To the best of our knowledge, there are not yet surveys that categorize WSNs for
    PA based on the power source. Ruiz-Garcia et al. (2009) discussed the general
    application area of WSNs in agriculture. They explained different systems that
    are available based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and WSNs. Similarly,
    Wang et al. (2006) explained the available WSN technologies that are applicable
    to agriculture and the food industry. In this paper, first, WSNs and the available
    network topologies are described. Second, the sensor node power sources are categorized
    and discussed in terms of homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes, and their advantages
    and disadvantages are noted. Current approaches and their energy consumption are
    reviewed and described based on these classifications. Third, the approaches are
    summarized and discussed according to their features, applications and technical
    contributions. Wireless sensor networks A WSN is a distributed network of relatively
    small, lightweight wireless nodes that are equipped with sensors (Can and Demirbas
    2013; Owojaiye and Sun 2012; Rathnayaka and Potdar 2013; Van Hoesel et al. 2013).
    Sensor nodes are the basic building blocks of a WSN. A typical node is composed
    of a transceiver, sensor(s), external memory and power source. Figure 1 shows
    the basic architecture of the nodes. The node has the ability to sense, process
    and communicate spatial and temporal variables of interest. Such nodes are deployed
    in areas of interest to work together for environmental or system monitoring (Peng
    and Liu 2012; Stankovic 2008; Vicaire et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2006). Fig. 1 Basic
    architecture of a sensor node Full size image WSN topologies Notable topologies
    mentioned in the literature include the single-star topology (Srbinovska et al.
    2014), mesh topology (Watras et al. 2014), and cluster tree-based topology (Senturk
    and Akkaya 2014). Star single-hop topology In star single-hop topologies, each
    node (or ‘client’) must communicate to other nodes (‘clients’) through a central
    hub (or a ‘server’) or cluster head. The clients do not relay packets through
    other nodes. Instead, each node directly transmits its packet to the cluster head.
    Tongtong et al. (2011) proposed a method of sensing and monitoring the temperature
    and humidity in a greenhouse environment for various distances. It consists of
    one more sensor nodes, some repeat nodes, one main node, PC Terminal, MYSQL (an
    open source relational database management system), web service and one real time
    alarm system. Based on this system, the temperature and humidity parameters can
    be sensed and monitored. They then used the database and web service to record
    the parameters at specific times. Finally, a curve showing the measurement differences
    from the sensing module is drawn by the web server. If the curve depicts abnormal
    changes in the temperature and humidity measurements, an alarm system is triggered,
    which informs the monitor to take required action. In this system, although the
    wireless transceiver distance was limited by the battery power to just 1.26 m,
    the distance could be increased in steps of 1.26 m for each node. Thus, the total
    distance could be calculated as 1.26 m × [1 + N(repeat nodes)]. Shaikh et al.
    (2010) designed WSN nodes with a protocol that ensured low power consumption in
    their development of a cost-efficient crop irrigation control system. The nodes
    are categorized into sensor, actuator and sink nodes, to create a functional architecture.
    The system collects sensor data packets wirelessly via a ZigBee wireless technology
    (Baronti et al. 2007) configuration and transfers them to a connected PC through
    a serial interface. It then sends the request and actuator packet that was generated
    by the acquisition and control/decision support system through the WSN network.
    The network protocol described makes the protocol in this experiment a star single-hop
    topology. With the use of these components and topology, a broadcast based protocol
    called “ProtoSense” was then developed. In this protocol, data request is made
    one level at a time. If the target node is not at one level, it would be forwarded
    to the next level. Hence, this protocol can efficiently optimize power by reducing
    extra communication. It also introduces a request acknowledgement pattern to ensure
    reliability. Cluster tree-based multiple-hop topology In this type of topology,
    two or more star networks communicate through a central hub called a ‘root node’.
    Each sensor node transmits data within a limited radius to reach a nearby cluster
    head. The lower cluster heads then refine the data packets and act as relays to
    further transmit the refined data to a super cluster head or a root node. There
    can be communication among the lower cluster heads via peer-to-peer topologies.
    This type of network structure is implemented in a data aggregation method to
    reduce the energy consumption in the WSN deployment. For example, Nesa Sudha et
    al. (2011) organized sensor nodes into clusters, with one node acting as a cluster
    head and a base station (BS) acting as a super cluster head. This experiment combined
    six sensors per cluster, and there were three clusters in all. The data transmission
    between the BS and cluster heads and also communication between the clusters was
    by time division multiple access (TDMA). The data transmission was based on a
    single-hop from one node to a nearby node. Overall, the network structure of this
    deployment is a cluster tree-based multiple hop topology. Each node is assigned
    a unique identification address and is known to the BS. At any point in time,
    TDMA scheduled any one of the nodes as the cluster head and communicated this
    information to all of the nodes in the cluster. All of the nodes transmit their
    power source information to the BS, and the node with the highest energy level
    in the cluster is assigned to be head of that cluster. Peng and Liu (2012) described
    the implementation of an auto system scheme in which the sensor network nodes
    are combined with fuzzy controller nodes to schedule irrigation. In the design
    structure of the system, the WSN is composed of a sensor node cluster, a co-ordinator
    node and a controller node. Irrigation pipelines are laid across the irrigated
    areas, and electric control valves are installed on the pipelines. The sensor
    nodes collect humidity and temperature data and form sensor clusters based on
    the plant-water status. In the network structure, each sensor node gathers the
    real-time data of its surrounding areas and sends it to the cluster heads. The
    information is further sent to the co-ordinator nodes within a set time period.
    In the co-ordinator node is an embedded fuzzy controller. This controller controls
    the pump valves and decides when to activate the irrigation and for how long.
    The WSN deployment from the data collection to the decision-making point makes
    the network structure a cluster tree-based multiple hop topology. Mesh topology
    In mesh topology, each sensor node communicates to every other sensor node and
    acts as a relay to transmit data from the other nodes in the network. Gao et al.
    (2013) proposed an intelligent irrigation system based on a WSN and fuzzy control.
    The objective was to solve issues of soil fertility loss and water wastage in
    irrigation. The system was composed of sensor nodes and the controller node; additionally,
    soil moisture sensors, irrigation pipes, spray irrigation and irrigation control
    valves were deployed. The ZigBee network was adopted in the mesh network topology.
    While the sensor nodes acted as terminal nodes in the field, some sensors nodes
    were selected as routers. These router nodes collected data from the terminal
    nodes and transmitted them to a head node, called sink node, which gathers and
    controls data collected by other nodes. A control panel was introduced as the
    control node. Data were acquired at periodic intervals; the control valve opened
    and closed the irrigation process depending on the command received. Vellidis
    et al. (2013) reported on use of a mesh network-based soil moisture sensing WSN
    in combination with variable rate irrigation (VRI) at the 2013 European conference
    on precision agriculture. Majone et al. (2013) monitored soil moisture dynamics
    in the top soil to analyze the interplay between soil moisture dynamics and plant
    physiology. Their experiment used a multi-hop WSN that was connected across several
    soil and temperature nodes that were deployed across 27 locations. The sensor
    nodes were connected to an input/output interface through a node called TinyNode
    584 (Dubois-Ferrière et al. 2006) WSN platform, which was developed by SHOCKFISH
    company, Lausanne, Switzerland. Power sources WSNs have been proposed to detect
    and monitor spatial and temporal parameters (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011; Peres
    et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012). The results are then used to control the levels
    of parameters to suit specific plant soil requirements and to provide event services.
    An example is the use of a WSN for intelligent diagnosis services and to schedule
    irrigation management. Power is required for WSN devices throughout their period
    of operation (Anastasi et al. 2009; Anisi et al. 2013b). There are two main types
    of power source: battery and solar. Battery sources Although batteries are relatively
    low cost and small size, continuous exposure to high temperature levels in fields
    have other undesirable effects, such as a shortened cycle life and an increased
    rate of self-discharge (Park et al. 2005). Short time battery life is a limitation
    on long-term monitoring. Rechargeable batteries can be used as a source of power
    to make up for the energy depletion in the sensor nodes. Homogeneous battery-based
    power approaches In homogenous WSNs, all of the sensor nodes possess the same
    network attributes in terms of their computational capability, battery power and
    transmission radius (Hou et al. 2005). All of the sensor nodes are identical,
    and all of the nodes might have the same lifetime. The advantage of using homogeneous
    nodes is that they are less complicated and uniform in their maintenance requirements.
    All of the sensor nodes could also be low-cost. In terms of cluster formation,
    any one of them can be selected as a cluster head. However, due to the continuous
    processing of data in terms of aggregation and protocol co-ordination and the
    long-range communication that are maintained with the remote BS, the co-ordinator
    nodes could become overloaded. As they have the same power resource as the other
    sensor nodes, their energy depletes faster resulting in premature failure (Mhatre
    and Rosenberg 2004). Vellidis et al. (2008) proposed a system in which multiple
    homogenous sensor nodes were used for monitoring soil moisture and temperature
    to schedule irrigation in a cotton farm. There was single-hop data transmission
    of data via RFID to a fixed central receiving unit. A laptop connected to the
    receiver was placed at one end of the field. The sensor nodes were composed of
    sensors, a sensor circuit board, and an RFID tag. At periodic intervals, the smart
    sensor board acquired sensor values and transmitted those values wirelessly to
    the receiver. The presence of plant biomass, terrain and objects imposed transmission
    difficulties during field testing of the prototype. This difficulty was solved
    when tags were removed from the electronic boards and mounted on hollow flexible
    fiberglass rods at approximately 1.2 m above ground level. A large number of sensor
    nodes were deployed to cover a large area. However, such a large number of nodes
    can cause interference problems which may result in more packet loss. A sensor
    circuit board which was called “smart sensor board” was supported by battery power.
    The micro-controller switched to sleep mode between sensor readings and data transmission.
    Sub-circuits also went ON and OFF as required. The microcontroller transmitted
    an alarm code when the voltage dropped below an acceptable threshold. This was
    meant to send an alarm and thereby avoid regular inspections. This method of power
    management increased the battery life through the growing season. Although some
    energy consumption reduction methods were implemented to conserve power, the approach
    was still not energy efficient. This is because the approach gathered data by
    using single-hop transmission of data from the multiple nodes in the field to
    the centrally fixed receiving unit. This method does not balance the energy expenditure
    to the multiple sensor nodes in the field. The energy levels of the nodes located
    farther away from the sink would deplete faster due to more transmission power
    required for long transmission ranges. Most of those sensor nodes would fail before
    their counterparts closer to the sink. Therefore, the energy of the network is
    unbalanced and thus, the network lifetime may be short. Baggio (2005) instrumented
    a potato field to monitor micro-climate: humidity, temperature and weather. This
    action was intended to reveal when the crop was at risk of developing a phytophtora
    disease. The experiment was also to collect statistics on the behavior of the
    WSN in a real-world experiment. Furthermore, the robustness of the energy-efficient
    T-MAC (Van Dam and Langendoen 2003) protocol was also tested. The sensor nodes
    used in the experiment were called TNOdes. These nodes were deployed across the
    field with some of them acting as relays. These relays were without sensors. These
    homogeneous sensor nodes measured the climatological conditions. A weather station
    was also installed on the field to register luminosity, precipitation, wind strength
    and direction. Soil moisture, which is a critical factor for micro-climate and
    development of diseases, was measured by a number of sensors. A sensor to measure
    the height of the groundwater table was installed. The nodes collected and transmitted
    infield data to a so-called field gateway, which also forwarded the data to a
    low frequency array (LOFAR) gateway by Wi-Fi. LOFAR is the low-frequency array
    for radio astronomy built by ASTRON organization in the Netherlands. The LOFAR
    gateway was connected to the internet through cable, and data were uploaded to
    a LOFAR server and further distributed to a couple of other servers using the
    extensible mark-up language (XML) format. The data on the behavior of the WSN,
    which was gathered during the experiment, served as a foundation for WSN algorithm
    simulations to check failed connections and dead nodes. A number of methods were
    adopted to ensure optimal utilization of the power source and to extend the lifetime
    of the sensor nodes. For example, the nodes reported data only every 10 min. The
    data sent over the wireless link was minimized by the delta encoding technique
    (Mogul et al. 1997) which is a data compression technique for efficient data storage.
    Data compression over radio communication lines was also considered. An energy-efficiency
    protocol called T-MAC was introduced, and it was implemented on the radio with
    a duty cycle of 7 %. Furthermore, some methods also ensured reliable data delivery
    to the LOFAR gateway, in such a way as to avert data loss. A multi-hop routing
    protocol (MintRoute) was proposed and used to maintain reliability of the WSN.
    This method reveals when the crop is at risk of developing disease and informs
    the farmer to appropriately treat the field or parts of it with fungicide. Their
    approach, with nodes reporting data every 10 min, was designed to save power.
    Furthermore, to balance energy, the multi-hop routing protocol of TinyOS (Levis
    et al. 2005), an application-specific operation system for WSN, was used to send
    data. Their approach was energy-efficient as it combined both energy balancing
    and energy consumption methods. Nesa Sudha et al. (2011) proposed an energy-efficient
    TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor communications in an automatic irrigation
    system. Their experiment involved a header node that collected data directly from
    all of the nodes in the field and passed them to the BS. Such a network arrangement
    made it a star single-hop topology. Direct communication is maintained between
    the sensor nodes and the BS in the data accumulation process, whereby the header
    node does not work on the collected data except to directly transmit it to the
    BS. The process starts by the BS assigning unique identification addresses to
    each of the nodes. The nodes went into a sleep state (or into a receiving mode)
    after acquiring the address. To obtain data at a specific location, the BS sent
    a broadcast request to all of the nodes, but only the addressed node responded
    with its present temperature and moisture values. The BS received values from
    all of the areas by repeating this process for all of the nodes in its address
    table. In this approach, the medium access control (MAC) (I.C.S.L.M.S. Committee
    1997) protocol was used to control energy consumption. Sensor nodes turned ON/OFF
    their radio according to a schedule to save energy. The approach verifies that
    data fusion (aggregation) in which nodes were grouped into clusters was more energy
    efficient than direct communication in which each node transmitted data directly
    to the sink. In energy conservation, a distributed TDMA-based scheme which leads
    to collision free transmission over the data channel was used. This reduced the
    energy consumption by each node thereby reducing the overall energy consumption.
    This approach could therefore extend the network lifetime. Heterogeneous battery-based
    power approaches In a heterogeneous WSN, nodes in the network have different network
    attributes (Hou et al. 2005). This type of network is usually associated with
    a hierarchical sensor network in which relatively low resource sensor nodes are
    deployed at the lower level. Additionally, higher resource sensor nodes are made
    into co-ordinator and sink nodes. In fact, in heterogeneous networks, only the
    co-ordinators and cluster heads might require higher resources. This arrangement
    is to enable the cluster head to receive data from sensor nodes and process it
    for the BS, to support data aggregation and protocol co-ordination. Providing
    more power source for cluster heads extends their lifetime under high loads. In
    addition, this arrangement could increase the cost and complexity. Zhang et al.
    (2012) proposed a WSN-based system to monitor the soil moisture and analyzed the
    temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. According
    to Fig. 2, the system architecture included heterogeneous sensor nodes and sink
    nodes and a remote management platform. The sensor nodes in the field collected
    and sent soil moisture data periodically to the sink nodes. Sink nodes that acted
    as gateways to the general packet radio service (GPRS) sent the data to the remote
    management platform via the TCP-IP standard protocol. The platform that was based
    on the BS mode could collect, store and analyze data and output the report forms.
    The sensor node positions were measured with a global positioning system (GPS).
    Additionally, the distance between the nodes was established according to the
    real field situation, the signal transmission distance and the spatial variability
    in the soil moisture. The core module of the sensor node was a wireless microprocessor
    from Crossbow Company, California, USA. The frequency domain measurement method
    to determine the dielectric constant of soil was used to calculate soil moisture.
    Both the sensor nodes and the soil moisture sensors were waterproofed to withstand
    harsh conditions. The power source to sustain the network operation was from a
    battery. Additionally, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode and
    were activated only when data were to be collected. Multi-hop and self-organizing
    nodes were also used to guarantee network connectivity. The authors designed and
    developed a multi-channel interface, peripheral bus and solar power system. Fig.
    2 Architecture of the soil moisture real-time monitoring system (Zhang et al.
    2012) Full size image The data collected was processed and analyzed by classical
    statistical methods. With a combination of soil moisture monitoring sensors, WSN
    and spatial analysis software, their method gathers and transmits soil moisture
    data to remote management systems automatically. The method used in the research
    to develop the soil distribution system was simple, and the system offers valuable
    information as the basis to make irrigation decisions. Soil moisture sensor nodes
    sent data to the sink node every 30 min. This would reduce the energy consumption
    of the sensor nodes. Soil moisture sensors were activated to collect data only
    when the data was needed which would also reduce the energy consumption. The multi-hop
    method of transferring data enables the nodes to transmit data to neighbor nodes
    for onward forwarding to the sink, instead of the case in single-hop data transmission
    in which the power source of remotely located nodes would be exhausted quickly.
    Yu et al. (2013) proposed a hybrid architecture involving WSN and wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSN). An implementation framework was then developed for real-time
    soil property monitoring. The impact of soil parameters, node depth, signal frequency
    and attenuation on transmission were studied. Reflection, scattering and diffraction
    may occur in the soil and at the soil–air interface during data transmission.
    The experiment revealed that the frequency of the electromagnetic signals and
    the water content of soil affect the path loss. As depicted in the Peplinski principle
    (Peplinski et al., 1995), γ = α + jβ, with $$ \alpha \, = \omega \sqrt {\frac{{\mu
    \varepsilon^{''} }}{2}\left[ {\sqrt {1 + \left( {\frac{{\varepsilon^{''''} }}{{\varepsilon^{''}
    }}} \right)^{2} } - 1} \right]} $$ (1) $$ \beta \, = \omega \sqrt {\frac{{\mu
    \varepsilon^{''} }}{2}\left[ {\sqrt {1 + \left( {\frac{{\varepsilon^{''''} }}{{\varepsilon^{''}
    }}} \right)^{2} } + 1} \right]} $$ (2) where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency,
    μ is the magnetic permeability, and ε′ and ε″ are the real and imaginary parts
    of the dielectric constant, respectively. The system architecture used CC2430,
    a wireless transceiver chip based on ZigBee by Texas Instruments, USA, which was
    developed to gather soil terrestrial information. The WUSN used NRF905 wireless
    chip manufactured by Nordic Semi-Conductor Company, Oslo, Norway, to collect and
    transmit information underground (UG). The hybrid system topology is a combination
    of terrestrial and WUSN structures and is illustrated in Fig. 3. The WSN was installed
    above 0.4 m depth while the WUSN was below 0.4 m. The sink node of the WUSN is
    placed on the ground. All WUSN nodes transmit data to the terrestrial sink node
    with their location based on the applications. The sink node is also said to be
    static or mobile provided it is within the communication range. WUSN is set up
    by placing underground sensors in the field, while deploying data sinks above
    the ground located around the field. Mobile data sinks are carried by people or
    machines in the field. The results of the experiment reveal that at low frequency
    signals and low volumetric water content, signal attenuation and bit error rate
    are minimal. The path loss is also influenced by depth of the WUSN. Fig. 3 Topology
    structure of WUSN Full size image In the authors’ test model, sensors are buried
    at depths of 0.8, 1, 1.6 and 2 m, which implies a large power source requirement.
    The UG nodes would have to expend a lot of energy in a single-hop to transmit
    data to the sink node located aboveground. Thus the nodes power sources could
    deplete quickly thereby shortening the network lifetime. Kim et al. (2011) designed
    and developed a sensor network architecture using autonomous robots with beacons
    to monitor and detect fires and air pollution in fields. The authors built a conceptual
    linear topology and implemented it in a tree-based network topology. Sensor modules
    were developed using a RF transceiver with model number CC2420, a single-chip
    2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 designed for low power and low voltage wireless applications
    by Texas Instruments, USA. Also, a micro controller with model number ATMega128L
    by Atmel corporation, California, USA was used. The application was to monitor
    the temperature, gas, smoke, humidity and illumination. The data collected was
    forwarded to a co-ordinator node every few seconds. Then, the co-ordinator sends
    the data to a specific processor called a knowledge information processor for
    agriculture-sensor data and fire-sensor data (KIP-AF) which shows the measured
    values in real time. For any data that arrives at the KIP-AF, the server transmits
    an alert message to the end user while using the ZigBee enabled SIM (ZSIM). Three
    types of nodes used in the scheme were the wireless co-ordinator (WC), the wireless
    router (WR), and the wireless end device (WED). The WC was the sink node and gateway,
    and it transmitted periodic beacon frames as well as collected data from the WRs
    and WEDs. The study used heterogeneous sensor nodes made up of one co-ordinator
    node, eight routers or parent nodes and 50 sensor nodes (WED) and a tree-based
    network topology with a maximum of three hops. A conceptual network topology that
    models the implementation architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 4. All of
    the sensor nodes transmitted packets in every transmission interval to process
    emergency data. At every interval, all of the sensor nodes transmit their sensing
    data to the WC, which then forwards it to the KIP-AF. This processor maintained
    the agricultural database for intelligent decisions and further analysis. When
    KIP-AF detects emergency conditions such as fire and dangerous air pollution,
    it immediately informs the remote user via a ZSIM terminal. To gather wide-area
    data from the farm, the study introduced mobile robots to cover areas that were
    inaccessible to the fixed nodes. Therefore, the sensor nodes in the field were
    heterogeneous, comprising mobile and static nodes. However, mobility leads to
    link failures due to network handover or loss of line of sight (LOS). The solution
    to this problem was for the mobile robots to scan for an alternative path to move
    to the WC. This action was performed by using the best link quality indicator
    (LQI) among the scanned WR candidates. Figure 5 shows the handover scenario of
    the mobile nodes. The second approach was to increase the RF power of the robot
    by adopting power amplifier and low noise amplifier (LNA) functions in such a
    way as to double the transmission range. Batteries were used as the power source.
    Fig. 4 System implementation architecture Full size image Fig. 5 Mobile handover
    scenario for router recovery (Kim et al. 2011) Full size image The packet loss
    rate from the WED to the WC was measured to be less than 4 %, and the numerical
    expression to calculate it is given as: $$ \frac{{{\text{N}}_{\text{Fail}} }}{{{\text{N}}_{{{\text{Fail}}}}+
    {\text{N}}_{{\text{Re} {\text{c}}}} }} \times 100 $$ (3) where \( {\text{N}}_{\text{Fail}}
    \) and \( {\text{N}}_{\text{Rec}} \) are the number of failed packets to transmit
    to the co-ordinator and the number of successfully received packets in the co-ordinator,
    respectively. Additionally, at any time that the mobile node executes a handover
    procedure, the average handover latency \( {\text{T}}_{\text{HO}} \) is calculated
    by using the expression: $$ {\text{T}}_{\text{HO }} = {\text{T}}_{{{\text{beacon}}\_{\text{loss}}}}
    + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{req}}}} + {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}} + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{data}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    + {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}} + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{res }}}} \, + \,{\text{T}}_{\text{ack}}
    $$ (4) where \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{beacon}}\_{\text{loss}}}} \) is the interval
    of the beacon loss due to the handover, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    \) is the transmission time of the association request frame, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{res
    }}}} \)is the transmission time of the association response frame, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{data}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    \) is the transmission time of the data request frame and \( {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}}
    \)is the transmission time of the acknowledgement frame. The most important concern
    is for reliable data transmission of real-time conditions without energy losses
    at the sensor nodes which could affect the network lifetime. Duty cycle is fixed
    at 100 %; this suggests that all sensor nodes transmit data to the WC at every
    transmission window in order to process data for onward forwarding to the sink.
    This may increase network traffic thereby causing packet collisions; retransmissions
    could lead to faster power source depletion. Solar power Batteries can limit the
    functionality of WSNs due to their low capacities but a solar energy harvesting
    module could fully meet the needs of practical applications in PA. Sensor network
    survival no longer depends on battery life. However, a solar harvesting system
    is more expensive to run than battery-based approaches and energy from the sun
    is not always available. Moreover, it has the disadvantage of being obtrusive.
    The solar panel must be mounted above the canopy and generally is an impediment
    to field operations. Homogeneous solar-based power approaches Hedley et al. (2012)
    developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring method to provide information
    for irrigation scheduling. Data were presented in digital format for incorporating
    into the VRI controlling software. The research was conducted in a 75 ha wheat
    field. The irrigation was by a center pivot (CP) irrigator with VRI modification.
    Each sprinkler was controlled individually by digital maps uploaded to a central
    controller. Sensors were combined with a real-time kinematic differential global
    positioning system (RTK-DGPS) to measure soil and land parameters. Data loggers
    were mounted on a vehicle to acquire high resolution vertical mode datasets in
    two separate surveys. The field was segmented into three classes, and homogeneous
    sensor nodes were deployed in each class. The nodes were organized in a mesh-structured
    topology and had a range of up to 1 km in LOS. For energy efficiency, the nodes
    switched into a sleep mode when they were in an idle state. Each node was attached
    with: (1) two Delta-T SM300 moisture sensors installed at 0.2 and 0.5 m depth
    to monitor the volumetric soil moisture content (v/v), (2) a Spectrum Technologies
    Watermark soil matric potential sensor that was installed at 0.2 m depth to monitor
    the soil moisture tension, and (3) a tensiometer equipped with an absolute pressure
    transducer, to assess the depth of the water table, was installed at 1 m depth.
    A rain gauge was also attached to one node, to monitor the irrigation and rainfall
    events. Data were relayed to a BS every 15 min; it was processed in real-time
    and converted to the necessary format and immediately made available through a
    3G cellular modem via the internet to a webpage. End users could access the web
    site. This WSN method provided a direct measure of the soil moisture status and
    the need for irrigation. It has the advantages of using site-specific real-time
    soil moisture data and site-specific climatic conditions to schedule the irrigation.
    Therefore, (1) there is no need to know the plant type, (2) there is no need to
    know the plant growth stage, (3) uncertainties (errors) when estimating the evaporation–transpiration
    (ET) are avoided, (4) there is no need to know any of the variables needed to
    estimate the ET, such as the air temperature, relative humidity (RH), radiation,
    soil temperature and wind conditions. In order to conserve power, the sensor nodes
    relayed data to the BS every 15 min. Mafuta et al. (2013) designed a WSN for PA
    in Malawi and called it the WiPAM. This system was intended to automate the irrigation
    process and implement an irrigation management system (IMS). The authors investigated
    variability in soil moisture. Information on the variability was then used by
    the irrigation controller to initiate irrigation events. For precise irrigation,
    an irrigation event was triggered occasionally. The sensor nodes were homogeneous,
    and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee co-ordinator (ZC).
    In the star topology, three sensors nodes were configured as ZED (in field-nodes)
    and one as a gateway node. One other node was also configured as ZC with the function
    to aggregate data and actuate the irrigation valves. The network topology is shown
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 The architecture of the irrigation system Full size image To
    operate the network, ZED collected soil moisture and temperature data at predefined
    time intervals. Sampled data were sent and stored in a co-ordinator node. The
    co-ordinator node then sent the data to a gateway node, which also transmitted
    the data to a remote monitoring station (RMS) through a cellular network. The
    power source to sustain the operation of the network was solar power. This approach
    was complemented by an energy-efficient management approach. In other words, sensor
    nodes went to sleep when idle and woke up to repeat the previous steps when required.
    The irrigation valves opened or closed depending on the values that were stored
    in the co-ordinator node. The WiPAM was composed of two sections: the irrigation
    station (IS) and the RMS. The sections were linked through a cellular network,
    as shown in Fig. 7. The RMS captured the performance parameters of the IS at the
    remote site. The parameters were the soil moisture level, the soil temperature,
    the battery voltage levels of the sensor nodes, the quality of the wireless links,
    and the valve status. The main contribution of this paper is the design, implementation
    and performance enhancement of a low-cost and efficient IMS that combines sensors
    and actuators in a wireless sensor/actuator network. Fig. 7 Irrigation management
    system architecture Full size image To attain low power consumption, the protocol,
    operating at low data rate (250 kbps at 2.4 GHz), was used to gather data. Other
    technologies such as Bluetooth (802.15.1) and Wi-Fi (802.11) consume more battery
    power although they offer higher data rates. Moreover, in PA, some sensor data
    do not require wide bandwidth since it is not necessary to continuously monitor
    soil moisture and temperature. Using ZC to aggregate data before actuating an
    irrigation valve could reduce energy consumption. The approach further conserved
    power by putting the ZEDs to sleep and only waking them up to make measurements.
    The sensor data were collected at intervals of 30 min when the system was idle
    and 2 min when irrigation was taking place. This arrangement could further reduce
    energy consumption. In general, this approach could be said to be energy sufficient
    as it incorporated a number of energy reduction methods. Majone et al. (2013)
    described the deployment of a WSN in an apple orchard. The goal was to monitor
    soil moisture dynamics in the top soil to analyze interaction with plant physiology.
    In the experiment, several homogeneous sensor nodes were deployed in a multi-hop
    wireless mesh topology. The sensor nodes were connected across several soil and
    temperature nodes and were deployed across 27 locations. The sensor nodes were
    connected through an input/output interface to a TinyNode 584 WSN platform. A
    solar power source supplied energy to the network. Some energy-efficient management
    approaches were adopted to minimize energy consumption. Real-time monitoring of
    the system began with measurement at each node of the battery and solar panel
    voltages and the internal voltage as well as the temperature of the micro-controller.
    On-board software routines were based on the TinyOS-2.x operating system. The
    process to acquire data started every 10 min, and between every two consecutive
    measurements, the sensor nodes went into sleep mode. Unnecessary modules [such
    as radio frequency (RF), module and sensor] were switched off. This action decreased
    the power consumption to a minimum of approximately 80 µA at 6 V. The energy consumption
    fluctuated from the start to end of data collection. Sensor nodes sent data to
    the sink node. The sink nodes then measured the received signal strength indicator
    (RSSI) value of every packet and forwarded the data packets to a PC gateway (GW)
    over the serial port. The packets were assigned a date and time, and the raw data
    were forwarded to a MySQL database for real time and historic management. These
    data were eventually converted and calibrated by specific equations and were displayed
    by dynamic PHP web pages. The experiment showed that sensors at shallow depths
    responded more quickly than those at larger depths. The nodes which were placed
    at lower depth measured high values of volumetric water content compared to the
    nodes at higher depths. Moreover, the nodes at higher depth had lower response
    time due to higher attenuation. It appears that this approach employed two contrasting
    methods in terms of energy efficiency. On the one hand, the approach may have
    conserved energy by putting the sensor nodes into low power mode (also called
    sleep mode) and switching off every unnecessary module (such as RF, module and
    sensor). However, a mesh network topology to enable multi-hop data transmissions
    was used and all the data were sent over a radio channel to a sink node. This
    means that all the nodes were awake and actively sending or providing pathways
    for one another to the sink node, thereby wasting power source in the process.
    The inference made is that the data were sent in raw form without any form of
    data compression or aggregation and this could have generated packet losses and
    retransmissions. Again since all nodes sent data to only one sink, the sink could
    over work thus depleting power source faster. This approach may not be energy
    efficient and, therefore, could have short network lifetime. Heterogeneous solar-based
    power approaches Peres et al. (2011) designed an intelligent autonomous gateway,
    which was called intelligent precision agriculture gateway (iPAGAT). The goal
    of iPAGAT was to function as an interface device that processes in-field data
    by performing data aggregation and integration. The processed information would
    then be transmitted to high-level decision support systems for farm managers to
    make decisions. iPAGAT used Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and GPRS to communicate with
    local and remote users. The power source for the system was solar power with a
    rechargeable battery, to increase the network lifetime. In the experiment, the
    communication was based on five layers. The layers were labeled as L1–5. L1 involves
    the function of using WSN to gather environmental data from the vineyard management
    zones. L2 devices function to co-ordinate the WSN and process the L1 data by means
    of data aggregation techniques. The L2 layer also acts as an access point to a
    site-specific management application and serves as a gateway to L3, which is the
    layer that has the function to manage the entire farm. Layers L4 and L5 are farmer
    associations and country policies, which are outside the scope of this paper.
    There are three methods of communication in the system set up: (1) the link between
    the WSN and gateway (i.e., the L1–L2 connections), (2) the link between the gateway
    and local user (with a smartphone), through Bluetooth and/or IEEE 802.11, and
    (3) the link between the gateway and farm management office through GSM/GPRS and/or
    IEEE 802.11. In the experiment, small stationary and heterogeneous data acquisition
    nodes were deployed across the field in a mesh network topology according to the
    ZigBee standard. The co-ordinator of this network is situated at the gateway of
    the infrastructure; it manages the WSN and also acts as a sink node for the collected
    data. It fed data into the gateway database which aggregated the collected data
    and made the compressed data available to local and remote users through web services.
    The solar panel uses Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies to communicate with
    the system devices. The iPAGAT served multiple functions: an environmental repository
    for the collected data, a sink node for the WSN, an aggregation engine and a Real-time
    alert system (RTAS). The management levels of the system are shown in Fig. 8.
    Fig. 8 Management level scenario (Peres et al. 2011) Full size image The RTAS
    embedded in the IPAGAT for disease prediction was a large advantage of the system.
    However, iPAGAT was rather complex and not easy to understand. Data were collected
    through multi-hop mesh network with clusters. In this way, the load was distributed
    among the cluster heads without overloading some specific nodes. Moreover, the
    collected data was summarized by a data aggregation method before transmission
    to the next layer. In this way, only compressed data was transmitted and the system
    avoided frame collisions and packet losses. In the light of the above, this approach
    could be described as being energy efficient since it combined both energy balancing
    and energy reduction methods in the data collection process. Garcia-Sanchez et
    al. (2011) proposed a system to monitor crop fields. The system could detect and
    identify procedures of a WSN video surveillance system. It also monitored, detected,
    identified and transmitted data over long distances in distributed crops. The
    authors designed an integrated wireless sensor networks solution for PA (ISSPA)
    and added it to the basic PA mechanisms. The system integrated video transmission
    to networks which hitherto only monitored crops. The system was, therefore, able
    to reduce the cost, increase the cycle lifetime of the devices and networks, and
    avoid duplicate infrastructure. The ISSPA synchronized the duty and sleep phases
    for the heterogeneous sensor nodes in the system. This goal was accomplished by
    the use of message forwarding techniques and multi-interface routing devices.
    All of the communications issues conformed to IEEE802.15.4 technology and allowed
    co-operation between several communication nodes. Another contribution of the
    system was the design and implementation of IEEE 802.15.4 real-devices that avoided
    frame collisions in the message transmissions and performance of their specific
    functions (i.e., crop monitoring, video surveillance) within the agronomic cycle
    for the crop of interest. This system provided the necessary hardware and software
    for monitoring farm field parameters such as temperature, humidity and soil nutrient
    level. It also detected and identified the procedures of a WSN video-surveillance
    system. Devices used in the study were categorized into five groups based on their
    functionality. The categories were the monitoring group, detection group, identification
    group, crop-gateway and farmer Co-op-gateway. All of the components of these nodes
    and gateways were encased for protection against dust and rain. For each type
    of device, appropriate commercialized hardware was selected, and appropriate software
    was developed to achieve functionality. These assorted nodes incorporated appropriate
    sensors together with wireless communication modules. The resulting devices were
    able to acquire data from different sensors, such as salinity, PH, temperature
    and soil moisture. Furthermore, motion detectors and identification sensors existed
    for video surveillance and crop security and control. Sensors collected appropriate
    data and transmitted it to the Gateway through a communication module, which then
    delivered the information to the Farmers’ Co-operative. The Co-operative then
    provided each farmer with information on his crops in real time. The farmer received
    the information at home via the internet on a PDA or Mobile handset. The system
    architecture is shown in Fig. 9. Solar power supplied the required power for the
    devices. Fig. 9 System architecture (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011) Full size image
    The approach used cluster-tree network topology to collect the required data from
    the sensor nodes. Then the ISSPA co-ordinated the information transmission from
    the cluster nodes and so reduced power consumption and frame collision probability.
    To further conserve power, IEEE 802.15.4 real devices were implemented. This suggests
    there were no retransmissions, thereby conserving power. Video-surveillance, which
    was used over the crop areas to capture, process and send pictures to the BS,
    may imply high energy consumption. The video messages, along with the monitoring
    data transmission coming from many sensors placed in separated crops could also
    provoke frame collisions and, consequently, losses. The issue could be more critical
    when several cameras are considered. The retransmission of monitoring messages
    may also cause more energy consumption. To mitigate the shortcomings, an ISSPA
    mechanism was again used. The mechanism provides an appropriate synchronization
    of duty and sleep phases for all nodes in the system using message forwarding
    techniques and multi-interface routing devices. Even though the approach used
    power-hungry devices such as video cameras in its implementation, it co-ordinated
    the data transmission from the nodes of the cluster network. Additionally, it
    reduced frame collision probability which prevented packet retransmission; thereby,
    mitigating the power consumption. Dong et al. (2013) provide a proof-of-concept
    towards an autonomous PA system by integrating a CP irrigation system with a WUSN.
    The system provides autonomous irrigation management capabilities by monitoring
    the soil conditions in real time using WUSN. The results are used to evaluate
    empirical channel models for soil–air communications. Their experiment proved
    that the concept of WUSN-CP was feasible. They designed an UG antenna to improve
    the communication range. In the experiment, above-ground nodes (AG nodes) were
    installed on the arm of a CP irrigation system, while UG nodes were buried at
    depth of 0.35 m in the field in a circle. The CP rotated in both clockwise and
    anti-clockwise directions. At suitable range, the AG nodes established communication
    with the UG nodes. Two antenna schemes were used: firstly, a full-wave (FW) dipole
    antenna for the AG node and secondly, a single ended elliptical antenna (SEA)
    for the UG. While the former has a gain of 3 dB, the latter used a directional
    Yagi antenna (Pozar 2000) for the AG node and a circular planar antenna for the
    UG nodes. The Yagi antenna has a higher directivity with a maximum gain of 10
    dB. Both the SEA antenna and the circular planar antenna are customized according
    to the operation range. A TinyOS application was developed to analyze the experiment
    without the need to reprogram the sensors. An AG node located on the CP maintains
    unicast communication with a UG node buried UG within their communication window.
    This suggests that the power source was only spent in transmitting data directly
    from one node to the other. Since data was not broadcast, it implies that other
    sensor nodes would not participate in data transmissions thereby conserving power.
    Moreover, no intermediate nodes were required in the data transfer; the source
    and sink nodes were therefore peer-to-peer. From the system structure, there could
    be delays in the spinning of the CP to reach a particular node. However, this
    delay may be acceptable in the application area of PA, since such delay is insufficient
    to cause significant difference in the measured parameters. This approach could
    therefore, be said to be energy efficient in the light of the foregoing observations.
    Discussion Table 1 compares WSN approaches based on their applications, features
    and contributions as used in PA. The table shows that the proposed WSN applications
    solutions are in irrigation scheduling, although other areas such as pollution
    and fire detection are also exploited. The major contributions of the discussed
    approaches could be categorized into data transmission reliability, energy efficiency
    and efficient scheduling of the nodes specifically for irrigation control. Several
    approaches (Fernandes et al. 2013; Peres et al. 2011) have adopted data aggregation
    techniques to collect the required data which is a technique known for the reduction
    of communication overhead and energy expenditure of nodes in WSN (Anisi et al.
    2013a; Nesa Sudha et al. 2011; Theodoridis et al. 2012). Moreover, WSN approaches
    must consider the type of topology to use and whether the sensor nodes are homogeneous
    or heterogeneous. Finally, a critical consideration identified was the use of
    appropriate power source to extend the network lifetime. Table 1 Features of WSN
    approaches in PA Full size table In general, energy-efficient routing for extending
    the network lifetime is provided by two methods: (1) energy balancing, in which
    overloading and multi-functioning of certain specific nodes is prevented, and
    the residual energy of the sensor nodes is monitored; and (2) energy consumption
    reduction to mitigate the average energy consumption of the network using methods
    such as clustering, reducing the number of messages, reducing overhead and establishing
    co-operative communications. In Table 2, the approaches have been classified according
    to the energy efficient methods used. Table 2 Energy efficient methods Full size
    table Conclusions A WSN is an efficient monitoring technique for use in PA. In
    this paper, the state-of-the-art of WSNs has been discussed and reviewed. To achieve
    this goal, first, the various topologies of WSN approaches, including star single-hop,
    cluster tree-based multi-hop and mesh networks, were described. Due to the vital
    role of energy in a WSN, the sources of power in WSN approaches, including battery
    and solar power, were described. Second, the current WSN approaches that are used
    in PA based on the power source and the type of the node were categorized and
    reviewed. Third, the approaches based on the applications, features and technical
    contributions of the WSN were outlined. Abbreviations AG: Above ground BS: Base

    \ agricultural activities in the world, which has\nbeen increasing over time.\
    \ Choosing an optimal irrigation management plan depends on having\navailable\
    \ data in the monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers data from several\
    \ sources;\nhowever, the data are not guaranteed to be free of discrepant values\
    \ (i.e., outliers), which can\ndamage the precision of irrigation management.\
    \ Furthermore, data from different sources must ﬁt\ninto the same temporal window\
    \ required for irrigation management and the data preprocessing\nmust be dynamic\
    \ and automatic to beneﬁt users of the irrigation management plan.\nIn this\n\
    paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart irrigation,\
    \ such as data\nmonitoring, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage, and\
    \ irrigation management enriched\nby the prediction of soil moisture. Outlier\
    \ removal techniques allow for more precise irrigation\nmanagement. For ﬁelds\
    \ without soil moisture sensors, the prediction model estimates the matric\npotential\
    \ using weather, crop, and irrigation information. We apply the predicted matric\
    \ potential\napproach to the Van Genutchen model to determine the moisture used\
    \ in an irrigation management\nscheme. We can save, on average, between 56.4%\
    \ and 90% of the irrigation water needed by applying\nthe Zscore, MZscore and\
    \ Chauvenet outlier removal techniques to the predicted data.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ smart agriculture; soil moisture prediction\n1. Introduction\nAgricultural activities\
    \ presently use 70% of the withdrawn freshwater in the world [1]. Therefore,\n\
    it is of fundamental importance that we apply irrigation management, especially\
    \ in semiarid regions\nwith a scarcity of rainfall. Irrigation management is a\
    \ part of precision agriculture, in which the correct\namount of water artiﬁcially\
    \ delivered to a ﬁeld to satisfy the crop needs and the real production of the\n\
    users is analyzed [2].\nThe irrigation must supply the crop water needs at different\
    \ developmental stages in a given\nlocal. Irrigation management is used to detect\
    \ when to irrigate, the amount of water needed, and the\nirrigation frequency,\
    \ based on the monitoring of crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions.\n\
    Crop evapotranspiration measures the water consumption by crops, according to\
    \ the developmental\nSensors 2020, 20, 190; doi:10.3390/s20010190\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n2 of 25\nstage of the crop and the weather conditions [3].\
    \ The soil moisture impacts the amount of irrigation\nwater given to the crop,\
    \ as irrigation management takes into account the level of water retention in\
    \ the\nsoil. Therefore, precision agriculture can reduce water consumption in\
    \ irrigation by considering the\ngroundwater available to the crop [2].\nThe choice\
    \ of the best irrigation management plan depends on the data available from the\n\
    monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers and processes data for irrigation\
    \ management\nfrom several sources using computer science and information technology\
    \ [4]. Users can provide\nthe features of different types of crop, soil, and irrigation\
    \ system, as well as the readings of analog\ntensiometers. Tensiometers are soil\
    \ sensors that detect the matric potential, which are used to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ at different depths and monitoring points in a ﬁeld. Automatic weather stations\
    \ [5] can\nprovide public data through the Internet. Moreover, the ﬁeld may have\
    \ sensors and actuators which\ncan interact with each other as objects of the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) in order to provide services\ntransparently to the\
    \ users [6]. Such services are related to irrigation management for monitoring\n\
    (i.e., water, soil, and air) and prediction (weather and soil conditions).\nHowever,\
    \ data are not free of discrepant values (i.e., outliers), which can negatively\
    \ affect the\nprecision of irrigation management. Furthermore, data from different\
    \ sources must ﬁt into the\nsame temporal window required for the irrigation management\
    \ and the data preprocessing must be\ndynamic and automatic for researchers, engineers,\
    \ and owners or farmers to beneﬁt from the irrigation\nmanagement plan. Data fusion\
    \ is required to improve the quality of soil data in the case where several\n\
    sources provide the same type of data (e.g., moisture) from the ﬁeld [7]. Data\
    \ fusion also informs the\ndecision whether to start irrigation or not in irrigation\
    \ management that makes use of other types of\ndata (such as weather or crop data).\n\
    In this paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart\
    \ irrigation,\nsuch as data monitoring and control, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization,\
    \ storage, and irrigation\nmanagement enriched by the prediction of soil moisture.\
    \ The Smart&Green services are modular\ncomponents which facilitate the reuse\
    \ and customization of code, which are challenges/limitations to\napplying IoT\
    \ in the smart agriculture context [8]. Our framework allows users to set the\
    \ data sources:\nThe nearest weather station, the moisture sensors (analog or\
    \ digital), the type of crop, and the features\nof the irrigation system in the\
    \ monitored ﬁeld. Therefore, Smart&Green also contributes to the solution\nof\
    \ another challenge in applying IoT for the purpose of smart agriculture: The\
    \ integration of the actual\ninfrastructure of the users (i.e., devices, machines,\
    \ and software) [9].\nSmart&Green recommends the best irrigation management plan,\
    \ according to the conﬁguration\nof the monitored ﬁeld. The framework also synchronizes\
    \ weather and soil data, as well as the crop\nstage for the chosen irrigation\
    \ management plan. The Fusion service allows for the deﬁnition of outlier\nremoval\
    \ criteria for the weather and soil data. The fusion service also applies the\
    \ outlier removal\ntechniques Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD before data aggregation,\nin order to obtain general information about the\
    \ soil conditions of a ﬁeld. Our results show that it\nmakes irrigation management\
    \ more precise, therefore saving water.\nFor ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ the prediction module estimates the soil moisture to\nmake the amount of water\
    \ irrigated more precise. In this work, we propose a computational model to\n\
    predict the matric potential based on weather data available at public stations\
    \ [5], crop information,\nand the amount of irrigation water used. As another\
    \ contribution, we provide to the scientiﬁc\ncommunity a public data set containing\
    \ the matric potential and irrigation data for cashew cultivation\nin an experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. The matric potential is the critical variable in measuring the soil moisture.\n\
    The computational model reduces the cost of equipment and energy, as the model\
    \ allows farms\nto estimate the moisture without soil sensors for the same soil\
    \ type. We evaluate the performance\nof a set of popular machine learning techniques\
    \ which have been widely applied to solve regression\nproblems. We measure the\
    \ quality of the models without feature selection using the RMSE (Root Mean\n\
    Squared Error) and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as metrics. Our results show\
    \ that the combination\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n3 of 25\nof predicted data and\
    \ the outlier removal techniques can save an average between 56.4% and 90% of\n\
    irrigation water, estimated by water balance management.\nThe rest of the paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, a literary review of IoT platforms for\n\
    Smart Agriculture is presented. Section 3 describes the structure and services\
    \ of the Smart&Green\nframework. Section 4 relates the materials and method of\
    \ the implementation of Smart&Green,\nespecially for the soil moisture prediction\
    \ evaluation. The results are given in Section 5, and we\ndiscuss our contributions\
    \ in Section 6. Appendix A gives details about irrigation management using\nSmart&Green,\
    \ and we formalize the problem of soil moisture prediction in Appendix B.\n2.\
    \ Related Work\nWe carried out a systematic literature review to ﬁnd the works\
    \ which have answered the following\nresearch questions:\n1.\nWhat software exists\
    \ for agricultural management that automates the process of gathering,\npreprocessing,\
    \ fusing, and synchronizing the data used in irrigation management?\n2.\nDoes\
    \ the software implement the well-known irrigation management approaches of matric\n\
    potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3))?\n3.\nDoes the software\
    \ forecast the soil moisture?\n4.\nCan users conﬁgure the software using information\
    \ about their crops, irrigation system, soil\nsensors, and weather stations close\
    \ to the monitored ﬁeld?\nMost of the discovered papers have partially answered\
    \ the research questions above. To our best\nknowledge, there have been almost\
    \ no Internet of Things (IoT) platforms introduced that provide the\nservices\
    \ required for smart irrigation, such as the gathering, preprocessing, synchronization,\
    \ and fusion\nof data; the planning and execution of irrigation management; or\
    \ soil moisture prediction.\nSeveral studies have only addressed the gathering\
    \ and visualization of weather and soil data\n(Section 2.1). Some works focused\
    \ on data preprocessing by applying outlier detection algorithms\n(Section 2.2).\
    \ Some approaches used speciﬁc methods to decide when to irrigate, whereas others\
    \ have\nimplemented water balance and matric potential (Section 2.3). Soil moisture\
    \ prediction using machine\nlearning techniques applied to crop data, satellite\
    \ images, and irrigation management information\nhas been investigated (Section\
    \ 2.4). In addition, IoT platforms have been studied, which should be\nﬂexible\
    \ enough to allow users to conﬁgure them for different monitoring cases in smart\
    \ agriculture\n(Section 2.5).\n2.1. Data Gathering\nIn general, most of the sensor\
    \ nodes used to monitor soil data (such as temperature, humidity,\nand matric\
    \ potential) and weather data (such as temperature and relative humidity) are\
    \ operated\nusing open, low-cost hardware platforms such as the Arduino [10–14]\
    \ or Raspberry Pi [15–17].\nZigbee [11,17–19], LoRa [16], Wiﬁ [20], Bluetooth\
    \ [14], GSM [12], and GPRS [21] are the predominant\nwireless technologies used.\n\
    Our proposal allows users choose between the CoAP [22] and MQTT [23] protocols\
    \ for sending\ndata to Smart&Green framework storage and later irrigation management.\
    \ For devices that we can not\nturn into a sensor node, such as analog tensiometers,\
    \ our framework has a mobile application with\nwhich users can gather data manually.\
    \ The framework also allows users to choose, as a weather data\nsource, the Brazilian\
    \ automatic weather station nearest to the monitored ﬁeld, from which data can\
    \ be\ngathered via HTTP.\n2.2. Data Preprocessing\nOther approaches have processed\
    \ soil data to detect outliers [24,25] and treat data using noise\nﬁltering techniques\
    \ [26]. One system applied an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to the soil moisture\n\

    \ in order to avoid the actuators inappropriately\nstarting the irrigation [27].\n\
    The pattern recognition of water consumption by a crop radicular system, presented\
    \ in [28],\nis an outlier detection technique based on a time-series analysis\
    \ of soil moisture gathered at several\ndepths before, during, and after irrigation.\
    \ This technique allows for the identiﬁcation of sensors with\npoor operation,\
    \ which indicates the need for calibration or change.\nOur proposed framework\
    \ allows users to deﬁne criteria for outlier removal for each type of\nweather\
    \ and soil data used in irrigation management. Our framework also gives the option\
    \ to execute\nsuch algorithms as Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD (Extreme Studentized\nDeviation) to remove outliers and fuse soil moisture\
    \ data, in the case when a ﬁeld has several soil\nsensors monitoring at different\
    \ depths.\n2.3. Irrigation Management\nOther works have automatically started\
    \ irrigation by implementing algorithms for analyzing the\ndata gathered by a\
    \ wireless sensor node. In one study, an algorithm based on decision trees used\
    \ the\nsoil temperature and moisture to determine the irrigation time and the\
    \ needed amount of water [29].\nCrisp rules (IF-THEN) were used to compare threshold\
    \ values with the soil moisture gathered by\nsensors, in order to decide whether\
    \ to turn on the sprinklers of an irrigation system, in [30,31].\nDecision support\
    \ platforms for the execution of traditional irrigation management, such as\n\
    the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3)), have been\
    \ introduced.\nThese systems allow agronomists and farm owners to manage Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) components\nfor ﬁeld monitoring. The matric potential management\
    \ uses soil data gathered by sensor nodes and\nimages captured by unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles to correctly estimate the irrigation water need [32].\nWeb systems\
    \ have been used for the planning and execution of irrigation management. Beyond\
    \ the\nvisualization of soil moisture and weather data gathered by wireless sensor\
    \ nodes, these systems\nuse crisp rules for data analysis and, when it is necessary,\
    \ the systems send messages to their users\nin order to notify about irrigation\
    \ times [33] or activate the irrigation system automatically [34,35].\nIn other\
    \ approaches, the system takes the rainfall forecast (available on the Internet)\
    \ into account when\ndeciding whether to activate the irrigation system [36].\
    \ A wireless sensor network can also plan and\nexecute irrigation management [37].\
    \ In this case, the sensor nodes gather and analyze soil moisture\ndata and turn\
    \ the irrigation system on until the moisture achieves the ﬁeld capacity.\nA SCADA\
    \ (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system can automatically carry out\
    \ the data\ngathering, planning, and execution of the water balance management\
    \ (see Equations (A3) and (A4)).\nThe soil sensor nodes are also actuators, which\
    \ control the irrigation and send data continually to\na management system. The\
    \ system receives data from a weather station on the farm to estimate the\nreference\
    \ evapotranspiration ETo. The system also utilizes the curve of the crop coefﬁcient\
    \ kc, choosing\nits value according to the current developmental stage of the\
    \ crop [38].\nThe water balance and matric potential approaches often must take\
    \ data synchronization into\naccount. Therefore, some applications have synchronized\
    \ the data of previously registered crops,\nas well as soil and weather data,\
    \ to precisely determine the irrigation water need for the current\ndevelopmental\
    \ stage of the crop [39–42].\nThe existing systems described in this section are\
    \ not ﬂexible enough to allow users to set the\nfeatures of a monitored ﬁeld,\
    \ such as the type of crop, the type and number of soil sensors, and irrigation\n\
    system parameters used. The systems usually work with a predeﬁned conﬁguration\
    \ and infrastructure.\nTherefore, code reuse is impracticable for the irrigation\
    \ management of agricultural ﬁelds which do not\nﬁt to the existing system conﬁguration.\
    \ Our proposal allows users to register relevant information for\nirrigation management:\
    \ Different types of crops, soil features, irrigation systems, data sources (weather\n\
    or soil), and outlier removal criteria. In this work, the framework plans the\
    \ irrigation management\nusing the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)) approaches.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n5 of 25\nFurthermore,\
    \ none of the systems could forecast the moisture levels in ﬁelds without soil\
    \ sensors.\nOur proposal implements computational models to predict soil moisture\
    \ based on weather data, crop\ninformation, and irrigation water need (IWN) (see\
    \ Appendix B). In this work, we include the predicted\ndata in the water balance\
    \ management, obtaining between 56.4% and 90% of IWN savings over six\nmonths\
    \ (Section 5.3).\n2.4. Soil Moisture Prediction\nIn [43], the Linear Regression,\
    \ Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with\nRegression Tree (GBRT)\
    \ machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to weather and soil sensor\ndata\
    \ (moisture and drought stress) to predict the best irrigation plan for a jojoba\
    \ crop. The GBRT\nmodel outperformed the others and, so, the decision support\
    \ service incorporated it as a module of\nthe system. A model based on support\
    \ vector regression (SVR) and k-means ML techniques which\nused weather data and\
    \ forecasts, as well the soil data (temperature and moisture), to forecast the\
    \ soil\nmoisture has also been investigated [44].\nIn [45], an integrated system\
    \ to monitor drought in northern China using satellite images (NOAA,\nMODIS, and\
    \ FY3A), weather stations, and soil data has been discussed. The drought forecasting\n\
    used the matric potential at the depth of the crop root, the water balance model,\
    \ depletion indices,\nand measurements of crop stress to estimate the soil moisture\
    \ and the water quantity needed for\nan extended period.\nIn this work, we apply\
    \ weather data, crop information, and the amount of irrigation water used\nin\
    \ a computational model, in order to estimate the daily matric potential of the\
    \ most superﬁcial soil\nlayer (Appendix B), which signals when the crop needs\
    \ irrigation [2]. We apply the predicted value in\nthe Van Genutchen model (Equation\
    \ (A1)) to obtain the soil moisture used in irrigation management\n(Equations\
    \ (A2) and (A3)) for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (i.e., Field 1 of Figure\
    \ A1).\nWe present two different approaches: Local and global prediction models.\
    \ In the local method,\nwe create a prediction model for each monitoring point\
    \ in an experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2). In the\nglobal approach, we create a\
    \ single model which can be generalized to any monitoring point. We have\nevaluated\
    \ the performance of a set of popular ML techniques which have been widely applied\n\
    to solve regression problems: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5\
    \ Model Trees and\nRules [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], RepTree, and\
    \ GBRT [51,52]. Our results show that\nGBRT outperforms the other evaluated techniques\
    \ in both approaches.\n2.5. IoT Platforms for Smart Agriculture\nSWAMP (Smart\
    \ Water Management Platform), introduced in [53], is one of the related methods\n\
    which is most similar to our proposal. SWAMP has components to allow for the implementation\
    \ of\ndifferent IoT applications for irrigation management, based on the crop\
    \ and soil moisture approaches.\nUsers can customize the services for the gathering\
    \ (MQTT or LoRa), processing, and synchronization\nof data with different types\
    \ of crops, weather, and country. Therefore, different ﬁeld conﬁgurations\ncan\
    \ reuse these services for data analysis and storage, highlighting the excellent\
    \ ﬂexibility of SWAMP.\nHowever, their techniques for the processing and the fusion\
    \ of data have not been detailed, and no\napplication or service for the prediction\
    \ of soil moisture has been provided.\nThe Agro-IoT framework, introduced in [54],\
    \ is also related to our proposal, which provides\nusers real-time data gathering,\
    \ aggregation (fusion), and analysis in the context of smart farming.\nAgro-IoT\
    \ reuses several components to implement IoT applications, according to the needs\
    \ of the\nmonitored ﬁeld. Agro-IoT provides similar services to our proposed method;\
    \ that is, it also provides\nthe management of devices (i.e., registration of\
    \ sensors and actuators) and event detection through\ndata analysis. However,\
    \ it does not contain modules for data synchronization and outlier removal or\n\
    soil moisture prediction.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n6 of 25\n3. Proposal\nIn this\
    \ paper, we propose Smart&Green: An Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the\
    \ smart\nagriculture domain. A framework consists of “a speciﬁc implementation\
    \ of a skeleton of infrastructure used\nfor the conception of a work” [55]. Work\
    \ is any activity performed by users or software. In this proposal,\nthe work\
    \ consists of the planning of irrigation management (Appendix A). In ﬁelds where\
    \ there are\nno soil moisture sensors, a computational model can estimate the\
    \ soil moisture for the same soil type\nusing weather, crop, and irrigation data.\
    \ Agronomists, researchers, and farmers conduct irrigation\nmanagement through\
    \ software which uses Smart&Green. Figure 1 presents the conceptual architecture\n\
    of Smart&Green, divided into four layers: Application, Services, Communication,\
    \ and Physical.\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture of the Smart&Green IoT Framework\
    \ for Smart Agriculture.\nIn software engineering, a framework can also be “a\
    \ mini architecture that can be reused and that\nprovides behavior and a generic\
    \ structure for a family of software abstractions in a context that speciﬁes the\n\
    collaboration and use of them into a given domain” [56]. Therefore, given the\
    \ smart agriculture domain and\nthe context of smart irrigation, the Smart&Green\
    \ framework speciﬁes the structure of a set of concrete\nand abstract classes\
    \ to implement modules for the gathering, storage, synchronization, and fusion\
    \ of\ndata, as well as mathematical models (Appendix A) which describe irrigation\
    \ management. Irrigation\nmanagement determines the behaviors of the classes and\
    \ modules. As a mini architecture, the proposed\nframework can be reused with\
    \ different smart agriculture software with the generic functionalities of\nirrigation\
    \ management.\n3.1. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides facilities\
    \ for the automatization of irrigation management\n(Appendix A) and soil moisture\
    \ prediction. Through this layer, users of an agriculture management\nsystem can\
    \ insert information about the farm infrastructure: The types of crops and irrigation\
    \ system\nto each monitored ﬁeld, the monitored soil layers, and the weather stations\
    \ closest to the farm.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n7 of 25\n3.1.1. Irrigation Management\
    \ Automatization\nThe Matric Potential and Water Balance modules implement well-known\
    \ irrigation management\nmethods (Appendix A). These modules use information registered\
    \ by users as well as that from\nweather and soil data sources. Smart&Green selects\
    \ the best irrigation management based on the data\navailable. The principal functions\
    \ of the Register Module are as follows:\n1.\nUser register: Smart&Green framework\
    \ allows two types of users: Specialist and regular. Specialist\nusers can provide\
    \ agronomic information, such as different types of crops, soil, and irrigation\n\
    system features. They can also register outlier removal criteria for weather and\
    \ soil data and\nchoose algorithms for the fusion service. Regular users can register\
    \ farms and ﬁelds.\n2.\nFarm Register: Users provide information about the farm,\
    \ such as address and geographical\nco-ordinates (i.e., latitude and altitude)\
    \ for the Smart&Green framework, and select the weather\nstation closest to the\
    \ farm.\n3.\nCrop register: A specialist user can create types of crops using\
    \ information such as a description,\nthe curve of the crop coefﬁcient, and the\
    \ critical moisture condition.\n4.\nSystem Irrigation Register: A specialist user\
    \ inserts the type of irrigation systems, such as\n“micro-sprinkler”.\n5.\nWeather\
    \ Station Register: Smart&Green automatically selects the weather station closest\
    \ to the farm\nusing the geographical co-ordinates. Users can conﬁrm this or choose\
    \ another one.\n6.\nSoil Sensor Register: The user can insert the types of soil\
    \ sensors used. Smart&Green already has\nanalog and digital tensiometers.\n7.\n\
    Field Register: Users set the ﬁeld conﬁguration features (Figure A1), such as\
    \ the type of crop,\nirrigation system, soil, and if there are soil monitoring\
    \ points. The developmental stage of the crop\nrepresents the number of days since\
    \ the initial cultivation. Effective precipitation (mm/h) and\nefﬁciency of the\
    \ irrigation system are necessary for irrigation management, in order to compute\n\
    the irrigation time. In the case of monitoring points, users can register the\
    \ type of soil moisture\nsensor (analog or digital) and the depth z monitored\
    \ for each monitoring point in the ﬁeld.\n8.\nField Communication register: In\
    \ the case where the monitored ﬁelds have sensor nodes that\nautomatically gather\
    \ soil data, users can deﬁne the type of communication to send the data to the\n\
    framework. Users set the IP address and speciﬁc conﬁguration (CoAP or MQTT).\n\
    9.\nOutlier Removal Criteria Register: Specialist users can create a threshold\
    \ for minimum and\nmaximum values of each type of weather and soil moisture data\
    \ used in irrigation management.\nThe Smart&Green framework suggests an irrigation\
    \ management plan, according to the data of\na registered ﬁeld. For ﬁelds without\
    \ soil moisture sensors (Field 1 of Figure A1), Smart&Green indicates\nthe water\
    \ balance without soil moisture data (i.e., without the term ∆A in Equation (A3))\
    \ or the water\nbalance with the soil moisture data created by the soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 3.1.2).\nFor ﬁelds with soil moisture sensors (see\
    \ Fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1), the framework calculates the\nmatric potential\
    \ (Equation (A2)) or water balance using the soil moisture data.\n3.1.2. Soil\
    \ Moisture Prediction\nIn this work, we address a large ﬁeld (over 7500 m2) to\
    \ produce one type of crop on a large scale,\nin which the soil is monitored by\
    \ a hundred tensiometers (i.e., soil moisture sensors) at three different\ndepths.\
    \ To investigate this scenario, we present the local and global approaches, which\
    \ can be used to\nlearn a prediction function ˆf (Appendix B).\nThe local approach\
    \ creates a different prediction function ˆfi for each tensiometer at the superﬁcial\n\
    soil layer of the ﬁeld. For this, it uses the observations recorded by a tensiometer\
    \ bi and a weather\nstation ms, as well the water amount wi given to the crop\
    \ and the crop coefﬁcient kc related to the\ncurrent life stage of the crop. The\
    \ local approach deﬁnes the prediction ˆf in terms of n different\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 190\n8 of 25\nfunctions ˆfi for local predictions. However, if a ﬁeld has\
    \ a large number of tensiometers, a large\nnumber of distinctive prediction models\
    \ must be trained.\nThe global approach creates only one prediction function ˆfi\
    \ using the information from all\ntensiometers. Therefore, the global prediction\
    \ model might not ﬁt some individual tensiometers.\nThe Smart&Green framework\
    \ implements the prediction model as a modular service (Figure 2)\nto complement\
    \ the irrigation management of ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (e.g., ﬁeld\
    \ 1 in\nFigure A1). The framework automatically retrieves and stores the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms\npublished on the Internet by weather stations. We deﬁned Mms in\
    \ Appendix B.\nFigure 2. Smart&Green Module for soil moisture prediction.\nThe\
    \ framework daily preprocesses the Mms data to remove possible outliers. The module\
    \ of soil\nmoisture prediction estimates the matric potential ψp of a ﬁeld, based\
    \ on (M′\nms, W, kc) (Appendix B).\nThe irrigation management module computes\
    \ the current soil moisture θc by applying ψp on the Van\nGenutchen [57] model,\
    \ following Equation (A1). Then, the obtained θc is applied to Equation (A2)\n\
    or (A3) to calculate the irrigation water need (IWN).\nIn the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) context, the framework sends the IWN value to an actuator to\nstart the\
    \ irrigation system. The irrigation system stops when the ﬁeld receives the amount\
    \ of water\nspeciﬁed by the IWN. Although this present work does not handle an\
    \ automatic irrigation system,\nthis issue is a concern for the full implementation\
    \ of an IoT system for smart farms.\n3.2. Service Layer\nThe Service layer supports\
    \ the Application layer by storing data provided by Smart&Green users\nand synchronizing\
    \ crop, weather station, and soil data when required by any irrigation management\n\
    module. The Service layer also carries out fusion tasks for data of soil moisture\
    \ sensors (e.g., ﬁelds 2\nand 3 of Figure A1) or the soil moisture prediction.\n\
    The Storage service provides centralized data persistence for the monitoring of\
    \ weather, crop,\nand soil data in the ﬁelds. The Synchronization service selects\
    \ the crop coefﬁcient kc which is\nappropriate to the current development stage\
    \ of the crop and retrieves the weather data Mms for\nthe period needed for irrigation\
    \ management. The service also requests the Communication layer for\nnew data\
    \ from the Internet, if needed.\nIn the case of soil data, the Synchronization\
    \ service selects data from all monitoring points\nBTc in the ﬁeld, taking into\
    \ account the period of irrigation management. If there are no data\navailable,\
    \ the service requests new data from the user (ﬁeld 2 of Figure A1) or the Communication\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n9 of 25\nlayer (Field 3 of Figure A1). Finally, the Synchronization\
    \ service makes the data set composed of\n{kc,current, Mms,period, BTc,period}\
    \ available.\nThe Irrigation Management Modules use the Fusion service if there\
    \ is a ﬁeld with monitoring\npoints, each with one or more soil moisture sensors\
    \ (e.g., tensiometers) at different depths z (e.g.,\nﬁelds 2 and 3 of Figure A1).\
    \ The Fusion service can also treat data created in soil moisture prediction\n\
    when irrigation management is required for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors.\
    \ Data fusion consists\nof processing the data to detect and remove outliers (DRO)\
    \ and submitting data to a co-operative\nfunction (CF), according to a multilevel\
    \ data fusion architecture [58].\nDRO tasks apply criteria and algorithms deﬁned\
    \ by specialist users to immediately detect and\nremove outliers. The Register\
    \ module of the Application layer allows for the creation of threshold\nvalues\
    \ for soil data. DRO algorithms are speciﬁc to the soil layer monitored. According\
    \ to [58],\nthe Z-score is more efﬁcient for data series at the most superﬁcial\
    \ soil layer (e.g., z = 15 cm). In contrast,\nthe Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized\
    \ Deviate) algorithm works well with data at depth of\nz = 45 cm. The Smart&Green\
    \ framework has implementations of the Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed\nZ-Score, and\
    \ Generalized ESD algorithms.\nA co-operative function (CF) [59] aggregates one\
    \ type of data gathered at different monitoring\npoints of a ﬁeld. Smart&Green\
    \ uses the mean function as the CF to aggregate soil moisture data at the\nsame\
    \ depth. For example, Field 2 of Figure A1 has six monitoring points at two depths.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe framework calculates the mean of each set of six samples gathered\
    \ at a given depth z. After fusion,\nthe data are ready for irrigation management\
    \ at the Application layer, which decides whether irrigation\nshould be started.\n\
    3.3. Communication Layer\nThe Communication Layer has a set of software to gather\
    \ weather and soil data through network\nprotocols. This includes a weather client,\
    \ four soil clients, three soil servers, and a gateway (see\nFigure 3). The weather\
    \ client consists of an HTTP client which downloads weather station data from\n\
    the Internet and stores them. Smart&Green offers an API to gather data from Brazilian\
    \ automatic\nweather stations [5].\nFigure 3. Interaction between the Communication\
    \ Layer and the Physical and Services Layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n10 of 25\n\
    The soil client gathers the matric potential data ψm if the ﬁeld has tensiometers\
    \ installed. If the\ntensiometers are analog, users have to manually collect the\
    \ ψm data, using a mobile application that\nsends it to the framework via HTTP.\
    \ If the tensiometers are digital, they are integrated into sensor\nnodes that\
    \ send the data to a gateway near the ﬁeld. The gateway hosts CoAP and MQTT clients,\n\
    which forward the ψm data to the servers of the framework.\n4. Materials and Method\n\
    In this section, we list the principal software components used in the implementation\
    \ of our\nproposed framework (Section 4.1). We describe what we use for soil moisture\
    \ prediction, in terms of\n(1) the weather, crop, and soil moisture information;\
    \ (2) the criteria for outlier detection and removal;\nand (3) the tested machine\
    \ learning techniques (see Section 4.2).\n4.1. Smart & Green Framework Implementation\n\
    We implemented the Smart&Green framework using the Python 3 Language. In the Application\n\
    layer (Section 3.1), irrigation management by the water balance module uses PyETo\
    \ [60] to calculate the\nreference evapotranspiration for a crop, with reference\
    \ to the Penman-Monteith Model [61]. The crop\nevapotranspiration measures the\
    \ water consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage\nof the crop\
    \ and weather conditions [3]. The Service Layer uses the MySQL database [62] to\
    \ support the\nStorage service. The PyAstronomy library [63] provides the implementation\
    \ of the Generalized ESD\n(Extreme Studentized Deviate) algorithm for the Fusion\
    \ Service.\nThe aiocoap package [64] supports the implementation of the CoAP client\
    \ and server of the\nCommunication layer (Section 3.3). The MQTT client uses the\
    \ Eclipse Paho MQTT client library [65],\nand we used Mosquito as the MQTT server\
    \ [66]. Our API for the acquisition of weather data operates\nby scraping the\
    \ web page of the automatic Brazilian weather stations [5] using the libraries\
    \ requests [67]\nand beautifulsoup4 [68], as well the frameworks Django [69] and\
    \ Django rest [70]. We implemented\nthe mobile application for soil moisture gathering\
    \ from ﬁelds with analog tensiometers (e.g., ﬁeld 2 of\nFigure A1) in the Javascript\
    \ language through the Firebase platform [71], React Native framework [72],\n\
    Realm [73], and React Native Firebase [74] libraries.\nWe also provide a web interface\
    \ for the\nSmart&Green Framework developed using Django [69]. Smart&Green was\
    \ run on a machine with\n2 GB of RAM, 20 GB of hard disk storage, and the Ubuntu\
    \ 18.04LTS OS.\nFor farm ﬁelds with sensor nodes, such as ﬁeld 3 of Figure A1,\
    \ we used an Arduino Pro Mini and\nthree Irrometer Watermark 200SS [75] digital\
    \ tensiometers to implement a sensor node which gathers\nsoil moisture data at\
    \ 15, 45, and 75 cm. The watermark measures the soil water tension (i.e., matric\n\
    potential), which ranges from 0 to 200 CBar/KPa. The sensor nodes use four AA\
    \ alkaline batteries of\n1.5 v as the power source. We modify the Arduino removing\
    \ the voltage controller and LEDs to the\nnode has a longer operating life. Sensor\
    \ nodes send soil data through an nRF24L01 with an external\nanthem and power\
    \ ampliﬁer. The nRF24L01 is a single-chip radio transceiver for the 2.4–2.5 GHz\
    \ ISM\nband. After data transmission, the sensor node hibernates for an hour to\
    \ save power [58]. We used\na Raspberry Pi 3 with the Raspbian OS as the gateway\
    \ to receive soil moisture data and send them by\nthe CoAP or MQTT client to storage.\n\
    4.2. Soil Moisture Prediction\n4.2.1. Raw Data Set\nWe obtained a data set of\
    \ soil moisture from an experimental cashew ﬁeld with other tropical\nraw materials\
    \ in the city of Paraibapa, Brazil [76]. The ﬁeld had approximately 250 cashew\
    \ trees with\nnine monitoring spots. Each spot had three tensiometers that allowed\
    \ manual reading of the matric\npotential at depths of 15, 45, and 75 cm. Figure\
    \ 4 shows the details of the analog tensiometers (soil\nmoisture sensors), which\
    \ provided the data set from 2016, 2017, and 2018, with 234, 245, and 138 daily\n\
    samples, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, in 2016, the ﬁeld had salvation\
    \ irrigation in which\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n11 of 25\nwe gave 5 liters of water\
    \ for each bud whenever the installed tensiometer at a depth of 15 cm read\na\
    \ matric potential of 60 kPa. Salvation irrigation prevents plants from dying.\n\
    (a) Tensiometers at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths near a\ncashew bud.\n(b) Cashew buds.\n\

    \ obtained from a Brazilian national weather station at Itapipoca\ncity, Ceara\
    \ (altitude 102 m; latitude 03◦29′ S; longitude 39◦35′ W). However, we decide\
    \ to use the\npluviometer sensor data of the ﬁeld, as the rainfall sensor of the\
    \ weather station had missing values\nover an extended period. Table 1 presents\
    \ the acronyms, the description of the variables, and the\nmeasurement data units\
    \ used in our prediction problem. We release the aggregated data set to the\n\
    scientiﬁc community to ensure the reproducibility of our results and promote research\
    \ developments\nin this ﬁeld (see Supplementary Materials).\nTable 1. Raw dataset\

    We also analyzed the soil particle composition of the experimental ﬁeld. The soil\
    \ has a medium\nsandy texture in the layer from 0 to 30 cm (805 g kg−1 of sand,\
    \ 76 g kg−1 of clay and 119 g kg−1 of silt)\nand the medium texture in the other\
    \ layers, presenting the characteristics of a red-yellow Argisol [77].\nThe maximum\
    \ organic matter content was 6.4 g dm−3; the pH varied from 5.6 to 6.3 between\
    \ the\nlayers; the capacity of cations exchange, from 31.3 to 64.8, and the sum\
    \ of maximum bases was 62% in\nthe most superﬁcial layer.\n4.2.2. Outlier Detection\
    \ and Removal\nFirst, the instances that presented Tmax, Tmin < 20, Tmax, Tmin\
    \ > 39, RHmax, RHmin < 20, and Ri >\n250 were removed, as these feature ranges\
    \ are uncommon in the city of Paraibapa. After that, the mean\nµ and the standard\
    \ deviation σ were computed for the variables P, Rn, and U2 for each month.\n\
    Afterward, we ﬁltered out data instances with anomalies; that is, the instances\
    \ with distance to µ\ngreater or equal than 3 × σ were removed, as performed in\
    \ [78].\n4.2.3. Machine Learning Methods\nWe decided to build the prediction model\
    \ using algorithms which have been widely applied to\nsolve regression problems:\
    \ Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules\n(M5P)\
    \ [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], and RepTree. Weka [79] provided all\
    \ of these.\nAnother widely used algorithm is the Gradient Boosting Regression\
    \ Tree (GBRT) [51,52] method and\nits implementation XGBoost [80].\nLinear regression\
    \ is a linear model of the relationship between a scalar response (in this work,\n\
    the matric potential ψm) and one or more explanatory variables (see Table 1).\
    \ The linear model consists\nof linear predictor functions which use the data\
    \ to estimate the unknown parameters [46]. Decision\nstump models a one-level\
    \ decision tree. The tree has one root (an internal node) which connects the\n\
    leaves (terminal nodes). The model uses the value of one single feature to make\
    \ predictions [47].\nM5P produces a tree with a multilinear regression model for\
    \ each node. A greedy algorithm\nremoves the insigniﬁcant features in the model\
    \ ﬁtted to each node. Then, the terminal node computes\nnew predicted values,\
    \ considering the predicted values of other intermediate nodes between the\nterminal\
    \ node and the root node [48,49].\nRandom Tree (RT) uses if-then conditions for\
    \ answering questions in a sequential order to achieve\na speciﬁc result. The\
    \ depth of the tree consists of the number of questions needed to reach a prediction\n\
    value. Random Forest (RF) is a collection of decision trees that can use a random\
    \ subset of the features.\nTherefore, the number of trees impacts the number of\
    \ features used and limits the number of errors\ndue to bias or variance [50].\n\
    RepTree is a fast decision tree algorithm in Weka which uses information gain/variance\
    \ to build\na regression tree. Reduced-error pruning takes into account the method\
    \ backﬁtting [79]. GBRT is a\npredictive model based on a weak learner, a loss\
    \ function, and an additive model. The weak learner is\na decision tree that can\
    \ be modiﬁed to achieve better results. The additive model adds weak learners\n\
    to correct for the residual errors of all previous trees. The loss function consists\
    \ of the mean squared\nerror for regression problems [51,52].\nWe set some hyperparameters\
    \ required by RT, RF, RepTree, and GBRT with the default values\nof Weka [79]\
    \ and XGboost [80]. We set the maximum tree depth (max_depth) to 3 for GBRT and\
    \ to\nwithout restriction for the RT, RF, and RepTree methods. The number of trees\
    \ (n_estimators) was\n100 for all methods. Finally, GBRT required a third hyperparameter,\
    \ the learning rate (learning_rate),\nwhich we set to 0.1.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 190\n13 of 25\nThe training and test sets included, respectively, 80% and 20%\
    \ of the data from each soil moisture\nsensor at a depth of 15 cm. Overall, for\
    \ each possible combination, we generated a model and\npicked the model which\
    \ gave the lowest MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square\nError)—metrics\
    \ which have been widely used to measure the quality of a prediction model (see\n\
    Equations (A6) and (A7) in Appendix B).\n5. Results\nFirst, we employed the outlier\
    \ removal techniques of Fusion Service (Section 3.2) on the real\nsoil moisture\
    \ data in order to analyze the inﬂuence of these techniques on irrigation management\n\
    (Section 3.1.1) in the Smart&Green framework (Section 5.1). Then, we analyzed\
    \ the MAE and RMSE of\nthe machine learning techniques tested with the local and\
    \ global approaches (Section 3.1.2) proposed\nfor the Smart&Green soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 5.2). Finally, we applied the soil moisture\ndata\
    \ created by the best prediction models for irrigation management to analyze the\
    \ water savings\n(Section 5.3).\n5.1. Impact of Outlier Removal Techniques on\
    \ Real Moisture Data by Irrigation Management\nFrom the raw data set (Section\
    \ 4.2), we selected data from from April to October/2017, since\nthere was no\
    \ salvation irrigation in the experimental ﬁeld, which could affect the irrigation\
    \ water need\n(IWN) estimated by water balance and matric potential management.\
    \ Then, we set Fusion Service\n(Section 3.2) to use an outlier removal technique\
    \ to process the matric potential ψc provided by the nine\ntensiometers (soil\
    \ moisture sensors) at 15 cm of depth in the experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2).\
    \ Second,\nthe Fusion Service aggregated ψc data using the co-operative function\
    \ mean. After this, the modules\nof water balance and potential matric (Section\
    \ 3.1) applied the aggregated ψc to Van Genutchen\nModel (Equation (A1)) to estimate\
    \ the current soil moisture θc at the crop root zone (z = 30 cm) and\ncompute\
    \ IWN.\nWater balance management (Equation (A3)) can depend only on the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ ETc\n(Equation (A4)) and rainfall R to estimate the IWN of a crop. Therefore,\
    \ we can only use weather data\nand the crop coefﬁcient (Table 1) to plan water\
    \ balance for n days. However, the IWN estimation is\nmore precise when we can\
    \ incorporate the current soil moisture data θcz since the water storage in\n\
    the crop root zone can contribute to the crop water supply. We set water balance\
    \ to estimates IWN\nevery three days (n = 3) over six months (26 samples of n\
    \ intervals), and the results in Table 3 indicate\nthat the use of θcz saved an\
    \ average of 90.4% of the IWN estimated, as compared to that using only\nweather\
    \ and crop data.\nTable 3.\nPercentage of water saved over six months by irrigation\

    \ to 89.3%. Zscore and MZscore data treatment led to an increment of the moisture\
    \ θc values\n(Figure 5a), and, consequently, a reduction of the term ∆A of water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)). GESD and\nChauvenet did not affect the moisture θc\
    \ data enough (Figure 5b), as well as IWN saving (Table 3).\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ Moisture Data used in Water Balance—the points outside of the dashed lines are\
    \ the\ncurrent moisture data θcz modiﬁed by an outlier removal technique.\nThe\
    \ matric potential approach depends exclusively on the soil moisture data (Equation\
    \ (A2)),\nand we planned this irrigation management to estimate the daily IWN\
    \ over six months (121 samples of\ndays) using the current moisture θc data at\
    \ the shallowest crop root zone (e.g., z = 30 cm). In the matric\npotential approach,\
    \ irrigation occurs only when θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\n\
    θcr, which is the ideal moisture for irrigation and signals when the crop productivity\
    \ is starting to\ndecline. Table 3 presents the IWN saving of matric potential\
    \ management that used an outlier removal\ntechnique when compared to the one\
    \ that did not use them. Figure 6 shows that there were several\ndays where θc\
    \ was equal to θcr (day 1 to 13). However, all outlier remotion techniques treated\
    \ various\noutliers that reduced the current moisture (e.g., 14th and 15th; 18th\
    \ and 19th; 26th days), improving\nthe water savings, on average, by 4.3% to 20.7%\
    \ (Table 3). Zscore and MZscore (Figure 6a) contributed\nmore to the tradeoff\
    \ between IWN saving and healthy crop development because they increased the\n\
    current moisture θc above the critical condition θcr in more days(e.g., the 40th\
    \ to 43th; 64th; 104th days)\nthan GESD and Chauvenet (Figure 6b).\n(a) Zscore\

    \ Models for Soil Moisture Prediction\nThe main goal of this analysis is to evaluate\
    \ and establish the best machine learning (ML)\ntechnique among those tested for\
    \ each approach (local and global prediction models). In this context,\nwe considered\
    \ analog soil sensors (tensiometers) distributed throughout a large ﬁeld (Figure\
    \ 4).\nWe compared the following ML techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Stump,\
    \ M5P, Random Tree,\nRandom Forest, RepTree, and Gradient Boosting. Through the\
    \ metrics MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\nand RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), we evaluated\
    \ the local and global approaches for the estimation\nof the matric potential\
    \ ψm—the primary variable for soil moisture prediction (Appendix B). Finally,\n\
    we used the 99% conﬁdence intervals to determine the best-performing model.\n\
    Table 4 presents the MAE and RMSE retrieved by the local approach for each prediction\
    \ algorithm.\nThe results of the local approach are the mean of the MAE and RMSE\
    \ achieved by the nine models\nbuilt for each monitoring point of the experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. Considering all the analyzed errors, Gradient\nBoosting outperformed all\
    \ the other techniques, followed by Random Forest. Both approaches\npresented\
    \ acceptable errors, according to a specialist agronomic engineer.\nTable 4. Evaluation\

    \ approach for each algorithm. Again,\nthe Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved\
    \ the best results, compared to all other evaluated models.\nIt can be noticed\
    \ that the MAE and RSME of the Gradient Boosting model did not vary as much as\
    \ the\nother evaluated models; this means the global model generalizes well for\
    \ any data from any sensor in\nthe ﬁeld. The Local Gradient Boosting approach\
    \ outperformed the global one. However, even though\nthe global model error had\
    \ an average MAE error increase of 58.9% and average RMSE error increase\nof 45.7%,\
    \ the errors were still acceptable, according to the specialist agronomic engineer.\n\
    We also analyzed the relevance of the features of Table 1, in the context of the\
    \ local and global\napproaches. We employed Gradient Boosting as, according to\
    \ the results of this section, it has proved\nto be the best ML technique for\
    \ our purposes. XGboost [80] estimates the relevance of each feature by\ncounting\
    \ the number of times it is used in a split node of any decision tree in the Gradient\
    \ Boosting\nforest. Figure 7 presents the results. The more an attribute is used\
    \ in a decision tree, the higher its\nrelative importance is. The most-used variables\

    \ of Predicted Data of Soil Moisture\nWe used the local and global models based\
    \ on Gradient Boosting to predict the matric potential\nψm for a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors over six months. The local approach estimated daily ψp\n\
    at a depth of 15 cm, as the ﬁeld had nine monitoring points. Therefore, we could\
    \ apply the outlier\nremoval techniques to treat this data set of nine daily values.\
    \ The global approach estimated one daily\nvalue for the ψp at a depth of 15 cm\
    \ in the ﬁeld. In this case, there was no need for preprocessing the\ndata using\
    \ the outlier removal techniques. We use ψp to compute predicted soil moisture\
    \ data for the\ncrop root zone (z = 30 cm) through the Van Genutchen Model (Equation\
    \ (A1)).\nFor water balance (Equation (A3)), executed every three days (n = 3)\
    \ for six months (26 samples\nof n), we compared the beneﬁts of our computational\
    \ models by analyzing how much they saved,\nin terms of the irrigation water need\
    \ (IWN) estimated using only weather and crop data. Table 6 shows\nthat the use\
    \ of global approach data saved an average of 56.4% and that the local approach\
    \ without\ndata preprocessing saved 100% of the IWN on average.\nThe Zscore and\
    \ MZscore methods tended to treat outliers by removing values that decreased the\n\
    current moisture θc (Figure 8a). Therefore, they reduced the result of the local\
    \ predicted data by 90%\nand 75.6%, respectively, for water balance. The employment\
    \ of Chauvenet for the local approach data\nalso saved 90% of IWN on average since\
    \ it almost achieved the performance of Zscore (Figure 8b).\nThe use of GESD did\
    \ not affect the local approach predicted data (Figure 8b), such that it had almost\n\
    the same water savings as when no outlier removal technique was employed (Table\
    \ 6). We consider\nthe global approach and local approach using Zscore, MZscore\
    \ and Chauvenet techniques optimized\nthe tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development, and they did not outweigh the IWN\nsavings of water balance\

    For the matric potential (Equation (A2)) executed daily, irrigation occurs when\
    \ the current\nmoisture θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\

    Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the\
    \ gathering,\npreprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management,\
    \ which also allows for the reuse of\ncode to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation\
    \ system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have\nproposed the Smart&Green\
    \ IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the\nwater\
    \ balance and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation\
    \ system\ninformation provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data\
    \ available close to the monitored\nﬁelds. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess\
    \ soil moisture data with outlier removal criteria and\ntechniques of Zscore,\
    \ MZscore, GESD, and Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need\n\
    (IWN) in irrigation management.\nFor large ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ we have considered the problem of predicting the\nsoil moisture by analyzing\
    \ the weather data, crop coefﬁcients, and amount of irrigation water. We have\n\
    formally introduced the problem of soil prediction and designed a methodology\
    \ which uses training\nmodels according to two different approaches: Local and\
    \ global. These approaches determine the\nimplementation of prediction models\
    \ based on supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe local approach trains\
    \ a model for each soil sensor in the ﬁeld, achieving high performance.\nHowever,\
    \ this approach can lead to a high cost of data management if there are a large\
    \ number of\nsensors, as it requires the training and maintainence of a large\
    \ number of distinctive prediction models.\nOn the other hand, the global approach\
    \ trains a single prediction model over the observations of all\nthe sensors.\
    \ Our results show that gradient boosting with regression trees (GBRT) outperformed\
    \ the\nother evaluated techniques in both approaches. The local approach had the\
    \ best results with gradient\nboost, although the results using the global prediction\
    \ model were also acceptable.\nFurthermore, we have designed a module to support\
    \ irrigation management with our prediction\nmodels, based on GBRT. We evaluated\
    \ irrigation management using the water balance and matric\npotential approaches\
    \ with real and predicted data of soil moisture, as well as the impact of preprocessing\n\
    data with outlier removal techniques. The real data was part of a data set collected\
    \ from an experimental\nfield for research in the city of Paraipaba, Brazil, in\
    \ which cashews and other raw materials were grown.\nWe also report that the dataset\
    \ will be made publicly available to ensure the reproducibility of our results\n\
    and promote research developments in this field (see Supplementary Materials).\n\
    The use of real soil moisture data from the data set in the water balance approach\
    \ saved as\nmuch as 90.4% of the IWN obtained for the water balance when using\
    \ only weather and crop data.\nZscore and MZscore applied to the real moisture\
    \ data saved 89.3% of IWN, optimizing the tradeoff\nbetween IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development. For the matric potential approach, Zscore and\nMZscore obtained\
    \ (on average) 20.7% and 14.1% of the IWN savings obtained by matric potential\n\
    without the use of any outlier removal technique. Considerating a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors,\nwe obtained a reduction between 56.4% and 90% of the\
    \ water balance IWN based on only weather\nand crop data, when we use our global\
    \ and local approaches to predict the soil moisture data. Zscore,\nMZscore, and\
    \ Chauvenet preprocess the predicted data to optimize the tradeoff without outweighing\n\
    the performance of water balance using real moisture data. We do not recommend\
    \ the use of predicted\ndata in the matric potential approach, as the computational\
    \ models (with errors) outperform mostly\nthe same approach using real data in\
    \ terms of water savings, according to our results.\nSupplementary Materials:\

    \ some examples of conﬁgurations composed of a crop, soil, weather,\nand an irrigation\
    \ system. The house is next to the entrance of the farm and has a connection to\n\
    the Internet. The house also hosts devices that connect sensor nodes in the ﬁeld\
    \ to the Internet.\nAutomatic weather stations make weather data available on\
    \ the Internet.\nIn this work, we address ﬁelds with one type of crop whose soil\
    \ has analog (Field 2) or digital\ntensiometers (Field 3) monitoring the moisture\
    \ at more than one depth z. Tensiometers installed\nat different points b of the\
    \ ﬁeld gather readings of the matric potential ψm. Mathematical models\nuse ψm\
    \ to measure the soil moisture θ as the level of water retention in the type of\
    \ soil. We use the\nVan Genuchten Model [57] to express θ as the volume of water\
    \ by the volume of soil (cm3/cm3),\nas Equation (A1) shows:\nθ(ψm) = θr +\nθs\
    \ − θr\n[1 + (α × |ψm|)n]1− 1\nn\n,\n(A1)\nwhere θr is the residual water content,\
    \ θs is the saturated water content, α is related to the inverse of\nthe air entry\
    \ suction, and n is a measure of the pore-size distribution in the soil (e.g.,\
    \ Table 2 has these\nVan Genutchen constants for the experimental ﬁeld soil).\n\
    The management of matric potential estimates the irrigation water need (IWN) for\
    \ a ﬁeld with\nsoil sensors (e.g., Field 3 of Figure A1) taking into account the\
    \ soil moisture at the monitored depths zi,\nas Equation (A2) shows:\nIWN = (θ\
    \ f c,z1 − θcr,z1) × z1 + (θ f c,z2 − θc,z2) × z2 + (θ f c,z3 − θc,z3) × z3\n\
    E f\n,\n(A2)\nwhere:\n•\nzi represent the thickness of soil along the proﬁle (monitored\
    \ depth);\n•\nθ f c represents the ﬁeld capacity at a depth z after the drainage\
    \ of water excess, which is a constant\nobtained by a laboratory soil analysis;\n\
    •\nθcr is the ideal moisture for irrigation, signaling when the crop productivity\
    \ starts to decline;\n•\nθc is the current soil moisture. In matric potential\
    \ management, we initialize the irrigation by\nθc,z1 ≤ θcr; and\n•\nE f is the\
    \ efﬁciency of the irrigation system used in the ﬁeld.\nWater balance management\
    \ computes the IWN for an interval of n days, comparing the inputs and\noutputs\
    \ of water in the soil by using the daily crop evapotranspiration ETc, the rainfall\
    \ R, and ∆A =\n(θ f c − θc)z which represents the soil moisture at the crop root\
    \ zone z through Equation (A3).\nIWN = ∑n\ni=1(ETc,i − Ri) − ∆A\nE f\n.\n(A3)\n\
    The value Ef is the efficiency of the irrigation system placed in the field. The\
    \ crop evapotranspiration\nETc represents the water consumption by a type of crop\
    \ at its current life development stage, which is\ngiven by:\nETc = ETo × kc.\n\
    (A4)\nThe Penman-Monteith model [61] estimates the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo using weather\ndata. Each type of crop, without hydrological restriction,\
    \ has a speciﬁc coefﬁcient curve in which the\ncrop coefﬁcient kc varies from\
    \ 0 to 1.5 with the number days since the planting of the crop.\nSensors 2020,\

    \ Problem of Soil Moisture Prediction\nLet B = {b1, . . . , bn} be the set of\
    \ tensiometers monitoring the soil moisture of a ﬁeld at n different\npoints.\
    \ A tensiometer bj gathers the sample (ψj,15, ψj,45, ψj,75), which consists of\
    \ the matric potential\nψ readings at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths, respectively,\
    \ at a point j. Let W = {w1, . . . , wn} be the set of\nwater amount given to\
    \ the crop at n different points by an irrigation system. Irrigation management\n\
    calculates W using the Equations (A2) and (A3), for example.\nThe weather data\
    \ are required, as the climatic conditions affect a crop’s need for soil water\
    \ and\nrainfall can increase the soil moisture. Therefore, we assume that there\
    \ is a weather station ms close to the\nfield which provides the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms = {Tmin, Tmax, RHmin, RHmax, Rn,U2, P, Ri}, where:\n•\nTmin and\
    \ Tmax are the minimum and maximum air temperature, respectively;\n•\nRHmin and\
    \ RHmax are the minimum and maximum relative humidity, respectively;\n•\nRn is\
    \ the net radiation;\n•\nU2 is the wind speed;\n•\nP is the atmospheric pressure;\
    \ and\n•\nRi is the rainfall.\nWithin a daily time interval, there are several\
    \ observations about the weather and ﬁeld. We denote\nby O the collection of observations,\
    \ which consists of (t, B, Mms, W, kc), recorded within a time t over\na day.\
    \ The irrigation scheduling methods presented in Appendix A decide to start precise\
    \ irrigation\nwhen the current moisture θc,z1 is low at the superﬁcial layer of\
    \ soil (z1 = 15 cm). Therefore, the matric\npotential ψi,15 is analyzed daily\
    \ to achieve θc,z1 using the Van Genutchen model (Equation (A1)). In this\nwork,\
    \ we wish to monitor the level of soil moisture without soil sensors (i.e., tensiometers).\n\
    Let y(i, Mms, wi, kc) be a function that, given the monitoring point i, the meteorological\
    \ variables\nMms, the irrigation water amount wi at the point i, and the crop\
    \ coefﬁcient kc returns ψi,15 (the matric\npotential at a depth of 15 cm). Then,\
    \ y(i, Mms, wi, kc) = ψi,15. We deﬁne the problem of soil moisture\nprediction\
    \ as the problem of ﬁnding an accurate function f for predicting y(i, Mms, wi,\
    \ kc), given all\nthe observations recorded in O.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n21 of\
    \ 25\nDeﬁnition A1. The problem of soil moisture prediction requires ﬁnding a\
    \ predictive function ˆf over the class\nof all possible predictive functions\
    \ H, such that\nˆf = argmin∆( f ),\n(A5)\nwhere f ∈ H and ∆ is a loss function\
    \ assessing the quality of a candidate predictive function f over the\nobservations\
    \ in O. In this work, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute\
    \ Error\n(MAE) loss functions, deﬁned as:\n∆RMSE( f ) =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\n|O′|\n\
    ∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n( f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc))2, and\n(A6)\n∆MAE(\
    \ f ) =\n1\n|O′|\n∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n| f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc)|,\n\
    (A7)\nwhere O’ is the set of observations used to assess the quality of the prediction\
    \ and f (i, Mms, wi, kc) is the estimate\nreturned by function f for y(i, Mms,\
    \ wi, kc). The smaller the value yielded by the above loss functions, the better\n\
    the predictive performance of f.\nWe employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to\
    \ address the problem of soil moisture prediction.\nMore speciﬁcally, we aim at\
    \ learning, from the observations in O, some function ˆf that minimizes the\n\
    error measured by ∆. We train the prediction models on a data set containing examples\
    \ built from\npast sensor observations (see Section 4.2). The ML techniques for\
    \ regression tasks used in this work\nare: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump\

    Precision agriculture is a field which provides one of the most suitable scenarios
    for the deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The particular characteristics
    of agricultural environments – which may vary significantly with location – make
    WSNs a key technology able to provide accurate knowledge to farmers. This knowledge
    represents a valuable resource because it enables real-time decision making with
    regard to issues such as establishing water saving policies while providing adequate
    irrigation and choosing the right time to harvest the fruit based on its maturity.
    This article proposes a methodology consisting of a set of well-defined phases
    that cover the complete life cycle of WSN applications for agricultural monitoring.
    We have studied different existing real-world scenarios where WSNs are being applied.
    Based on this study we have discovered that there exist significant commonalities
    but no methodology that specifies the best practices that should be used in the
    general, crop-independent case. The lack of a general methodology negatively impacts
    the amount of effort, development time, and cost of developing applications. Highlights
    ► We are proposing a methodology to guide the development of applications for
    the agricultural domain based on WSN. ► We are leveraging the existing state-of-the-art
    to collect a set of common actions and best practices for agriculture monitoring

    applications and provide a solid foundation on which applications can be built
    with significant productivity gains and facility of maintenance. ► We validate

    computingDevelopment methodologyWinemaking 1. Introduction In recent years, wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as a promising technology in the field of
    embedded systems. A WSN connects the physical and computational world by monitoring
    environmental phenomena through ubiquitous devices called sensor nodes or motes.
    These networks are composed of many autonomous, cooperating, battery-powered,
    small-sized motes usually connected through wireless links and a communication
    gateway with capacity to forward data from the motes to a base station with high
    processing and storing capacities. The potential provided by the motes is based
    on the integration of different sensors, from simple – e.g. temperature, light,
    humidity – to complex – e.g. global positioning system, images, micro-radars.
    This makes it possible to monitor a wide range of environments with the purpose
    of providing accurate and up-to-date knowledge from the field (Akyildiz et al.,
    2002). Fig. 1 depicts a WSN composed of a set of sensor nodes, a gateway, and
    a base station. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. A wireless sensor
    network. Developing an application requires an extensive effort to identify the
    key requirements and decide which are the general tasks and how to implement them;
    all these steps are necessary and incur a significant time investment and considerable
    financial costs. For specific domains such as the one we are targeting is it feasible
    to envision a methodology for guiding the development and deployment of WSN applications
    in agricultural environments. Several projects have been presented in the literature
    which use WSNs in the agriculture domain. These works take a first step towards
    connecting agriculture and sensor networks technology but constitute isolated
    case studies where only a limited set of aspects of WSN research have been exploited.
    To the extent of our knowledge there exists no work that proposes to unify the
    global development process into a set of best practices that cover the whole lifetime
    of an application. We are proposing a methodology to guide the development of
    applications for the agricultural domain based on wireless sensor networks. Our
    methodology facilitates the interaction between heterogeneous groups from multidisciplinary
    sciences. We are leveraging the existing state-of-the-art to design a generic
    methodology which integrates best practices in agricultural applications based
    on WSNs. We have been actively involved in a Spanish Research Project named Control
    Automatizado de Procesos Agrícolas (COPA) – Automated Control of Agricultural
    Processes – whose aim is to design and implement a prototype application for vineyard
    monitoring using sensor networks. We have applied our methodology within the COPA
    project; this approach proved to considerably facilitate the development process.
    This hands-on experience proved to be an invaluable resource in the process of
    filling the gap between the way isolated applications are built in the field and
    a robust, customizable development approach. The remainder of this paper is organized
    as follows. Section 2 describes the economic importance of the winemaking process
    as a reference sector of the Spanish economy and it discusses both WSNs and other
    alternative monitoring strategies. Section 3 presents the related work with regard
    to solutions for agricultural monitoring and decision making. In Section 4 we
    collect the general requirements for agricultural monitoring based on WSNs. Section
    5 describes our proposal for a novel methodology designed to support applications
    development with the purpose of improving the agricultural production. Section
    6 underscores our main contributions. We conclude in Section 7 by summarizing
    our work. 2. Motivation 2.1. Economic impact of the vineyard sector Winemaking
    is an activity that brings a lot of income to the Spanish industry. Due to the
    type of monitoring and feedback that vineyards require they constitute one of
    the most suitable scenarios where sensor networks and embedded systems can help.
    COPA is a project intended for controlling vineyards with the purpose of improving
    the quality of the wine and it can be viewed as a representative example of monitoring
    application based on WSNs. We took advantage of the opportunity that COPA provides
    to directly quantify the impact of the methodology we are proposing in the field.
    As a result this paper focuses specifically on vineyard monitoring; our methodology
    can however be used to develop WSN applications to be deployed in other environments
    for other types of crops. Due to the massive wine production both in Europe and
    world wide, 2004 brought with it a wine crisis which lead to a global reorganization
    of the vineyard production. The increase in the number of producers of wine in
    the European Union led to a reduction of the area dedicated to the grape production
    per producer. According to the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV,
    2008) the rate of decrease is approximately around 40 thousands hectares per year.
    More wine providers make the market more competitive and quality becomes the key
    factor. Quality specialization is a critical factor for success and therefore
    competitors focus on factors affecting the quality of the wine. In Spain vineyards
    are considered a key sector for the country''s economy. Spain is in fact the country
    with the largest extension of vineyard terrain in the world. The Spanish wine
    sector is important for its economic value and for the size of the population
    employed by this sector. The geographical situation, the climatic differences,
    and the variety of the soil make the peninsula a privileged place for producing
    wines with very distinct characteristics. In accordance with the Spanish Institute
    for Foreign Trade (ICEX, 2004) Spain has 62 Denominations of Origin. The strict
    control of the wine production process is of utmost importance for obtaining wine
    of quality. Winemaking includes several phases which require distinct conditions
    depending on the type of grape: agricultural production, harvesting, crushing,
    fermentation, aging, and packaging. While some phases of winemaking can be supported
    by modern techniques, the agricultural production consisting of the cultivation
    of grapes and their surveillance is done with traditional techniques by the farmers
    in order to detect problems – e.g. plagues, humidity, or dryness – and ideal conditions
    – e.g. the Ph or sugar level. 2.2. WSNs in agriculture WSN expert researchers
    agree that vineyards are a good candidate for the deployment of wireless sensor
    applications to monitor the vines and enable an informed decision process on the
    farmer''s side. The winemaking process is affected by different factors such as
    weather – e.g. temperature, humidity, solar radiation – and particular conditions
    of the terrain – e.g. Ph, water content, topography. During the process of maturation
    of grapes, the photo-synthesis produces sugar, which is progressively stored in
    grapes. The balance among sugars, acids, Ph, potassium, and so on is fundamental
    to determine the quality of the wine. Another relevant aspect to consider is that
    the spatial variability of the conditions affecting the grapes is high. This means
    that vineyards located at short distances may measure notably different values
    for temperature, humidity, and so on due to factors such as the orientation and
    slope of the landscape. All of these factors can be monitored by deploying the
    appropriate sensor network. Real-time data from a sensor network deployed in the
    field may be used by experts to make decisions such as the irrigation policy,
    the location of vineyards onto raised posts to maximize the sunlight, or the actions
    to be taken when detecting fungus or plagues of the grapes. Additionally, WSN
    technology has the advantage of being both non-intrusive – in that wires are not
    required and there is no or little human intervention – and expected to become
    cheap in the near future. 2.3. Alternative monitoring strategies There exist other
    alternative strategies that can be used for agricultural monitoring. The two main
    ones are: • Weather stations: they provide accurate local measurements for various
    farming applications in real-time. Some measurements that can be obtained are
    wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, rain level, and solar radiation.
    Some stations may also measure the ultraviolet index, leaf wetness, soil moisture,
    and soil temperature. • Surveillance satellites: are used to harvest data from
    a terrain; in accordance with Economist (2009) this service costs about $15 per
    hectare for a handful of readings a year, while the benefits can increase up to
    10%. Precise recommendations for growing crops can be obtained quickly by measuring
    electro-magnetic radiation reflected from farmland and collected by orbiting satellites.
    The spectrum of this radiation can reveal the properties of the soil, moisture
    level, the quantity of crop being grown, and the levels of chlorophyll and minerals
    in the crops. This solution is generally less expensive than the analysis of crops
    typically performed in laboratories. Weather stations monitor a specific location
    within the terrain. However, some soil characteristics such as acidity and humidity
    may change from one point to an other. Therefore, weather stations do not facilitate
    the detection of micro-climates, which may depend on the weather station''s orientation.
    A possible solution is to install many weather stations in suitable locations,
    but this would be obviously prohibitive in terms of cost. Satellite-based intelligence
    is in a preliminary state and its application is limited to regions covered by
    these satellites. To add to the problem, the possibility of extracting data depends
    on the weather conditions at the moment and the geographic location of the terrain.
    The data sampling frequency could be insufficient, while having one dedicated
    satellite would be cost prohibitive. All these issues make satellite-based solutions
    inadequate, at least for the time being. WSNs, on the other hand, enable an unprecedented
    level of control over crops and have the capacity to affect both the quantity
    and the quality of the final product. WSNs are a more effective and cheaper way
    of collecting data periodically than whether stations and satellite-based strategies.
    Up until now, there is no other approach providing the level of detail that a
    WSN provides for monitoring and controlling the agricultural production. 2.4.
    Reasons for a methodology Our motivation for designing a methodology for agricultural
    monitoring is to establish a working framework intended to guide the efficient
    development and maintenance of applications for agriculture based on WSNs. After
    studying the state-of-the-art in agricultural monitoring we have identified a
    set of actions that came up repeatedly in the development, deployment, and maintenance
    processes of agricultural applications. Based on these, we are proposing a set
    of generic tasks that must be carried out as part of the process of developing
    and deploying efficient sensor networks for agricultural monitoring. In spite
    of the particular requirements of each application and the characteristics of
    each type of crop, our methodology identifies a set of common tasks that need
    to be performed and which have the potential of saving time and effort, and consequently,
    increase the productivity of developing applications. To the extent of our knowledge,
    there exists no unified methodology for guiding the development of applications
    which monitor environment and crop conditions in oder to improve the quality of
    the crops. 3. Related work This section presents the related work in WSN applications
    for agricultural monitoring. The purpose is to provide the necessary background
    to fully understand the requirements of these applications. 3.1. Taxonomy of agricultural
    applications Wireless sensor network applications are often multi-disciplinary
    and must obey many types of requirements. Therefore, the construction of a taxonomy
    of applications is a challenging task. Several authors have classified WSN applications
    according to their domain (Akyildiz et al., 2002, Xu, 2002) and, as a result,
    they have identified military, environmental, health, civil and structural engineering
    applications. Among these applications, vineyard applications constitute one of
    the most important scenarios. The design space defined by Römer and Mattern (2004)
    consists of a set of dimensions that facilitate categorizing existing applications
    which take specific values for each such application domain. Among the applications
    used for this study we find Grape Monitoring (Beckwith et al., 2004), the only
    wireless sensor network application which monitors environmental conditions affecting
    vineyards. The first column in Table 1 shows the set of dimensions identified
    by Römer and Mattern (2004). Column 2 describes each dimension and column 3 indicates
    the specific value for the Grape Monitoring application. Table 1. Classification
    of Grape Monitoring based on the Römer design space. Dimension Description Class
    Deployment How are sensor nodes installed over the terrain? Manual, one-time Mobility
    Can the sensor nodes change their location? Immobile Resources Size and restrictions
    Matchbox2 Cost Cost of the devices ∼200 USD Energy How are the sensor nodes powered?
    Battery Heterogeneity Are devices heterogeneous from HW/SW point of view? Heterogeneous:
    sensors, gateway, base station Modality Wireless communication mode Radio Infrastructure
    Communication among other devices Base station Topology How are the devices interconnected?
    Tree (two-tiered multi-hop) Coverage What is the range covered by the sensor nodes?
    Sparse (20 m apart) Connectivity Are the nodes always connected or intermittently?
    Connected Size What is the network size? Up to hundreds Lifetime What is the expected
    network lifetime? Several months (growth period) QoS Does the application have
    any other QoS requirement? No Mottola and Picco (2010) present a new taxonomy
    of WSN applications in order to identify their fundamental requirements. This
    taxonomy consists of a more reduced set of dimensions, some of which are the same
    than those defined by Römer and Mattern (2004); for Grape Monitoring the dimensions
    coincide and have the same values as those from the Römer and Mattern (2004) study.
    All the existing studies point to the fact that, despite the differences among
    crops, most agricultural applications based on WSNs present similar requirements.
    Therefore, we take these requirements as a starting point for the design of agricultural
    monitoring applications. 3.2. Case studies Precision agriculture is a term conceived
    to refer to the fusion between the farming management process and the new technologies.
    A study of the WSN technology and its application in agriculture is discussed
    by Wang et al. (2006). Specifically for vineyards, Winkler (1963) describes the
    generic wine production process. Open challenges in precision vineyards were reviewed
    by Arnó et al. (2009). The term vineyard computing was introduced by Burrell et
    al. (2004), which in his work uses ethnographic methods to identify the priorities
    of people working in vineyards in order to exploit the use of sensor networks
    in agriculture. There are many real instances of WSN deployment for agricultural
    monitoring, some of them specific to the vineyard scenario. Camelie Vineyards
    (2005) is a familiar company in Northern California. The company is one of the
    first to experiment with applying WSNs in agriculture with the purpose of implementing
    a water saving policy. Beckwith et al. (2004) studied the results of a 65-node
    WSN deployed in a vineyard in the Rhine region. Authors exploited the WSN for
    6 months and focused on the investment returned to farmers by deploying such a
    network. Grape Networks (2008) is a company founded by Stanford University with
    the aim of monitoring the environment, water, and micro-climate in agriculture,
    open fields, and deserts. Costa et al. (2007) studies the monitoring of wine cellars
    using WSNs. In Spain, the University of Castilla-La Mancha developed the WISEVINE
    project (Montero et al., 2007, Olivares et al., 2006), whose results can be tracked
    online at: http://www.wisevine.info. Table 2 summarizes these projects in order
    to show their contribution to the WSN-based agricultural research. Each of them
    was developed independently and adopted a different methodology. However, most
    of them coincide in several aspects such as the measurements to be taken, the
    need of studying micro-climates, and the way in which network is deployed. Table

    challenges; energy is doubtless the most restricted resource for WSN applications
    and consequently it poses a strong design requirement. The particular issues around
    the lifetime of WSNs in vineyard applications have been addressed by Galmés, 2006,
    Galmés, 2007, who studied vineyard requirements and the WSN deployment to determine
    the optimal topology in terms of energy. The demand for new services able to exploit
    and integrate data as well as inter-operate between WSNs and other technologies
    have promoted the appearance of tools which ease the access to data generated
    from the network. Data contextualization and information systems meant to access
    information through mobile devices and PDAs were described by Cunha et al. (2010).
    4. Analysis of agricultural monitoring applications This section discusses the
    set of requirements for WSN applications intended to monitor agricultural crops,
    first from the agricultural viewpoint, then from the engineering viewpoint. 4.1.
    Agricultural view Crops provide an ideal setting for applying WSN technology as
    they are very sensitive to environmental changes. For example, the presence of
    hot or cold spots may determine variations in the degree of maturity of the fruit.
    For each kind of crop there are maybe different factors affecting its quality.
    According to Winkler (1963), in the case of vineyards temperature is the most
    relevant factor but other variables such as atmosphere humidity, soil humidity,
    and luminosity must also be considered. These variables can help to diagnose with
    accuracy the grapes’ health and plagues, the state of the terrain and the water
    requirements, and therefore may improve the quality of the grapes. Enologists
    are faced with a unique opportunity of being able to use the data from the sensors,
    conveniently processed, to enhance the quality of wine. Some of the key issues
    that WSNs may help resolving are: • How to identify the micro-climates within
    vineyards. According to (Winkler, 1963), the grape yield usually displays considerable
    spatial variability within the same parcel. • What is the best irrigation policy
    within each small parcel. Irrigation could be dynamically adjusted depending on
    the current level of water in the soil and the plants. • How to provide measurements
    of specific terrain conditions (e.g. soil features, topography) based on which
    farmers can make decisions about which type of grape is best suited to the terrain
    under monitoring. • How to detect and diagnose problems early (such as fungus
    and plagues). • What are the optimal fruit conditions – e.g. alcohol and sugar
    level. 4.2. Engineering view From the engineering point of view, designing and
    implementing WSN applications should take into account the following: • The network
    traffic model, which takes one of two approaches: 1. Proactive or time-driven
    model. The sensor nodes perform a set of actions in a periodic way and at specific
    intervals of time. These actions generally follow a pattern consisting of sampling
    the sensors, encapsulating the values into a message, and delivering them to the
    network. Nodes must also forward the messages received from other nodes within
    the network. This behavior generates a continuous and regular traffic pattern,
    which can be predicted. 2. Reactive or exception-driven model. The sensor nodes
    only generate network traffic when an unusual condition or exception happens,
    for example, when a measurement exceeds a pre-determined threshold. Subsequently,
    data is generated at discrete times and in an unpredictable fashion. • The network
    deployment is accomplished in a structured way, locating the sensor nodes at strategic
    positions within the cultives. This model is opposite to random deployments typically
    performed in unaccessible fields such as glaciers or volcanos. Generally, in agriculture,
    nodes are regularly distributed over the terrain in form of rectangles composed
    of multiple parallel rows (Galmés, 2006). • The radio range of nodes and their
    physical location. In order to have a connected network, every node should be
    accessible by at least one other node in the network. In this regard, the maximum
    radio range which depends on every radio model is a key parameter. However, if
    we want to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of the measurements –
    necessary in the case of micro-climates –, we must add redundant nodes at shorter
    distances although the radio range does not require them. • Energy is a key factor
    to get networks operating for long periods of time. The main two approaches for
    conserving energy are: (1) shortening the distance between nodes and using a multihop
    protocol to communicate between source and sink nodes. Longer distances imply
    a higher transmission power, which increases the global energy consumption. Therefore,
    a multihop protocol will be the preferred option for communicating between the
    source nodes and sink node; and (2) employing energy-aware implementations which
    are conscious about the power consumption of both the hardware and software layers.
    5. Our monitoring methodology This section introduces our novel methodology for
    agricultural monitoring applications which uses WSN technology. The goal of this
    methodology is to guide the applications development through a set of well-defined
    phases throughout their entire life cycle. The methodology uses the work from
    the projects in Table 2 to collect a set of common actions and best practices
    for agriculture monitoring based on WSNs. It also takes into account the classification
    for vineyard monitoring applications depicted in Table 1. The methodology is illustrated
    in Fig. 2. As shown, the life cycle is divided into seven sequential phases. Each
    phase presents a challenge, gets an input, produces an output, and describes the
    procedures to be undertaken by a specific group of users. Specifically, the purpose
    of this methodology is to describe the life cycle of applications by identifying
    its phases, the tasks within phases, their inputs and outputs, and the responsibilities
    for the users. We expect the benefits of this methodology be manyfold: • A roadmap
    and guidelines for the main actions to be carried out by the agricultural applications
    that use WSN technology. • A better estimation and planning of human resources,
    time, and effort in the agricultural production. • The early detection of many
    common problems such as failing sensors, disconnected zones. • A goal-directed
    deployment process, where the monitoring system considers the specifics of every
    environment. • An increase in the coordination between the different working groups
    (farmers, enologists, technical assistants and managers) thanks to a clear division
    of responsibilities. • The reuse of knowledge gathered from real-world applications.

    It includes tasks of supervision through the data collected at the base station,
    prevention tasks as well as decision making 5.1. Phase 1: study of the terrain
    The first phase collects data which is necessary to fully understand the features
    of the terrain to be monitored. This phase consists of an exhaustive description
    of the terrain from the geographical, topographical, and climatic points of view.
    It should include at least: • The geographic map that provides information about
    size, location, orientation, and topography (e.g. level curves, slope). It is
    important to note that this data can vary from one point to another within the
    same parcel. • A weather map that shows information about the meteorological conditions
    such as sunlight level, temperature, wind speed, humidity and pressure. Data must
    be available for a long interval of time such that we can observe the trends.
    • A soil map which classifies the different kinds of soils as well as the criteria
    that dictate choices in the use of crops. It is useful to determine for example
    the Ph levels, substratum conditions, and the presence of fungus in the soil.
    The study of these maps leads to the classification of the whole terrain in different
    zones. Each zone can be described as an equivalence class of locations within
    the map obtained by overlapping the geographic, weather, and soil maps; these
    zones share similar properties in terms of geography, climate, and soil. As an
    example, consider Fig. 3 where three zones were identified from the different
    geographical and weather requirements. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. A parcel with three different zones – A, B, and C – classified based on geographic
    and weather maps. This information is relevant for detecting micro-climates and
    determining the degree to which the soil is adequate for a specific kind of crop.
    Micro-climates can be viewed as critical regions inside a zone, where the climatic
    conditions vary notably in comparison to the collected average values for a specific
    zone. In 2002, the Spanish Agricultural Ministry published agricultural, topological,
    and climatic maps for all Spanish regions with the goal of helping the agriculture
    through a tool called System for Geographic Agricultural Information (SIGA) which
    is available online at http://sig.marm.es/siga/. Using this tool, maps including
    altitude, slopes, rivers, and landscape, among other features, can be easily obtained.
    We name the output of this phase Terrain Description Table (TDT). A TDT collects
    the information for every zone that was identified within a terrain; Table 4 shows
    the TDT for zone B of Fig. 3. Table 4. Terrain Description Table (TDT) for zone

    2: network architecture design Given the TDT from the previous phase, the next
    step is to select the most adequate network design that will monitor each zone.
    This is the phase which identifies the relevant environmental variables for each
    specific zone and micro-climate and should be performed by farmers. In this phase
    also participate WSN technical people. According to Winkler (1963) “the only factor
    of climate that proved to be of predominant importance [for wine quality] was
    temperature”. For example, the difference between two well-known wine regions,
    Rhine (Germany) and Tuscany (Italy), is that Tuscany has a 20% more heat accumulation
    during the growing session (Beckwith et al., 2004). In all instances previously
    described, temperature was always a mandatory measure and therefore the methodology
    should include such a measure. Enologists also consider other measures to be important
    for obtaining wine of quality. For instance, in order to adjust the irrigation
    it is paramount to measure the soil and environmental humidities. Luminosity is
    a key factor determining the sugar concentration in grapes, which indicates the
    amount of alcohol of the wine. The complete set of parameters to be measured is
    important to determine the most suitable model of sensor node and sensor board
    to be selected. The goal of this phase is designing the most suitable network
    architecture able to measure the selected variables and monitor the different
    zones and micro-climates. This process includes the selection of the hardware
    elements and their location within each zone. The physical characteristics of
    the motes, especially the radio range, will also influence their number within
    the field. If there exist micro-climates that need to be analyzed then redundant
    nodes should be added. Since the organization of the parcels typically takes the
    shape of a rectangle with multiple rows the most appropriate deployment will usually
    be the grid such as described in the literature (Galmés, 2006). Algorithm 1 shows
    a basic algorithm for grid distribution which could to be used to establish the
    location of the nodes. Algorithm 1 Grid deployment of sensor nodes on the terrain
    Define Sizewidth,Sizeheight of the terrain/zone in meters Define RadioRange as
    maximum range Select MinRange as minimum range Select Distance ∈ [MinRange.. RadioRange]
    Compute NumOfNodes = (Sizewidth/Distance) + 1 * (Sizeheight/Distance) + 1 for
    all n in Nodes do n(i,j) = matrix(n, Nodes)/* Assign identifiers i, j to node
    n*/  =  /*Assign point x, y for node n*/ This algorithm computes the number of
    nodes and assigns their location within the terrain. The distance among nodes
    – ranging from a configured minimum value to the radio range – and the size of
    the terrain determines the number of sensor nodes required. Choosing a smaller
    number may obviously result in less precise information; this information may
    be very useful in case of micro-climates, where generally redundant nodes are
    necessary to obtain more knowledge about each zone. Fig. 4 shows an estimation
    of the network architecture for a fictitious terrain of 27 ha (600 × 450 m) where
    three different zones – A, B, and C – were identified in the previous phase. Consider
    that, by the terrain circumstances extracted from the TDT, every zone requires
    the monitoring of different environmental variables. Thus, let us assume that
    C requires temperature, humidity, soil humidity, luminosity, and Ph level; B requires
    temperature and luminosity and, finally, A requires the environmental temperature
    and humidity. Assume a radio range of 150 m, which constrains nodes to be located
    within this distance to be able to communicate with each other. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. On the left, a terrain of 600 × 450 m divided in three
    different zones of interest: A, B and C. On the right, the network architecture
    design for every zone, identifying the amount of nodes required and their physical
    location. Due to the different requirements of each zone we will have one subnetwork
    for each of them. The gateway is only accessible by the nodes at distance lower
    than 150 m, while nodes further out should connect using a multihop protocol.
    The multihop protocol could use different metrics to select the next hop among
    a subset of neighbors; this process results in a tree topology. Fig. 5 shows an
    example of grid deployment with a tree topology. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A wireless sensor network using a tree topology. In Fig. 4 a given
    node in zone B can connect only to three other nodes: one located on the diagonal
    and the two closest neighbors located on the same column and row. The routing
    protocol should select the best neighbor according to the metric that was chosen.
    If the routing protocol aims to minimize the energy use, the nodes located on
    the diagonal are less attractive than the other two because they are further out.
    Assume that we decided to add more nodes for zones A and C. The distances among
    nodes become shorter and the number of neighbors is bigger. These zones would
    implement a more robust fault tolerance requirement. If the previous TDT shows
    micro-climates within a specific area of the map then technical people should
    consider adding more sensor nodes to increase the knowledge gathered from these
    regions. This policy was implemented by the Grape Monitoring project (Beckwith
    et al., 2004) where nodes were positioned 20 m apart for a radio range of approximately
    100 m in order to study micro-climates. The output of this step is a table which
    describes the sensor network design. We name this table the Sensor Network Architecture
    TAble (SeNTA); SeNTA will record the assignments of the monitoring elements to
    the zones identified in the previous step. Table 5 shows the SeNTA for the previously
    described scenario. For each zone we compute the number of nodes; we then select
    the mote and sensor board model depending on the parameters to be measured and
    the radio range. Given the application requirements, there may be more than one
    candidate sensor board. The most suitable for zones A and C is the MDA300 acquisition
    board (MDA300, 2003) because it incorporates, among others, humidity and temperature
    sensors, and it has analogical inputs which can be connected to other kind of
    sensors. For measuring the soil humidity we can choose the ECHO EC20 Soil Moisture
    sensor (ECHO20, 2002) which can be connected to a MDA300 sensor board. This sensor
    is able to measure the water content of the soil. Zone B requires a luminosity
    sensor such as the one integrated into the MTS300 sensor board. Several motes
    are compatible with the two mentioned sensor boards. A good election is the MicaZ
    (MICAZ, 2005) mote, due to the fact that it can be attached to MDA300 and MTS300
    and it incorporates the CC2420 ZigBee-compliant radio. The outdoor transmission
    range for this radio is 75–100 m. We also require one gateway acting as a bridge
    between the WSN and the base station. As mentioned, the gateway delivers data
    proceeding both from the WSN and from the base station due to the fact that the
    information flow might be bidirectional. Typically, gateways connect directly
    to the base station through a serial interface. Table 5. Sensor Network Architecture

    Temperature, humidity MDA300 75 m Soil humidity ECHO EC20 5.3. Phase 3: defining
    roles and functionalities The goal of this phase is to define the role that every
    node in the sensor network should assume. Having precise and up-to-date knowledge
    of the roles and functionalities being implemented by all of the nodes during
    the network exploitation makes it possible to detect anomalies in the working
    nodes. The input for this step is the SeNTA, which provides the network design.
    For each role a set of functionalities must be described. This phase is collecting
    the functional requirements for the WSN application and therefore must involve
    both WSN developers and farmers. A basic monitoring application consists of capturing
    data from the environment and sending it to the base station following a well-defined
    protocol for data transmission. Such an application must consider at least the
    following roles: • Sensor is a node of the network with the capacity of periodically
    sampling the sensors from the sensor board, delivering data to the network and
    routing the incoming packets from its neighbors towards the gateway node. • Actuator
    is a node with the capacity of dynamically acting on the environment. For example,
    an actuator can control the irrigation system to adapt it to the current humidity
    levels. In order to accomplish this task, a set of commands or orders should be
    designed. Actuator nodes must be able to receive commands from the base station,
    interpret them, and generate the corresponding action (e.g. irrigation). • Redundant
    nodes can provide complete, partial, or auxiliary functionality relative with
    regard to the Sensor and Actuator roles. They are useful in the presence of faulty
    nodes and micro-climates. In normal conditions they should be switched off to
    save energy. • A gateway forwards data from the network to a base station through
    a communication port (e.g. serial, TCP/IP). It is important to point out that
    other roles such as data storing or aggregation could also be defined depending
    on the application requirements. The functionality of the four roles described
    above is rather a recommendation; it does not prevent additional actions to be
    performed. A single node may also assume several roles at once. Non functional
    requirements should also be taken into account in this phase: given the nature
    of the applications programmers must be particularly energy-aware during this
    phase. Saving energy may require renouncing roles or decreasing the sampling frequency
    which reduces the network traffic. Once roles and functionalities have been defined,
    they must be assigned to the nodes identified in SeNTA. This assignment is recorded
    in the Role Assignation Table (RAT). Consider the RAT in Table 6 for the scenario
    in Fig. 4. WSN developers must adjust the initial configuration of each role;
    configuration consists of the values of all application variables. For example,
    for the Sensor role the parameters regarding the sampling frequency (Ps), sending
    frequency (Pt), and thresholds for each sensor reading are mandatory and should
    be defined with the help of farmers. The Actuator role must define useful commands
    such as switching the mote on and off, modifying the motes configuration (e.g.
    thresholds and sampling periods), or requesting the state of a node from the base
    station in order to know its configuration. These commands are asynchronously
    received by the sensor nodes. Table 6. Role Assignation Table (RAT). Role Identifier

    gateway Fig. 6 shows a diagram for a generic application with nodes acting as
    both sensor and actuator. At each sampling interval the application will do the
    following: (1) stay in sleep state to save energy if no event occurs; otherwise
    go into active state. (2) Depending on the type of the event, go to sensing, acting,
    or sending states from active state. (3) When the actions corresponding to each
    state are finished, the motes go back to sleep. Note that some edges are bidirectional,
    which means that the application can only return to the previous state. For instance,
    if the application is in active state and the time event Pt occurs, it goes to
    sending state, executes the sending, and finally comes back to sleep state. The
    notation “/”means an OR condition for the events that produce a certain state.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. State transition diagram of generic
    monitoring applications (time-driven and exception-driven model). Sampling is
    carried out every sample period (Ps). Due to the fact that vineyards manifest
    slow temporal variability Ps tends to be high – for instance 10 min. Pt is a function
    of Ps and generally corresponds to one send every n sampling periods (Pt = Ps
    × n). The value of n depends on the memory constraints of the mote given that
    sensor readings must be stored until they can be delivered to the network. For
    example, if n is 6 the ratio between sampling and sending is 6:1. This results
    in a significant energy saving since communication is more expensive than computation
    in terms of energy. Maximum and minimum thresholds must be assigned for each variable
    to provide a basic mechanism for the detection of undesirable conditions in which
    users should apply corrective actions. Following this approach, the application
    is both time-driven and exception-driven because it generates traffic at periodic
    intervals and as well as when an unusual event occurs. 5.4. Phase 4: implementation
    process This phase implements the requirements provided by each role defined in
    phase 3 as one or several applications to be installed on the sensor nodes. The
    phase takes as input the RAT, the SeNTA, and the software requirements specific
    to the application under development and makes decisions with regard to: • The
    most suitable operating system on top on which to program the WSN application:
    There are different OSes specifically designed for sensor nodes but there is no
    optimal solution for all application domains. Application requirements are essential
    in deciding which OS to use, and so is the programmer experience. This decision
    is relevant because it determines the choice of the programming language in which
    the application will be written (Mottola and Picco, 2010, Sugihara and Gupta,
    2008), as well as the development and simulation tools that are available. Additionally,
    not all OSes support the complete range of hardware platforms. Some of the OSes
    built specifically for sensor nodes are TinyOS TinyOS (Hill, 2003), Contiki (Dunkels
    et al., 2004), Mantis (Bhatti et al., 2005), and LiteOS (Cao et al., 2008). TinyOS
    is considered the de facto standard OS. It has the lowest footprint and it is
    a good fit for reactive systems; it has also been ported to most commercial sensor
    nodes. Contiki is probably the second most widely used OS and, differently from
    TinyOS, it is generally used for long running computations. • The network protocol
    stack, which depends on the application requirements: this choice is critical
    because it directly affects the network lifetime. Therefore designers must decide
    about whether the existing protocols are a good choice for their needs or whether
    they must develop their own protocols. OSes provide a wide range of network protocol
    implementations which high-level applications may use. Some typical examples are
    localization, routing, and different Medium Access Control (MAC) strategies. Among
    them there are several energy-aware protocols which increase the network lifetime.
    • The distribution of tasks among cooperating nodes: each node carries out a partial
    task while global functionality is achieved by the coordinated activity of all
    of the nodes. Our methodology is not explicitly recommending any specific implementation
    choice. The contribution of this phase is to collect the set of actions that developers
    should take into account before building the implementation. The output of this
    step is an application – or a set of applications – developed for each zone taking
    into account the requirements from phase 3 and the choices made in this step.
    As a typical phase of the software process, the documentation related to design
    and implementation should also be generated. 5.5. Phase 5: simulation and evaluation
    Testing WSN applications is a critical process that must be included in its life
    cycle. Obtaining successful results in this step is mandatory before deploying
    the WSN. Both the source and binary code obtained in the previous phase are necessary
    to carry out white box and black box testing. Users involved in this phase are
    developers who have knowledge about the existing OS-specific simulators. Two of
    the most relevant simulators for sensor networks are TOSSIM (Levis et al., 2003)
    and Avrora (Titzer, 2005). The former is mainly conceived for debugging applications
    in a controlled and repeatable environment such as a PC, but it does not emulate
    the node platform; neither timing nor energy consumption are simulated. The latter
    is intended for a more reliable simulation due to the fact that it emulates the
    hardware of real platforms – specifically Mica2 and MicaZ – and it provides support
    for measuring energy consumption and execution time. In our view simulating an
    application consists of evaluating the application in a software controlled environment
    which emulates the target hardware platform where the application is going to
    be installed. The following steps should be carried out in this phase: • Select
    the most appropriate simulator. Frequently, simulators for sensor nodes support
    only a limited set of hardware platforms and operating systems. Therefore, the
    selection of the simulator will depend on the chosen platform. Moreover, not all
    simulators provide information about relevant features such as energy consumption.
    • Design the set of tests that allow requirements validation. Both black box and
    white box testings should be considered. Black box testing serves to check the
    correct functioning of the applications with respect to requirements. For example:
    Is node 4 from zone C sampling the sensors of temperature and humidity every 60
    s (Ps)? or Is node 223 receiving commands from the base station?. White testing
    is used to verify that the source code is robust, reliable, and correct. For example,
    it is important to validate that sensor readings are adequate for the data type
    assigned and that the node has enough RAM to store the n readings between two
    sending periods. • Evaluate the performance, most importantly the energy consumption.
    These tests must help to identify which are the nodes that will first deplete
    their batteries within each zone, and based on that, to better estimate the network
    lifetime and take the appropriate actions when depletion occurs. Simulation is
    useful in discovering mismatches between the implementation and the functional
    and non-functional requirements. In this phase faults and errors are detected
    and can be corrected before deployment. Fig. 7 shows the results for energy consumption
    that we obtained using the Avrora simulator for a monitoring application with
    no energy-aware routing protocol – on the left side – vs. the same application
    using an energy saving technique – on the right side. This specific technique
    consists of reducing the time that the sensor node spends in listening state,
    which is the main energy consumer. The right side of Fig. 7 shows a significant
    increase in node lifetime; for two batteries of 3000 mAh each, it was estimated
    that nodes could theoretically live for 16 months1 for a 64 s sampling (Ps). However,
    the same protocol without an energy saving strategy only lives several days. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Estimation of node lifetime using a routing
    protocol without energy saving (on the left) and with energy awareness strategy
    (on the right) for different battery capacities and sampling frequencies. Based
    on our own experience, energy saving techniques are always desirable, especially
    for unaccessible scenarios where battery replacement is difficult or even impossible.
    On the other hand, employing these techniques could lead to a reduction of the
    delivery packet ratio and therefore to many lost packages. Despite this drawback
    and taking into account the results from Fig. 7, our methodology strongly encourages
    employing energy saving techniques. The output of this phase will feed back into
    the input of the phase 4 until the simulation and testing phase finds no more
    errors and gives successful results in terms of energy. The process finishes when
    the desired version of applications is obtained. The output of this phase is the
    set of documents that describe the tests that were performed, their results, and
    the degree to which they fulfill the requirements. 5.6. Phase 6: deployment and
    exploitation This phase consists of the exploitation of the WSN during its lifetime.
    The phase requires first the installation and the physical deployment of the network
    in order to proceed with its start-up. The inputs of this phase are the SeNTA,
    the RAT, and the applications built in phase 4; the output is a deployment and
    an operation manual. The users involved in this process are WSN supervisors and
    farmers. The deployment process is split in two main tasks: 1. Install the elements
    of the WSN: This task consists of a process for manually downloading the corresponding
    executable code into the associated microcontroller of the mote. During this process,
    a unique identifier is assigned to each node according to SeNTA. The applications
    developed for each role are installed into the corresponding sensor nodes according
    to RAT. 2. Physically locate the sensor nodes in the field: In this second task
    the users place the sensor nodes on the terrain according to their physical coordinates
    obtained from SeNTA. Once this operation is completed, the motes are activated
    and the WSN application starts running. After deployment is done, the system will
    be exploited for the maximum period of time. The exploitation process consists
    of the following tasks: 1. Data coming from the WSN reaches the base station and
    it is stored in a database. 2. Data in the database is processed and presented
    to users. For this purpose, an assistant application could be used in order to
    help extracting and presenting the relevant up-to-date information obtained from
    the vineyards. 3. The WSN supervisors use the information provided by the assistant
    application to take the most appropriate actions in case of unexpected situations
    or problems. Note that these corrective tasks correspond to the phase of maintenance,
    which is accomplished in parallel to the exploitation phase. Although the assistant
    application could be a traditional local application, an Internet application
    is preferred because it has important advantages such as the mobility and portability
    among different types of platforms (e.g. smartphones, PDAs, mobile phones, laptops).
    Nowadays every platform has several web browsers that can be used to access information
    from the Internet. As a recommendation based on our experience, an adequate interface
    for this kind of tools should provide the following views: • Line or bar graphics
    to show the evolution of the values being measured by the WSN along logical time:
    this level of detail provides accurate information about the measured variables
    during a specific period of time. • Color map (or graph) to represent the last
    state monitored by the WSN: this is just a snapshot of the last state in the representation
    using lines or bars. • List of alarms that has been fired: when a value measured
    by the WSN is above a maximum or below a minimum threshold then the application
    must send a message to the maintenance people. Both the values that triggered
    the alarm and the rule which decided to trigger it should be presented to the
    user. We have developed two web tools which help with the exploitation and maintenance
    (as explained later) phases and which provide a simple yet powerful interface
    for general-purpose data analysis: • Sensitive – A graphic editor utility: it
    helps users to analyze the information represented as graphics. It works as follows:
    it connects with the database, gets the data in form of numerical values from
    a table, and it draws it as a graphic with lines or bars. Fig. 8 shows an example
    of the values obtained from the vineyard, presented as different types of graphs.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Sensitive: it is represented the temperature
    read from several sensors (identified by sensor node id) during a logical period
    of time (given by sequence number). • Sensonic – A panel with the critical graphs
    that need to be inspected: it allows users to add one or more of the graphs generated
    with Sensitive into a panel where they can collect several graphics related (for
    example, from the same vineyard or zone). Different panels can be used, each one
    with a set of graphics. Fig. 9 shows the main screen of this application. Any
    graph obtained from Sensitive can be added to the panel by simply getting the
    URL associated with the data displayed as a graph. The Sensonic tool has a refresh
    parameter which allows the user to update the information displayed by Sensonic
    every predefined time value. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. View
    of Sensonic where the Sensitive graphics can be added and removed. The deployment
    and exploitation manual consists of recording the tasks performed in this phase
    as well as the problems that were found. For each problem we include its graphical
    representation if it exists – for example, the graphical representation of the
    alarm – as well as the actions that need to be taken to avoid or correct the problem.
    During the exploitation phase the manual is continuously adapted; it must record
    new problems along with their symptoms and the corrective actions that solve each
    problem. It also records the actions that allow to optimize the exploitation process.
    5.7. Phase 7: WSN maintenance Although sensor networks are optimized to maximize
    their lifetime and intended to work in an autonomous fashion, they do require
    maintenance tasks, which are performed concurrently with the exploitation phase.
    The inputs of the maintenance phase are the SeNTA, the RAT, and the deployment
    and operation manual. The output is a maintenance manual that will be updated
    by WSN supervisors. This manual provides the description of all the maintenance
    tasks that need to be performed, in a similar way that the operational manual
    provides the tasks to be performed during the exploitation process. The general
    maintenance process consists of the following two steps: (1) problem detection:
    the users inspect the data generated from the WSN in order to detect anomalies.
    For example, an alarm of temperature has been received and it needs to be treated
    properly – an unusual condition happened such as a frost or a fire; (2) problem
    resolution: the users decide what corrective actions are most suitable in the
    current context and how to apply them in order to efficiently solve the problem.
    The maintenance process is continuously updating the maintenance manual; it records
    all the problems that were found, their symptoms and the procedure that needs
    to be applied to solve them. This manual should be reviewed in order to know how
    similar problems were solved in the past. Additionally, the maintenance manual
    includes the list of rules that check the state of the WSN and signal any abnormal
    conditions, for instance values – energy level, sensor readings – outside the
    recommended range. To accomplish this phase, a computer application is required
    to manage the records and help process a potentially large amount of data. There
    are two kinds of complementary strategies that can be employed for maintenance
    tasks: • Preventive: The goal is replacing an element (e.g. sensor nodes, batteries,
    sensor boards) before the typical problems associated with this element occur.
    This includes tasks like the replacement of batteries near depletion or the substitution
    of monitoring elements before achieving the expected Mean Time To Failure (MTTF).
    • Reactive: In this case the goal is to quickly adapt the WSN to non-planned changes;
    it includes tasks such as repairing the failing elements, maintaining a completely
    connected network, adapting the WSN to the new requirements – for example via
    dynamic reprogramming of the network – and following through with disaster plans.
    For preventive maintenance SeNTA is used to compute the MTTF (or expected lifetime)
    for each element. With this information, the WSN supervisors update an event calendar
    which records the MTTF of each element. Once the element is replaced, the calendar
    is updated by changing the timestamp related with the new element. This process
    is also recorded into the maintenance manual. The maintenance tasks with regard
    to monitoring are performed by the same applications that we discussed in phase
    6, i.e. Sensitive and Sensonic. The main difference is that this step is targeted
    to WSN supervisors rather than the farmers. This means that these tools will be
    mostly used for control and decision making purposes rather than for visualizing
    the application data. For example, the exploitation utility Sensitive displays
    the temperature values from the vineyard to be monitored. Sensitive will also
    be used by WSN supervisors to detect and control that the temperature measured
    by the sensors is inside a recommended range; if a temperature threshold is exceeded,
    it is probably the case that sensor is failing or there is some extreme climatic
    condition present (e.g. frost, fire). Other example is the knowledge of the battery
    state of each sensor. The supervisors should accomplish the maintenance actions
    to check and solve the problem when possible; in the case of batteries depletion,
    supervisors should proceed with their replacement; in the case of values above
    or under the specified thresholds, supervisors should first discard false positive,
    or otherwise to take corrective actions. An example is shown in Fig. 10, which
    shows zone B of the parcel. One of the mandatory maintenance actions that need
    to carried out is the replacement of batteries. Monitoring provides us with information
    about the battery level of each sensor node in zone B at each moment. This can
    be done according to a simple color code: green for voltages above 2.5 V, yellow
    for voltages above 1.7 V, and red for depleted batteries – indicating that they
    must be substituted. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Representation
    for the battery state of motes on zone B. 6. Contributions We consider the main
    contributions of this work to be the following: • A methodology which collects
    the set of requirements that need to be addressed by WSN-based applications for
    the agricultural domain. Each step of the methodology discusses the different
    choices that can be made among a set of recommended options, along with their
    advantages and weaknesses. • Through the usage of wireless sensor networks and
    the definition of best practices used by farmers and enologists our methodology
    leads to an improved production process reflected in both the quality and quantity
    of the wine. • Our methodology helps increase the productivity of developing WSN
    applications for agricultural monitoring and control by way of reusing domain-specific
    knowledge. The application that we developed for the COPA project was deployed
    in a vineyard located in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) and was in use for a long
    period of time. The terrain has a few hectares and it is almost flat; the soil
    is mainly limestone. The farmers were cultivating white and red grape and were
    selectively using irrigation on different zones within the terrain. Given these
    requirements the goal was to improve the quality of the wine. The parameters that
    we measured were soil humidity, temperature, and luminosity. We discovered that
    for this type of soil, the humidity level is especially important to be able to
    increase the production of grapes. The humidity level measured by the sensor network
    allowed to choose an optimal policy for water control within the irrigated vineyards.
    According to our measurements, humidity had a high spatial variability while temperature
    did not suffer strong variations mainly due to the flat topography of the terrain.
    Another relevant factor of direct impact for the quality of the wine is the alcohol
    level in the grapes. This parameter must not exceed a threshold which is fixed
    by the local Farmers Federation. This means that alcohol level (alcohol by volume)
    should range between threshold ±2°, otherwise the farmers are economically penalized.
    Our focus therefore was to control the amount of sunlight received by the vines
    in order to control the sugar in the grapes; we did this by determining the ideal
    time for harvesting. Table 7 shows various alcohol levels for different grapes
    and irrigation policies. Table 7. Production of grapes for different types of
    vineyards and grapes. Type of irrigation Type of grape Production per vine Alcohol
    (alcohol/volume) Non-irrigated White 3 kg 11.5°/12° Irrigated White 10/12 kg 10°
    Non-irrigated Red 2 kg 15° Irrigated Red 6/7 kg 15° To evaluate our methodology
    in a real scenario we developed COPA following this methodology. This process
    confirmed that our methodology recommended most of the tasks that were needed
    in the development process. Some of them were tasks extracted from our study of
    real works; others had been added by us. Additionally, several new actions had
    to be incorporated into the methodology during the exploitation process. As an
    example, we decided to introduce alarms to signal unusual conditions that need
    to be treated. Alarms are generated by nodes when unexpected conditions such as
    frosts are detected in the field. This type of functionality extends the usefulness
    of the WSN applications beyond purely the monitoring process to provide capabilities
    of basic problem detection and real-time decision making. The applications development
    process proved to be fast and cost effective; moreover, during the exploitation
    period the maintenance process turned out to be more straightforward. 7. Conclusions
    Agricultural monitoring is one of the WSN applications with important benefits
    to the farmers. This article presents a methodology that can successfully guide
    the process of building monitoring applications for agricultural production based
    on WSN technology. The methodology covers the complete life cycle of applications,
    from requirements to maintenance. The motivation for describing a methodology
    is to collect a set of best-practices and procedures that are found in the literature
    and bridge the gap between how applications are built in practice and a robust,
    customizable approach. We validate our methodology by using it to develop the
    COPA project. The methodology we present in this paper focuses on vineyards monitoring
    as a reference case, but it applies directly to other agricultural scenarios with
    minor changes. Our methodology consists of seven phases, each of which describes
    a challenge, takes as input, produces an output, and is carried out by a set of
    users; each phase collects the generic actions to be performed in that step but
    also includes specific actions that should be considered depending on the special
    requirements of every scenario. The seven phases of the methodology represent
    the backbone of WSN agricultural monitoring applications and provide a solid foundation
    on which applications can be built with significant productivity gains and facility
    of maintenance. Based on these advantages we believe that our methodology will
    contribute to the adoption of the WSN technology in the agricultural field. Acknowledgement

    rights and content Abstract: Recent technological and commercial developments
    make cloud computing an affordable, scalable, and highly-available platform technology.
    Meanwhile, precision agriculture is showing its potentials by improving agricultural
    operations through better data-driven decision making. Nevertheless, further development
    of precision agriculture requires better technology and tools to process data
    efficiently at a reasonable cost, and to translate the data to better decisions
    and actions in a field. We developed a framework for cloud-based Decision Support
    and Automation systems that can acquire data from various sources, synthesize
    application-specific decisions, and control field devices from the Cloud. A distinctive
    feature of our framework is its extensible software architecture: decision modules
    can be added and/or configured for a specific operation. The platform features
    a device-agnostic frontend that can process incoming data in different formats
    and semantics. Finally, the platform incorporates software-defined control, a
    new software design paradigm we proposed to enable versatile and safe control
    of field devices from a cloud computing platform. An early version of the system
    has been developed and tested with support from the USDA. Previous article in

    Abstract Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) based sensing systems have improved
    capabilities to precisely monitor environmental conditions. Plants are sessile
    organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding
    environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation,
    and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems)
    of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision
    agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication
    aspects of the WSN''s, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components
    for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured.
    The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access,
    and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed
    sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a
    framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement
    (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing
    system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities
    such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement
    estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management. Also, the modeling
    techniques were integrated with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for
    addressing water management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.

    Sensor Network 1. Introduction Agriculture is an important sector which drives
    the economy and food security of many nations. Various kinds of sensing systems
    are emerging in the area of precision agriculture in which the current trend is
    towards the design and development of cost-effective, energy efficient and fault
    tolerant Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for various monitoring and management
    applications. The focus of recent research is on improving and sustaining the
    productivity of different crops. Current advances in Information Communication
    and Dissemination Technologies (ICDT''s) have well proven their ability in information
    and knowledge dissemination. Globally, the ICDT initiatives in the field of agriculture
    have shown that with accurate monitoring and analysis of crop/weather parameters,
    it is possible to judiciously allocate available resources in agriculture (Nash
    et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010, Prabhakar et al., 2010, Li et al., 2011). Several
    WSNs are being deployed in many countries, and have a wide range of applications
    in agriculture, such as: • Crop/pest disease monitoring (Riquelme et al., 2009,
    Tripathy et al., 2011). • Crop water management (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, uAgri C-DAC, 2013, Sudharsan et al., 2012, Ojha et al., 2015). •
    Crop yield prediction (Honda et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011). • Weather
    based advisory services (IMD, 2016, ISRO, 2015, mKRISHI, 2016). In general, several
    dissemination systems are currently being deployed, which enables the discovery,
    access and retrieval of various meteorological, biophysical, ocean and coastal
    water quality parameters. This kind of systems can be divided into two types:
    (1) Stovepipe or standalone systems which provide sensor details (i.e. metadata,
    observations and measurements) in their own formats (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, Riquelme et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011, Sudharsan et al.,
    2012, Tripathy et al., 2011, Ojha et al., 2015). (2) Interoperable systems and
    platforms which implement commonly agreed standards for sensor metadata, observation
    and measurement representation (Korduan et al., 2004, Murakami et al., 2007, Mizoguchi
    et al., 2008, Nash et al., 2009, Durbha et al., 2010, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Bröring
    et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2011b, Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Jazayeri et al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015, Du et al., 2016,
    Geipel et al., 2016). However, there is a paucity of standards driven, interoperable
    systems in the Agriculture domain that severely impedes the discovery and access
    of data across Agri-WSN''s. For example, to answer a question such as “What is
    the crop water requirement during a particular crop growth stage?, there is a
    need for weather parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, solar
    radiation, wind speed, and rainfall. from weather station and crop growth stage
    information from field/cultivation practice. It''s hard for users from diverse
    areas of study to understand the exact lineage of the collected data i.e. how
    the measurement is transformed into an observation. It is possible that the measurement
    has gone through various transformations (e.g. application calibration curves),
    which can also give rise to heterogeneous data formats (Comma Separated Values
    (CSV), Tab Separated Values (TSV), EXtensible Markup Language (XML), etc.). With
    this ever increasing spread of WSNs, there is a need for standard sets of specifications
    (both syntactic and semantic) and encodings to bring multiple sensor networks
    on a common platform (Durbha et al., 2010, Bröring et al., 2011a, Patil et al.,
    2012, Liang and Huang, 2013). Which enables the development of geographically
    distributed systems that are standardized at the semantic (Folmer and Verhoosel,
    2011, Compton et al., 2012) and Syntactic (Bröring et al., 2011b) level for regional
    agricultural practices planning (i.e. irrigation, pest/disease management, etc.).
    The initiatives such as, FOODIE: Farm-Oriented Open Data in Europe (Esbri et al.,
    2014), GeoCENS: Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for the World-Wide Sensor Web (Liang
    and Huang, 2013), Sensor Asia (Mizoguchi et al., 2008) and Service Oriented Architecture
    for sensor data discovery in agriculture (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Chen et al., 2015), are some of the attempts towards facilitating the interoperability
    and sensor data discovery. These studies have shown the utility of Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) specified Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standards for sensor
    data access from geographically distributed sensing systems (OGC, 2016, Bröring
    et al., 2012, Bröring et al., 2011a). Keeping in view of the requirement of a
    sensing and analysis platform in the ever increasing precision agriculture area,
    the specific objectives of this paper are: • to design a sensor platform (hardware)
    with integrated SWE architecture for precision agro-meteorological monitoring
    • to integrate the OGC''s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to achieve interoperability
    and scalability of heterogeneous sensing systems • to demonstrate the utility
    of such interoperable sensing systems for agro-meteorological monitoring and potential
    evapotranspiration estimation. This paper is organized into various sections:
    Section 2 describes the design of sensor platform (hardware) and integration of
    sensor web architecture (software) for agriculture monitoring. A case study on
    the application of interoperable sensor system for crop water requirement analysis
    is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents results and discussions on the integrated
    sensor web system and its utility for crop water requirement analysis. Section
    5 concludes with a comparison between current SWE initiatives for precision agriculture
    and a description of the future work. 2. Materials and methods The sensor web
    enablement framework of the agro-meteorological observation and analysis platform
    consists of three layers: (1) Sensing systems, (2) Sensor Web Enablement (middleware)
    and (3) Web based visualization layer (Fig. 1). Below is a description of each
    component of the framework shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image

    The sensing systems layer comprise of the network of geographically distributed
    heterogeneous sensing systems (i.e. a set of standalone and interoperable sensing
    platforms). 2.1.1. Development of an interoperable sensing platform An interoperable
    wireless sensing system (henceforth called as SenseTube) has been designed using
    low powered System on Chip (SoC) single board computer (i.e. Raspberry Pi/R-Pi,
    Raspberry Pi (2016)) as a data collection and dissemination platform (Fig. 2a)
    (Sawant et al., 2015). Multiple sensor nodes (child nodes) can be interfaced with
    the SenseTube base station. Download : Download high-res image (226KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Interoperable sensing system, (a) system hardware
    block diagram and (b) interoperable sensor data communication architecture. Field
    level node to node communication has been established using Wi-Fi (i.e. IEEE 108.11)
    communication protocol (Fig. 2b) (Sawant et al., 2015). The General Purpose Input
    Output (GPIO) pins of SoC hardware are utilized to connect the Analog to Digital
    Converter (ADC), and through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) the data is collected.
    The ADC has eight analog channels for connecting external sensors. The resolution
    of ADC is 10 bit thereby facilitating to interface analog sensors such as temperature,
    and humidity. The digital (raw) voltage observations collected from ADC are converted
    into physical measurements and stored onboard. The sensor sampling and polling
    frequency can be adjusted through the configuration interface. The default sampling
    interval has been set to fifteen minutes and polling frequency to one hour. The
    sensing system comprises of sensor node collecting observations at fixed interval.
    The sensing system can be configured as a base station and child node. When set
    as base station sensor node receive observations and measurements from distributed
    child nodes and transmit over remote address/service. The child node configuration
    provides a capability to receive and locally transfer sensor observations and
    measurements to the base station. Table 1 lists sensing system configurations
    for interoperable sensing system (SenseTube). Table 1. Sensing system configuration.
    SN Configuration parameter System configuration 1. Resolution Analog to Digital
    Convertor (ADC) 10 bit 2. Number of analog channels 8 channels 3. Sampling frequency
    15 min 4. Polling frequency 1 h Existing infrastructure of Internet Service Providers
    (ISP''s) has been utilized in the present study for internet connectivity. Normally,
    the ISP''s dynamically assign Internet Protocol (IP) address to the field based
    sensing system, this configuration brings out two cost-effective approaches to
    communicate with the data processing layer: (1) through Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) server configured on fixed IP addressed remote/cloud service platform (Liu,
    2000), (2) using cost-effective cloud service (e.g. ownCloud, Dropbox, etc.) which
    is easily accessible to both the field based sensing system and remote/cloud based
    data processing server (ownCloud, 2016, Dropbox, 2016). Direct reliable and secure
    access to SWE sensing platform facilitate the on-board data processing (i.e. estimate
    reference evapotranspiration, daily minimum/maximum temperature, humidity, etc.).
    The remote/cloud based data processing server can access the field nodes using
    SWE requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation detailed
    information about communication between field based interoperable sensing systems,
    and sensor data storage and data analysis layer (middleware) is described in the
    subsequent section. 2.1.2. Existing standalone sensing systems Various studies
    have provided methodologies for SWE of standalone (the sensing systems which provide
    sensor details in their formats) sensing systems (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015). A wrapper (a piece of software
    to transform sensor observations) is necessary to make standalone sensing system
    into OGC standardized, interoperable sensing system. The method for design of
    Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) proposed by Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012 has been used for regional Automatic Weather Station (AWS). This methodology
    facilitates the integration of standalone AWS into interoperable sensor web layer.
    2.2. Sensor web enablement layer (Middleware) The SWE layer provides sensor data
    polling and processing facility. The OGC standards such as SOS, Observations and
    Measurements (O&M), Sensor Model Language (Sensor ML), and Web Processing Service
    (WPS) are used to establish communication between sensing systems and client interface.
    2.2.1. Background 2.2.1.1. Sensor model language The Sensor ML has the primary
    objective to provide a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes
    and processing components associated with the measurement and post-measurement
    transformation of observations. This includes sensors and actuators as well as
    computational processes applied pre- and post-measurement (Botts and Robin, 2007).
    In sensor web enablement architecture shown in Fig. 1, SensorML encoding is used
    to define each sensor of the sensing system. The sensor details include observed
    property, transducer information, manufacturer, geographical location, etc. The
    detailed description about sensor Observations and Measurements is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.2.1.2. Observations and measurements The OGC O&M standard
    specifies an XML implementation for the OGC and ISO Observations and Measurements
    (O&M) conceptual model, including a schema for sampling features. The O&M encoding
    is an essential dependency for the SOS interface standard as it defines XML schemas
    for observations and for features involved in sampling when making observations
    (Cox, 2011). The O&M specifications are used to formulate the response to the
    GetObservation request which is comprised of observed properties and constrained
    by observation schema definitions (Fig. 1). The GetObservation request states
    the feature of interest with begin and end timestamp and observed properties.
    The details of SOS component is described in subsequent section. 2.2.1.3. Sensor
    observation service The OGC SOS standard defines a web service interface which
    allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as representations of observed
    features. Further, this standard defines means to register new sensors and to
    remove existing ones. Also, it defines operations to insert new sensor observations
    (Bröring et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2012, Na and Priest, 2007). The SOS stores
    time series sensor observations in a relational database and facilitates the formulation
    of response for various requests (DescribeSensor, GetObservation, InsertObservation,
    etc.). Fig. 1 shows the integration of all sensor observations into SOS relational
    database. 2.2.1.4. Sensor event service (SES) The SES provides the user an interface
    to access sensor data and measurements (Chandy and Schulte, 2007, Echterhoff and
    Ingo, 2010). The SES facilitates user to subscribe for the particular sensor or
    set threshold value/s and enable notifications about selected phenomenon (e.g.
    event notifications are triggered on depletion of soil moisture to the set threshold
    i.e. allowable depletion). It also provides methods to dynamically add new sensors
    and send notifications to the service (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (108KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Architecture of sensor event
    notification service. 2.2.1.5. Web processing service The WPS interface standard
    provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses)
    for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, the daily mean of
    sensor observation time series, etc. The standard also defines how a client can
    request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled
    (Mueller and Pross, 2015). Fig. 1 shows the core WPS requests i.e. GetCapabilities,
    DescribeProcess, and ExecuteProcess. The GetCapabilities request provides information
    about available processes (e.g. a process to estimate root-zone soil moisture
    storage based on soil moisture sensor observations). The DescribeProcess provides
    details about selected process. For example, the process for estimation of root-zone
    soil moisture storage requires, input (i.e. time series observations from soil
    moisture in date and float data type) and output (i.e. estimated soil moisture
    storage time series of date and float data type) parameters. The ExecuteProcess
    handles actual computation defined by process and output results are provided
    in response. The detailed description of each component of SWE layer is described
    in subsequent section. 2.2.2. Architecture of SWE layer The Architecture of SWE
    layer comprises of, an SWE web services module (e.g. Sensor Observation Service
    version 1.0) for data query and access, Sensor Alerts and Notification (e.g. Sensor
    Event Notification Service) based on pre-defined parameter thresholds and rules
    and Sensor data archival module. These various components run in parallel with
    the supporting functionalities (Fig. 1) as discussed below: SWE Web services module
    maps the details about each sensing system using Sensor ML. The O&M standards
    are used for encoding the observations (e.g. observed values, observed property,
    references to feature and procedure, time stamps, etc.). For example in case of
    air temperature sensor, O&M standards are used to represent parameters such as
    observed values (i.e. actual sensor observations), observed property (i.e. identification
    of observed property air temperature), feature of interest and procedure (i.e.
    identification of associated feature with procedure), time stamp (i.e. time at
    which observation is collected), and offerings. The user interactions are handled
    through SOS requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation
    (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (530KB) Download : Download full-size

    of sensor web enabled service platform. The SOS GetObservation request specifies
    the sensor offering (i.e. sensor system), O&M sampling time, observed property
    and response format (Fig. 5a). The GetObservation response returns the location
    of the feature of interest (i.e. sensor) and observation collection for specified
    time interval (Fig. 5b). Details about Sensor Alerts and Notification are discussed
    in subsequent section. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download

    SOS GetObservation response. Sensor Alerts and Notification provides capabilities
    to report the sensor observations over email, social network site such as Twitter
    (2016). The main advantages of this functionality are (a) observations from sensing
    system are available on user''s social web page/account without maintaining a
    separate database on cloud service and (b) as observations are directly posted/updated
    on social media the latency in information dissemination are significantly reduced.
    The critical information about events such as sudden increase in temperature,
    and drop in relative humidity below a certain level can be effectively notified
    to the user''s/stakeholders thereby ensuring the initiation of quick response
    for mitigation of effects of these events. Social network tweet capability is
    configured to one hour in sensing system (Fig. 4). In future, the event notification
    service can be improved by incorporating the OGC publish/subscribe interface standard
    (Braeckel et al., 2016). The data from heterogeneous sensing systems is collected
    and organized in SOS complaint format by sensor data polling process. To continuously
    update the state of service the data polling process executes SOS request GetCapabilities
    and InsertObservation. As internet connectivity (GSM/GPRS network) at the test
    site (remote villages) widely varies, the process of sensor data polling is independently
    maintained, which ensures communication with all remote sensor systems. The data
    polling frequency can be configured to any duration, and it has been set to one
    hour in the present study. The size of text data transferred per sensing system
    during each polling event ranges between 1 and 1.5 kilobytes (Fig. 4). The request
    specific algorithms required for sensor data processing (e.g. daily minimum and
    maximum temperature calculation, reference evapotranspiration estimation, etc.)
    are maintained using WPS. In this study, existing implementations of the OGC SWE
    and WPS provided by OSGeo community are used (OSGeo, 2017). The OGC SOS standard
    version 1.0 implementation provided by istSOS is used, the architecture is also
    tested with OGC SOS standard version 2.0 (istSOS, 2017). Major differences identified
    between the SOS version 1.0 and 2.0 during preliminary tests of SenseTube interoperable
    sensing and analysis platform are: (a) each observation offering is limited to
    associated with only a single procedure (i.e. one to one constraint). In SenseTube
    platform, multiple procedures (e.g. for temperature sensor associated ADC values
    and observations) were stored as a single offering which caused issues while retrieving
    only the sensor observations. This improved specification for observation offerings
    in SOS 2.0 facilitated identification of correct procedure and removed ambiguity
    in obtaining the observations. (b) The improved specification for temporal and
    spatial filters added in the GetObservation request of SOS 2.0 has facilitated
    the effective retrieval of sensor observations. For example, to estimate reference
    ET for long duration (i.e. quarterly/monthly time interval) would require the
    retrieval of a large number of sensor observations. The updated temporal filters
    in SOS 2.0 enable to divide the request into smaller chunks thereby reducing memory
    overloads. The spatial filters are used to identify the nearest AWS and SenseTube
    observations to validate the observed and model estimated soil moisture and temperature.
    (c) In SOS 2.0, the response format conversion (serialization) is loosely coupled
    and can be moved from server side to client side; this helps in reducing processing
    overhead. In the long-term deployment with very high sensor sampling frequency
    this improved specification would help in reducing the energy footprint of SenseTube
    sensing and analysis platform. The OGC WPS version 2.0 implementation PyWPS 4.0
    is used (PyWPS, 2017). The SOS and WPS implementations are selected mainly because
    of lightweight Python based implementation on single board computer. The proposed
    methodology provides the on-board implementation of SWE and attempts towards independent
    hardware or software implementation. The web/mobile user interacts with SWE layer
    through SOS and WPS requests handled by the interoperable thin client. The detailed
    explanation about a web based client and SWE service platform is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.3. Web based visualization layer A web based thin client
    has been designed to establish seamless communication between the SWE processes
    and user/stakeholder. In this study thin client has been designed for user e.g.
    farmer, researcher, etc. The OGC specified standards such as SOS, WPS and third
    party Web Map Service (WMS) are the primary access point of the web based thin
    client. The service architecture can also facilitate machine to machine interaction
    through process sharing and seamless data access (this study do not cover the
    details about machine to machine communication). Designed thin client acts as
    a gateway interface to the SWE architecture, and it hides the complexities of
    sensing systems from the end user (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    (a) Details about sensing system and SOS capabilities, (b) and (c) Sensor observations
    in chart and table format and (d) Sensor observations overlaid on third party
    WMS layer. Fig. 6 shows snapshots of modules of web based thin client, (1) details
    about sensing system and capabilities, (2) sensor observations in a chart and
    table format, and (3) sensor observations over third party WMS layer (e.g. Open
    Street Map, Google Map, Bing Map, etc.). The client is interoperable with any
    SOS, WPS based sensing system. The first module provides basic information about
    service platform facilitating the details about geographic location, manufacturer,
    the number of sensors on sensing system, etc. (Fig. 6a). This information leads
    to the further query about details of each procedure and identifies the exact
    feature of interest e.g. air temperature, relative humidity, etc. Also, it provides
    details about each observed property and its associated sensor lineage e.g. minimum/maximum
    range, observed property, time of first and recent observation insert into SOS,
    etc. The sensor data access and visualization are important for any sensing system,
    particularly to the novice farming community. Sensor data observation module of
    the interoperable client comprises filter (e.g. date, time, sensor id, etc.) based
    sensor data querying mechanism. The user can select any sensor from selected sensing
    system and visualize the observations in table and chart format, and also facilitate
    the sensor data download in comma separated variable (CSV) format (Fig. 6b and
    c). The sensor observations are overlaid on third party WMS layer to understand
    the geospatial location and details of observed phenomenon (Fig. 6d). We have
    designed a web based thin client (i.e. interoperable web client) in PHP and Python
    programming language and it''s available for download on GitHub URL''s https://github.com/suryakant54321/sos-client-in-php
    and https://github.com/suryakant54321/Python-SOS-Client. A case study on agro-meteorological
    monitoring and potential evapotranspiration estimation have been discussed below
    to understand the need and utility of interoperable sensing systems. 3. A case
    study on application of SOA for citrus crop water requirement estimation A major
    Citrus (Orange/Mandarin) growing region in the semi-arid tropical region was selected
    to demonstrate the need and utility of SWE in agriculture. The details about study
    area, deployment of interoperable sensing system and estimation of agro-meteorological
    parameters are described in subsequent section. 3.1. Study area and field deployment
    of sensing system Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, India experiences severe climatic
    uncertainties (uneven rainfall and severe heat) thereby giving rise to crop failure.
    The area receives rainfall during southwest monsoon. The average annual rainfall
    ranges between 700 and 800 mm. The maximum temperature during summer recorded
    up to 46 °C while the minimum temperature during winter drops to about 5 °C (GSDA,
    2016). Wheat and Gram are major irrigated crops; Cotton, Jowar (Sorghum) and Toor
    (Pigeon Pea) are major non-irrigated crops; Orange, Cotton, and Groundnut are
    major cash crops cultivated in the region. The harvesting of Orange takes place
    in two fruiting seasons Ambiya (November-December) and Mrig (February-March).
    As per ground water resource estimates, Warud is categorized as one of the three
    over-exploited groundwater resources regions (tahsils) of Amravati district (CGWB,
    2007). The main reasons for selection of this study area to study the prospects
    of Sensor Web Enablement for irrigation management in agriculture are (a) the
    problem of ground water table depletion is more prominent in this region (NRAA,
    2011). (b) the groundwater is a major source of irrigation for Orange cultivation
    of this region and it is adversely affected due to improper irrigation practices
    (NRAA, 2011), (c) Orange crop diseases have a very close relation with poor drainage
    and excess irrigation (Grimm and Timmer, 1981). The soil-borne crop disease infestation
    is caused due to unavailability of right information on stage-wise crop water
    requirement. For initial test deployment of sensing system Orange orchard from
    Nagziri village from Warud tahsil has been selected. The World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) guidelines for automatic weather station deployment are considered
    for sensor placement in SenseTube sensing system (WMO, 2012). Two each temperature
    and relative humidity sensors are placed at 5 m (above at top of canopy) and 2.5
    m (within the canopy) from ground. Two soil temperature and one soil moisture
    sensors are placed at 15, 30 and 30 cm depth, respectively at a radial distance
    of 5 m from the Orange tree. Remaining ADC channel was closed using pull-down
    resistor (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (212KB) Download : Download

    ease in wire connection and placement of entire module on the base structure.
    The sensor observations are continuously being polled using data polling process
    (Fig. 4) since the date of field deployment (16 Feb. 2014). To monitor the state
    of the sensing system, SES (sensor Twitter feed KrishiSense) has been configured
    to upload two sensor tweets per event. Considering the character restriction of
    a tweet, each event consists of timestamp and value of recorded phenomenon. The
    URL to access sensor system Twitter feed is “https://twitter.com/KrishiSense”.
    3.2. Reference evapotranspiration estimation Widely used reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) estimation equations i.e. FAO Penman-Monteith (ETo PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (ETo Harg) (Allen et al., 1998) were used in order to understand
    seasonal variation in crop water requirement of orange crop grown and to study
    the feasibility of SenseTube sensing system for field level agro-meteorological
    monitoring and analysis. ETo estimations were performed for both AWS and SenseTube
    weather observations. The equation for estimation of ETo by Penman-Monteith (Allen
    et al., 1998) method is given as, (1) where Δ is slope of saturation vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), Rn is net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), G is
    soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), Ta is mean daily air temperature at 2 m
    height (°C), U2 is wind speed at 2 m height (m/s), es is the saturation vapour
    pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapour pressure (kPa), (es − ea) is the saturation
    vapour pressure deficit (kPa) and γ is psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1). The
    equation for estimation of ETo by Hargreaves (Allen et al., 1998) method is given
    as, (2) where Tmean mean daily air temperature (°C), Tmax is maximum daily air
    temperature (°C), Tmin is minimum daily air temperature (°C) and Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm day−1). 4. Results and discussions The agro-meteorological observations
    recorded by SenseTube sensing system during one cropping season of Orange i.e.
    July 2014 to August 2015, locally known as Mrig (July-February) and Ambiya (March-October)
    flowering (locally called bahar), are used for the study. The sampling (for air
    temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture) and polling (data
    update to the remote server) frequency were set to fifteen minutes and one hour,
    respectively. In order to compare the performance of SenseTube sensing system,
    a commercially available Automatic Weather Station (AWS) was set in the study
    area. The AWS has been set up according to World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
    guidelines for automatic weather station installation (WMO, 2012). The spatial
    distance between both sensing systems is less than one kilometer. The daily variations
    in air temperature (°C) at test site are shown in Fig. 8. Ranges of daily minimum
    and maximum temperature at the test bed during the said period were observed to
    be 6.44–34.09 °C and 20.30–46.73 °C, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    by AWS. The composite plot in Fig. 10 shows daily soil temperature observed by
    SenseTube and rainfall events observed by AWS. The soil temperature at 30 cm depth
    varies between 23 °C and 32 °C. It can be observed that there is a steady change
    in soil temperature and rainfall events have very low impact on the change in
    soil temperature at depth of 30 cm. Observed soil temperature shows seasonality
    with the return period of the year which closely resembles with variations in
    surface air temperature. Fig. 11 shows daily volumetric soil moisture at 30 cm
    depth observed by soil moisture sensor mounted on SenseTube. The variations in
    soil moisture are observed to be corresponding rainfall events. The minor variations
    in soil moisture during the absence of rainfall event are caused by irrigation
    events. In selected citrus orchard drip irrigation systems are functional during
    the crop growth period. The volumetric minimum and maximum soil moisture content
    were 12.04% and 48.77%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (445KB)

    are available, whereas ETo Harg was obtained with AWS and SenseTube system as
    the necessary parameters are limited and observed by both AWS and SenseTube for
    comparison. The results show that for most of the period SenseTube based ETo Harg
    underestimates than ETo PM (Fig. 12). The close vicinity of crop canopy and variations
    in field level relative humidity may have caused overestimates of SenseTube based
    ETo Harg. Download : Download high-res image (948KB) Download : Download full-size

    proposed SWE hardware and software architecture has unique features over existing
    implementations. The major advantages of proposed SWE architecture are, • Scalability:
    the proposed sensor web enablement architecture based on heterogeneous sensing
    systems provides the ability to seamlessly connect with multiple sensor nodes.
    • On the fly data processing: dense observations of agro-meteorological parameters
    with seamless data access facilitate important decisions regarding irrigation
    interval and depth. • Distributed computing: design of web enabled client has
    a unique advantage for distributed computing of domain specific environmental
    and crop parameters. With evolving OGC SWE specifications there are few limitations
    in the integrated architecture. Some of the major limitations of proposed SWE
    architecture are, • Scaling up estimates from point to region: the proposed SWE
    architecture needs to be configured with OGC Web Feature Service and Web Coverage
    Service to scale-up actual ET estimates at field level. • Need for sensor plug-n-play:
    significant improvements in analog multi-bus (Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C),
    Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), RS485, RS232, etc.) sensor hardware connection
    needs to be integrated on sensing system hardware. • Public availability of sensor
    observations: very few public, private organizations are providing sensor observations
    in OGC O&M specifications which impose limitations on the utility of service oriented
    architectures. However, there is need to compare the studies based on SWE for
    precision agriculture. Comparison of available studies based on selected features
    is discussed in subsequent section. 4.2. Comparison between SWE studies Available
    published studies on SWE architectures for precision agriculture application are
    studied based on features proposed by Chen et al. (2015). The proposed features
    of SWE are architecture, sensors supported, data sharing, process sharing, services
    involved, data model, validation and complexity. In this study two additional
    features were identified for comparison of SWE implementation, (1) sensor plug-n-play
    and (2) SWE integration on hardware. The sensor plug-n-play feature describes
    implementation of OGC PUCK Protocol Standard ensuring seamless integration of
    sensors. Feature on SWE integration with hardware was identified to ensure the
    seamless communication between standardized web-enabled hardware platforms (Table
    2). Table 2. Comparison of SWE based architectures. Empty Cell Features Empty

    3. The fields marked by right (√) represents available and cross (×) represents
    not available. Table 2 shows a comparison between various SWE implementations
    in precision agriculture application. The SOA proposed by Korduan et al., 2004,
    Murakami et al., 2007, Nash et al., 2009, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Patil et al.,
    2012, Sawant et al., 2012 primarily focus on SWE of existing sensing systems/platforms.
    Whereas, SOA proposed by Liang and Huang, 2013, Geipel et al., 2016, Chen et al.,
    2015, Du et al., 2016 integrate SWE on hardware layer of sensing system/platform.
    The OGC SWE standards are evaluated for their usability and applicability in precision
    agriculture application. The scalability of proposed architecture is facilitated
    by O&M, SensorML and SOS standards. On the fly data processing and distributed
    computing is facilitated by WPS standard. Integrated geospatial information with
    sensor observations facilitates spatio-temporal estimation of the critical agro-meteorological
    parameter. On-board implementation of the SWE framework facilitates ease in acquiring
    processed information at client interface which has potential to extend sensor
    as a service. The large deployment of such SWE based sensing system facilitates
    system identification and reliable access to sensor observations which facilitates
    the hardware maintenance and remote software (i.e. firmware) updates. 5. Conclusions
    With ever increasing capabilities of open source hardware and software tools,
    cost effective IoT based agro-meteorological observation systems can be designed
    for monitoring the weather conditions at very high precision and temporal scale.
    This will facilitate the open field based agricultural research and decision making
    abilities of resource poor farmers in developing countries. Through on-board implementation
    of OGC specified SOS standards the designed sensing system facilitates storage
    and dissemination of sensor observations thereby reducing syntactic heterogeneity
    among sensing systems. The multiple modes (VPN and cloud service) of sensor data
    transfer over the internet ensured the IoT capability of the sensing system. Sensor
    event notification service through social media (Twitter) has shown the effective
    mode of sensor information dissemination to the larger audience. The web based
    interoperable service oriented application client provides better sensor data
    dissemination capabilities thereby facilitating the stakeholders to easily access
    the required sensor observations. The operational field deployment of the sensing
    system in Orange orchard has proved the capabilities of designed SOA. When implemented
    on large scale these distributed interoperable sensing systems can have very wide
    range of applications in solving the regional issues pertaining to the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. The study has been initiated to collect soil moisture observations
    from multiple depths and locations for validation of proposed modeling approach
    for field scale irrigation scheduling of Orange crop. It has been envisaged to
    integrate OGC specified Sensor Planning Service on sensing platform for effective
    in-situ data processing for better decision making. Attempts are being made towards
    deployment of multiple sensing systems for agro-meteorological data collection
    for precision water management in the horticultural crop (Orange) of the semi-arid
    tropical region of Maharashtra India. Acknowledgements This is a part of research

    agriculture has brought many technological enhancements to traditional farm machinery
    and management tools. For a small tillage, manual control of inputs (such as water,
    fertilizer, pesticide) is still possible, but such an approach becomes unfeasible
    for larger cultivations. Furthermore, the manual control is based on the operator''s
    opinion and often have no quantitative basis. In order to optimize the yield and
    the use of the available resources, wireless sensor networks can play a relevant
    role because of their ability of providing real-time data collected by spatially

    The growing demand of food resources, the rise of energy prices, and the climate
    changes have been recognized among the main causes of the food crisis that is
    recently affecting the whole planet [1]. In the framework of industrial agriculture,
    the dramatic increase of food prices brings back to mind the problem of the intensive
    exploitation of the natural resources. In order to define a suitable model of
    sustainable agriculture aimed at preserving the environment and the communities
    of the farmers as well as at enhancing the productivity, a modern approach consists
    into the exploitation of technologies and techniques for achieving, in production,
    economies of scale. Recently, an innovative strategy generally identified as “precision
    agriculture” has been proposed to cope with the problem of environmental sustainability
    [2] [3]. It is based on the observation, the impact assessment, and a timely strategic
    response to fine-scale variation of the parameters of agricultural production
    processes [4] in order to reduce the waste of natural resources and the use of
    fertilizing substances also holding or enhancing the yield of the tillage at the
    same time. In this area, a significant role is played by the Global Positioning
    System (GPS) [5] thanks to its features in terms of localization. Moreover, remote
    sensing techniques [6] have been employed to provide suitable and effective information
    to the farmers in order to evaluate soil and environmental conditions starting
    from images collected by satellites or by the plane. However, the need of real-time
    data and the arising cost strongly suggest the use/integration of/with alternative
    strategies based on sensors located inside or nearby the tillage. In this scenario
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [7] can play a relevant role. More specifically,
    a WSN is a wireless network composed by a set of autonomous, low-power, and low-cost
    devices (called nodes) using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical quantities.
    WSN are a key technology for the monitoring both in military and civil frameworks.
    Such devices are employed in domotics and security applications, for instance
    to track people [8]. Thanks to the possibility to acquire the monitored parameters
    in a continuous and distributed fashion, the WSN are also employed in environmental
    applications, such as precision farming and forest-area monitoring [9]. In these
    frameworks, the low cost and the wireless architecture (fast deployment and high
    scalability) play a relevant role for the rapid diffusion of WSN. In the particular
    context of precision farming, the issues related to the energetic consumption
    and to the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a complex environment significantly
    impact on the physical layer, with nonnegligible setbacks at superior layers as
    well. WSNs have been already used for precision farm purposes especially for monitoring
    environmental parameters [10]. Such a paper describes an innovative solution based
    on a WSN for precision agriculture. With respect to state-of-the-art deployments,
    the proposed solution is based on totally autonomous sensor nodes characterized
    by multiple sensors to real-time collect in a distribute fashion data concerned
    with the temperature and the moisture of the subsoil, but also related to the
    tree, with the aim of defining a closed-loop control system for agriculture management.
    In this framework, the system is aimed at providing a substantial amount of information
    in order to assess the relationship between the irrigation and the quality of
    the tillage yield. SECTION 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The proposed system is composed
    by 27 WSN nodes, each one equipped with 5 Decagon EC-5 [11] soil moisture sensors,
    a subsoil thermometer based on the Sensirion SHT75 sensor [12], and an Ecomatik
    DD dendrometer [13] in order to monitor the variation of the diameter of the trunk.
    Such sensors are connected through an input/output interface to a TinyNode 584
    WSN platform [14]. As detailed in Figure 1, the power supply subsystem consists
    of a lead acid battery (6 V 4.5 A/h), a solar panel able to provide 250 mA at
    7 V and a 3V DC/DC converter based on a dual frequency high efficient switching
    regulator. Fig. 1. Sensor node architecture. Show All For a more efficient power
    management and to provide a 2.5V regulated power supply to the sensors, a second
    DC/DC converter is used. This voltage regulator is turned on by a CMOS switch
    only when the acquisition procedure is started. Finally, in order to acquire the
    8 analog input channels an additional analog low resistance multiplexer controlled
    by the WSN node is employed. According to the on-board software routines, the
    acquisition procedure is started every 10 min (sampling time). During this time,
    the sensor node is in low power operation mode (called also “sleep mode”) and
    every unnecessary module (such as RF module and sensor) is switched off. The sampling
    time can be reduced by the user or can be changed automatically when a fast humidity
    variation is measured by the soil moisture sensors in order to monitor the current
    phenomena. In this way the power consumption is kept extremely low (about 80μA
    @ 6V). Moreover, the lead acid battery are recharged by means of a solar panel.
    When the “sleep mode” timer expire, the acquisition routine is started (as show
    in Fig. 2) and the 2.5V voltage regulator is switched on. After some warm-up time
    (5 ms), all the sensors are interrogated sequentially. During this procedure,
    the power consumption is about 120mA @ 6V. In order to perform a real-time monitoring
    of the state of the network, each node also collects data concerned with the voltage
    of the battery, the current provided by the solar panel, the internal voltage,
    as well as the temperature of the microcontroller. In addition to the voltage
    of the output signals of the sensors, the voltage of the soil moisture sensors
    and dendrometer power supply is gathered in order to real-time compensate the
    measured data. At the end of the measurement procedure, the sensor board is switched
    off and the RF interface sends the collected data over radio channel to a sink
    node. Finally, the sensor node return to the “sleep mode”. Fig. 2. On-board SW
    flow chart. Show All The network can be organized in star or multihop topology
    depending on the dimension of the required coverage area. In our implementation,
    we are using nodes working in the 868Mhz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM)
    band with maximum output power of 12 dBm. Moreover, a robust and simple star topology
    has been considered in order to improve the reliability of the measurement system
    and reduce the power consumption with respect to the multihop network topology.
    The sink node receives the data coming from sensor nodes, measure the Received
    Signal Strength (RSS) value of every packet and sends the data packet to a Gateway
    (GW). Such a GW assign date and time to the packet and sends the raw data to a
    database for real time and historic data management. The data are finally converted
    and calibrated by specific equations and displayed on a web site. SECTION 3. DEPLOYMENT
    The sensor node is installed in a plastic package to protect the devices against
    adversary weather conditions and, at the same time, avoid perturbation on the
    antenna pattern. The solar panel is mounted on the top of the plastic case. To
    maximize the recharge efficiency, a specific mounting bracket with a tilt of 45°
    has been employed (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Sensor node deployment. Show All The sensor
    nodes have been deployed on a 5000 m2 large apple orchard and disposed in 3 different
    areas where different irrigation thesis are carried out. In each area, the WSN
    nodes have been equally-spaced on a grid of size 30 m×40 m. As reported in the
    Figure 4, the soil moisture sensors have been located underground at different
    depth levels (−0.1 m, −0.2 m, −0.3 m, −0.5 m and −0.8 m). Moreover, the thermometer
    has been located at −0.2 m in depth and the dendrometers has been applied to seven
    apple trees chosen among those. Data are continuously collected by the sensor
    nodes and are then transmitted to a gateway node located in the farm 300 m far
    from the orchard. Then, data gathered by the sensor nodes and from a permanent
    weather station are then organized in a database on a public web site (http://www.eledia.ing.unitn.it).
    More in detail, data can be downloaded in raw format, their behavior with respect
    to time can be visualized, or the parameters can be presented linked to the location
    as in a geographic information system (GIS) (see Fig. 5). Fig. 4. Sensors positioning.
    Show All Fig. 5. GIS-like visualization of collected data. Show All SECTION 4.
    CONCLUSION This paper describes a WSN-based system for precision agriculture.
    Such an installation is characterized by totally autonomous nodes equipped with
    a set of multiple sensors to collect data concerned with environmental parameters
    as well as with the status of the apple trees. The preliminary validation of the
    network confirmed the effectiveness of such a system and the feasibility of the
    precision farming by means of WSN. The long run use of the system will certainly
    provide useful data and suggestions to complete a closed-loop solution for production
    management. The natural evolution of the proposed system is the integration on
    the network of some actuator nodes that are able to control the irrigation system
    following an irrigation strategy based on the measured parameters. Authors Figures

    Get rights and content Abstract Science-based, holistic, site-specific water conservation
    practices can reduce water use on turfgrass sites without adversely affecting
    turfgrass performance. However, when water use is decreased below a certain threshold,
    performance declines. Water conservation measures that reduce turfgrass performance
    essentially decrease its economic, environmental, recreational, and aesthetic
    values, which can in turn adversely impact many ‘stakeholders’, including the
    local economy and those affected by increased wind erosion, water erosion, or
    fire hazard. On larger turfgrass sites, considerable costs are associated with
    some water conservation strategies, especially when the quality of an alternative
    irrigation water source is poor or redesign of the landscape and/or irrigation
    system is involved. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords TurfgrassDrought

    management 1. The question The question “Can we maintain turf to customers’ satisfaction
    with less water?” suggests several points: (a) That less water can be used on
    turf sites in many situations. (b) That turf performance or quality could potentially
    be affected in a manner that would reduce its value to the customer. (c) There
    are ‘customers’ who derive benefits from turfgrass. (d) The issue of water conservation
    as a ‘benefit’ should be addressed in the context of other changes (environmental,
    economic, recreational, etc.) that may be ‘costs’ to customers. In the midst of
    a water crisis, the general public, politicians, and water regulatory agencies
    may focus only on water savings that can be achieved by implementing immediate
    water saving measures without regard to potential short or long term consequences
    to all that may be affected. However, if water conservation measures are severe
    enough to compromise turf recreational use, economic impact, environmental/functional
    benefits, or aesthetics, then more than the perceived direct ‘customer’ may be
    adversely affected (Beard and Green, 1994, Gibeault, 2002, Cathy, 2003). The focus
    of this paper is to address the points posed by the question in the title. 2.
    Sound water conservation strategies can result in less water used on turf sites
    In recent papers (Balogh and Watson, 1992, Ervin and Koski, 1998, Richie et al.,
    2002, Bastug and Buyuktas, 2003), the relationships between turfgrass evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and turf quality were explored along with the discussion of past research
    as reviewed by Kneebone et al. (1992) and Kenna and Horst (1993). Several conclusions
    can be reached based on the various studies relating ETc versus turf performance:
    (1) In general, the landscape coefficients (KL), for cool-season grasses (0.70–0.95)
    are higher than for warm-season turfgrasses (0.65–0.85) when the irrigation regime
    is at 3–7+ days between events, which would allow moisture stress within the surface
    zone. At these KL values, the turf could maintain acceptable quality and growth,
    but as the KL value was decreased below these general ranges using a similar irrigation
    schedule, turf performance rapidly declined (Meyer and Gibeault, 1987, Carrow,
    1995). (2) Irrigation scheduling can influence the KL value versus turf performance.
    When a grass was irrigated more heavily (KL 0.75–1.00 for tall fescue, Festuca
    arundinacea Shreb., 7 day schedule), the irrigation frequency could be extended;
    but with a 2–3 day schedule, a KL of 0.50 maintained good quality (Richie et al.,
    2002). The concept of deep, infrequent irrigation scheduling is limited by the
    surface drying versus turf performance relationship, especially in arid regions.
    In arid regions, where most water addition is by irrigation, it is important to
    determine the deepest and least frequent irrigation schedule that will allow maximum
    water conservation without an unacceptable decline in turf quality resulting from
    too severe drying at the surface (Brede, 2000). Extending the irrigation interval
    too long will result in more water application to maintain the same turf quality
    level compared to a less frequent irrigation using less water. In a semi-arid
    or humid climate, deep rooting is important to take advantage of natural precipitation
    events. However, in an arid climate, rooting to a depth that allows a reasonable
    interval between irrigation events without excessive surface drying is all that
    is needed and not the deepest rooted grass. (3) Carrow (1995) reported turfgrass
    ETc was 40–60% less in a humid environment compared to the same cultivar grown
    in an arid environment, but similar KL values were reported for both. ETo under
    the humid climate was less, accounting for the differences in observed ETc. Additionally,
    irrigation intervals in arid or semi-arid climates were normally within the range
    of 3–7 days, but Carrow (1996) reported irrigation frequencies of 5–20 days due
    to lower ETc, allowing more opportunity to capture natural precipitation rather
    than to irrigate. (4) If a daily irrigation regime was followed, KL for cool-season
    grasses is reported to be 0.88–1.09 (Aronson et al., 1987, Bastug and Buyuktas,
    2003). Thus, allowing no drought stress on the turfgrass can result in high ETc.
    Dormant turf would be expected have only evaporation losses. (5) Within the broad
    categories of cool and warm-season grasses, species differences are apparent.
    (6) Within a species, there can be 20–60% range in ETc (Kjelgren et al., 2000).
    Thus, controlled research studies confirm that water conservation can be achieved
    to a point before turfgrass quality starts to decline; thereafter, decreasing
    water results in reduced turf quality. The resulting reduction in turf quality
    or cover implies a potential for reduction in recreational use, environmental/functional
    capabilities, and economic use/value of the site, which in turn may adversely
    affect the direct customer, owners, local economy, and local environment (Beard
    and Green, 1994, Cathy, 2003). The real issue then becomes how to maximize water
    conservation on turfgrass areas while maintaining economic viability. Be science-based:
    Water conservation measures are increasingly becoming incorporated into regulatory
    policy. However, it is essential that policy arising out of the political process
    be based on science and not political decision devoid of sound science. When incorporating
    science-based concepts into a water conservation program, it is important that
    it is true science and not pseudo-science where opinion is cloaked in scientific
    language. A science-based approach stimulates entrepreneurship to develop improved
    technology to enhance future water use-efficiency. Holistic in terms of water
    conservation options: There is no ‘silver-bullet’ or single factor to achieve
    water conservation, rather a combination of water conservation strategies is needed
    to achieve high water-use efficiency in the whole system. The system includes
    soil, plant/landscape, atmosphere, turf manager, irrigation system, irrigation
    source, cultural practices, and any other aspect that may influence water-use.
    Holistic in terms of consideration of the effects of water conservation measures
    on all stakeholders as a central component of all water conservation plans: Water
    conservation programs should include consideration of the effects on the economy,
    environment, jobs, and site use. The customer or user/manager/owner of a turf
    site is not the only stakeholder potentially affected by water conservation measures,
    but others include: the supply side (water authorities, suppliers); demand side
    (homeowner, turf manager, turf industry, etc.); and others affected by environmental
    and economic water conservation measures (society in general, local economy, health
    aspects, etc.). 3. Assessing the benefits and costs of water conservation programs
    Vickers (2001) noted key steps to a successful water conservation program on a
    regional or state-wide basis as: (a) identify conservation goals; (b) develop
    a water-use profile and forecast; (c) evaluate planned facilities; (d) identify
    and evaluate conservation measures; (e) identify and assess conservation incentives;
    (f) analyze benefits and costs; (g) select conservation measures and incentives;
    (h) prepare and implement the conservation plan; (i) integrate conservation and
    supply plans, modify forecasts; and (j) monitor, evaluate, and revise program
    as needed. Specific best management practices (BMPs), however, that can be applied
    on a site-specific basis on a turfgrass facility are essential. There are a number
    of components or strategies that should be integrated into an overall turfgrass
    BMPs water conservation plan, at the site-specific level (Gibeault and Cockerham,
    1985, Carrow and Duncan, 2000a, Carrow et al., 2002a, Carrow et al., 2002b). Within
    each broad strategy there are numerous options to consider when selecting the
    water conservation BMPs most appropriate for a particular site. However, except
    for the water audit approach, which deals only with the irrigation system, comprehensive,
    in-depth plans have not been available to turf managers (Irrigation Association,
    2003a). Recently, Carrow et al. (2005), in conjunction with the Golf Course Superintendents
    Association of America, developed a comprehensive, water conservation BMPs document
    (template) for individual golf courses dealing with: the planning process; detailed
    options for different water conservation strategies; and information on benefit/cost
    assessment. Components of a site-specific water conservation program for golf
    courses are denoted in Table 1. Their BMP template model is currently being considered
    by two states in the USA as a model for state water conservation plans related
    to the golf course industry in contrast to rigid regulations, such as a set quantity
    of water or specific days and times of irrigation. Table 1. Components of site-specific

    and costs of water conservation measures on all stakeholders  Benefits   Direct
    and indirect to the owner/manager and site customers   Direct and indirect to
    other stakeholders, including water savings but also other benefits—society, economic,
    environmental  Costs   Facilities costs for past and planned implementation of
    water conservation strategies, irrigation system changes; water storage; pumping;
    new maintenance equipment; water/soil treatments; course design alterations; etc.   Labor
    needs/costs   Costs associated with changes in maintenance practices; different
    irrigation water sources (water treatment, soil treatment, storage, etc.)   Costs
    that may impact the community if water conservation strategies are implemented
    (especially mandated ones), such as revenue loss, job loss, etc. Assessment of
    benefits and costs of implementing water conservation measures on all stakeholders
    is essential to understand implications. The immediate owner or manager of a turf
    site will naturally assess the direct costs involved to implement water conservation
    measures. For the homeowner, rebate or water cost incentives may help offset the
    cost of landscape design and plant material changes, irrigation system alterations,
    and rain sensors (WRA, 2003). For large scale facilities, such as a golf course,
    the implementation costs may be considerable for changes in landscape design/plant
    material, irrigation system design and operation, using alternative irrigation
    water resources (i.e., wastewater piping costs, water/soil amendments), more frequent
    cultivation, training, and monitoring. Vickers (2001) and WRA (2003) provide much
    discussion on direct and indirect benefits of reducing water consumption, but
    limited discussion concerning potential for adverse effects to: (a) facility costs
    to implement changes required by a plan, and (b) some potential adverse environmental
    impacts if overuse of water on turf resulted in adverse in-stream flow, over-pumping
    of groundwater, reduced wetland effects, and one mention of fire hazard from native
    grasses. In contrast, Cathy (2003), Beard and Green (1994), and Gibeault (2002)
    note a broad array of benefits that turfgrass and the turf industry contribute
    to society (Table 2), and present a good discussion with case studies of adverse
    effects when water conservation measures are taken to the extreme, especially
    without consideration of other environmental impacts. Table 2. Benefits that turfgrass
    sites contribute (after Beard and Green, 1994, Cathy, 2003, Gibeault, 2002) Functional/environmental  Prevent
    soil loss from wind erosion—a primary reason turf is used as a groundcover.  Reduce
    air borne dust  Protect for soil loss by water erosion—a primary reason turf is

    reason turf is used as a groundcover.  Capture water from runoff for soil moisture

    on sports fields and turf areas used for enjoyment  Entrapment of organic chemical

    sports—soccer, golf, football, etc.  Enhances participation in outdoor activities
    and sports  Contributes to a safe playing environment for athletes—cushioning
    and surface stability, smoothness  Contributes to spectator enjoyment  Low cost,
    living surface that can be self-repairing Aesthetic  Beauty contributes to quality
    of life  Feeling of mental well-being—horticulture therapy  Community pride  Ornamental
    compliment to trees, shrubs, and flowers  Allows individuals to express themselves
    and influence their surroundings through individualized landscape Economic  Direct
    revenues, taxes, jobs from sports events and golfing in the local economy  Enhancement
    of tourism—in some cases tourism is build around golfing  Parks, sports venues,
    golf courses, and landscape industry contribute jobs, money and taxes  Suppliers
    of turfgrass equipment, supplies, and services contribute jobs, money, and taxes
    in the economy  Enhanced home and properties values and, therefore, greater tax
    revenues  Contributes to purchase of non-turf items goods and services in the
    community—restaurants, dry cleaners, service stations, etc. As noted earlier,
    careful application of water conservation strategies can reduce turfgrass water
    use, but after a point turfgrass performance and associated benefits will start
    to decline. Therefore, as a part of an overall water conservation plan, actual
    water conservation/savings must be balanced by potential effects that may arise
    (i.e., economic, functional/environmental, recreational use of the site, and aesthetics)
    not just on the specific site, but also on the local and broad economy and environment.
    Two examples illustrate the effect when removal of turf is carried too far: •
    When China removed all turf and many trees from Beijing public spaces during the
    Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the result was major air pollution from dust
    storms, related health problems, and higher air temperatures within the city (Cathy,
    2003). Revegetation with trees alone did not resolve the problem but required
    turfgrass cover. Recently, the People''s Daily (2000) reported “Beijing will take
    drastic moves to eliminate the sources of dust so as to reduce the amount of dust
    people breathe in everyday … worksites that refuse to plant trees shall be taken
    back … and shall be turned into lawns put under the management of gardening departments”.
    • Mowed turfgrass can be an effective fire buffer and replacement near homes can
    result in fire hazard and higher homeowner insurance. ‘Firewise’ landscaping for
    the wildland-urban interface suggests that zone 1 (9 m ring around home); and
    zone 2 be well-irrigated, low growing, and low flammability species; zone 3 to
    low-growing plants and well-spaced trees in this area, with low volume of vegetation
    for fuel (Firewise, 2004). 4. Site-specific turfgrass water conservation strategies
    Several potential water conservation strategies with options can be used in BMPs
    for a turfgrass site (Table 1) (Carrow et al., 2005): 4.1. Use of non-potable
    water sources for irrigation-alternative water sources, water harvesting/reuse
    An important strategy for water conservation is to use alternative non-potable
    water sources, such as runoff collected in ponds, effluent (wastewater), poor
    quality ground water, seawater or seawater/blends (Carrow and Duncan, 2000b).
    As recreational areas shift to poorer water quality, more salt-induced problems
    are anticipated that will require extra alternative irrigation water beyond the
    normal irrigation rate for salt leaching. Monitoring of soil moisture and salt
    levels at multiple depths will become more commonplace by mobile and/or installed
    moisture and salt sensors. The necessity of using grasses with higher salt tolerance
    will alter management not only because the grass is new, but because salt-induced
    problems must be managed (Carrow and Duncan, 1998). The environmentally friendly
    term ‘water harvesting’ is not often used in relation to golf courses or other
    turf sites, yet it is a common practice (Florkowski and Landry, 2002). Many golf
    course irrigation lakes also serve as landscaping features and catch excess runoff,
    preventing the loss of substantial amounts of water from the site and preventing
    sediment into streams or rivers. Catchment features are usually part of an overall
    stormwater control and reuse plan mandated by governmental policies. A recent
    survey of Georgia golf courses indicated that as much as 67% of irrigation water
    came from such non-potable, runoff lakes (Florkowski and Landry, 2002). Water
    harvesting is usually thought of as treating watersheds to enhance runoff collected
    for future use (Thomas et al., 1997, Todd and Vittori, 1997, Waterfall, 1998).
    In the case of golf courses, the landscape is purposely contoured to collect the
    excess runoff from rainfall, while allowing good infiltration of water into the
    soil under normal conditions. Some golf courses with large adjacent housing developments
    are investigating the potential for collecting drainage and runoff from these
    areas, using their own facility to treat the non-potable water to standards acceptable
    for turf use, and irrigating the golf course with the water. This practice saves
    local government the expense of treating the water. 4.2. Selection of turfgrass
    species/cultivars and landscape plants for water conservation Development and
    use of turfgrasses with superior drought resistance/low water use is a primary
    means of decreasing water needs on turfgrass sites (Kenna and Horst, 1993). Cynodon
    spp. are widely used in warm-season zones and most cultivars exhibit superior
    drought resistance; but superior drought resistance in many other commonly used
    species, especially cool-season grasses, is less evident, and will remain so until
    breeders focus on this as a priority. Some turfgrass breeders are now placing
    more emphasis on drought resistance, particularly the most important component
    which is drought avoidance via a greater genetic-based root tolerance to soil
    stresses that limit root development/maintenance and by shoot characteristics
    that contribute to an inherent low water use (Duncan and Carrow, 1999). Under
    more limited irrigation regimes, other stresses besides drought are enhanced and
    will require attention by breeders and turf managers, namely; high temperature
    tolerance for cool-season grasses, wear tolerance, salinity tolerance in the case
    where poor water quality is used, and pests that are favored by reduced growth
    rates. In addition to assessing and developing drought resistant cultivars among
    traditional species, non-traditional species bred for superior drought resistance
    and/or other stress resistance traits will become more commonplace (Brede, 2000,
    Duncan and Carrow, 2001, Loch et al., 2003). 4.3. Landscape design for water conservation
    On homesites, ‘Xeriscape’ principles are often promoted as water conserving. Interestingly,
    Vickers (2001) noted that ‘beyond Xeriscape’ is a move to an all natural landscape.
    Behind this movement appears to be groups that promote only native plants as appropriate
    for the natural landscape and use water conservation as the environmental reason,
    but without a balance of what other adverse human and ecological environmental
    effects may result, fire hazard, dust hazard, etc., or what about the non-native
    garden and food crop plants? However, Welch (2003) states that as the original
    “Xeriscape concept matured and spread, the principle of limited turf use was increasingly
    scrutinized by horticulturists and turf experts. Today''s Xeriscape movement incorporates
    a more holistic approach to reducing turf irrigation … through the principles
    of Xeriscape, turf irrigation can be reduced while the many benefits of turfgrass
    can still be derived … many turfgrasses are drought-tolerant and can survive extreme
    drought conditions”. These contrasting views illustrate that all ‘Xeriscape landscape
    design’ concepts are not equal, which one is used for water conservation purposes
    has a dramatic effect on the potential for environmental and human hazards. Landscape
    design focus must not be one-dimensional by focusing on minimizing the turf area,
    but must apply all of the Xeriscape principles (Cathy, 2003) of planning and design,
    soil improvement, appropriate plant selection, practical turf areas, efficient
    irrigation design and scheduling (including the human factor), mulching, and appropriate
    maintenance. Additionally, any adverse environmental effects of proposed landscaping
    changes should be considered, namely, wind erosion/dust, water erosion/sedimentation
    of water features, fire hazard, etc. On larger, more complex sites, such as golf
    courses, prior to construction or renovation, many decisions can be made that
    will foster water conservation or greatly limit it, such as grass choices, irrigation
    system design/piping and zoning, contouring, and area of well-irrigated turf on
    the site. Numerous design looks can be achieved with mulch materials; use of alternative,
    drought-resistant grasses that are left unmowed in non-landing areas; incorporation
    of native low growing ground covers, shrubs, and trees that require minimal irrigation
    and possess unique looks; using higher mowing heights on parts of the fairway
    or adjacent roughs that may receive little or limited irrigation; utilization
    of features, such as rock, sand bunkers, and non-irrigated mounds. Golfers seem
    to accept brown turf when it is mowed high or left unmowed, but may not accept
    as much discoloration or lower plant density on the closely mowed high-use areas.
    Since golf courses must compete for local and, in some locations, national and
    international customers, the visual aspects on the close-mowed playing area influences
    play and the associated tourist industry, i.e., Asian golfers may not come to
    the Australian Gold Coast if it does not have competitive quality to alternative
    golf locations. In other instances with less play demand and competition for customers,
    dormant, semi-dormant, or lower quality turf may be very acceptable on large expanses
    of many golf courses. Irrigation level on the high use areas also influences the
    degree of traffic that a golf course or recreational field can tolerate. Contouring
    is another important design factor, especially avoiding excessive slopes, mounds,
    and berms that are difficult to irrigate even with an excellent irrigation system.
    Also, contouring should foster water harvesting. 4.4. Efficient irrigation system
    design Irrigation system design and irrigation scheduling (see Section 4.5) are
    essential for water conservation on irrigated sites. One critical design challenge
    is to deal with spatial variability, which can be very complex on turf sites with
    many microclimates resulting from the diverse terrain, soil, and plants (Table
    3). Spatial variability must be determined, and adjustments made through landscape
    design, irrigation system design, and site-specific irrigation scheduling. Even
    a home landscape can be much more variable than most agricultural fields and golf
    course sites are very complex in terms of variability. Specific types of variability
    (Table 3) must be individually identified and quantified. This is an area that
    the author believes will receive more attention in the future so that more precise
    design of irrigation systems and their operation can be achieved, while also maximizing
    sensor placement. Table 3. Spatial variability that influences irrigation scheduling
    and water-use efficiency Above-ground—variability across the landscape due to:  Climate
    variation   Solar radiation (N/S exposure, shade)   Wind speed   Humidity   Air
    temperatures  Grass/plant type and characteristics—canopy structure, mowing height,
    growth rate, etc. Soil variability—both horizontally and vertically due to:  Soil
    texture  OM content  Soil depth  Slope  Soil water holding capacity  Infiltration  Salinity  pH,
    fertility, etc.  Irrigation system—good design, zoning, and hardware reduces landscape
    and soil variability but when the system is not properly designed or operated
    it becomes another source of variability. In recent years, as water conservation
    has become a looming reality, there has been a marked increase in entrepreneurial
    activity to improve irrigation design and scheduling aspects through better hardware,
    develop software to communicate between controllers and sensors, and improved
    irrigation concepts. The author''s current research is focused on identification
    and characterization of variability of landscapes and soils; categorizing similar
    microclimates; and using sensor technology to integrate real-time information
    by microclimate type into irrigation scheduling by combinations of atmospheric
    and soil-based means. Within agriculture, the equivalent of incorporating these
    issues would be the precision agriculture or integrated approach to irrigation
    management described by Buss (1996). Irrigation system design is an important
    component of water conservation on turfgrass sites in order: (a) to apply water
    in an efficient manner so as to limit water losses by runoff, leaching past root
    systems, or unnecessary evaporation from water standing on the surface; (b) to
    allow adequate irrigation of areas as needed within the time constraints imposed
    by night time irrigation, salt leaching, water control authorities, etc.; and
    (c) to make site-specific or precision water applications accurately on individual,
    microclimate areas, according to their needs. In this latter aspect, control of
    water application on a site-specific basic will often include control of the water
    rate and depth of percolation for maintaining root viability; and on areas with
    poor water quality to insure salt movement downward, while preventing capillary
    rise back into the root zone. Many of the fundamentals of good irrigation design
    are known and have been applied to a certain extent, especially in more arid and
    semi-arid locations (Irrigation Association, 2003a, Irrigation Association, 2003b).
    However, for maximum water use-efficiency, full incorporation of these principles
    must be “the norm” for the next generation of irrigation systems and renovations
    of existing systems. Water must be applied on a precision basis in a BMPs water
    conservation plan—and this cannot be accomplished with a poorly designed irrigation
    system. Highly automated irrigation systems will initially cost more, but in the
    long term save water/money and allow true implementation of environmental stewardship
    principles by the turf facility. 4.5. Improved irrigation scheduling Irrigated
    sites can be over-watered because people do not irrigate according to plant needs,
    including Xeriscapes. In Phoenix, Xeriscapes actually used 30% more water than
    conventional landscapes. This illustrates the critical point that it is people
    who over-irrigate (Vickers, 2001). Means must be developed to couple irrigation
    applications to true plant water needs. The best designed irrigation system will
    not efficiently apply water unless it is properly programmed. Irrigation scheduling
    is normally by experience of the turf manager using indicator spots or problem
    areas where drought symptoms are first observed to aid in deciding when to irrigate.
    Many golf courses and some other turf sites have an on-site weather station where
    estimated ETo data is available; but ETo data must be adjusted for each microclimate
    site, since grass, soil type, radiation, wind, and other environmental or management
    conditions will differ from the weather station site. For example, each microclimate
    adjustment is made by multiplying a landscape coefficient (KL) by the ETo to obtain
    an estimated turf ET (ETc). Unfortunately, the KL factor differs with grass, season,
    weather front, and microclimate soil/atmospheric conditions, while the ETo does
    not take into account the soil (current soil moisture level by depth) nor plant
    (depth of viable root system, current level of stress) conditions. Irrigation
    scheduling of the future will involve real-time information from within an irrigation
    zone to provide more site-specific guidance (Sudduth et al., 1999). One approach
    will be soil sensors that are now capable of monitoring soil moisture in 50–100
    mm zones at multiple depths down to 1 m in a real-time mode with remote transfer
    of the data for ease of use (Charlesworth, 2000, Moller et al., 1996). Precision
    application of irrigation for prevention of moisture stress and for salt control,
    requires precise information on current conditions by soil depth. A common question
    that arises with soil moisture sensors is whether a soil measurement represents
    the area due to spatial variability across a landscape and within the soil. Comments
    related to this question are: • For any means of irrigation scheduling to be efficient,
    adjustments must be made for the microclimate site. Soil sensors offer the capability
    for being the most site-specific moisture monitoring approach within the vertical
    plane throughout the root zone. However, microclimate site assessment must be
    more stringent than is practiced in a current water audit (Irrigation Association,
    2003a) and must be quantified so that: (a) zoning can be more specific; (b) sensors
    can be accurately placed; (c) similar microclimates can be classed together so
    that one representative site can be used as an indicator for other similar sites;
    and (d) so KL values can be daily adjusted via soil sensor and atmospheric sensor
    (such as in shaded areas) data by adjustment of weather station ETo for actual
    microclimate water use. • New sensors and software have greater capabilities than
    many now visualize when they think of a soil sensor. They offer real-time data,
    multiple depth moisture readings, translation of the information into useful formats
    with appropriate software, and the ability to electronically transfer data to
    remote sites. These attributes can be useful for documenting the need to irrigate
    a site and maintaining a history of soil moisture statue. • Soil sensor placement
    must be done carefully to represent the diverse characteristics of the area. Their
    installation must follow the guidelines to make sure good soil-to-sensor contact
    exists and calibration must be accurate, but these issues can be addressed. •
    As noted, soil sensors are only effective when they are used within a carefully
    zoned irrigation system that has a high uniformity of water application or a system
    with the ability to control water delivery to specific parts of a zone (Buss,
    1996). Then, sufficient sensors must be placed to represent a microclimate zone,
    but one such zone may then represent several other similar ones. • It is the difference
    in water content between readings that is important and not absolute moisture
    content information, because the difference is an actual measure of water used
    and it indicates where the water was extracted within the root zone. There is
    less spatial variability in the difference data than within an absolute value
    when comparing across several sensors. Another emerging technology is the use
    of plant-based monitoring of plant stress in irrigation scheduling using precision
    agriculture concepts (Frazier et al., 1999). Currently, the most effort is in
    measuring light reflectance from the turf canopy within the 350–1100 nm wavelength
    region, which includes the visible/PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) region
    of 400–750 nm (Geuertal et al., 2000). Loss of color and/or leaf area can increase
    reflectance within certain wavelengths that may be used in models to estimate
    overall plant stress, irrigation need, or perhaps a nutrient stress. For example,
    Jiang and Carrow (2005) investigated turf quality and leaf firing responses versus
    narrow-band reflectance in the 400–1100 nm region under progressive drought stress
    for five turfgrass species and several cultivars within species. Models based
    on narrow-band reflectance data to predict drought stress differed with species
    and for cultivars within a species; and models exhibited coefficients of determination
    (R2) of only 0.40–0.60 (Jiang and Carrow, 2005). Other approaches may become possible,
    such as using a wider wavelength range of 350–2500 nm where several ‘water bands’
    occur, use of the infrared thermal region of 8000–14,000 nm, fluorescence reflectance,
    digital imaging data, and others. However, even with an accurate plant-based method,
    the question of how much water to apply is still a major problem. 4.6. Altering
    management practices to enhance water-use efficiency Various management practices
    can substantially affect water-use efficiency, especially practices that maximize
    water infiltration and turfgrass root development and maintenance (Carrow, 1994).
    Cultural operations may alter the soil conditions to reduce water loss from runoff,
    leaching or excess evaporation and to improve soil water retention. Although a
    particular turfgrass may have the genetic potential to be drought resistant, without
    proper management, it may exhibit low water-use efficiency. 4.7. Education Educational
    efforts will be needed for policy makers, water management authorities turfgrass
    managers, turf students, facility officials and members and crew members who are
    concerned with water conservation and management on turfgrass areas. The challenge
    for extension specialists and research scientists will be to produce in-depth
    information packages containing both scientific principles and specific practices
    for turf managers and consultants in the industry (Carrow et al., 2001). Turf
    mangers will be more likely to embrace new technology if they have ready access
    to good educational opportunities from well-trained consultants and specialists.
    4.8. Water conservation and contingency plans A water conservation plan conserves
    water on a continuous basis, whereas a contingency plan deals with water-conserving
    measures during severe water shortages. At the turfgrass facility level, it is
    essential that owners, members and officials assist in formulating these plans,
    understand their implications, and adopt the plans. Facility policies must include
    water conservation. 4.9. Other water conservation practices In addition to the
    practices already outlined, other practices include: (a) monitoring a water conservation
    program to assess success by documenting water use (for example, by water meters)
    and relating it to turfgrass performance, (b) periodic site water audits can identify
    leaks, irrigation head malfunctions, design limitations, irrigation scheduling
    problems or other wasteful water use, and (c) indoor water conservation plans
    for any buildings on a facility (Vickers, 2001). 5. Challenges to water conservation
    Considerable information exists about many aspects of turfgrass water conservation
    practices, which could be implemented rapidly to achieve water savings on most
    sites. Incorporating new developments in grasses, technology, concepts, and scientific
    knowledge would produce additional water savings over time. Many turfgrass managers
    already follow some water conservation practices at their sites, but full implementation
    is often hindered by certain challenges: • Agronomic—the current turfgrass on
    a site may not be very well adapted or drought resistant. • Educational—managing
    for water conservation requires a whole systems approach by the turf manager and
    it is a complex issue. Facility owners may not understand the complexities. •
    Financial—high costs can be associated with implementing some water conservation
    measures. • Institutional—government regulations can foster (water price structure)
    or hinder (regulations requiring irrigation to be done on a calendar schedule
    rather than plant need basis) adoption of conservation practices. • Management—the
    facility owner/management must place priority on water conservation on an on-going
    basis in order for the turf manager to fully implement a conservation program.
    6. Conclusions In summary, water conservation will become increasingly necessary
    on many turf sites, regardless of the climatic zone. Considerable knowledge already
    exists about many practices within this complex soil-plant–water source–climate–man
    system that can be implemented rapidly to achieve a certain degree of water conservation
    or water-use efficiency without sacrifice of turf performance. In addition to
    the current state of science, turf managers will be presented with a host of new
    tools for better water management and ongoing changes in equipment, chemicals
    and practices. In depth, continuing education will become necessary as new technology
    and new grasses must be integrated into ‘BMPs for water conservation’ to be truly
    efficient, properly implemented, and carefully monitored; but this paradigm will
    require whole-hearted involvement by all owners/facility officials and the turf
    manager associated with a turfgrass facility. References Aronson et al., 1987

    maintaining turfgrass quality (Carrow, 2006; Beard and Kenna, 2008; Devitt et
    al., 2008; DaCosta and Huang, 2006). One of the main challenges for water management
    with all plant systems is to accurately estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and,

    are needed for realizing IoT potential in commercial-scale applications. The main
    challenge is to provide solution flexibility to meet custom application needs.
    We developed an IoT-based platform for smart irrigation, with a flexible architecture
    to easily connect IoT and machine learning (ML) components to build application
    solutions. Our architecture enables multiple and customizable analytical approaches
    to precision irrigation, making room for the improvement of ML approaches. Impacts
    on different stakeholders can be anticipated, including IoT professionals, by
    facilitating system deployment, and farmers, by providing cost reduction and safer
    crop yields. Examples are given based on pilots in Europe and Brazil. Published

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has already
    left the state of an idea and has been applied in practical projects. The technical
    and application challenges are enormous since IoT platforms enable complex real-time
    control systems that combine the use of communication infrastructure, hardware,
    software, analytical techniques, and application knowledge combined into multiple
    layers. One of the key technical challenges is to realize the expected IoT impacts
    on systems, as IoT allows them to become service mashups, connecting things as
    services. Consequently, system development will become dynamic plug-and-play interoperable
    service composition, and system logic will become service orchestration. Overall,
    IoT allows solution flexibility to fulfill custom application needs. In the context
    of agriculture, irrigation is a key task to guarantee adequate crop yield by avoiding
    under- and over-watering. Moreover, it is an important cost driver, as the energy
    to transport water and to operate irrigation equipment is costly – in some places,
    even the water itself is costly. Smart irrigation seeks to apply IoT and analytical
    methods to leverage precision irrigation, aiming optimal cost effectiveness to
    the farmer by flowing the water in the proper amount to places where and when
    it is needed. In this article we introduce the concept of a flexible IoT-machine
    learning (ML) platform, wherein IoT and ML components are connected as services
    in an application context, allowing adaptable solutions to fulfill application
    needs. This approach benefits IoT professionals, as they can easily develop and
    deploy complex solutions involving devices, communication, data management, analytics,
    and application elements. In particular, our work on this concept has resulted
    in a platform called SWAMP1 that implements our flexible IoT-ML architecture toward
    the smart irrigation problem. This allows highly customizable soil water management
    solutions, involving flexible connectivity among data, physical models, and ML
    algorithms oriented to solve application key tasks, such as water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. We call this concept flexible data-driven
    soil water management, which in practice allows suitable solutions to a great
    variety of soil, plant, and regional weather characteristics. This approach benefits
    the farmer, as a highly customizable smart irrigation solution may reduce water
    and energy usage and mitigate crop yield risks as it keeps soil water content
    at healthy levels for plants. In the remainder of this article, we compare our
    approach to other practical IoT research projects, provide details on our flexible
    platform applied to precision irrigation, describe our flexible ML approach to
    address precision irrigation tasks, highlight the potential impacts of our approach
    to IoT professionals and farmers, and summarize our main contributions. Related
    Work In recent years, different academic and commercial initiatives have emerged,
    aiming to incorporate IoT and ML into the agriculture. IoF2020 (www.iof2020.eu)2
    and Dragon (www.data-dragon.eu) are two projects funded by the European Union
    for developing IoT platforms for agrifood. IoF2020 is organized into five sectors
    that adopt different solutions: arable crops, dairy, vegetables, fruits, and meat.
    Arable crops use sensors to monitor production and intelligent analysis of images
    to assess crop development. GPS data from cattle neck collars or livestock movements
    monitor dairy chain, and ML is used for early lameness detection. IoT devices
    track the production chain of vegetables, fruits, and meat. Dragon aims to integrate
    IoT data with phenomics, genomics, and metagenomics data associated with ML methods
    to increase production. Other recent academic studies include a platform for precision
    agriculture and experimentation in turmeric cultivation [1]. The platform provides
    a graphical interface for connecting sensors and actuators and uses analytical
    methods to analyze the delay of messages. Another study uses thermal images generated
    by drones and transmitted throughout a cloud-fog system to identify non-uniform
    irrigation zones [2]. Commercial companies are also putting some of these ideas
    into the market. Examples include Agrosmart (www.agrosmart.com.br) in Brazil,
    Agricolus (www.agricolus.com) in Italy, and Cropmetrics (www.cropmetrics.com)
    in the United States. Among other technologies, they use soil sensors, weather
    stations, and weather forecasts for irrigation advising. However, their underlying
    approaches for water need estimation and irrigation optimization and operation
    are not available. Despite the richness of recent approaches adopting IoT in the
    agri-food chain, they do not yet fully explore: (a) the architectural aspects
    to hold flexible solutions involving IoT and ML components and (b) the potential
    of the collected data for a more accurate analysis of water needs. In this article,
    we advocate that data-intensive methods provided by ML algorithms, in combination
    with IoT technologies and weather-soil-atmosphere simulations, can provide a considerable
    impact in precision irrigation and its solution deployment. A Flexible IoT-ML
    Platform for Smart Irrigation The success of next generation systems for precision
    irrigation based on IoT technologies coupled with intelligent ML data processing
    techniques depends on the ability of the solution to adapt to different contexts
    found in farms. A flexible IoT-ML platform must allow different deployment configurations
    of hardware, software, and communication technologies, customized to deal with
    the requirements and constraints of different settings, countries, climate, soils,
    and crops. Here we advocate that an IoT-ML infrastructure for providing smart
    irrigation services be defined by two complementary dimensions, namely core components
    and deployment locations. Core components are a set of software, hardware, and
    communication technologies, such as soil moisture sensor probes, long-range WAN
    (LoRaWAN) [3], Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [4], LoRa Server (www.loraserver.io),
    FIWARE [5], and SEPA [6], as well as specific services for water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. On the other hand, deployment locations
    define where core components can be placed, and how they communicate with each
    other. This generates distinctive configuration scenarios for different deployments.
    Locations follow an IoT computing continuum, composed of things (sensors and actuators),
    mist (field nodes such as radio gateways), fog (farm on-premise computing infrastructure),
    cloud (data storage and processing), and terminal (a smartphone, tablet, or laptop
    where the end user interacts with the application). The five instances of this
    continuum define the end-to-end information path starting with data collected
    by sensors up to commands executed by actuators. The five instances might not
    necessarily be present in all scenarios. Rather, depending on farm characteristics,
    requirements, and constraints, fog or cloud may not be present. This feature provides
    additional flexibility to the IoT-ML platform, as the differences are understood,
    and the platform adapts to the farm and not the opposite. Figure 1 depicts the
    IoT infrastructure for providing smart irrigation services, composed of core components
    and deployment locations. In smart agriculture, each farm has particular objectives
    and characteristics, so different deployment configurations may be used, representing
    instances of the same platform. Figure 1 presents a simpler version of the deployment
    of the IoT-ML platform where locations are thing, mist, cloud, and terminal (i.e.,
    no fog is used). This configuration was chosen for simplicity and a farmer''s
    choice of not hosting anyon-premises infrastructure. Figure 1. IoT-ML platform
    overview and end-to-end data path for a smart irrigation scenario. Show All In
    Fig. 1, the numbers in blue circles represent a simplified sequence of the end-to-end
    data flow through this deployment of the IoT-ML platform. Soil moisture sensors
    send data via LoRaWAN to the gateway installed in the mist node. Particularly
    for the SWAMP Project, we have built a custom-made three-depth soil moisture sensor,
    but also use commercial sensors from Libelium (www.libelium.com) and Meter (www.metergroup.com).
    A weather station also sends data to the mist node via a serial wired interface
    (1). From there, the mist node forwards data via 4G through the Internet directly
    to the cloud (2). Within the cloud, sensor data are treated by the LoRaWAN server
    and sent to the IoT protocol translator (3), such as a FIWARE IoT Agent. Weather
    data goes directly to the IoT protocol translator using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol,
    as well as weather forecasts obtained from an external service. The Translator
    converts the three different types of input data – soil, weather conditions, and
    weather forecast – into the format of the particular IoT underlying platform transmitting
    them to the context broker (4) (e.g., NGSI JSON format for FIWARE Orion). Once
    data arrives at the context broker, it is forwarded to time series storage (5)
    that makes it available for further processing (e.g., FIWARE QuantumLeap using
    CrateDB), where the first part of the end-to-end data flow ends. Here, depending
    on the volume and velocity of data, the time series storage may be replaced by
    a distributed data pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka) connected to a big data processing
    system (e.g., Apache Spark). However, for most smart agriculture scenarios dealing
    with individual farms with hundreds of sensors, time series storage is a lightweight
    solution that provides adequate performance. The water need estimation component
    obtains soil moisture, weather conditions, and weather forecast data from the
    time series storage (6) to generate ideal crop water need estimates. Water need
    estimation is further divided into physical and ML models, further explained in
    the next section. The estimates are in turn used by irrigation planning to generate
    an optimized and real plan that is aware of different physical and financial constraints
    (7). Farmers are shown the irrigation plan via the Farmer App (8) and approve
    or change the irrigation plan that is sent back to irrigation operation (9), which
    controls the irrigation system. From there, irrigation commands follow the way
    back to the mist going through the context broker (10), IoT protocol translator
    (11), and Inter-net/4G (12). Finally, irrigation commands reach sprinklers, pumps,
    and valves (13). Should the fog be present in a different scenario, the end-to-end
    communication would be preserved with small changes, as some components would
    be deployed on-premises in the farm office where the fog node is located, such
    as the LoRaWAN server. This scenario includes the direct operation of the irrigation
    system. In alternative scenarios, the irrigation plan either interacts with existing
    third-party irrigation systems (e.g., Netafim – www.netafim.com – or Focking –
    www.fockink.ind.br) already installed on the farm or even used by farmers to operate
    the irrigation systems manually. These options for interacting with an irrigation
    system are common, and we assume they are generic enough to represent an IoT ecosystem
    for smart irrigation. Flexible Data-Driven Soil Water Management Over the last
    decades, data-driven soil water management has been accomplished using physical
    models3 or triggering soil moisture sensors data4 [7]. However, as IoT enables
    more abundant data, with major spatial and temporal granularity and low latency,
    it increasingly allows the rise of data-driven approaches. Here, a key challenge
    is how to make all analytical techniques (e.g., physical models and ML) available
    to work together in a flexible IoT platform, considering that each crop, type
    of soil, and region may demand a different solution. In this sense, our work aims
    to show the roles that these analytical techniques can play in soil water management,
    and how they can be flexibly assembled together. Our approach is based on two
    main characteristics: Solution flexibility: Modularized components are integrated
    as services in the IoT platform, allowing solution flexibility. Increased ML relevance:
    Analytical solutions can be assembled from traditional physical approaches, and
    modern ML and simulation ones, and even by combining them. Benefits of this approach
    are not only improved irrigation plans, but also self-improved platforms that
    learn from experience. Soil water management is performed in two phases, namely
    water need estimation and irrigation planning. Water Need Estimation The precision
    irrigation problem can be modeled as the soil water balance system at the root
    zone, where the soil water content is the result of the balance between water
    content level and a series of mechanisms that make this level increase or decrease
    (soil water dynamics) [8]. IoT provides the ability to monitor water content levels
    and dynamics, while soil water management systems seek to maintain water content
    in an optimal range [7]. Figure 2 depicts the water need estimation process, divided
    into two key activities: Soil water content and dynamics estimation: This consists
    of estimating soil water content and dynamics through: Direct measurement of soil
    water content, rainfall, irrigation, and so on Physical models of soil water dynamics
    applied over the collected data (weather data mainly) and soil and crop characteristics
    Soil water need forecast: This consists of calculating soil water content forecasts
    and water need forecasts for each moment of a planning horizon, using techniques
    such as simulation and ML algorithms: Simulation is appropriated when working
    with physical models, iteratively applied to simulate future data points [9].
    ML takes advantage of data from multiple time series (soil moisture, soil water
    balance, soil characteristics, and weather data) of direct sensor readings or
    from variables derived out of physical models. Weather forecast data, provided
    by external services, can also be used. Different multivariate forecasting methods
    can be used to handle these multiple time series [10], [11]. Figure 2. Water need
    estimation process. Show All The process depicted in Fig. 2 allows flexibility
    once it allows different components combinations, as they are implemented as services
    in the platform. It is also possible to customize each combination, as they have
    numerous options inside them (i.e., different physical models and ML techniques).
    As an example, the SWAMP project provides two customized analytical solutions
    among all combination possibilities to fit the characteristics and needs of different
    pilots. One of them, called CRITERIA-1D [9], uses physical models and simulation,
    wherein soil water dynamics models (physical models) are the input to soil simulation
    that generates soil water content and water need forecasts. Another solution uses
    direct measurements, physical models, ML, and simulation, wherein the main input
    is direct measurement of soil moisture enriched by an evapotranspiration5 model
    (physical model) [7] as the main soil water balance contributor. ML techniques6,
    such as Panel VAR [10] and RNN-LSTM [11], are used for the processing of soil
    water content and water need forecasts, and simulation to test alternative irrigation
    scenarios. Note that the latter uses Panel VAR and RNN-LSTM, respectively, a traditional
    and a cutting-edge technique for time series, thus highlighting the solution flexibility
    in exploring different ML techniques as they gain relevance. Irrigation Planning
    and Operation The water need estimation models provide what can be called the
    ideal irrigation. There are, however, other aspects that need to be considered
    when conceiving an actual irrigation plan, that is, a plan that can be put in
    place in the farm, which include: Water availability: Water scarcity is a problem
    in various parts of the planet. Water quotas or supply schedules might not allow
    the ideal amount of water to be irrigated in time. If the needed amount of water
    is not available, the irrigation plan should allocate the existing water so that
    the best economic return to the farmer is achieved. Costs of irrigation: Even
    if the water comes from private reservoirs, irrigation is not free. Pumping the
    water to the fields consumes energy, and its cost has an impact on the farmer''s
    bottom line. For example, in certain regions of Brazil, the energy bill can account
    for up to 30 percent of the production cost. A cost-aware plan should avoid irrigation
    when tariffs are higher. Limitation of the irrigation systems: Irrigation methods
    differ in how much of the irrigated water actually reaches the plants: furrow
    irrigation has 60 percent efficiency, while sprinkler irrigation reaches 75 percent
    [12]. Other aspects of the irrigation infrastructure need to be considered when
    planning: maximum pumping capacity of the farm, uniformity of irrigation, and
    soil variability, among others. Figure 3 presents a modular approach that separates
    irrigation planning from operation, completing the data flow shown in Fig. 2.
    There are three main modules: Irrigation planning: Computes the timing and water
    volume of irrigation events that best address the crop needs, while being aware
    of operational constraints and economic interests. Linear and nonlinear programming
    techniques can be used, as well as approximate solutions such as those provided
    by metaheuristics [13]. Irrigation operation: Communicates with the sensors and
    actuators installed in the farms, sending commands and monitoring the operation
    to ensure adherence to the plan. It controls the opening and closing of valves,
    the pressure at pumps, and so on, using the underlying IoT communication infrastructure
    to send commands. The use of standard IoT interfaces and protocols enables on-demand
    addition of sensors and actuators, smoothing the transition toward fully automated
    irrigation. System Model: Computes an updated model of the system behavior as
    far as irrigation is concerned. IoT devices (e.g., soil sensors, water meters)
    in combination with data-driven techniques enable estimating the actual irrigation
    efficiency, and planning accordingly. Figure 3. General data flow between irrigation
    services. Show All Discussion and Lessons Learned Physical Models vs. Machine
    Learning The increasing use of IoT in precision irrigation brings spatial and
    temporal accuracy gain, as sensors can potentially be placed in all manageable
    locations on a farm. Thus, site-specific particularities can easily be considered,
    leveraging the exploration of data-driven approaches. In this context, the question
    of what would be the right combination of techniques to deliver adequate soil
    water management emerges. Do traditional approaches, such as using physical models
    or triggering soil moisture sensors data [7], still take place? Or is this the
    time to avoid physical models and use cutting-edge ML algorithms acting directly
    to data? Our vision is that there is no unique ideal analytical approach for all
    cases, as crops differ significantly in irrigation methods and in crop, soil,
    and regional weather characteristics. More than that, depending on crop culture
    or region, not all data features might be available or cost-effective. However,
    a discussion of the roles traditional and ML approaches can play in effective
    solutions can provide guidelines to discern the most appropriate alternatives
    to each application case. Physical models have been extensively used in irrigation,
    bringing implicit agronomic knowledge, as they connect raw data features to specific
    and relevant features. Nevertheless, there are important limitations, as general
    models involve simplifications that often ignore local particularities, while
    site-specific models work well only regionally, and few models have adequate performance
    levels for different regions. Finally, the few models of general application that
    are flexible enough to address different conditions [7] are often complex and
    require many data features that are difficult to obtain. On the other hand, pure
    ML approaches applied directly to IoT data seem promising, as cutting-edge deep
    learning is capable of capturing implicit knowledge from raw data in many application
    areas, as well as delivering highly customizable results [14]. For this reason,
    we believe that ML approaches will be extensively explored in scientific research
    in the coming years, allowing the emergence of truly cognitive smart irrigation
    systems. As such, our architecture approach, based on core components and deployment
    locations, gives the necessary flexibility not only to build customizable IoT-ML
    solutions, but also to assemble customizable data-driven solutions. For smart
    irrigation, we have shown that it is possible to use various combinations of analytical
    tools, including mixes of physical models, simulation (traditional approaches),
    and ML techniques. As ML gains momentum, existing physical models may lose room
    because ML could implicitly capture from raw data the same information physical
    models provide. Instead, IoT''s continuous growth might enhance the utilization
    of physical models, as they can calculate their outputs with better spatial and
    temporal granularity. Also, IoT tends to promote not only physical models but
    also ML. In summary, a futuristic vision may be that ML is well positioned for
    IoT-based applications. However, although ML seems to have a promising future
    for smart irrigation, we are still at the beginning of its exploration, and we
    need reliable data that now is still generated by physical models or a combination
    of data and ML techniques. All in all, considering the advantages and disadvantages
    of each side, we advocate that current solutions consider using both physical
    models and ML algorithms – physical models serving as feature engineering for
    ML approaches. We believe that physical models can aggregate agronomic knowledge
    that ML algorithms eventually cannot capture yet directly from raw data. Finally,
    as different physical models can potentially capture different aspects of reality,
    we recommend using multiple physical models, even for similar tasks. Then ML will
    hold the task of capturing valuable information from the features provided by
    the physical models to deliver more precise water need estimation. Integrating
    Different Stakeholders The approach taken is the result of a joint and largely
    interdisciplinary effort, and the authors'' ambition is to generate an impact
    on a wide community of stakeholders with the envisioned innovation. On one hand,
    the interoperability at the communication level provided by IoT is a key factor
    to promote a platform culture among not-computer-scientists, as it brings easy
    node deployment, data collection, and inter-researcher interaction. On the other
    hand, only with our flexible architecture approach due to the heterogeneities
    embedded in the agricultural scenario – heterogeneity of devices and simulation
    tools, but also farms and the stakeholders themselves – can the barriers be properly
    handled. Different stakeholders speak their own languages: for example, soil-moisture
    sensor data are numbers for computer scientists, bits for telecommunication professionals,
    voltage signals for electronic engineers, while the end users expect volumetric
    soil moisture values. As the calibration of these sensors is soil-type-dependent,
    geologists, agronomists, and other researchers must take part in the game of this
    context-dependent calibration process. Altogether, the smooth interplay between
    actors with different skills and habits is a key success factor. Each stakeholder
    needs specific and mostly mobile services, with the appropriate human-machine
    interface, if we want to deploy the appropriate level of automation with the man
    in the loop, as required in today''s agriculture. Services need to be organized
    like a chain of tools that mutually exchange information and understand each other
    thanks to a shared information model based on emerging ontologies. This shared
    data model fosters smooth and sustainable innovation because the tool chain may
    easily be extended to provide new capabilities and value propositions, and attract
    new stakeholders. Impacts For IoT Professionals Our approach incorporates the
    ML pipeline into the IoT continuum by using a structure of services deployed as
    containers that exchange messages through the FIWARE NGSI unified data model.
    This scheme impacts IoT platform development and deployment in many aspects: Automation:
    The platform provides a subscribe/notify mechanism for building automated data
    pipelines. Traceability: The storing of meta-data information about the model
    specifications and context of data used in the estimation allows keeping track
    of model forecasts, as well as quality indicators. Pluggability: The integration
    of new or updated models is facilitated by the unified data model, consuming data
    and producing water need estimates in a standard way. Flexibility: The pluggability
    allows IoT professionals to compose different data workflows flexibly by using
    various components. Hybrid environments: The architecture allows the use of different
    ML frameworks to train models, as well as hardcoded physical models. All these
    aspects have been allowing a relatively simple deployment of our platform in all
    SWAMP pilots, each one with its characteristics and different specific goals.
    In Italy, the goal is to use farm data for water management and distribution (i.e.,
    to share data outside the farm to create an even bigger system-of-systems). In
    Spain, the goal is to explore the limits of flexibility and precision in irrigation
    by going into a very fine-grained irrigation system where each sprinkler is an
    IoT node. In Bahia, Brazil, there is a large-scale use case with huge center-pivot
    irrigation systems, where the goal is to decrease operational costs through improved
    situational awareness. Near São Paulo, Brazil, the goal is to improve the quality
    of grapes and wine. For Farmers Currently, in modern farms that rely on physical
    water need estimation models and respect soil variability, farmers are provided
    with irrigation plans for long periods, such as weeks, months, or even the entire
    season. Based on their accumulated experience and daily work in the field, they
    continuously adapt the irrigation plan to avoid crops suffering from water stress.
    In this scenario, the irrigation plan plays the role of an offline longer-term
    forecast that needs to be fitted into the reality of the farm. In a fully automated
    future agriculture scenario, the IoT-based smart irrigation system will precisely
    control every aspect of the use of water, adapting it to shorter-term periods
    according to instantaneous information coming from the field, which can be daily
    or even based on intra-day micro adjustments in the irrigation plan. Between these
    two scenarios – current and future – lies a new IoT-enabled reality that will
    change the way farmers face irrigation. In any case, a requirement is that farmers
    always control the irrigation and are provided a wealth of real-time information
    to be able to make better decisions. To this end, we developed a smartphone app
    (Fig. 4) where farmers are informed of immediate water needs (Fig. 4a), measured
    and forecast water balance time series (Figure 4b), and the current soil moisture
    information for a 3-depth sensor probe (Fig. 4c). With this real-time status of
    the farm at hand, and equipped with the optimized irrigation plans computed by
    the system, the farmer can achieve better use of the water resources without harming
    productivity. Figure 4. Farmer application screenshots. Show All As the system
    reliability and precision increase and earn the trust of farmers, they can slowly
    give more power to the system to make automated decisions. In other words, the
    application will allow farmers to express policies on how to behave whenever a
    new irrigation plan is generated. Conclusion In this article, we present our flexible
    IoT-ML platform and highlight its scientific contribution over related work. The
    platform allows easy solution deployment involving IoT and ML components working
    in an application. Our real case is a smart irrigation application, where we exemplify
    how a solution can be built and customized depending on site-specific needs. Special
    attention was given to how the platform enables more exploration of ML-based solutions
    and on how it can positively impact IoT professionals'' and farmers'' needs. SWAMP
    project pilots have just been deployed; they are operating properly, and data
    is being collected. The next step, expected by the end of 2020, is to analyze
    the data and disseminate quantitative impact results. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research

    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\

    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\

    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\

    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\

    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    \ are helping to make water management smarter\nand optimizing consumption in\
    \ the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology\nof sensor\
    \ nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efﬁcient components, such as\
    \ water level,\nsoil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally,\
    \ to guarantee good performance\nof the system, the used transmission module is\
    \ based on LoRa LPWAN technology. The design of the\nmain circuit board of the\
    \ system is optimized by combining two layers and implementing software\noptimization.\
    \ The overall sensor network is developed and tested in the research lab, and\
    \ real farms\ncan be controlled by users manually or automatically using the mobile\
    \ application. Experimental\nresults are produced by testing sensor and communication\
    \ link effectiveness, and are subsequently\nvalidated in the ﬁeld through a one-week\
    \ measurement campaign.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); water management;\
    \ smart agriculture; LoRa; LPWAN; sensor\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) technology, which is known as the center of the Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ has continuously grown in recent years. An advantage of WSNs is their ability\
    \ to easily\ndeﬁne a network of devices that can be communicated with and gathered\
    \ from a monitored ﬁeld\nthrough communication links since the information is\
    \ sent through multiple nodes with a gateway and\nconnected to other networks\
    \ like wireless Ethernet. Many researchers have applied WSNs to different\nresearch\
    \ areas, such as environmental monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, smart cities,\
    \ smart education,\nhealthcare, agricultural control, water quality monitoring,\
    \ military uses, and asset management [1–9].\nAccordingly, WSNs are suitable for\
    \ multiple applications. The long range (LoRa) LPWAN is one\nnovel IoT communication\
    \ technology with an excellent capacity for development that is applied in\nmany\
    \ ﬁelds. The beneﬁts of this technology can be attributed to its capabilities\
    \ of ultra-long-distance\ncommunication, low power consumption, and ease of deployment,\
    \ among others.\nIn agriculture, environmental monitoring is required to control\
    \ speciﬁc plant conditions.\nBy collecting approximate values of available data\
    \ and making more accurate estimates, a WSN\ncan be used to achieve this task.\
    \ In addition, many agriculture researchers apply WSNs to monitor\nenvironmental\
    \ criteria [2–6]. In addition to standard environmental conditions such as temperature,\n\

    \ such as the ability to control the water level or temperature level are\nthe\
    \ subject of research in an agricultural environment [10].\nWater management and\
    \ optimal water supply have become popular topics in the ﬁeld of smart\nagriculture\
    \ and are being studied and developed by many researchers. Over the years, prominent\n\
    researchers in the ﬁeld of smart agriculture have written many survey articles\
    \ which introduce the\nresearch methodology for various communication technologies\
    \ that control resources efﬁciently based\non IoT technology [11–13]. We summarize\
    \ and compare our model with the existing literature in\nTable 1. In Vietnam,\
    \ agricultural production has transformed the country’s socioeconomic status\n\
    by alleviating national food insecurity, reducing poverty, fostering agrarian\
    \ exports, and providing\nlivelihoods to nearly half of the labor force nationwide.\
    \ These are just some examples, since WSN is\nactively applied to various functions\
    \ such as smart cities, waste management, and waste collection\nwith LoRaWan technology\
    \ [14–16].\nTable 1. A comparisons of our model with existing literature.\nModel\n\

    \ work on WSN in smart\nagriculture, clariﬁcations on issues of water management,\
    \ and essential tasks to be completed. Section 3\npresents details of the architecture\
    \ of the IoT proposed system. Section 4 presents the operational tests\ncomposed\
    \ of two different tasks, while Section 5 discusses the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of our\npolicy. Finally, some concluding observations and a way forward are\
    \ offered in Section 6.\n2. Smart Agriculture and Related Works\nAs it possesses\
    \ the advantage of critical natural resources, Vietnam is an agricultural country\
    \ that\nis growing very quickly. Agriculture plays an essential role in the Vietnamese\
    \ economy and contributes\nto the country’s economic development currently and\
    \ in the future. Agriculture is one of the critical\nindustrial sectors of Vietnam,\
    \ and economic growth depends heavily on agriculture. The population of\nVietnam\
    \ will rise to reach 100 million people by 2020, while the demand for agricultural\
    \ products such\nas food crops (e.g., sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, and corn)\
    \ rice, coffee, pepper, cashew nut, rubber,\ntea, fruit, and vegetables continues\
    \ to increase dramatically. Combined with the effects of climate\nchange, these\
    \ demands place even more strain upon land, water, energy, and other resources\
    \ that are\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n3 of 22\nalready inﬂuenced. Several\
    \ smart solutions can be co-optimized and scaled up to improve yields and\nmeet\
    \ growing food production demands while transporting power and water resources\
    \ efﬁciently [17].\nMany articles depict the close relationship between smart\
    \ agriculture and IoT/WSN.\nResearchers focus on how this high-tech improvement\
    \ can be employed to develop effective smart\nsystems and data transmission [8,18].\n\
    The authors of [18] present a SmartFarmNet framework, based on the IoT platform\
    \ that can\nautomate the collection of environmental, fertilizer, soil, and irrigation\
    \ data; automatically correlate\nthat data and evaluate product performance; and\
    \ calculate product estimates and suggest speciﬁc\nproducts for any particular\
    \ farm. Importantly, IoT devices can be integrated into this platform as\nsensors,\
    \ cameras, and weather stations. Produced data can then be saved in the cloud\
    \ to enable\nperformance analysis and and recommendations.\nWith the help of IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4, which is a suite of high-level communication technology, artiﬁcial\n\
    intelligence, and decision support technology, the authors of [19] have developed\
    \ research on the\nagricultural application of IoT technology to monitor real-time\
    \ moisture and nutrients of citrus, along\nwith an analysis of the combination\
    \ of fertilizer support systems and irrigation. However, this research\nhas weaknesses,\
    \ which include system complexity and high costs. The authors of [20] also present\n\
    a narrow-band radio channel model whereby the communication link transfers under\
    \ near-ground\nrequirements for a smart agriculture platform.\nThe solution presented\
    \ in [21] was developed by implementing machine learning applications\non agriculture\
    \ datasets for smart farm improvement. By employing and comparing numerous\nmachine\
    \ learning methods to recommend the best solution, this system enabled the investigation\n\
    and deployment of useful jobs, varying from crop yield forecasting to missing\
    \ or incorrect sensor\ndata reconstruction. However, the only reasonable application\
    \ for this scenario is smart agriculture,\nsince three different resources are\
    \ available: the CRN scientiﬁc dataset, Istat statistical dataset, and the\nIoT\
    \ sensor manufacturing dataset.\nMany researchers and developers have chosen microcontroller\
    \ boards (e.g., Arduino boards) or\nRaspberry Pi for IoT applications. These allow\
    \ real-time monitoring, collection, data management,\nsecurity, and remote control\
    \ functions using the mobile app because of the suitable platforms available\n\
    for Internet-connected sensor buttons. This option is often challenging because\
    \ it entails a trade-off\nbetween cost, performance, and functionality for each\
    \ speciﬁc application project. Water management\ninvolves a valuable resource.\
    \ If an attacker controlled the system, entire crops could be destroyed\ndue to\
    \ altered irrigation levels. A denial of service (DoS) attack on sensors, irrigation\
    \ actuators,\nor distribution systems could affect system-wide operations. Changes\
    \ to sensor settings may also\nissue a warning that could cause networks or decision\
    \ producers to perform illegal actions and yield\nmonths of efforts and production\
    \ aims. If an attacker gains control of the actuators, irrigation and\nwater distribution\
    \ may be compromised and result in the incorrect irrigation of certain products.\n\
    Furthermore, eavesdropping may give criminals access to secret data about the\
    \ farm. They could\nremove productivity information and even manipulate the commodity\
    \ business, which represents an\neven more signiﬁcant threat. Self-governing vehicles,\
    \ drones, and engines utilized to collect images or\ncontrol manufacturing must\
    \ also be kept classiﬁed. An unauthorized node in the network can send\nincorrect\
    \ information about a crop. However, the authors only present the challenges to\
    \ security in\nsmart agriculture, and do not discuss how to overcome challenges\
    \ [22].\nA smart agriculture system was constructed to use low-power Bluetooth\
    \ and LPWAN\ncommunication technologies, including the wire-based communication\
    \ technology used in the existing\nfarm in [23]. This was combined with microcontrollers\
    \ such as an Arduino UNO board or Raspberry Pi\nboard. The administrator receives\
    \ data from sensor connections, and then stores the data, analyzes it,\nand provides\
    \ a user interface to monitor it. A related study [24] explains how an approach\
    \ to using IoT\nand cloud computing that incorporates development is helping to\
    \ quickly modernize agriculture and\nto realize smart solutions for agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, to solve problems regarding more practical issues\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n4 of 22\nrelated to farmers, sensors can be applied for use\
    \ in the IoT system. Furthermore, 2G and 3G wireless\nbroadband networks can be\
    \ used for communication between other components in the IoT system.\nSeveral\
    \ enabling technologies are adapted to present smart platform projects, which\
    \ are able\nto collect and manage data handling problems related to water management\
    \ in smart agriculture.\nFor example, the SWAMP project is a platform architecture\
    \ that includes a scenario-based development\nprocess for the obtained systems\
    \ in [25]. Moreover, the platform develops and assesses smart water\nmanagement\
    \ for precision irrigation in agriculture with a practical method based on four\
    \ pilots in\nBrazil, Italy, and Spain. The structure of SWAMP can be developed\
    \ for different solutions to deal\nwith the requirements of different contexts,\
    \ countries, climates, soils, and crops. Indeed, considerable\nﬂexibility is required\
    \ to adapt to a range of deployment conﬁgurations, including a diverse mix of\n\
    technologies. Unfortunately, for this platform, it is not possible to use without\
    \ the license and to do\nthis. The different IoT smart platforms presented in\
    \ [26] propose the use of cloud-based technology\nto manage the collection, analysis,\
    \ and forecast of agricultural environmental information in one\nuniversal system.\
    \ Besides the introduction of the platform, the author of the paper also presented\
    \ LoRa\ncommunication and applied it to the studied network, and although details\
    \ were not provided on the\nhardware used to do this. In summary, both studies\
    \ presented interesting suggestions and suitable\nplatforms for application to\
    \ smart agriculture.\nOther authors have focused on completing a systematic literature\
    \ review of IoT research and\ndeployments in protected agriculture over the past\
    \ ten years, in which they evaluate the contributions\nmade by various researchers\
    \ and organizations. Moreover, the structure of IoT is also detailed in\nprotected\
    \ agriculture, including the used platforms, modern wireless technologies, cloud\
    \ computing,\nmachine learning, big data, animal farming, hardware, software challenges,\
    \ and so on [27].\nAnother paper [28] proposes an IoT idea-based solution for\
    \ smart farming, where the authors\nproposed stack and discuss the current improvements.\n\
    They mainly focus on the IoT/M2M\ninteraction and explain the design and development\
    \ of a gateway that discusses the provided\nservices. Notably, in [29], the Web\
    \ of Things (WoT) was proposed as an idea to use environmental\nmonitoring and\
    \ enhance agricultural practices by supporting decision-making based on bio-data\n\
    collection. The paper brieﬂy presents the original design, which is a middleware\
    \ platform for IoT\nthat performs separation by understanding opportunistic networking\
    \ and computing operations.\nAccordingly, it is able to detect and control environmental\
    \ targets using web-based technologies.\nMeanwhile, the use of IoT for smart precision\
    \ agriculture for rural areas is proposed in [30]. In this\npaper, the authors\
    \ focus on a scalable network architecture for real-time monitoring of agriculture\
    \ in\nrural areas. A possible strategy is to optimize each element of the system\
    \ to reduce system latency\nup to a particular area. A solution [31] was proposed\
    \ by implementing a framework for managing,\ninvestigating, and sharing groundwater\
    \ data, with the use of sensors to gather data on groundwater\nlevels, pump sensors,\
    \ and weather conditions.\nIn [32], electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis is presented\
    \ as an enhanced monitoring approach for\nsubsurface radio wave propagation and\
    \ underground sensing applications in the ﬁeld of prediction\nagriculture. However,\
    \ this technology is challenging to implement in complex real environments,\n\
    which may delay system deployment. The prediction of the agriculture model presented\
    \ by [33]\noffers solution management capabilities by monitoring soil conditions\
    \ in real time using underground\nwireless sensors. Furthermore, the structure\
    \ used two types of communication links, above-ground\nand underground, for the\
    \ experiments. However, other challenges need to be solved, such as reducing\n\
    energy loss and promoting energy efﬁciency. These nodes should be able to adapt\
    \ to the soil moisture\nand temperature changes of the environment, among others.\n\
    More recently, the authors in [8] proposed an irrigation system that combines\
    \ IoT and data\nanalysis for the collection of environment data and control of\
    \ the farm via web and mobile applications.\nHowever, this article faced challenges\
    \ in controlling water in the farm. After analyzing state-of-the-art\nresearch\
    \ on water management and smart agriculture that applies IoT and related technology,\n\
    the following outcomes are drawn:\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n5 of 22\n\
    •\nMany popular systems and platforms can be used for water management in smart\
    \ agriculture,\nbut may be too expensive for the average farmer [28–31].\n•\n\
    The combination of multiple technologies in one system and the presence of limitations\
    \ leads to\ncomplexity when combining proprietary technologies. Moreover, many\
    \ factors affect the price\n(e.g., farm, hardware design, and guiding documentation),\
    \ although a basic package costs a\nminimum of $500 in [28–31].\n•\nAll IoT smart\
    \ agriculture solutions on the market are Most IoT smart agriculture products\
    \ are\npassive methods (i.e., manual). In some cases, they are connected to farm\
    \ monitoring devices to\nact smartly.\n•\nMany researchers have presented solutions\
    \ for smart agriculture systems. However, these\nmethods are restricted by the\
    \ design-embedded board and the inﬂexibility of devices, as it\nmay be necessary\
    \ to attach additional sensors or to control two or more farms with the same\n\
    mobile application.\nTherefore, we proposal a novel system to address the four\
    \ above points:\n1.\nThe standard IoT water management system is explained and\
    \ designed. It can connect to the\nInternet through LoRa communication both manually\
    \ and automatically with all hardware\ndesigns. The IoT box is designed to manage\
    \ the IoT devices and obtain data from the farms.\n2.\nA system is possible connected\
    \ the agriculture from farming based on rural areas efﬁciency\nto IoT system.\
    \ Additionally, the implemented system is a good alternative for analyzing the\n\
    communication between the gateway and nodes 1 and 2.\n3.\nOur smart watering system\
    \ receives real-time data input from sensors embedded in a farm tunnel\nand other\
    \ locations. The system then offers suggestions for watering schedules and capacity.\n\
    An advantage provided by the sensors, used for two farms, are the transmission\
    \ of an evaluation\nto the user’s mobile application, from where users can prepare\
    \ a watering plan for the farms.\n4.\nFinally, our smart watering system is scheduled\
    \ to a date and time which guarantees that the\nwater level falls below the threshold\
    \ in the tunnel farm. The system notiﬁes the user and switches\non the water pump\
    \ (manual or automatic) in time to water the plants.\n3. System Architecture\n\
    The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the real-time monitoring of\
    \ water management\nthat optimizes power consumption.\nAn additional target is\
    \ a cost-saving in smart agriculture.\nThe critical element that affects energy\
    \ dissipation in the sensor nodes is the transmitting module.\nAs a design operation,\
    \ it focuses on the structure of the sensor node and the meaning of the network\n\
    sensor architecture. Finally, the determination of effective data transfer technology\
    \ is geared towards\nimplementing an energy-efﬁcient sensor node. The details\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.1.\nHowever, most of the smart agriculture ﬁeld if\
    \ the data are the crucial importance in the node,\nwhere the users could be easily\
    \ chosen by operating more comfortable components. Therefore,\nthe micro-controller\
    \ must be selected to guarantee a suitable trade-off between energy efﬁciency\n\
    and complexity. Finally, elements must be selected to consider the optimal agreement\
    \ between\nmeasured data accuracy, expected energy to carry out that task, and\
    \ price, thus prioritizing the use of\nsensors. As a result, the power of the\
    \ sensors becomes an important factor for energy consumption\nand longevity. The\
    \ proposed IoT node in our system is constructed following these requirements.\n\
    First, the choice made regarding essential elements is a single-chip micro-controller\
    \ such as an\nATmega328/P or ATmega2560. A reasonable choice is to provide simple\
    \ open-source software to allow\nthe user to observe and boost their conﬁdence\
    \ in the programming. Second, it uses a lower number\nof clock cycles to execute\
    \ instructions than others—all of the sensors and the developed single-board\n\
    microcontroller, where all of the devices are integrated. Third, after reviewing\
    \ the start-of-the-art of\nthe relevant technology, the best option is the LoRa\
    \ technology, as it provides IoT connectivity over\nlarge areas by enabling data\
    \ transmission across an extended range. It uses very little power, is robust\n\
    in a rural area, and uses an overall network architecture that was developed in\
    \ a smart agriculture\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n6 of 22\nsituation.\
    \ Finally, low-cost and low-power sensors were selected to provide an excellent\
    \ balance\nbetween measurement accuracy and energy efﬁciency.\nOur paper introduces\
    \ a reliable, robust, cost-effective, and scalable smart agriculture solution\n\
    based on IoT technology. The architecture system is presented in Figure 1, which\
    \ presents three\nnode prototypes: the gateway, node 1 and sensor node 1, and\
    \ node 2. The ﬂow diagram shown in\nFigure 2 demonstrates how to manage data transmission\
    \ between the gateway, node 1, and node 2 of\nour system.\n•\nThe gateway performs\
    \ the core functions of data collection from the nodes via LoRa, and then\nsends\
    \ data to the cloud, via the WiFi ESP82666 module, and to the mobile application.\
    \ Moreover,\nusers can also control the node throughout the gateway with the use\
    \ of the mobile app.\n•\nNode 1 and sensor node 1 are designed for this case,\
    \ as we assumed that the water pump machine\nis far from the sensor location.\n\
    •\nNode 2 was designed for orchard conditioners, with a topographic condition\
    \ suitable for installing\npumps directly in the farm without separating the sensor\
    \ block.\nFarm 1\nFarm 2\nGateWay\nNode 1\nSensor node 1\nNode 2\nFigure 1. Block\

    this power has to convert toward the expected form with normal voltage range for\
    \ storing power\nsupply to different kinds of devices in the IoT proposed node.\
    \ Based on the requirement of the\npower IoT system that the microcontroller and\
    \ the communication module need 5 V and 3.3 V for\nthe powering system with receive\
    \ node, respectively. It is necessary to include voltage regulators\ninside the\
    \ node. For that reason, two voltage regulators employ a 5 V regulator that powers\
    \ sensors of\nFigures 3–5 and a 3.3 V one which powers the powering system for\

    \ is combined of a LoRa module and WiFi ESP8266 module, and ATmega2560. Figure\

    \ how all device elements are\nconnected: the LoRa transmission module, WiFi ESP8266\
    \ module, ATmega2560, and power system for\nGateway. Figures 6 and 7a show the\
    \ Electronic schematic and Gateway’s prototype, which includes\nthe sub-section\
    \ mentioned as below:\n3.2.1. Transmitter Module\nAs mentioned previously, the\
    \ transmitter module performs a vital concern in energy consumption\noptimization.\
    \ Hence, it has to be precisely selected and prospered. The IoT proposed node\
    \ is proposed\nto be used outside and spread over a rural area. Since radio communication\
    \ link solutions must be\nexplored, this needs to be taken into account. In fact,\
    \ it is unthinkable for something like this to have\na wirework connection (e.g.,\
    \ LAN) in large quantities at each node. An IoT application has many\ncommunication\
    \ networks where the sensor system is proposed. These systems are working based\
    \ on\nvarious radio technologies. Table 2 shows a measurement of the available\
    \ technologies, along with\ntheir essential features. The vital functions such\
    \ as area, consumption, and availability are accentuated\nin this table because\
    \ they are crucial parts for developing the device. After reviewing the technical\n\
    aspects as presented in this paper, the selection for data transmission technology\

    \ 6. Electronic schematic of the Gateway and Node 1.\nConsidering all of these\
    \ previous technologies, there are mean ﬂexible options for the achievement\n\
    of IoT nodes. The most signiﬁcant selection has to be carefully studied as it\
    \ is easy to change\nthe hardware, implementation, and long-lasting quality over\
    \ time. The one recommended in our\narticle, which is a solution for the real-time\
    \ monitoring of controlling the level of water and resulting\nhypothesis, shows\
    \ as:\n•\nThe IoT node system is expected to be deployed for two nodes with the\
    \ distance between two\nnodes being a few km with complex terrain in rural areas.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of the system needs\nto reduce to the lowest level possible,\
    \ and the support services need to be optimized:\n•\nThe coverage of our system\
    \ to around tens of km2;\n•\nThe lower power consumption is composed possibly\
    \ for an adaptive data rate and changes\nthe output bit rate. Moreover, it depends\
    \ on payload combined with chirp spread spectrum\ntechnology that effectively\
    \ gives processing gain. In addition, LoRa Technology can easily plug\ninto existing\
    \ infrastructure and enables low-cost battery-operated IoT applications.\nAfter\
    \ reviewing these simple highlights, it can deﬁne the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\
    \ the leading\nfour communication networks released for the previously outlined:\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n10 of 22\n(a) Gateway\n(b) Node 1\nFigure\
    \ 7. Prototype of the gateway and Node 1.\n•\nLocal Area Networks (LAN): The ad\
    \ hoc’s area coverage is signiﬁcantly more than other carrier\nnetwork technologies.\
    \ However, it still has some disadvantages. Applying the radio technology\nnetwork\
    \ for our system: for instance, WiFi or BLE technology set up, requires a signiﬁcant\
    \ number\nof nodes for the system. It will noticeably change the overall cost\
    \ of the deployed infrastructure.\nA different choice might be to implement a\
    \ ZigBee network or BLE technology. Because the system\nis not energy efﬁcient,\
    \ and admits a signiﬁcant decrease in the power consumption of the\nend device\
    \ nodes, this means that, although their current absorption levels are relatively\
    \ low\n(40 mA [35]), their life expectancy provided by batteries is in some order.\n\
    •\nLow Power Consumption (LPWAN): The authors in [36] proposed characterizing\
    \ great Area\nNetworks LPWAN solutions as their more extensive transmission range\
    \ allows for the\nestablishment of a star or multi-star network with some APs.\
    \ Allowing the sensor node to\nuse the chief duty-cycling policies allows for\
    \ turning off buttons for long periods. Finally, the\nprice of this technology\
    \ is meager when agreeing to use them in large quantities at no extra charge\n\
    as in the situation of ISP co-operation.\n•\nGlobal Area Networks (GAN): The global\
    \ network is the most simple solution to deploy because\nit does not need access\
    \ points or speciﬁc infrastructure implementations. Unfortunately, it has\nmany\
    \ other essential features, the ﬁrst being the price: 3G technologies; still,\
    \ the lowest of different\ntechniques is always more expensive than other solutions.\
    \ Furthermore, SIM is used, so\nthey need subscription payments when preparing\
    \ to deploy many of nodes and become\ninsigniﬁcant. Additionally, the energy consumption\
    \ needs to take into consideration that the\naverage modern consumption of the\
    \ third-generation mobile cellular system is many times higher\nthan that of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [37]. Alternatively, a low-power wide-area network module [38]\n\
    may be considered; however, obtaining it is unsuitable for applications with low\
    \ energy use.\nFinally, in the rural areas, some ISP cannot support the Internet\
    \ service for the users.\n•\nNarrowband-Internet of Things:\nNB-IoT is the novel\
    \ technology with a short form of\nNarrowband-Internet of Things and speciﬁed\
    \ in LTE Release-13 [39]. It is developed to meet\nthe requirements of LPWA (Low-Power\
    \ Wide-Area) networks. NB-IoT has a wide variety of\napplications for many ﬁelds\
    \ such as personal, technology and industrial. The applications are\nwearables,\
    \ smart bicycles, event detectors, smart garbage bins, smart metering, smart agriculture,\n\
    and logistics tracking. Mainly, low power and long-range are the absolute essentials\
    \ for IoT\n(Internet of Things), which is a signiﬁcant concern with mainstream\
    \ cellular technologies.\nThe other advantages of the NB-IoT are scalability,\
    \ quality of service and safety related to\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n\
    11 of 22\nunlicensed LPWA networks and design, including the secure connections\
    \ between small energy\ndevices and a gateway.\nTable 3. Technical speciﬁcations\

    UART\n3.2.2. ATmega2560 Microcontroller\nIn this research, the nodes communicate\
    \ with each other via the UART interface. At the gateway,\nit is necessary to\
    \ use two UARTs (the ﬁrst one communicates with the ESP8266 module, and the other\n\
    one is used to communicate with two nodes. In Node 1, it is also necessary for\
    \ two UART interfaces to\ncollect data from the nodes and the gateway, since the\
    \ ATmega2560 is a reasonable choice [40].\n3.2.3. WiFi ESP8266 Module\nThe WiFi\
    \ ESP8266 module from [41–43] is the best choice because the ESP8266 is very ﬂexible\
    \ in\ndata transfer between devices and mobile applications, easy to integrate\
    \ into advanced projects, and\nadaptable within the Arduino embedded development\
    \ environment.\n3.3. Node 1 and Sensor Node 1\nThe same as in gateway, in this\
    \ node, an AC supply has to be converted towards the demanded\nform with the required\
    \ voltage range for storing power supply to various types of devices. We are\n\
    suggesting that the micro-controller and the transmission module need 5 V for\
    \ the powering system\nwith a receive node each, and it is necessary to incorporate\
    \ voltage regulators inside the node. Therefore,\ntwo voltage regulators use 5\
    \ V and 3.3 V regulators, which power the sensors in Figure 4 and the\npowering\
    \ system for the receiver node.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of Node 1, which\
    \ designs the case. It assumes that the water\npump is placed far away from the\
    \ sensor location since there is a sensor node to collect the data for\nNode 1.\
    \ Node 1 receives the data from sensor Node 1. Based on the sensor values, we\
    \ can deﬁne the\nvalue from the application and the sensors located at Node 1.\
    \ Moreover, in this node, there are two\nprimary sensors, which are the pump temperature\
    \ sensor and water level sensor. LoRa module on\nNode 1 communicates to the Gateway.\
    \ We also use RF HC12, a short-range wireless data transmission\nmodule whose\
    \ primary function is to receive data from sensor Node 1 transmitted to Node 1.\
    \ RFID\nperforms the central feature of controlling the pump directly at Node\
    \ 1 to increase the security of the\nsystem, and LCD is designed to display the\
    \ data of Node 1. Sensor Node 1 in Figure 5 shows the\nﬂowchart of details as\
    \ the node power is an external AC–DC converter with 7 V that gives sufﬁcient\n\
    current to power all the components.\nSection 3.3.1 illustrates the details of\
    \ the ATmega328 microcontroller and the sensors connected in\nFigure 8 for Node\

    \ Node 2.\n3.3.1. ATmega328 Microcontroller\nAll of those sensors require the\
    \ involvement of a micro-controller system to perform:\nthis component must be\
    \ implemented to trade off the price, power consumption, and performance\nenergy\
    \ results. According to most elements of low power, modern micro-controllers use\
    \ for a several\nmA, the effects of this element for the typical power consumption\
    \ of the node can be negligible,\nthus providing a higher level of independence\
    \ [43].\nBased on the principle diagram of Gateway and Node 1, it seems that both\
    \ have many common\npoints, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The best selection\
    \ in this study for the integrated design\nfor both Gateway and Node 1 is signiﬁcant.\
    \ Because they save on the costs of printed circuitry, achieve\nfaster circuit\
    \ machining, and quickly ﬁx hardware errors. Figure 6 shows the schematic of an\
    \ actuator\nGateway and Node 1, which contains: an AC–DC converter, ATmega2560,\
    \ LoRa transmission, RFID,\nLCD, and all the sensors. Note that, for the sake\
    \ of simplicity, we proposed all of the integrated circuits\ndepicted in the schematic.\
    \ After that, the printed circuit boards Gateway and Node 1 are designed\nwith\
    \ two layers of wires to make wiring more convenient and help optimize the circuit\
    \ as much as\npossible. The components are arranged in blocks with separate functions,\
    \ making it easier and more\nconvenient to check for errors.\nThe printed circuit\
    \ of Gateway and Node 1 is designed with:\n•\n62 components in which there are\
    \ 59 glued components and three pin components.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019,\
    \ 8, 45\n13 of 22\n•\nThe total number of different lines is 49 lines.\n•\nThere\
    \ are three different line sizes of 80 mils, 25, and 10 mils following different\
    \ wiring\nrequirements.\n•\nLine rules: do not cut wires, report faulty components\
    \ and the minimum distance between wires\nis 10 mm.\n•\nSize: 74.193 × 87.503\
    \ mm.\nFigure 7b shows the overall prototype of Node 1. Node 1 powers with a 5V\
    \ AC–DC converter that\nstores full current energy to control all the components\
    \ and the relay module. Furthermore, the LoRa\nmodule is not put close to the\
    \ converter because it generated the electrical noise and the interference of\n\
    communication links.\nWith the various parameters to be observed in our system,\
    \ in most cases, temperature,\ntemperature–humidity, soil moisture, rain, and\
    \ water level are measured.\n•\nTemperature sensor: DS18B20, [44], the popular\
    \ solution for temperature control in smart\nagriculture systems is the application\
    \ of standard digital sensors, for instance, DS18B20 integrated\ncircuits in this\
    \ research.\n•\nTemperature-humidity sensor: DHT22 [45] is a current sensor, which\
    \ combines the temperature\nand humidity sensor; it provides a wider temperature\
    \ range and better accuracy. In particular,\nit has low consumption and is better\
    \ for most smart farming systems.\n•\nSoil moisture sensor: SKU:SEN0193 [46],\
    \ this soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture levels\nby capacitive sensing\
    \ rather than resistive sensing like other sensors on the market. It is made of\n\
    corrosion-resistant material, which provides a good solution for the user. Moreover,\
    \ the sensor is\nsimple to use—an analog sensor that works at a low voltage.\n\
    •\nRain sensor: LM393, this is an analog sensor that operates at a low voltage,\
    \ and the current sensor\nis for easily detecting rain [47].\n•\nWater level and\
    \ temperature pump: LM393 [48]; this is an analog sensor when the water level\n\
    reaches below the threshold in the tunnel farm and checks the sensors. Our system\
    \ communicates\nto the user and establishes a water pump to its switch on the\
    \ state for sufﬁcient watering of plants\nthroughout a mobile application.\nFigure\
    \ 9 shows the sensor Node 1 electronic schematic, and how total hardware elements\
    \ are\nattached: microcontroller, power, and IC circuit. DS 1307 is used to read\
    \ the real-time with the high\naccuracy, LoRa module transfer data via a serial\
    \ connection, and the module connection is used to\nconnect RF HC12, RFID RC522,\
    \ LCD, sensors, pump, and ATmega2560. Figure 10a shows an actual\nmodel of sensor\
    \ Node 1.\nBesides the hardware, before being discussed, sensor Node 1 needs an\
    \ additional device to\noperate. The general important thing is the power subsystem.\
    \ In the case of the nodes, it was selected\nto power the nodes. Note that, in\
    \ this situation, we also can be used by the power supply unit, which\nis based\
    \ on a 12 W solar panel. The solar panel is linked to the solar charge controller,\
    \ where a solar\ncharge controller manages the power going into the battery.\n\

    \ Tests\nThe proposed smart agriculture system is evaluated using two different\
    \ scenarios in Vietnam:\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the sensors for the\
    \ analysis of temperature, solid humidity in\na research lab; and conﬁrming data\
    \ transmission by using the LoRa channel over a large area\nand distance.\n4.1.\
    \ Tests on the Sensors of the IoT\nThe ﬁrst scenario was set up in the Department\
    \ of Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering of Ton Duc Thang University,\
    \ Vietnam, where the sensing infrastructure was evaluated.\nThe performance of\
    \ the system was tested using a subset of nodes with the Arduino. These sensors\n\
    were used because the presence of other components would not affect the accuracy\
    \ of the measurement.\nIn addition, since the circuit board was furnished with\
    \ the equivalent microcontroller used in the node,\nthis circuit board was chosen\
    \ for speciﬁc tests due to its ease of use, as fast prototyping is required\n\
    and because it can exploit the equivalent microprogramming of an IoT button. Experiments\
    \ were\nperformed using the gate, button 1, and sensor button 1 and button 2 with\
    \ LoRa integrated with\nembedded sensors. An easy-to-read LCD screen was added\
    \ to the mainboard, where it displayed\nthe temperature and humidity measured\
    \ by the sensor as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Furthermore,\nthe accuracy of sensor\
    \ measurements was displayed and conﬁrmed on the LCD screen. Finally,\nsensors\
    \ were calibrated before the test to guarantee the accuracy of data, and to help\
    \ users to eliminate\ndifﬁculties during the setup process the system.\nJ. Sens.\

    sensors on the right.\n4.2. Test on Data Transmission through the LoRa Channel\n\
    In the second scenario, the effectiveness of the LoRa technology for the placement\
    \ of a farm\nmonitoring infrastructure was investigated by examining data transmission\
    \ distances in two real\nfarms as shown in Figure 13. For this purpose, a model\
    \ system infrastructure was set up in the Cho\nLach district, Ben Tre province,\
    \ Vietnam, to demonstrate the usability of an individual star topology\nnetwork\
    \ covering an entirely rural area. The model infrastructure was composed using\
    \ a gateway node\nproduced by a LoRa E32-TTL-1W module connected to a mobile application,\
    \ and by two sensor nodes.\nThe transmission modules were set up with three critical\
    \ measures: the symbol rate of information,\nthe bandwidth of the channel, and\
    \ the information rate were set according to the datasheet provided\nby the manufacturer\
    \ in order to obtain the highest sensitivity.\nBased on the sensor network structure\
    \ presented in the previous sections, the transmission\nranges were checked by\
    \ placing the gateway in the farm. The nodes were located in various areas:\n\
    node 1 covered 2000 m2 at a distance of 700 m from the gateway, while node 2 covered\
    \ 1000 m2 at a\ndistance of 500 m from the gateway. These positions were ﬁxed\
    \ and it was veriﬁed that the actual\ndata was correctly received. Subsequently,\
    \ data were collected from nodes 1 and 2 and sent to the\ngateway during the following\
    \ seven days of the same month, during which 24-h measurements were\nmade. In\
    \ this way, the performance of the system was tested. Figures 14 and 15 show the\
    \ results\nof the two nodes, which present the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\
    \ It can be observed\nthat, based on the threshold of these values, the system\
    \ could automatically switch on the water for\nthe farm. The experimental results\
    \ indicate that the application of a quick procedure for effective\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n17 of 22\nresolution building certainly helps to enhance\
    \ the outcomes of a sensor-based system. Not only does a\nsmart strategy improve\
    \ the performance of IoT-based and sensor-based systems, but the efﬁciency of\n\
    these systems can be increased with the smarter and more accurate choices made\
    \ by such intelligent\nsystems. Our experimental results highlight the procedure\
    \ used by the smart irrigation system to\nsave water in tunnel farming, thus achieving\
    \ higher productivity and the ability to ﬂexibly manage\nthe farm.\nFigure 13.\

    \ humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried out\
    \ on Node 1 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\nData transmission\
    \ is also a crucial issue in the IoT smart system in checking the effect of packet\
    \ loss.\nData transmission is tested by exploiting a model created by internal\
    \ sensors. Node 1, Node 2, and the\ngateway are connected through a LoRa module\
    \ in the prototype as described in Section 4.1. Packages\nare lost from all test\
    \ nodes during transmission. Although packet loss was observed whenever the\n\
    model moved between a test place, this is not a problem because the nodes are\
    \ expected to remain\nat the growing farms in the studied area. Therefore, LoRa\
    \ technology is proven to be effective when\ndeployed in rural areas, without\
    \ having to turn on acceleration mode on the transfer module shown\nin Figure\
    \ 13.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n18 of 22\nFigure 15. Collected soil\
    \ moisture, humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried\

    The smart agriculture system based on an IoT application has the following advantages\
    \ compared\nto the previous approaches:\n•\nThe system can be used to manage two\
    \ or more independent farms on the same mobile application,\nwhich may have different\
    \ growth schedules. The aim of this research was to use devices of the\nIoT system\
    \ with lower prices that are easy to obtain.\n•\nRemoving the need for WiFi on\
    \ the farm with the application of LoRa technology helps to save\nenergy, lower\
    \ costs, improve efﬁciency, and facilitate excellent communication between the\
    \ farm\nand gateway.\n•\nControl data are saved to the system memory to prevent\
    \ power outages that result in data loss.\nFurthermore, the multitude of control\
    \ modes makes it easier for users to manipulate the farm.\n•\nReal-time updates\
    \ are available directly from the Internet in order to enable the system to run\n\
    more accurately.\n•\nA lost WiFi connection can be detected and communicated to\
    \ users for timely processing.\n•\nMany different sensors are integrated to collect\
    \ information related to tree care in order to improve\ncrop productivity. Our\
    \ strategy studies ﬁve parameters: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level.\n•\nNone of the previously mentioned approaches discuss\
    \ and investigate the effect of energy\nconsumption in smart irrigation systems.\
    \ Furthermore, other methods frequently rely on soil\nmoisture to determine the\
    \ water needs of plants.\n•\nThe results of the test and the measurement of our\
    \ smart watering system approach the standard\nwatering procedure as a product\
    \ of high-tech application. It has an economic efﬁciency that is at\nleast 30%\
    \ higher than the used technology.\nIn addition to the advantages presented above,\
    \ our research also has disadvantages, which need\nto be overcome before widespread\
    \ application. For instance, the ESP8266 module is a mid-range\nmodule without\
    \ a high stability, while the system can lose an Internet connection and depends\
    \ on the\nBlynk application.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a solution using\
    \ LoRa module transmission for a low-cost and effective smart\nagriculture system\
    \ for use in Vietnam, which is designed and implemented to control environmental\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n19 of 22\nfactors in agriculture. It is less\
    \ expensive than other solutions with a similar accuracy. The system can\ncontinuously\
    \ observe the measured values and communicate them to users via a network and\
    \ mobile\napplication. Furthermore, the system can send alarms to users and activate\
    \ reduction devices. The IoT\nnode was tested in two separate cases in Cho Lach\
    \ district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam, and was used\nto measure distinct values\
    \ such as moisture, humidity, and temperature. Finally, experiments were\nperformed\
    \ to determine if the embedded electronics and the wireless communication module\
    \ might\ninﬂuence the collected values; there were no signs of interference. In\
    \ summary, the results conﬁrm\nthat the system provides the optimal solution to\
    \ users of smart agricultural control for farmers in\nVietnam. The availability\
    \ of real-time data enables quick use and management at all times from all\nplaces.\
    \ However, when IoT nodes are placed in various places, they generate huge quantities\
    \ of data.\nIn this case, our system requires time to store and analyze data before\
    \ ﬁnding the best solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-Y.N.,\

    \ devoted to process automation in\nagriculture. Regarding irrigation systems,\
    \ this demand has found several diﬃculties, including the\nlack of communication\
    \ networks and the large distances to electricity supply points. With the recent\n\
    implementation of LPWAN wireless communication networks (SIGFOX, LoraWan, and\
    \ NBIoT),\nand the expanding market of electronic controllers based on free software\
    \ and hardware (i.e.,\nArduino, Raspberry, ESP, etc.) with low energy requirements,\
    \ new perspectives have appeared\nfor the automation of agricultural irrigation\
    \ networks. This paper presents a low-cost solution for\nautomatic cloud-based\
    \ irrigation. In this paper, it is proposed the design of a node network based\
    \ on\nmicrocontroller ESP32-Lora and Internet connection through SIGFOX network.\
    \ The results obtained\nshow the stability and robustness of the designed system.\n\
    Keywords: LPWAN; free hardware; sensor networks; IOT platform\n1. Introduction\
    \ and Background\nIn modern farms, the competitiveness of the sector and the growing\
    \ demand for food [1] leads to\nan increase in water consumption, which requires\
    \ optimal water management strategies ([2,3]).\nThe optimization of irrigation\
    \ water consumption entails the improvement of crop development\nconditions through\
    \ irrigation planning: water quantity and scheduling. For this purpose, automatic\n\
    systems for monitoring variables and taking decisions are required.\n1.1. State\
    \ of the Art\nThe need for optimization in agriculture became a reality in the\
    \ 1970s. At the beginning,\nnon-standardized wired electronic solutions designed\
    \ ex professo were used. Since then,\nthe development of irrigation system optimization\
    \ has been closely linked to the rise and evolution of\nICT [4].\nThere has been\
    \ a trend in the last decade to implement intelligent irrigation management systems\n\
    based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [5], which have also been used in other\
    \ agriculture\nareas. The characteristics and potentialities of WSNs perfectly\
    \ match irrigation needs [6]. Presently,\nthe integration of the devices to local\
    \ communication networks, as well as to storing platforms,\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 2318; doi:10.3390/s19102318\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 2318\n2 of 20\nbig data and information processing in the cloud, enable them\
    \ to interact with other networks and the\nenvironment. [7,8] propose applications\
    \ of IoT and Cloud Computing in agriculture\nAmong the advantages of WSNs, we\
    \ can highlight the option of automating irrigation,\nsince networks allow taking\
    \ measurements (humidity, temperature, irradiance, etc.) and actions\n(solenoid\
    \ valves, pumps) through the diﬀerent independent electronic systems (nodes) that\
    \ compose\nthese networks.\nSeveral authors [5,9,10] have developed methodologies\
    \ for the analysis and\ndevelopment of eﬃcient networks based on needs assessment\
    \ for diﬀerent crops, soil attributes,\nclimate, etc. In [11] the authors developed\
    \ an application for smartphones to programme urban lawn\nirrigation by using\
    \ evapotranspiration data from weather stations. This proposal achieved a saving\n\
    of 48% of water in comparison to the previous irrigation system. In [12] the authors\
    \ monitored golf\ncourses and greenhouses by running an Android management application\
    \ using WSN. This kind of\ntools allows instant decision making for any event\
    \ and from any place.\nThe integration of WSN and decision-making systems enables\
    \ the development of irrigation\nplans based on energy savings, available water\
    \ or the reduction of greenhouse gases. In [13] the\nauthors developed an application\
    \ whose aim is to save costs in pumping stations by ﬁnding balances\nbetween the\
    \ ﬂow (the result of valve opening levels) and the pressure at diﬀerent points\
    \ of the system.\nFor this purpose, the authors implemented contrasted heuristic\
    \ models ([14–16]). In [17], a system\naimed at saving energy in irrigation facilities\
    \ by making real-time decisions based on data acquisition\nwas designed through\
    \ WSN. A fuzzy control to optimize WSN energy consumption by establishing\nwhen\
    \ to transmit the data collected [18]. In [19], the authors designed a multi-objective\
    \ optimization\nalgorithm to maximize beneﬁts in every irrigation plot while reducing\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions.\nWith the same purpose, we can ﬁnd works such as that\
    \ of [20] which are oriented towards the search\nfor pumping and monitoring systems\
    \ that are totally disconnected from the electricity grid system.\nThis is achieved\
    \ by means of a real time model that synchronizes the photovoltaic energy available\n\
    with the requirements for each sector.\nThanks to the automatic storage and the\
    \ analysis of the measured data, in [21] the authors\nproposed the elaboration\
    \ of databases from sensor measurements allowing the user of the application\n\
    to model the operation of the irrigation system. The deployment of these solutions\
    \ based on real-time\ndata availability requires wireless communication networks\
    \ both at local level and to the cloud.\nNetworks of distributed nodes in ﬁelds\
    \ and farms require speciﬁc attention since the quality of\ntransmissions among\
    \ devices needs to be ensured. The vegetative state of the crop canopy or the\
    \ shape\nof the soil are known to aﬀect the information loss rates in radio wave\
    \ transmissions. In this sense,\nthe works developed in ([22,23]) must be highlighted.\n\
    1.2. Typology of Communication Networks\nCommunications networks are classiﬁed\
    \ into three diﬀerent groups according to their range and\ntransmission speed\
    \ as shown in Figure 1 ([24,25]), namely:\n•\nShort-range networks.\n•\nCellular\
    \ networks.\n•\nLong-range networks.\nShort-range networks do not require a license\
    \ for use. This group includes ZigBee or Bluetooth,\namong others. They are characterized\
    \ by their low power consumption and high data exchange speed,\nalthough these\
    \ features are limited to a short range (Table 1). In [21] the authors used this\
    \ sort of\nnetworks for monitoring the irrigation infrastructure.\nCellular networks\
    \ outstand for a high transmission speed including short (Wi-Fi) and long-range\n\
    with license (GSM, GPRS, 3G, 4G, 5G). In [26] a tracking system for sprayers in\
    \ vineyards based on\nGSM and GPRS high data ﬂow was developed.\nLong-range networks\
    \ present as advantages to the previous two systems that they have lower\nenergy\
    \ consumption, lower cost and a greater range.\nSensors 2019, 19, 2318\n3 of 20\n\

    \ range in communication networks. Source: [27]. \nA new model of long-range wireless\
    \ networks, Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), \nhas been recently developed.\
    \ Its main feature is to have a star topology which has led to two models \nof\
    \ technological development [28]. On the one hand, several telecommunications\
    \ companies have \nused existing facilities (antennas, relay stations, etc.) to\
    \ offer coverage to devices compatible with \nthis technology [29]. On the other,\
    \ collaborative networks have emerged for the global integration of \nIoT applications\
    \ through low-cost open tools [30].  \nThis “ease of use” increases since electronics\
    \ companies, aware of the impulse of LPWANs, \nhave incorporated compatible communication\
    \ modules to the already known boards, thus \nfacilitating connectivity (e.g.,\
    \ Arduino MKR 1200, Arduino MKR 1300, Pycom Lopy 4, etc.).  \nLPWANs are very\
    \ promising for the development of a monitoring, control and computing \nsolution\
    \ “in the cloud” in agriculture. Relevant variables are well known and, in most\
    \ cases, have \nreaction times that limit the measurement frequency required (temperature,\
    \ soil humidity, \natmospheric humidity, precipitation, solar radiation, wind,\
    \ hail). For this reason, the information \ntransfer rate is low, and long-range\
    \ communications are required [31]. \nThe main aspects of SIGFOX, LoraWan and\
    \ NBIoT are presented below considering their \napplicability in the digitalization\
    \ of irrigation exploitations \nSIGFOX: It is presented as the most limited option\
    \ in terms of transmission speed (100 bps) and \nasymmetry, as it allows 140 uplink\
    \ and 4 downlink messages per day. The uploading of messages \nadmits up to 12\
    \ bytes for payload and up to 8 bytes for download. Moreover, the network use\
    \ \ninvolves a cost per device similar to the use of the GPRS network in M2M (Machine\
    \ to Machine) \nmode. Despite these limitations, SIGFOX is considered to be a\
    \ suitable option for a wide range of \nagricultural projects since no additional\
    \ facilities are required to be deployed and it achieves a high \ncoverage in\
    \ many EU countries (Figure 2). Several devices incorporating the SIGFOX \ncommunication\
    \ module have emerged on the market due to the rapid growth of this technology.\

    \ \nFigure 16. Global system architecture.\nThe elements that compose the system\
    \ are:\n1.\nMonitor node: This is a device consisting of a Heltec ESP32 LoRa board\
    \ measuring soil moisture\nthrough a SHT15 sensor. As shown in Figure 17, the\
    \ board is powered from the TLP5110 module\nand the battery pack. To ensure the\
    \ durability of the electronic devices, the unit has been placed in\na PVC box\
    \ with IP67 protection. The node measures soil moisture every 15 min and sends\
    \ the data\nvia LoRa network to the local gateway. Once the operation has been\
    \ performed, a digital output is\nactivated to order the TPL5110 module to disconnect\
    \ the power supply until the next transmission.\n2.\nHydrant node: Designed similarly\
    \ to the previous node at a hardware level, although it is not\nequipped with\
    \ a humidity sensor. To act on the hydrant valve, digital output from the Heltec\n\
    ESP32 LoRa board is used. It connects to the gateway every 15 min to request priority\
    \ and\ntime settings.\n3.\nGateway or local concentrator: It consists of two devices,\
    \ a Heltec ESP32 LoRa board and\nan MKR1200 board. The ﬁrst one operates as a\
    \ LoRa communications concentrator. Through\nthis element communication is directed\
    \ to hydrant nodes and from monitor nodes. This board\ncommunicates through the\
    \ serial port with the MKR1200 board, which is the platform that\ncommunicates\
    \ to the cloud.\n4.\nSIGFOX backend: The information sent by the local gateway\
    \ reaches the SIGFOX web platform\nwhere data are sent to the IoT platform. This\
    \ process is bidirectional, the backend receives data\nfrom the IoT platform to\
    \ be sent to the MKR1200 board. Figure 18 shows data in the backend.\n5.\nIoT\

    \ and manage irrigation. This is\na geographically scalable solution applicable\
    \ to other areas of agriculture.\nProblems related to\nconnectivity and energy\
    \ availability have usually made automation diﬃcult in rural areas.\nThe emergence\
    \ of SIGFOX technology with its low implementation and operating costs allows\n\
    isolated devices to be connected to the cloud.\nFurthermore, a strategy focused\
    \ on reducing electronics energy consumption has enabled the\nnodes to have a\
    \ power independence for over 5 years.\nICT based on free hardware and software\
    \ have led to a high reliability and low-cost solution either\nin terms of investment\
    \ or operation. The solution has been tested in real conditions for four months.\n\
    Robustness and stability of the communications and hardware with been veriﬁed.\n\
    The IoT platform used in this work (ThingSpeak) has allowed interaction with controlled\
    \ facilities\nfrom any device connected to the Internet.\nThe prolonged operation\
    \ of systems such as the proposed here will generate a large volume of data\n\
    from which knowledge will be extracted, as well as new irrigation strategies can\
    \ also be developed.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.L.-L.; Investigation,\

    enabled cyber-physical infrastructure. • Sensor web enablement and web processing
    service are mainly utilized. • Two interaction patterns are designed to cooperate
    SOA based geospatial services. • Providing interoperable access for heterogeneous
    sensors, data, and algorithms. • The infrastructure is capable in sensor-based

    serve vital functions in situational awareness for precision agriculture (PA)
    monitoring. Achieving the seamless integration of these heterogeneous sensors
    into information systems to achieve interoperability is challenging. To solve
    this problem, an integrated open geospatial web service-enabled cyber-physical
    infrastructure was proposed in this study to acquire, integrate, process, and
    distribute monitoring information from the physical sensor space of the PA system
    over the World Wide Web space. This infrastructure was designed as a service-oriented
    architecture middleware between heterogeneous physical sensors and different PA
    information clients. In particular, sensor web enablement and web processing services
    were utilized. Ten types of distributed agricultural sensors were deployed in
    Baoxie field, Wuhan City, and two different experiments were conducted to verify
    the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. Results demonstrated that this infrastructure
    was capable of handling data and analyses in sensor-based PA monitoring. The proposed
    approach was then compared with existing typical PA infrastructures. Results indicated
    that the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure provided interoperable access
    for heterogeneous sensors, data, and algorithms. The proposed infrastructure thus
    provides a new feasible method for information system design in PA. Previous article

    agricultureSensorsSensor webWeb services 1. Introduction 1.1. Background and problems
    Precision agriculture (PA) has been promoted by multidisciplinary theories and
    technological advancements over the last decade. The core term in PA, called site-specific
    management, is related to natural resource variability, variability management,
    and management zones (Zhang et al., 2002). For a high yield, these field variables
    should be monitored, transmitted, stored, analyzed, mapped, and distributed. Therefore,
    electronic and electrical science (Fernandes et al., 2013), information science
    (Cox, 2002), and computer science (Batte, 2005) have been serving increasingly
    vital functions in agriculture. Heterogeneous sensors, especially wireless sensor
    networks and corresponding web systems, are widely used for precision seeding
    irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting. A development trend in PA is standardization
    (Zhang et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2006) to achieve web sharing and interoperability
    (Murakami et al., 2007). Web sharing provides the prerequisites for wide access
    to agricultural data (Blank et al., 2013). For instance, soil moisture values
    in every management field can be obtained not only by the farmer himself but also
    by a third party in a standard-compliant manner. This feature helps to improve
    the value of agricultural data while reducing repetitive costs. Interoperability
    is recognized as a new paradigm for integrating heterogeneous systems into a synergistic
    unit. These two features are critical for the seamless integration of data, reusability
    of agricultural processes, and loose coupling in the PA web infrastructure (Murakami
    et al., 2007). However, some barriers in achieving web sharing and interoperability
    exist because of different sensor manufacturers, system architectures, and software
    designs of PA systems. The first barrier is heterogeneity in sensor interfaces.
    Sensor interfaces include early analog interfaces (i.e., pulse-width modulation),
    digital interfaces (i.e., RS232, RS485, and serial peripheral interfaces (SPI)),
    and fieldbus interfaces (i.e., controller area networks (CAN), highway addressable
    remote transducers local operating network, and process field bus). However, no
    uniform interface is suitable for all application contexts. Therefore, the interfaces
    used in the field can be diverse. As a result, the integration of agro-sensors
    with different interfaces in the field is cumbersome and requires extensive adaptation
    efforts (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). The second barrier is agricultural data model.
    Several data models have recently been proposed by different organizations. These
    models include AgroXML developed primarily by the Association for Technology and
    Structures in Agriculture in Germany; the ArcGIS model for agriculture discussed
    by the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.; AGROVOC created by the
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the Commission
    of the European Communities; AgMES; International System for Agricultural Science
    and Technology; and AgXML. Although these models have their own advantages, a
    widely accepted agricultural data model remains unavailable. Understanding the
    syntax and semantics of different models and exchanging data smoothly on the World
    Wide Web (WWW) are hot research topics in PA. The third barrier is related to
    the agriculture web system architecture and software design. An earlier agricultural
    web system may be designed as a closed architecture in a local network. This type
    of infrastructure is incapable of sharing information and cooperating with other
    systems (Kim and Evans, 2009). Given the need for seamless integration and reusability,
    software engineering provides PA with one solution called service-oriented architecture
    (SOA), which integrates distributed web services. Therefore, an increasing number
    of SOA-based PA systems have been proposed because of their openness and flexibility
    (Nikkila et al., 2010, Murakami et al., 2007). However, more studies and experiments
    should be conducted in PA to explore new potential advantages by utilizing multi-disciplinary
    web services, such as geospatial web services. In addition to these three barriers,
    different data transmission protocols and security concerns are involved in the
    design of a shareable and interoperable web information system for PA. Therefore,
    researchers worldwide have conducted numerous studies to solve these heterogeneities
    in PA (Iftikhar and Pedersen, 2011, Schuster et al., 2011). However, a satisfactory
    solution for acquiring, integrating, processing, and distributing PA monitoring
    information interoperably over the WWW space from the physical sensor space remains
    unavailable. The Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC) and ISO/TC211 Geographic
    Information/Geomatics have proposed a series of geospatial and location-related
    standards for a number of fields in the last decade including PA. Different geo-information
    in PA can be handled using these OGC standards. This mechanism is another approach
    to achieve interoperability in PA sensor systems. Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature
    Service (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Geography Markup Language (GML)
    have already shown their advantages in distributing geo-information (Han et al.,
    2012). The OGC published Web Processing Service (WPS) in 2007 to define standardized
    interfaces that facilitate the publishing, discovery, and binding of geospatial
    processes by clients (Schut, 2007). WPS is compatible with both Web Service Definition
    Language and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), thus facilitating interoperability
    with generic, non-geospatial web services. Although Yang et al. (2012) discussed
    the potential of WPS in agricultural processing, research in this area is still
    in its infancy. A promising open geospatial web service used in PA is Sensor Web
    Enablement (SWE). The NASA Sensor Web Applied Research Planning Group first proposed
    the term “Sensor Web” in the late 1990s. It is a macro-instrument concept comprising
    spatially distributed sensor platforms that share information among themselves
    and act in concert as a single instrument (Delin, 2002). The SWE initiative in
    the OGC standardized web service interfaces, data, and sensor models in sensor
    systems. After several revisions by the OGC, the SWE can support almost all aspects
    of heterogeneous sensor applications. Such applications include Sensor Model Language
    (SensorML) for sensor modeling and discovery; Sensor Observation Service (SOS)
    for retrieving sensor data and metadata; Observation and Measurement (O&M) for
    modeling different data; Sensor Planning Service for sensor tasking; and Web Notification
    Service for asynchronous notifications. Therefore, the SWE initiative has potential
    for providing an information middleware to integrate web-ready sensors (Nash et
    al., 2009). Kubicek et al. (2013) utilized O&M for agriculture, and visualized
    the O&M data adaptively. Given the interoperable and real-time characteristics
    of a sensor web, sensor web-integrated infrastructure provides some new features
    for PA, which is the focus of this study. 1.2. Purposes and outline As different
    sensors are utilized to detect spatial-temporal variations in fields, this study
    attempts to design an open geospatial web service-integrated cyber-physical infrastructure
    for sensor-based PA monitoring. The proposed cyber-physical infrastructure can
    serve as an open standards integrated middleware between heterogeneous monitoring
    sensors and different PA applications. More importantly, this cyber-physical infrastructure
    can provide seamless interaction for real-time data sharing, loose coupling for
    reuse, and interoperability for cooperation. Therefore, this research includes
    three objectives (1) exploring merits of integrating open geospatial services,
    especially SWE in cyber-physical infrastructure for PA, (2) designing a novel
    architecture and orchestrated interaction patterns to coordinate these open geospatial
    web services, and (3) validating and evaluating the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure.
    This article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the design goals, architecture
    overview, and two interaction patterns for this cyber-physical infrastructure.
    Two field experiments that validate this infrastructure are then presented in
    Section 3. Section 4 presents a discussion of our approach, comparison with four
    existing approaches, and a summary of the merits and limitations. Finally, Section
    5 presents the conclusions and future work. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Design
    goals Cyber-physical infrastructure is a coordinated environment, which includes
    several hardware components, software, and interactions. In PA, a cyber-physical
    infrastructure is similar to a bridge that connects heterogeneous agricultural
    sensors with different PA clients. The cyber-physical infrastructure is also similar
    to a black box, in which all differences between physical sensor interfaces, data
    transmissions, data formats, and control modes are hidden from the users. The
    higher-level applications only need to concentrate on a suite of standard interfaces.
    Therefore, acquiring, integrating, processing, and distributing monitoring information
    in PA are the aims of the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. Before designing
    the architecture of this infrastructure, some design goals are given below. (1)
    Integrating heterogeneous agricultural sensors As discussed above, the sensors
    installed in a field can be coordinated through different interfaces, such as
    SPI and CAN. These sensors can also be accessed by different transmission protocols
    such as IEEE 802.11 or Bluetooth. Therefore, the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure
    should be capable of hiding these physical differences and managing them transparently
    over the WWW. In this manner, a higher-level application (i.e., a precision irrigation
    support desktop system, or an iOS-based fertilization monitoring system) can obtain
    sensor data without knowing their physical details. Applications can operate heterogeneous
    sensors in a simple standard-based manner from the web, thus decreasing the need
    for adaptation. (2) Web-based instant sharing of real-time data and processes
    Real-time or near real-time monitoring enables farmers to be aware of some anomalous
    events or potential emergencies immediately. Agricultural data, such as soil moisture,
    air temperature, and precipitation, are also valuable for environmental modeling
    and hydrology analysis. Therefore, the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure
    should not only gather and publish real-time data but also share data on the web
    for wider availability. Furthermore, processing algorithms should be shared on
    the web as well. This feature is necessary to lower the cost of the repetitive
    construction of PA sensors and agro-processes. This feature can also simultaneously
    lower the process learning curve and enhance reusability. (3) Open and flexible
    The components of a cyber-physical infrastructure should be organized in a loosely
    coupled manner and be independent of any specific hardware platform, operating
    system, and implementation language. In particular, any component inside the infrastructure
    can easily be added, removed, and updated without affecting other components.
    Therefore, a distributed structure is required. This cyber-physical infrastructure
    should also be open and sufficiently neutral for diverse high-level applications.
    2.2. Infrastructure architecture SOA-based cyber-physical infrastructure architecture
    was designed on the basis of open geospatial web services to achieve the three
    goals discussed above (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (317KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Architecture of an open geospatial web service-integrated
    cyber-physical infrastructure. Fig. 1 shows that this PA architecture comprises
    four layers. Besides the physical and application layers, two layers in the cyber-physical
    infrastructure exist, namely, the sensing and business layers. These four layers
    are divided on the basis of their functions in the PA monitoring system. The physical
    layer is a set of agricultural sensors and transmission devices deployed in soil
    or between crops. These sensors transfer measurements of environmental conditions
    (e.g., air humidity and soil moisture) through electronic signals. The data are
    then pulled out regularly by the upper gateway service. Therefore, the physical
    layer is the basic layer to support other PA operations. Regardless of diverse
    operation interfaces, communication protocols, and sensors, this physical layer
    is the data input layer for the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. The application
    layer is the interface between users and PA systems. The cyber-physical infrastructure
    provides general functions for sensors and data, whereas the application layer
    focuses on a specific application. Therefore, the application, such as a precision
    irrigation system or yield mapping system, is referred to as the client for this
    study. Third party PA information providers can customize the multiplatform- and
    multi-granularity-specific clients by using the open standard interfaces defined
    by this cyber-physical infrastructure. 2.2.1. Sensing layer The sensing layer
    is primarily based on the SOS introduced by the SWE framework, which provides
    a popular interoperability interface to store and distribute sensor data from
    heterogeneous sensors. The potential value of SOS for the interoperability in
    PA was explored in this study. Moreover, SOS also supports spatial queries, temporal
    queries, property queries, and combination queries, thus benefiting different
    user-defined data requests. Before standardizing data through SOS, a gateway service
    was deployed to transform sensor data to SWE-enabled information. First, the IP
    address and port of the gateway service were configured in a field-data hub. A
    TCP/IP connection was then established once the gateway service detected the connection
    request from the field-data hub. The gateway service could then send a sensor
    data request to the field-data hub according to different data communication protocols.
    After receiving a data response from the field-data hub, the gateway service parsed
    it from binary format to plaintext. Finally, the gateway service encoded raw sensor
    data into O&M-compliant XML format. Therefore, the O&M is used as the final standard
    data format in the sensing layer. O&M is an international standard (ISO 19156)
    that defines a conceptual schema for different observations to enhance data semantics
    and accessibility. Although O&M was proposed in the context of geography, the
    model is not limited to it. Collected agricultural data, as well as meta-data
    in PA can also be modeled by O&M, which are stored in SOS. SOAP and HTTP transmission
    protocols are supported. 2.2.2. Business layer This layer is a relatively high
    layer in this cyber-physical infrastructure. Advanced agricultural analyses can
    be realized in this layer. WPS is adopted as an open processing interface by wrapping
    different processing algorithms and models for PA, such as a buffer algorithm,
    a crop production prediction model, or a crop water requirement model. WMS can
    also publish web maps, such as farm base maps or nitrogen distribution maps, as
    an output from the WPS. WFS can also return geospatial features, such as points
    (i.e., deployment points of wireless sensors), polylines, and polygons (i.e.,
    observation range of a weather station). WCS can also provide a standard interface
    to retrieve coverage data, such as remote sensing imagery and the digital elevation
    model of the farmland. In this layer, the GML is used to encode geographical features
    in data exchanging between services, and both SOAP and HTTP protocols are supported.
    2.3. Interaction patterns Clients/applications need to interact with this two-layer
    integrated cyber-physical infrastructure to fulfill different PA monitoring requirements.
    After sufficient experiments and abstractions, two typical interaction patterns
    were found: (1) a primary monitoring pattern and (2) an advanced monitoring pattern.
    The sequence diagram from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to show
    the interactions between processes in a sequential order. It shows different participating
    processes or objects (parallel vertical lines (lifelines)) and messages exchanged
    between them (horizontal arrows). These sequence diagrams help us to understand
    the interfaces and functions of different services in this infrastructure. 2.3.1.
    Primary monitoring pattern The primary monitoring pattern is used when different
    FMIS clients need to obtain real-time and historical observation data from deployed
    agricultural sensors. Therefore, the application, sensing, and physical layers
    are all involved in this scenario. Before being standardized by the SOS, the gateway
    service acts as a broker by transferring messages from the web to the cyber-physical
    infrastructure. In particular, the gateway service first pulls data from the physical
    sensors by interacting with the field-data hub, and then the field-data hub pushes
    the data back. After gathering data from the web, this gateway posts them to the
    SOS using the InsertObservation interface. The SOS can then publish data in an
    open manner using the GetObservation interface. Therefore, clients on the web
    can access the agricultural data measured in this farmland using this SOS as long
    as other constraints were satisfied. WMS/WMTS and WFS can also provide farmland
    base maps and features. The sequence diagram of the primary monitoring pattern
    is shown in Fig. 2. Notably, the function of SOS is to provide a high-level, aggregated,
    and open interface for sensor users. In a diverse sensor environment, the primary
    monitoring pattern facilitates the querying and acquiring spatial–temporal referenced
    data without the need to communicate with one sensor or one sensor network individually.

    Fig. 2. Sequence diagram of the primary monitoring pattern. 2.3.2. Advanced monitoring
    pattern This advanced monitoring pattern mainly takes advantage of the WPS for
    open processing for PA. First, the WPS provided the GetCapabilities interface
    for clients to query useable and suitable processes within. The client then obtained
    mandatory and optional parameters required by the process through the DescribeProcess
    interface. The Execute operation was then called to execute this process. In this
    stage, SOS, WMS, WFS, and WCS can be employed to obtain essential data to run
    the process using the primary monitoring pattern or publish processing results
    through their interfaces. Finally, the data or data URL was returned to the clients.
    The results were then accessed by the primary monitoring pattern. The sequence
    diagram of the advanced monitoring pattern is shown in Fig. 3. The use of a distributed
    web processing service allows flexibility when updating and redeploying algorithms.
    All algorithm changes are invisible to the users because the interfaces are unchanged.
    Therefore, the clients do not need any modifications when the algorithms are updated.
    Considering the web-based processing functions, the FMIS or other clients can
    run on a low-cost machine such as a mobile device. Download : Download high-res

    conducted to serve as a proof-of-concept. The results were then analyzed to validate
    the merits of the proposed open geospatial service-integrated cyber-physical infrastructure.
    3.1. Experimental site A 20 m × 40 m test field located at 30°28′13.00″N and 114°31′35.71″E
    was selected to test the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. Fig. 4 shows
    that 15 soil moisture sensors and 3 soil temperature sensors were deployed 10
    cm below the surface to measure soil conditions. Two heterogeneous meteorological
    stations were installed above ground. Eight types of sensors were employed to
    monitor the following agricultural conditions continuously: wind speed, wind direction,
    air humidity, air pressure, air temperature, precipitation, net radiation, and
    sunshine duration. Each station has a field-data hub to gather all real-time data.
    A general packet radio service module, which is powered by a solar charge controller,
    is used to transmits data wirelessly. Download : Download high-res image (814KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Experimental site and the 10 types
    of agricultural sensors deployed. These sensors are heterogeneous because they
    were constructed by different manufacturers. Sensors with the RS485 interface
    produced by Wuhan Xinlvyuan Technology Development Co., Ltd. were installed at
    the meteorological station 1 and at the soil station. Wireless sensors with the
    IEEE 1451 interface that were assembled by ourselves were installed at the meteorological
    station 2. The Modbus protocol was also used in data transmission for the RS485
    sensors, whereas the smart transducer interface module was used for the IEEE 1451
    sensors. Thus, the transformation from different protocol-based sensor data to
    SWE-enabled information is required. Therefore, the following two experiments
    demonstrate how to integrate these physical sensors using the proposed infrastructure
    to achieve sharing and interoperability in the web information space. 3.2. Experiment
    1: real-time visualization of agro-meteorological measurements The physical layer
    (in Fig. 1) was based on the experimental site described above. The gateway service
    was then installed by implementing a Windows service on one server. This service
    sent a data request to the field-data hub using different protocols (i.e., RS-485
    or IEEE 1451). The field-data hub then sent the requested data back through a
    telecommunication network and the WWW. After receiving these raw data, the O&M
    encapsulation function in the gateway service started to encode “local” data as
    web sharing data. These heterogeneous agro-meteorological measurements were then
    stored through the InsertObservation interface of the SOS service. One implementation
    of SOS (i.e., 52°North SOS) was adopted. The 52°North SOS utilizes the PostgreSQL
    database management system with PostGIS extension to store sensor data. Fig. 5
    shows a sample InsertObservation request with two main parts, namely, the assigned
    SensorId and O&M encapsulated data. This sample request implies that at 17:59:01
    + 08:00 on 2014-01-11, one sensor (ID: urn:liesmars:insitusensor:BaoxieSoilMoistureStation-LVDSC12-25)
    measured soil humidity at 30.46992°N and 114.52636°E with a value of 31.1%. Using
    this O&M schema, all different types of observation data such as wind speed data
    can be represented and exchanged in the same way. Fig. 6 shows the InsertObservation
    response returned from the SOS. If this data insert request is valid, SOS will
    return an ID (o_53865298) to represent this successful insert operation. If no
    ID was returned, it indicates that this data insert operation failed. Download

    insert. Besides data sharing, these heterogeneous sensors also achieve interoperability
    by using a model in compliance with the SensorML standard. Fig. 7 shows the SensorML-based
    information model of a soil moisture sensor (ID: urn:liesmars:insitusensor:BaoxieSoilMoistureStation-LVDSC12-25)
    with a service interface (one SOS URL: http://202.114.118.60:8080/SOSv3.5.0/sos)
    and other metadata (i.e., classification, valid time, characteristics, and position).
    This meta-information of heterogeneous sensors can be obtained using the DescribeSensor
    interface of SOS. Therefore, clients on the web can access this sensor and its
    data through its SOS interface and by using these important meta-information.

    test client was implemented to retrieve and visualize different real-time and
    historical agro-meteorological measurements in this field using the primary monitoring
    pattern. Fig. 10 shows that this client continuously retrieves real-time sensor
    data from the SOS and displays the data on the left. These observations are refreshed
    at a certain frequency, i.e., every 10 s. On the right, the Tianditu (Map World),
    which is the public version of the national platform for common geospatial information
    service of China, was used. Tianditu provides JavaScript-based web APIs to construct
    a geospatial client quickly. In our experiment, Tianditu web APIs were mainly
    utilized to provide a base map service, add overlays, and response to user inputs
    (e.g., click). For example, a “TMarker” (i.e., “var sensor_location = new TMarker
    (new TLngLat (114.526587, 30.470278))”) to add the location of a sensor. This
    location label was then added to the base map and called “map.addOverLay (sensor
    location).” By clicking on the label of the sensor on the map, a “MarkerClick”
    map event defined in Tianditu APIs was captured. The DescribeSensor interface
    of the SOS was then triggered to retrieve the sensor metadata for users. Therefore,
    farmers can obtain the sensor’s information intuitively, including the name, intended
    applications, state, keywords, organization, and picture, which were already modeled
    in the SensorML (Fig. 7). Besides the real-time data, historical data can also
    be simultaneously plotted below in this client. Download : Download high-res image

    visualization of agro-meteorological measurements based on the proposed cyber-physical
    infrastructure and primary interaction pattern. Notably, an air temperature sensor,
    called LVQSZ33 was present in the client. Real-time air temperature was measured
    at 7.7 °C at 23:01:17 on January 19, 2014. During the previous 24 h (January 18),
    the highest temperature was approximately 13 °C at 15:00, whereas the lowest temperature
    was approximately 2 °C at 7:00 on January 19. Similarly, all 10 types of agricultural
    measurements in this field can be accessed and displayed in this manner. These
    historical and real-time data, as well as meta-information of the sensors, were
    all obtained through the SOS using the primary monitoring pattern. 3.3. Experiment
    2: soil moisture collaborative mapping Farmers should be aware of soil moisture
    conditions over the entire area of their fields. However, since sensors are limited
    and must be dispersed to the field, obtaining a complete soil moisture map based
    on limited sensors is challenging. Geographical methods can be employed to handle
    this problem efficiently. The first law of geography states that, “Everything
    is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”
    (Tobler, 1970). Several multivariate interpolation algorithms, such as inverse
    distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation, were put forward
    on the basis of this law. These geospatial algorithms are widely used to calculate
    assigned values at unknown points. These WPS-wrapped interpolation algorithms
    can be constructed for our proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. For this experiment,
    five WPSs were implemented to create a real-time soil moisture map collaboratively.
    Fig. 11 shows that the FMIS client interacts with the Mapping, Points to Shapefile,
    Interpolation, Rendering, and Publish to WMS WPSs. These WPSs utilized the distributed
    organizational structure to form scalable and loosely coupled WPS services. Download

    Implementation of soil moisture mapping using seven open geospatial web services.
    Scattered soil points and their soil moisture values were directly retrieved using
    the primary monitoring pattern. The Points to Shapefile WPS then enabled us to
    create a point Shapefile, which was the input of the Interpolation WPS. The identifier
    of this WPS was called “v.surf.idw.” Fig. 12 shows the DescribeProcess response
    of the core Interpolation WPS based on IDW. This response indicates that the input
    of this WPS was the Shapefiles or zipped Shapefile and the output was a tiff image.
    The output is the final soil condition map for the entire field. All functional
    WPSs in this experiment, including the IDW algorithm based interpolation WPS,
    were constructed using ArcGIS Engine 10.0 components. For example, the IInterpolationOp
    interface provided by the ArcGIS Engine helps to build reliable interpolation
    functions. Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download : Download full-size

    The output format is specified as a tiff image. The interpolated tiff image was
    then rendered and published as a WMS for web access. The “wmsLayer” in Tianditu
    JS APIs can be utilized to construct the final WMS layer object: “var wmsLayer
    = new TTilelayerWMS(“layers”, url, config)”. The “map.addLayer” method can then
    be called to add this resulting WMS layer to the Tianditu base map: “map.addLayer(wmsLayer).”
    By adding a timer, this collaborative mapping scheme can run automatically and
    obtain a near real-time result (e.g., one soil condition map every half hour).
    Fig. 14 shows that a test client was implemented to verify the final mapping result.
    The left part of this client is used to display the sensor distribution. The right
    part of this client is used to query, select, and play maps with animation effects.
    By selecting a start time (2014-02-11 15:08:18), end time (2014-02-12 15:08:16),
    and soil profile depth (10 cm), users can obtain all soil moisture maps during
    this period. The user can also select each single soil moisture map to understand
    soil conditions in the field. The user can also display all of the maps to view
    dynamic variations in soil conditions. The variations in soil moisture values
    of each sensor can also be plotted on the lower right. Download : Download high-res

    the soil moisture collaborative mapping results based on the proposed cyber-physical
    infrastructure and advanced interaction pattern. The said map shows that the soil
    moisture distribution in this test field was unbalanced, with the lowest value
    (8.8%) in the northeast and the highest value (61.5%) in the southwest. The rest
    of this field maintained relatively normal soil moisture (30–40%). Therefore,
    the farmer should only irrigate the northeast part of the land to normalize the
    whole soil moisture distribution. After obtaining the field soil moisture map
    from the proposed infrastructure, software algorithms can be used to detect anomalous
    local regions in this field in terms of soil moisture. Crop, meteorology, and
    soil composition are required to judge the anomalous soil moisture conditions.
    If an anomalous region (e.g., drought area) is detected successfully, only a nearby
    irrigation facility should be triggered to balance the water condition in the
    soil automatically. Therefore, this automated event-driven method can respond
    to an emergency in the field more quickly and appropriately. The lower right line
    chart displays soil moisture values of the LVDSC12-08 sensor over a long period.
    The condition of the soil measured by this sensor was relatively steady (approximately
    40%) with few deviations. This sensor is also located in the lower middle part
    of the test field, which can be found on the upper left part of the sensor distribution
    map. 4. Discussion 4.1. Comparisons Four typical existing methods for designing
    PA monitoring infrastructure were compared in terms of eight features shown below
    in Table 1. These features include architecture, supported sensors, data sharing,
    process sharing, services involved, data model, validation, and complexity. As
    each infrastructure has its own unique features and contributions, this comparison
    tries to figure out the advantages of the proposed method in multi-sensor based
    PA monitoring scenarios. The detailed comparisons were discussed below. Table

    GML, O&M √ High (√: supported; ×: unsupported; and –: unknown). Korduan et al.
    (2004) designed an interoperable geo-data infrastructure for PA. These researchers
    realized the increasing importance of geo-information in PA. Therefore, spatial
    data infrastructures (SDI) should be established to handle geo-related data in
    PA, which is consistent with our viewpoint. In the soil sampling use case, Korduan
    et al. identified five actors and employed two OGC services (i.e., WMS and WFS),
    the Internet, a GML, and a database to build an SDI for providing geo-information
    from the field. This WMS and WFS-integrated infrastructure for PA was an innovation
    in 2004. While, the cyber-physical infrastructure proposed in this study not only
    utilizes WMS and WFS but also sensor web/SWE and WPS. The sensor web is a popular
    methodology for sensor-based research and applications (Conover et al., 2010,
    Havlik et al., 2011, Kanbayashi and Sato, 2011). By integrating the sensor web
    standards and sensors in PA, real-time metrological and soil data can be accumulated
    from physical sensors and then distributed over the web through consensus-based
    interfaces. The first experiment showed that real-time and historical monitoring
    data could be retrieved from heterogeneous sensors through a standard interface.
    Besides, the second experiment indicated that WPS could be a valuable tool for
    web-based analysis in PA. A new functionality only has to be integrated into the
    proposed infrastructure once. According to different complexities of new functions,
    different numbers of new WPSs should be implemented. For example, if the function
    of average monthly precipitation is required, only an averaging algorithm based
    WPS should be implemented. Some new averaging functions, such as the average annual
    temperature, can use this WPS without repetitive algorithm implementations. For
    a complex functionality, (e.g., crop yield prediction), several existing WPSs
    can also be re-utilized (e.g., rendering WPS). Only the core algorithm relative
    to crop yield prediction need to be implemented. These functional WPSs can also
    be used by the other PA clients. Murakami et al. (2007) designed an infrastructure
    for the development of distributed service-oriented information systems for PA
    in 2007. These researchers presented an SOA-based infrastructure and a standard
    language, called PAML, for data exchange. By integrating software engineering
    techniques and concepts (i.e., XML, SOA, and service bus) with some agricultural
    services and open geospatial services (i.e., WMS and WFS), this infrastructure
    served as a foundation for different high-level applications. This study encouraged
    researchers to absorb and utilize software engineering tools for PA. Thus, the
    infrastructure presented in this study also included some software engineering
    concepts, such as the design of the two-layered SOA-based infrastructure and the
    UML interaction patterns. The infrastructure proposed in this study was designed
    using physical sensors as data input, which served as the foundation for up-to-date
    PA data. The web interoperability of sensors was achieved, with the help of SWE
    and WPS. Therefore, the above two experiments showed the advantages of the proposed
    method in data and information retrieval. However, the design of the service bus
    in Murakami’s infrastructure was not included in this work. The service bus is
    important for invoking the services which are physically distributed across the
    network. Therefore, the proposed infrastructure can be improved in the future
    by utilizing services catalog services from the OGC. Nash et al. (2009) systematically
    reviewed the use of open geospatial web services in PA for the first time. Three
    typical use cases designs were proposed to demonstrate the great potential of
    open geospatial web services in PA. Nevertheless, cases were high-level designs
    without experimental validation. The proposed method was tested and verified by
    two typical field experiments. Based on the real agricultural sensors in the field,
    the proposed infrastructure and patterns were validated in handling geospatially
    referenced PA data. What’s more, complete infrastructure and architecture, as
    well as two interaction models from practices were also presented. These designs
    and detailed interaction models should be helpful for PA researchers. Notably,
    although some ideas of our approach were derived from Nash’s work, our research
    moved a step further, as discussed above. Nikkila et al. (2010) analyzed additional
    requirements for FMIS in PA. They also identified the requirements imposed by
    PA on FMIS. A web-based approach for the implementation of an FMIS was evaluated,
    which fulfilled these additional requirements. The six requirements in implementing
    an FMIS for PA include the support of digital data transfer; the storage and management
    of GIS data, large quantities of data, meta-information, and device-specific information;
    as well as the creation of operational plans. Although our infrastructure was
    designed as a foundation for different FMISs, instead of a simple FMIS, our design
    can also meet most of these requirements. As tested in prior experiments, the
    meta-information of the GIS data was supported by the O&M encoding method used
    in our approach. Experiment 1 and Fig. 5 showed that the metadata of sampling
    time (timestamp), procedure (related sensors), observed property (what is measured),
    and feature of interest (location) were encoded. The SensorML encoding method
    used in our approach also supports the meta-information of devices. Fig. 7 showed
    that the metadata of heterogeneous sensors included text description, name, keywords,
    identifiers, classification, valid time, characteristics, capabilities, contact,
    location, and interfaces. Such a wealth of meta-information can be useful for
    precise sensor discovery and operations. The PostgreGIS database, with the GIS
    extension based on the PostgreSQL database, was adopted by the SOS service in
    our infrastructure. Therefore, the SOS can meet the demand of storage and management
    of significant amounts of GIS data. However, the proposed infrastructure cannot
    support the complete PA information system because of the research aim of this
    work. Nikkila et al. designed a web-based FMIS architecture that can handle all
    PA tasks. Therefore, a complete PA information system solution can be achieved
    by combining Nikkila’s design with ours. 4.2. Merits and limitations The experiments
    and comparisons revealed that the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure had some
    unique features and advantages over existing studies. These advantages and limitations
    were summarized below. (1) Feasible solution for sensor-based PA monitoring The
    proposed cyber-physical infrastructure is capable of integrating different sensors
    used in farmland from raw data to thematic maps. The benefit of using the sensor
    web concept and SWE framework is that these tools provide a standard access manner
    for heterogeneous agricultural sensors. Experiments showed that the data flowed
    seamlessly from the physical domain to the information space. Therefore, this
    infrastructure was referred to as a cyber-physical infrastructure, rather than
    just a cyber-infrastructure. In this cyber-physical infrastructure, data and processes
    are exposed by web services in an interoperable manner. The SensorML promotes
    the interoperability of sensors, and the O&M/SOS helps to achieve web sharing
    of the observation data. The WPS can also decrease repetitive work and enhance
    the capability of running complex algorithms. (2) Good emphasis on geospatial
    models and methods Geographical models and methods are important for PA, especially
    for the expression and analysis of spatial-temporal variations in the field. Our
    approach highlighted this importance by adopting the advanced methods from the
    OGC. By integrating these open geospatial services, this infrastructure is a valuable
    tool in the spatiotemporal data acquisition, display, and analysis for FMIS in
    PA. (3) SOA architecture for maintenance and update Unlike desktop applications
    for PA, the SOA-based philosophy was utilized in the design of the architecture.
    By installing web services in a distributed environment, the failure risk and
    the update cost were reduced. Therefore, this approach is more flexible than stand-alone
    applications. Although the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure has these three
    merits, some limitations still exist. First, the whole infrastructure is a slightly
    more complex compared with previous approaches. Promoting the balance in the functionality
    and usability of this infrastructure still requires future work. The second limitation
    is the completeness. Given the focus of sensor-based PA monitoring in this work,
    rather than the complete operations, the proposed approach was designed to handle
    agricultural sensors, instead of traditional PA information. Therefore, if a complete
    PA solution is desired, the proposed method must combine with other traditional
    PA information systems to provide the managements of general PA data and documents.
    Another limitation is the multi-service registration, query, and management for
    the proposed infrastructure. If a catalog service can be added to the business
    layer, the integration of services will be more efficient. 5. Conclusion and outlook
    Wired/wireless sensors serve vital functions in situational awareness in farming.
    Given different sensor interfaces, system architectures, and software designs,
    the seamless integration and reuse of these heterogeneous sensors are challenges
    in PA. The consensus-based OGC SWE standards enable the retrieval and aggregation
    of observed data, even from multiple sensor networks without requiring knowledge
    of the diverse protocols and data formats used by individual sensors. With the
    use of the sensor web concept and SWE standards, a middleware was designed to
    act between the heterogeneous sensors of the physical domain and different PA
    applications on the web. This middleware consists of two layers and six open geospatial
    web services. After conducting two field experiments, this cyber-physical infrastructure
    was found capable of acquiring data from the physical sensor space, as well as
    of processing, integrating, and distributing such data seamlessly on the WWW.
    The interoperability of the sensors, data, as well as processes and the flexibility
    in the architecture, were achieved to provide a referable method for PA information
    design. Although this infrastructure is efficient, a fully functional design for
    all PA operations still requires further research. The limitations in complexity
    and management of multi-web services can be overcome by future work. With more
    research, a one-stop infrastructure solution with high efficiency can be available
    in the future to support all types of PA data, processes, and controls. Acknowledgments

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\

    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\

    \ over parallel programming\nparadigm to enhance processing and reduce execution\
    \ time [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic\nis the support of prototyping and reusability\

    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ introduces a new way of managing water in irrigation systems, which can\nbe\
    \ applied to gardens or agricultural ﬁelds, replacing human intervention with\
    \ Wireless Sensor\nNetworks. A typical irrigation system wastes on average 30%\
    \ of the water used, due to poor\nmanagement and conﬁguration. This sustainable\
    \ irrigation system allows a better efﬁciency in the\nprocess of irrigation that\
    \ can lead to savings for the end user, not only monetary but also in natural\n\
    resources, such as water and energy, leading to a more sustainable environment.\
    \ The system can\nretrieve real time data and use them to determinate the correct\
    \ amount of water to be used in a garden.\nWith this solution, it is possible\
    \ to save up to 34% of water when using sensor data from temperature,\nhumidity\
    \ and soil moisture, or up to 26% when using only temperature inputs. Besides\
    \ a detailed\nsystem architecture, this paper includes a real case scenario implementation\
    \ and results discussion.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; Wireless Sensor Networks;\
    \ sustainability; LoRa; ESP32; water savings\n1. Introduction\nResearch and implementation\
    \ in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ﬁelds and in topics such as Smart\nCities, Agriculture\
    \ and Sustainability have been growing in the past years [1].\nAs S. Routray [2]\
    \ said “Green technologies and energy efﬁcient process in IoT are well researched\n\
    areas in which optimization of resources takes the central position”. IoT is impacting\
    \ the world,\ncreating new markets and innovation, as it connects a wide range\
    \ of networks in both economy and\nsociety, requiring innovation in information,\
    \ communications and regulations [3]. This emerging\nconcept aims to disruptively\
    \ enhance the efﬁciency, sustainability, and safety of cities, with integrated\n\
    infrastructure and services, that allows a monitoring and management using intelligent\
    \ devices and\nsystems [4,5].\nA big part of cities nowadays is their focus on\
    \ creating green spaces, not only for their recreational\npurpose, but also because\
    \ it helps reduce the carbon footprint and overall temperatures of cities,\nbut\
    \ the maintenance of those spaces includes usage of huge amounts of water.\nAutomatic\
    \ irrigation solutions, based on manual conﬁgured controllers, composed of timers\n\
    and irrigate every day at the same time and duration, are the basic solution and\
    \ the go-to choice\nwhen building a new garden. This type of solution is still\
    \ the main choice in around 80% of the\nirrigation projects due to low prices\
    \ and simplicity, but this type of solution has a poor efﬁciency when\nit comes\
    \ to water management; it is common to see them start the irrigation process in\
    \ periods of rain,\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402; doi:10.3390/s20051402\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2019, 20, 1402\n2 of 14\nexcessive heat or strong winds, conditions that\
    \ contribute to the waste of water. Further, this type of\nsolution is unable\
    \ to understand if problems with the system, such as pipe leaks or broken valves,\n\
    occur, contributing to garden ﬂooding, not only killing the garden but also making\
    \ it inaccessible\nto users.\nSustainability is nowadays directly linked to innovation,\
    \ since all around the world, people are\nbecoming more concerned with climate\
    \ changes, water shortage, clean energies and other challenges\nthat require the\
    \ development of new products, business and services that can lead to advances\
    \ not only\nin environmental dimensions but also in social and economic dimensions\
    \ [3]. Only with innovation we\nare able to ﬁght the ongoing process where natural\
    \ resources, such as water, are starting to vanish and\nmaterial goods prices,\
    \ like energy, are at an all-time highs. Combining IoT, sustainability and Machine\n\
    Learning algorithms is possible to create more efﬁcient processes and achieve\
    \ a disruptive innovation\nthat in the medium to long term will allow consumption\
    \ reduction in natural and material resources.\nAt this moment, water shortage\
    \ is something that is rising every day, affecting more and more\npeople. Approximately\
    \ 70% of the fresh water used in many parts of the world is going for irrigation\n\
    related activities, from agricultural ﬁelds to gardens, and according to [6],\
    \ 30% of this water is being\npotentially wasted due to environmental conditions\
    \ or from the cycles not being optimized for the\ntypes of plants. This waste\
    \ is not only inﬂuencing the costs for the consumer but also is reducing the\n\
    health of the ﬁelds, in either under or over irrigation.\nTo achieve the goal\
    \ of reducing the waste of water in irrigation systems, disruptive solutions need\n\
    to be the go-to solutions. Instead of another smart irrigation controller, our\
    \ solution is a Sustainable\nIrrigation Solution, that not only controls the irrigation\
    \ system, but also analyzes all the system\ncomponents, from the pipes that supply\
    \ the water to the sprinklers, in order to analyze potential leaks\nor malfunctions,\
    \ improving efﬁciency and reducing costs in a sustainable and circular economy\
    \ fashion.\nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), directly in the garden to collect\
    \ real time data to\ncheck the current conditions of the garden and crossing these\
    \ information with weather forecast,\nevapotranspiration and garden speciﬁcations,\
    \ our proposed solution is able, through artiﬁcial\nintelligence algorithms, to\
    \ predict/calculate the real water needs for that particular garden and\nadjust\
    \ the irrigation controller without human interaction. It is also able to detect\
    \ how weather\nconditions, such as rain or strong winds, may affect the irrigation\
    \ process, scheduling the best time to\nstart. We stand out from other solutions\
    \ is that we do this analysis per irrigation zone and not in the\ngarden as a\
    \ whole, since gardens can have different characteristics in their constitution,\
    \ having also\ndifferent hydric needs.\nCombining this real time analysis with\
    \ the use of the correct irrigation times, the detection of\nsystem malfunctions\
    \ in the pipes and other materials, and the ability to control the entire system\n\
    remotely through a mobile dashboard, we are able to reduce the waste of water\
    \ in up to 30%, but also\nreduce the costs of installation and maintenance.\n\
    In this paper, an extended version of a previous paper published by the authors\
    \ [7] is presented,\nwith a more detailed and novel description of a system based\
    \ on WSN for retrieving real time\nenvironmental data in order to optimize irrigation\
    \ timings. A larger test case is described, with more\ntest scenarios, followed\
    \ by new experimental results and a comparison with previous ones. Finally,\n\
    the main conclusions and future work are also presented.\n2. Related Work\nAs\
    \ presented in the previous research,\nmany projects [8–11] have been published.\n\
    These implementations for IoT solutions that control irrigation systems, mainly\
    \ using single nodes\nwith Arduinos, combined with a set of environmental data\
    \ sensors, have several problems due to the\nlarge amounts of wire used to spread\
    \ them across the ﬁelds. All these projects use the collected data to\nincrease\
    \ the garden or agricultural ﬁeld efﬁciency, including user comfort and water\
    \ savings, but lack\nthe ability to be implemented in a real case scenario.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 20, 1402\n3 of 14\nMore advanced projects were also found [12–16]\
    \ where full WSNs are used to automatically turn\non the irrigation system when\
    \ low levels of soil moisture are detected. Although some good results\ncan be\
    \ found, none works with the goal of water management.\nIn terms of real water\
    \ management, and not only turning the irrigation off when the soil is still\n\
    moist, not many works were found. The SWAMP project, by C. Kamienski [17–19],\
    \ was the main\nresearch found. The project consists of a full system, from software\
    \ to hardware, that includes the use\nof sensors, drones and weather stations\
    \ to retrieve data, LoRa and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry\nTransport) to transmit\
    \ data and a set of models to adapt these values to create the best irrigation\n\
    process for precision agriculture.\nOur proposal, already tested on a small scale\
    \ in a previous research [7], stands out from the others\nby the use of algorithms\
    \ capable of analyzing the environmental data and understanding the correct\n\
    amount of water needed for the ﬁeld, instead of watering only when moisture is\
    \ low. This allowed\nfor savings of around 25%. Even so, the previously presented\
    \ systems lack some reliability, mainly in\nthe chosen sensors, and needed to\
    \ be tested in a larger scenario. In order to improve the results and\nguarantee\
    \ that the solution works in multiple environments, we present an improved proposal,\
    \ with a\nmore reliable WSN.\n3. Materials and Methods\nIn order to achieve the\
    \ goal of collecting garden information in real time, the proposed solution,\n\
    bearing in mind the WSN fashion, is composed of a set of hardware nodes, responsible\
    \ for the\ncollection of sensor data, which communicate among each other using\
    \ LoRa [20] and with the server\nvia MQTT [21] over WiFi. Then, a set of Software\
    \ algorithms complements the network to store and\nanalyze the collected data.\n\
    The system architecture is based on a WSN that was previously developed and tested\
    \ in several\nscenarios by the authors [7,22–24]. The WSN is composed of a set\
    \ of two different nodes, each with\ntheir responsibilities and features:\n•\n\
    The aggregation node: a single gateway, responsible for maintaining the connected\
    \ network and\ncommunicate with the server. It is responsible for receiving the\
    \ messages sent from the sensor\nnodes and sending them to the server.\n•\nThe\
    \ sensor nodes: multiple nodes, responsible for collecting sensor information\
    \ and then\ntransmitting them the server to be analyzed.\nA high-level view of\
    \ the system architecture can be seen in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. System Architecture\
    \ [7] c⃝2019 IEEE.\n3.1. Hardware\nAs described by the authors in their previous\
    \ research [7,22–24], each node is composed of an\nESP32 ultra-low-power consumption\
    \ microcontroller, with built-in WiFi and the ability to connect\nup to 18 analog\
    \ sensors through its 12-bit Analogic Digital Converters (ADCs) [25], and an RFM95W,\n\
    a transceiver LoRa radio module capable of creating encrypted multi-point network,\
    \ that can\ncommunicate up to 2000 meters [26]. An 868MHz dipole ﬂexible antenna\
    \ is part of the hardware that\nforms the nodes.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n4 of\
    \ 14\nAlthough the same hardware is used on both types of nodes, aggregation and\
    \ sensors, each has\nspeciﬁc characteristics. The built-in ESP32 WiFi connection\
    \ is used by the aggregation node, however,\nin the sensor node, no WiFi connection\
    \ is used, which allows this node to use the deep-sleep in order\nto run on batteries\
    \ for a longer period of time, on a low-power fashion. The other difference from\
    \ the\nnodes is that the sensor node is complemented with an array of sensors,\
    \ composed of:\n•\nSensirion SHT30-DIS-P2.5KS: a high accurate and reliable sensor,\
    \ capable of retrieving\ntemperature and air humidity with an accuracy of ±0.1\
    \ ◦C and ±1.5%, respectively, via an\nInter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), was the\
    \ perfect solution for our speciﬁcations, since it is low-cost,\nhas a low power\
    \ consumption with only 1.7 µA on average, and is easy to install and to retrieve\n\
    data [27]. This sensor is a huge improvement when facing the DHT22 used before\
    \ by the authors\nin [7], not only in terms of power consumption and size but\
    \ also has a better accuracy;\n•\nCapacitive moisture sensor: works by measuring\
    \ the capacitance changes between the dielectric\nplates, and is capable of detecting\
    \ the amount of water in the soil. The advantages of these types\nof sensors,\
    \ not only include a better reading of soil moisture, but also avoid corrosion.\n\
    Both types of nodes are enclosed in an IP68 box, as shown in Figure 2, to guarantee\
    \ that\nenvironmental conditions such as rain, wind, heat or dust and wildlife,\
    \ do not damage the electronics\nwhen placed in the implementation environment.\n\
    Figure 2. Smart Node.\nThe system was developed to be power efﬁcient and run on\
    \ batteries for a long period of time,\nwhile being able to collect and transmit\
    \ information. In this case, only the sensor node can be powered\nby batteries,\
    \ since it is the only one that enters in deep sleep after collecting and transmitting\
    \ the sensor\ndata. The aggregation node, since it needs to always be listening\
    \ to new sensor messages, is powered\nby a 5 V power adapter and a voltage regulator.\n\
    The sensor node power consumption in its life cycle can be found in Table 1.\n\
    Table 1. Sensor node power consumption.\nNode Status\nPower Consumption VIN =\
    \ 3 V\nTransmitting\n80 mA\nCollecting data\n20 mA\nDeep Sleep\n100 µA\nSince\
    \ the sensor node is in deep sleep mode for almost 90% of each collecting cycle,\
    \ and due to the\ncomponents chosen, the node can be powered by 2 AA batteries,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2, for long periods\nof time. Table 2 presents the expected\
    \ life-cycle of the batteries, based on real tests, depending on the\ninterval\
    \ between sample collection.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n5 of 14\nTable 2. Sensor\

    The proposed hardware architecture for the WSN meets the requirements of the current\
    \ IoT\nsystems and proves to be an optimization from the current solutions on\
    \ the market, since it is able to\nadapt to multiple situations, as shown by the\
    \ authors in their previous research and tests [7,22–24].\nBesides that, the ability\
    \ to perform in a low-power scheme and also adapt the consumptions to the\nuser\
    \ needs, allows the system to be very reliable in terms of battery replacements.\n\
    The proposed system can support a network of up to 250 nodes, with bigger networks\
    \ not\ncompromising the reliability of the system nor giving extra work in the\
    \ implementation, since the\nnodes are conﬁgured automatically inside the network\
    \ when booting for the ﬁrst time.\n3.2. Communication\nCommunication is the most\
    \ important part of a WSN, being responsible not only for transmitting\nthe collected\
    \ data, but also to keep the network connected, create reliability and guarantee\
    \ that the\nsystem can perform the tasks that were speciﬁed. In a WSN, communication\
    \ also helps improve the\ncoverage of the implementation environment, mainly with\
    \ new protocols, such as LoRa or SigFox,\nallowing the network to expand up to\
    \ 5 km.\nAlthough only two types of nodes exist in the network, two communication\
    \ protocols are required\nto allow the network to work, since an intra-network\
    \ communication for communication between the\nnetwork nodes, and an Internet\
    \ communication to send data to the servers, are needed. Both networks\nwill be\
    \ described in the next sections.\n3.2.1. Node-to-Node Communication\nThis is\
    \ how information is exchanged inside the WSN, from sensor information to actuator\
    \ actions.\nSince nodes can be far from each other, and as some of the nodes are\
    \ powered by batteries, a wireless\ncommunication capable of long-range transmissions\
    \ with low power consumption is needed.\nLoRa, due to its long range and low power\
    \ consumption and also the fact that it works\non an unlicensed radio spectrum\
    \ [20], meaning that no costs are associated, was the chosen\ncommunication standard\
    \ to connect the WSN. With the ability to eliminate repeaters, reduce device\n\
    cost, increase battery lifetime on devices, improve network capacity and support\
    \ a large number\nof devices, when facing other major communication protocols,\
    \ as is presented in Table 3 [20,28–41],\nmake LoRa the ideal solution to connect\
    \ our WSN.\nTable 3. Major Communication Wireless Protocols Characteristics.\n\

    \ bit\nHence, in order to connect all the network nodes, a LoRa peer-to-peer network\
    \ was implemented,\nusing the RFM95W radio transceiver. These modules, capable\
    \ of using the LoRa protocol, allow the\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n6 of 14\nnetwork\
    \ to cover up to 2 km with up to 256 nodes, with individual node addressing [26].\
    \ With the LoRa\nradio module only consuming 70 mA while transmitting and with\
    \ a sleep mode feature, they check all\nthe necessary speciﬁcations in terms of\
    \ node-to-node communication.\nFor conﬁguration and usage, the Arduino library\
    \ RadioHead [42] was used; this enables the node\naddressing, with a unique address\
    \ being chosen, guaranteeing that each node has its own address.\nThe nodes can\
    \ communicate in two different ways, both encrypted by the library:\n•\nBy sending\
    \ a message directly to a speciﬁc node, using its destination address;\n•\nSending\
    \ a broadcast message to every node in the network, including the destination\
    \ node ID\ninside the message.\nNetwork ﬁdelity is assured by the RadioHead library,\
    \ with the use of automatic acknowledgement\n(ACK) response to the node that sends\
    \ the message using its ID, as in the ﬁrst scenario. When a\nbroadcasting message\
    \ is sent, as for the second scenario, no ID is used and so, no ACK mechanism\
    \ is\nused by the library. To cope with this limitation, an ID is added to the\
    \ broadcasting message in order\nfor the receiving node to send an ACK response\
    \ to the transmitting node.\nThe ﬁrst scenario is usually used for the sensor\
    \ nodes to send data to the gateway, while when\nthe gateway send information\
    \ for the sensors or actuators, the second scenario is used.\n3.2.2. Node-to-Server\
    \ Communication\nThis is how information containing sensor data leaves the network\
    \ and actions are received.\nFor that, some sort of Internet connection is needed\
    \ to connect to the server, and since our core\nmicrocontroller, the ESP32, has\
    \ built-in WiFi, we use that functionality to transfer data.\nIn order to create\
    \ a constant low-power data connection, the MQTT protocol was adopted, due to\n\
    its high communication reach and the low power consumption, when compared to other\
    \ protocols.\nMQTT is a messaging protocol [43–45] built on top of the TCP protocol,\
    \ that uses a publish/subscribe\npattern, as shown in Figure 3, to provide ﬂexibility\
    \ and simplicity transition making MQTT an optimal\nconnection protocol for the\
    \ IoT and M2M, being suitable for small, cheap, low power and low memory\ndevices\
    \ with low bandwidth networks.\nFigure 3. MQTT architecture.\nTo implement this\
    \ protocol, it was necessary to deﬁne speciﬁc topics for each way of\ncommunication,\
    \ making it possible to distinguish between messages intended for the server and\n\
    those intended for the aggregation node:\n•\n“irrigation/network/in” – to send\
    \ messages to the server;\n•\n“irrigation/network/out” – messages whose destination\
    \ is the network.\nThe network, and particularly the aggregation node, subscribes\
    \ to the “irrigation/network/out”\ntopic and is constantly listening to new messages,\
    \ for example, action to turn on/off the irrigation.\nWhen a message is received\
    \ through the LoRa network from another node, for example, new sensor\ninformation,\
    \ the aggregation node publishes that message to the topic “irrigation/network/in”.\n\
    The server does the exact opposite, subscribing to the “irrigation/network/in”\
    \ to wait for new sensor\ninformation, and publishing to “irrigation/network/out”\
    \ when a new action is created.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n7 of 14\n3.2.3. Security\n\
    As this will be implemented in real case scenarios, all the system communications\
    \ must be secure,\nincluding the radio transmissions and the MQTT messages. For\
    \ that, all messages are encrypted using\na private key.\n4. Implementation Scenario\n\
    To test if the solution can work to improve convectional irrigation system efﬁciency,\n\
    the implementation scenarios must contain a garden with an existing system. In\
    \ the work developed\npreviously by the authors in [7] a small garden with only\
    \ three irrigation zones was chosen, so now\nthe goal was to select a bigger garden,\
    \ with more diversiﬁcation of irrigation zones and also where\npeople usually\
    \ pass, in order to see if the system affects in any way the normal behaviour\
    \ of the garden.\nThe selected garden, as seen in Figure 4a, is a 2 ha public\
    \ garden with more than 60 irrigation zones,\nin Campo Grande, Lisbon.\n(a)\n\
    (b)\nFigure 4. (a) Satellite Image of the Garden; (b) Irrigation zones and sensor\
    \ implementation.\nSince it was difﬁcult to cover the entire garden with sensors,\
    \ the northern side of the garden\nwas chosen. As displayed in Figure 4b, this\
    \ part of the garden has eight irrigation zones, each with\napproximately 350\
    \ m2, and on four of them, we implement up to three sensor nodes, represented\
    \ as red\ndots, depending on size and type of plants. One aggregation node was\
    \ included in a nearby machine\nhouse, where a WiFi connection was available.\n\
    Figure 5a,b shows how the sensor nodes were implemented in the irrigation zones,\
    \ and mainly\nhow the soil moisture sensor is capable of analysing multiple depths.\n\
    As in the previous research, our system does not replace a convectional irrigation\
    \ system, in order\nto comprehend and compare the results with the use of real\
    \ time environmental data.\nTherefore, each sensor node ran for two months, in\
    \ June and July, retrieving air temperature,\nrelative humidity and soil moisture\
    \ every 4 h and sending them to the servers via the aggregation node.\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 20, 1402\n8 of 14\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5. (a) Smart Node with Soil sensor;\
    \ (b) Irrigation zones and sensor implementation.\n5. Results\nThe system implementation\
    \ allowed the collection of about 320 valid samples per sensor node,\ncontaining\
    \ real time local information about the garden environmental parameters. Two sets\
    \ of\ncollected data can be seen in Figure 6, with 2 weeks in June represented\
    \ in Figure 6a and 2 weeks in\nJuly represented in Figure 6b.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure\
    \ 6. Data collected: (a) 2 week June data; (b) 2 week July data.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 20, 1402\n9 of 14\nThe ﬁrst thing to notice is that in the testing period, there\
    \ were no rain periods, and that irrigation\nwas mainly done when soil moisture\
    \ was below 30%, but it is also possible to notice that humidity\nlevels are high,\
    \ which helps the soil moisture to decrease more slowly, so the water used in\
    \ the\nirrigation can be less.\nIt was possible to understand that the sensors\
    \ spread throughout the garden do not have any\nimplications in the normal activities\
    \ in the garden, not harming the users, plants or do not even need\nto be removed\
    \ when maintenance occurs in the garden, such as mowing the grass.\nAnalysing\
    \ the obtained real time sensor data, it is possible to comprehend that these\
    \ data can\nhelp improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation system.\nThe real water\
    \ needs depend on the type of plants, the evapotranspiration, garden area, type\
    \ of\nvalves and tubing, distance between valves and the number of irrigations\
    \ per day. Considering all\nthese parameters, using Equation (1), it is possible\
    \ to calculate the real amount of water for that\nparticular garden.\nT = A ×\
    \ (Kc + ET) × 60\nF × N × 1000\n/P\n(1)\nwhere T is the irrigation time in minutes,\
    \ Kc is crop coefﬁcient, in this case for grass is 6 L/m2, F is\nthe outgoing\
    \ ﬂow of water per valve in m3/h, N the number of valves, P is the number of irrigation\n\
    periods, A is the garden area in m2, given by Equation (2)\nA = [(0.5 × N) − 1]\
    \ × D2\n(2)\nwhere D is the distance between the valves, and ET is the evapotranspiration\
    \ in mm/day, given by\nsimpliﬁed Hargreaves formula [46] shown in Equation (3)\n\
    ET = 0.0023 × (Tmed + 17.78)R0 × (Tmax − Tmin)0.5\n(3)\nwhere Tmed is the average\
    \ temperature, Tmax is the maximum temperature, Tmin is the minimum\ntemperature\
    \ and R0 is the incident extra-terrestrial solar radiation which, based on latitude\
    \ and time\nof the year, for Lisbon is about 17.1 mm/day.\nIt is possible to see\
    \ that the only parameter in which variations occur is the value of temperature,\n\
    both minimum and maximum, for a particular day. This is the ﬁrst evidence that\
    \ collecting local data\nis important.\nTo use as much of the collected environmental\
    \ data as we can and to create a more efﬁcient system,\nthe irrigation times formula\
    \ (Equation (1)) was adapted to take into consideration the last air humidity\n\
    and soil moisture values. This new formula, Equation (4), allows to have a more\
    \ precise irrigation time,\nsince it includes all the environmental data that\
    \ affect garden health.\nTopt = TIsoil × 0.7 + TIhum × 0.3 + T × 0.1\n(4)\nwhere\
    \ TIx is the time needed to reach 100% of the variable x, in this case soil moisture\
    \ (soil) and air\nhumidity (hum), given by Equation (5)\nTIx = T × (100 − Ix)\n\
    100\n(5)\nwhere Ix is the last value retrieved for the sensor x.\nThe weight of\
    \ each variable in the optimized formula can be adjusted from time to time, in\
    \ order\nto reach a more precise formula. This, in the future, will be done using\
    \ Machine Learning prediction\nalgorithms. The 0.1 added in the end, is a margin\
    \ of error, hence, the 1.1 total weight.\nConsidering the formulas obtained and\
    \ how much data we can input to get better results,\nthree analyses were done\
    \ and compared to the normal irrigation system, already implemented in the\ngarden:\n\
    Sensors 2019, 20, 1402\n10 of 14\n1.\nIrrigation system controlled by our solution\
    \ while using Equation (1) and forecast data to calculate\nthe irrigation times;\n\
    2.\nIrrigation system controlled by our solution while using Equation (1) and\
    \ sensor data to calculate\nthe irrigation times;\n3.\nIrrigation system controlled\
    \ by our solution while using the optimized Equation (1) and sensor\ndata to calculate\
    \ the irrigation times;\nWith these scenarios, not only are we able to check if\
    \ the use of sensor values can really help\nadjust the irrigation times but also\
    \ prove that locally retrieved data are better than weather forecast for\nthat\
    \ region.\nIn the ﬁrst scenario, the national Portuguese weather institute, IPMA\
    \ [47], weather information\nwas used, through their API, with the hourly temperature\
    \ and the higher and lowest values for relative\nhumidity for each day in the\
    \ garden location. The values were retrieved from the IPMA API everyday\nat midnight,\
    \ in order to get the values for the next 24 h.\nFigure 7 compares the IPMA weather\
    \ forecast data with the collected data from the sensor\nnetwork, and is possible\
    \ to understand that although they follow the same pattern, some variations\n\
    occur, that might affect the end result.\nFigure 7. IPMA vs Sensor data comparison.\n\
    In the remaining scenarios, only the sensor network information was used. When\
    \ an irrigation\nschedule approaches, the last needed values retrieved from the\
    \ 4 hour interval datapoints are used in\norder to calculate the needs based on\
    \ the most current conditions available.\nTable 4 shows the irrigation times for\
    \ each of the tested scenarios.\nTable 4. Average irrigation time per scenario.\n\
    Scenario\nAverage Irrigation Time (min)\nCurrent system\n42\n(1)\n33.6\n(2)\n\
    32.3\n(3)\n28.7\nThe obtained results shows that a viable solution that can reduce\
    \ the amount of water used due\nto the adoption of a sensor data approach, is\
    \ possible. To verify that by applying a solution based on\nthe sensor data retrieved\
    \ from the environment, the amount of time the valves are open are reduced,\n\
    meaning that the amount of water used will be lower while maintaining the garden\
    \ healthy.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n11 of 14\nSince valves are open for a reduced\
    \ amount of time, less water will be used, while keeping the\ngarden healthy.\
    \ Equation (6) can be used to calculate the amount of water used based on the\
    \ time that\nthe valves need to be open.\nC = (F × N × 1000) × T\n60\n(6)\nThis\
    \ allows a comparison between the consumptions of the normal irrigation system\
    \ and the\ntheoretical consumptions of a system based on our solution. Table 5\
    \ shows the amount of water used\nin the scenarios described above.\nTable 5.\
    \ Water used per scenario.\nScenario\nWater Used (L/h)\nSavings\n(a)\n614376\n\
    -\n(b)\n463561\n24.55%\n(c)\n452017\n26.43%\n(c)\n401541\n34.64%\nWith these results,\
    \ it is possible to conclude two major results. Firstly, using data to set the\n\
    irrigation times allows a reduction in up to 34% of the water used to irrigate\
    \ a garden. This shows that\na proper analysis of the environment can help create\
    \ a more efﬁcient and sustainable irrigation service,\nnot only saving water but\
    \ also reducing the costs for the owner.\nBesides that, and bearing in mind the\
    \ goal of this paper of assessing if real time and local data can\noffer improvements\
    \ over historical or forecast data, it is possible to see that when using the\
    \ collected\ndata over the IPMA weather data, an improvement of almost 2% is possible.\
    \ This might seem like a\nlow improvement, but when we put it into perspective,\
    \ it relates to almost 10,000 L/h saved.\nFinally, it is possible to conclude\
    \ that when more parameters are used, the best results are obtained.\nUsing the\
    \ optimized Equation (1), that uses soil moisture and air humidity besides only\
    \ air temperature,\nwe get an 8% improvement facing the normal Equation (1).\n\
    Maintaining the irrigation hours, but using the real amount of water that the\
    \ garden needs,\nit is possible to get the same results in terms of soil moisture\
    \ and garden health, while reducing\nwater consumption.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this\
    \ article, the improvements done on a previous published research [7] are presented,\
    \ with the\nmain goal of creating a reliable WSN system to collect real time environmental\
    \ data to optimize\nirrigation times. This paper shows the hardware and software\
    \ improvements as well as the results\nfrom a new real case implementation in\
    \ a bigger garden and for a longer period of time.\nIn the previous research,\
    \ it was possible to conclude that the retrieved data were could be\nintroduced\
    \ in an intelligent and efﬁcient algorithm in order to predict a more accurate\
    \ irrigation\ntiming. It was also possible to understand that by keeping track\
    \ of environmental status, such as rain\nor high humidity values, it is possible\
    \ to detect if it is really necessary to irrigate. In that case study,\nan improvement\
    \ of 25% was achieved, although implementation was done in a small garden and\
    \ for\nonly 2 weeks.\nThe results from this new case study show again that using\
    \ local real time data is a big advantage\nwhen facing forecast and historical\
    \ data, with improvements of 2%. When using data facing a typical\nirrigation\
    \ system, the improvements go up to 26%, when using just temperature, and 34%\
    \ when\ncombining more sensor data, such as humidity and soil moisture.\nOnce\
    \ again, this number can be improved to reach 50% with some modiﬁcations to the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem, namely, the valves and tubing used as well as the application\
    \ layout.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n12 of 14\nIt is also important to note that\
    \ the savings are theoretical, since the irrigation controller was\nnot changed.\
    \ It is possible to evaluate the real amount of water saved, since this can be\
    \ affected by\nnumerous situations.\nBy combining the sensor data gathered by\
    \ the WSN with Artiﬁcial Intelligence algorithms,\nit possible to conﬁgure, in\
    \ real time, the WSN to adapt to new conditions or speciﬁcations, but also\nachieve\
    \ a better efﬁciency in the process leading to savings for the ﬁnal user, not\
    \ only monetary but\nalso in natural resources, such as water and energy, leading\
    \ to a more sustainable environment.\nThe next step of this project is to use\
    \ Machine Learning in order to predict the future conditions\nof the garden and\

    widely used around the world to fill the need of crop watering. This method of
    irrigation has a low efficiency compared to other methods of irrigation such as
    drip systems and generally they use water without consider the real need of plants.
    In this paper we propose an automation system based on the Internet of Things
    (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS) and quasi real-time in the cloud of
    water requirements to improve the efficiency of water use. Indeed, each segment
    of the pivot-center moves at a different speed compared to others; thus, must
    be individually controlled to optimize the yield of irrigation. Moreover, it necessary
    to integrate factors such as stage of crops'' development, heterogeneity of soil,
    runoff, drainage, soil components, nutrients and moisture content. In this paper
    we develop a complete system integrating sensors, GIS, Internet of Things and
    cloud computing. This approach allows to automate fine-grained the consumption
    of water without decreasing the yield. In addition to that, the collect of data
    and the soil moisture measurement will allow to adapt coefficient of evapotranspiration
    to local weather without having to resort to lysimetric measures. The proposed
    architecture allows to store and treat real-time, time series data and low-priority
    data such as 3D images used in digital phenotyping field which are treated with
    batch processing. Published in: 2018 International Conference on Advanced Communication

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Marrakech, Morocco I. Introduction The demand
    of food production and fiber increase with de world population. The irrigation
    management is important particularly in context where the fresh water resources
    are limited. The aim of the irrigation is to give to plants the adequate amount
    of water to ensure their water requirements. The use of Water Production Function
    (WPF) allows to estimate the production in terms of dry matter or marketable yield,
    evapotranspiration ore the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). According
    to the different production functions of IW may also include different components
    in addition to Crop Water Requirement (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to
    prepare the seeding, leaching requirement to decrease the salinity, rise of water
    table by capillarity and rainfall. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\
    \ applications\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081593\n\

    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\
    \ posi-\ntioning systems (GPSs) were available for civil services [11]. GPS services\
    \ were opened\nfor general use in U.S. farms in 1983 [2]. In the next decade,\
    \ GPS technology facilitated\nfarmers to precisely locate and map their ﬁelds\
    \ [10,12], empowering them to manage their\nfarmlands according to site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\
    \ such as planting, seeding,\nharvesting, and soil sampling. This is making farming\
    \ more efﬁcient while reducing\nlabor costs.\nSmart agriculture is an evolving\
    \ ﬁeld that leverages technological innovations to\ntransform traditional farming\
    \ practices. The integration of digital technologies into agricul-\nture has opened\
    \ up new opportunities and possibilities, revolutionizing the way farmers\nmanage\
    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\
    \ exploring its key\ncomponents and highlighting its potential for sustainable\
    \ farming practices. One of the\ncritical aspects of precision agriculture is\
    \ data collection and acquisition planning, which\nplays a fundamental role in\
    \ optimizing farm management decisions. Through efﬁcient data\ngathering, farmers\
    \ can make informed choices regarding crop health, resource allocation,\nand yield\
    \ optimization. Decision making and execution are also vital components of preci-\n\
    sion agriculture, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies is pivotal.\
    \ Leveraging\nmachine vision technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) can\nlead to enhanced precision and efﬁciency in agricultural\
    \ processes, beneﬁting both farmers\nand the environment. Throughout this review,\
    \ successful precision agriculture proposals\nand real-world implementations are\
    \ analyzed to gain insights into their achievements and\nchallenges. By identifying\
    \ future developments required in precision agriculture, we aim\nto provide a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of how this ﬁeld can continually evolve to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable farming practices and address global food security challenges. The\n\
    amalgamation of scientiﬁc research and technological innovations holds great promise\
    \ for\nthe future of precision agriculture and its positive impact on agriculture\
    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\
    \ time related to net beneﬁts [9] while supporting the conservation of agricultural\n\
    inputs and reducing costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another\
    \ man-\nagement tool, grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into\
    \ a grid and collecting\ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach\
    \ provides representative information\nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11],\
    \ where such data are able to be used for site-\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n\

    \ small-scale\nvariabilities of soil and crop features, a local resource management\
    \ (LRM) system was\ndeveloped with computer-aided farming (CAF), which translated\
    \ information into variable\nrate applications [11].\nThus far, humans have used\
    \ digital tools to enhance diagnosis and decision making\nwhile adding automated\
    \ machines for precise performing [14]. The accelerating changes of\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 plus these digital technologies have granted the gradual automation of the\n\
    diagnosis and decision-making steps, limiting human involvement to only monitoring\n\
    (Figure 1) [6]. This revolution mostly targets optimal farming and variability\

    \ should not rely solely\non “more production”. At the same time, it should be\

    \ applied to understand data-intensive agri-\ncultural processes for decision\
    \ making [6], where analytic tools operate enormous data\nsets [4]. These analytic\
    \ tools consist of data mining, statistics, AI, predictive analytics,\nneural\
    \ language processing, etc. [4]. Big data science usually functions either with\
    \ ML,\ncloud computing, image processing, modeling and simulation, statistical\
    \ analysis, NDVI\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n7 of 26\nvegetation indices, or\

    marketing features of this high-performance informatics technology [6]. These\
    \ predictions\nand recommendations assist farmers with handling the upcoming outcomes,\
    \ risks, and\nchallenges in the agricultural industry [4]. Combining the data\
    \ in agricultural production\nprocesses creates traceability of product while\
    \ increasing product quality, including safety\nand taste. As customers are now\
    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n9 of 26\nage [4,13,16,28]. Those sensors can directly\
    \ combine with agricultural robots, autonomous\nplatforms, machines, and weather\
    \ stations for real-time monitoring [4]. With the IoT, UAVs\ncan respond promptly,\
    \ leading to high-quality, high-resolution, and exceptionally reliable\nobservations\
    \ through high-throughput 3D monitoring at different geographical areas. At\n\
    the same time, various kinds of agricultural sensor nodes, autonomous farm vehicles,\
    \ and\nmobile crowd sensing have been put forward based on the IoT for ground\
    \ and undersurface\ncognition [8]. Most IoT sensors in precision agriculture are\
    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\
    \ mobile terminals, and intelligent devices in\nmodern agriculture, the integration\
    \ of machine-learning algorithms has had signiﬁcant\nimprovement. With machine-learning\
    \ models, integration into mobile detection algorithms\nhas paved the way for\
    \ innovative and more precise detection methods, overcoming certain\nlimitations\
    \ faced by technology adaptation in plant factories, such as limited computer\n\

    \ and\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n10 of 26\nprecision issues related to small\

    \ fruit and pest detection, as well as the optimization and prediction of complex\n\
    conditions in plant tissue cultures and breeding processes [25,28,44]. Notably,\

    \ and providing accurate predictions of the dynamic nature\nof agriculture while\
    \ identifying new opportunities [1]. Supervised machine-learning\ntechniques,\
    \ such as support vector machines, decision trees, k-means, random forests,\n\
    genetic algorithms, deep learning, and fuzzy logic, are several categories of\
    \ machine-\nlearning models (Figure 3) that play a vital role in agricultural\
    \ automation, augmenting\nthe intelligence of other technologies, such as smartphones,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles,\nunmanned ground vehicles, satellite systems, automated\
    \ machines, agricultural robots,\nand big data analytics [1,28,31].\nMobile applications\
    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\
    \ ML algorithms in big data are also critically essential because this\nintegration\
    \ can learn from data to create decisions, data-based prospects, and predictions.\n\
    Due to the intricate input data requirements of machine learning (ML) and deep\
    \ learning\n(DL), the initial stage of adopting ML models in precision agriculture\
    \ may encounter\nsigniﬁcant obstacles in terms of the time and cost involved in\
    \ gathering the necessary data\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n11 of 26\nfrom commercial\
    \ farms [1,6,30]. However, with the continuous advancement of IoT sensors,\nAI-based\
    \ autonomous machines or robots together with cloud computing, edge computing,\n\
    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\
    \ ML is able to be\nused to solve diverse issues in agriculture related to yield\
    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\
    \ animal welfare, livestock production,\nwater management, and soil management\
    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\
    \ instance-based models, regression, artiﬁcial and deep neural\nnetworks, ensemble\
    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\
    \ Examples are the fuzzy-logic-based soil risk characterization decision support\
    \ system\n(SRCDSS), management-oriented modeling (MOM), artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs),\nCALEX, PROLOG, computer vision systems, ANN-GIS, invasive weed optimization\
    \ (IWO),\nand support vector machines [4]. One key application of AI is a mobile\
    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\
    \ 26\n \nAI background [52,54], and therefore, when detecting diseases, pests,\
    \ nutrient deﬁciency, \nand weeds, stressed responses are detected using high-quality\
    \ images generated with \nUGV or UAV remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and\
    \ satellite imaging to support \nhigh-throughput phenotyping [57]. Ultimately,\
    \ high-throughput phenotyping has the po-\ntential to revolutionize agriculture\
    \ by enabling more the precise, real-time, and eﬃcient \nmonitoring of farming\
    \ practices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmen-\ntal impacts,\
    \ and increase food security [54]. \n \nFigure 4. Importance of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping in agriculture. \nThe traditional methods of plant breeding have\
    \ limitations in terms of time, cost, and \naccuracy. HTP, on the other hand,\
    \ uses nondestructive and rapid methods to gather data \non a large number of\
    \ plants, allowing breeders to identify traits of interest more eﬃciently \n[58].\
    \ A study by Yang et al. (2017) [59] described using high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ \n(HTP) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic\
    \ architecture \nof maize plant growth. The authors collected data on various\
    \ traits related to plant growth, \nsuch as plant height, leaf area, and biomass,\
    \ using HTP techniques, such as imaging and \nspectroscopy [59]. Unmanned aerial\
    \ systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary \nchange in ﬁeld high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping by providing a platform for diﬀerent sen-\nsors to collect remote-sensing\
    \ data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include regular RGB \ncameras, multispectral-imaging\
    \ cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras, thermal-imag-\ning sensors, and light\

    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\
    \ domains [34]. As an example, a study in Thailand designed telematics-equipped\n\
    tractors to assist farmers in efﬁciently managing their machinery, optimizing\

    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\
    \ thinning and pruning. This system addressed\nlabor shortages, reduced fruit\
    \ production costs by approximately 30%, provided real-time\nupdates to farmers\
    \ via a mobile app, and aimed to tackle challenges faced by the agriculture\n\
    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\
    \ in\nthe cloud, reducing costs and improving productivity. Experimental validation\
    \ conﬁrmed\nthe effectiveness of the model for crop prediction and soil health\
    \ maintenance, emphasizing\nthe importance of real-time data collection and expanding\
    \ data sets and regular application\nuse for informed decision making and soil\
    \ quality enhancement [49]. The use of unmanned\naerial systems (UASs) and unmanned\
    \ ground vehicles (UGVs) in precision agriculture for\ninspecting insect traps\
    \ in olive groves was proposed by [49], with a cooperative robot archi-\ntecture\
    \ using UAS and UGV systems evaluating vision-based navigation algorithms and\n\
    augmented reality tags for return and landing. The results demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ of\nthe architecture for automating inspections and improving pest control policies.\
    \ Challenges\nremain in addressing real-world conditions and optimizing image\
    \ capture. Future work\nincludes real-world scenarios and long-term mission capabilities\
    \ of UAS vehicles [49].\nTwo studies from University Tenaga National, Malaysia,\
    \ present autonomous and\nrobotic machineries to deal with fertilizer and pesticide\
    \ spraying. The authors of [67]\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n16 of 26\npresented\
    \ a low-cost agricultural robot for fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,\n\
    and pest detection. The prototype system operated autonomously, reducing labor\
    \ costs,\nalthough productivity slightly lagged behind human workers. An autonomous\
    \ organic\nfertilizer mixer was developed in [68] based on IoT technology to reduce\
    \ labor costs and\nenhance efﬁciency. The improved mixer allowed remote monitoring,\
    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\
    \ by the Beijing Research Center\nof Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture. This\
    \ new harvesting robot system for cherry\ntomatoes was designed featuring a railed-type\
    \ vehicle, a visual servo unit, a manipulator,\nand picking end-effectors. Field\
    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\
    \ for\ndifferent seed sizes (Table 2).\nThe Cooperative Heterogeneous Robots for\
    \ Autonomous Insects Trap Monitoring\nSystem experiment in Portugal proposed a\
    \ cooperative UAS and UGV system for olive\ngrove inspection that veriﬁed the\
    \ feasibility and robustness of the multiple-cooperative\nrobot architecture in\
    \ an olive inspection scenario [49]. Russian researchers Filipe et al. [7]\nproposed\
    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\
    \ agriculture tasks,\nensuring transparency and veriﬁcation at each stage. Precision\
    \ agriculture is a strategy that\nuses advanced technologies, like sensors, remote\
    \ sensing, and data analytics, to improve\nagricultural management decisions and\
    \ increase productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainabil-\nity. Machine-learning\
    \ models have been integrated with IoT sensors to develop intelligent\nsensors\
    \ for generating of big amount of data. In the study of Smolka et al. [71], a\
    \ microchip\ncapillary electrophoresis sensor was used for soil nutrient analysis,\
    \ demonstrating its gen-\neral sensitivity to ions in liquids, particularly NO3,\
    \ NH4, K, and PO4. The sensor exhibited\nstrong linearity and detected important\
    \ plant nutrients, which could contribute to future\ndevelopments in digital agriculture.\
    \ Insufﬁcient power infrastructure is one obstacle in\nadapting novel technologies\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds. Researchers successfully developed an\nIoT-based solar-energy-powered\
    \ smart farm irrigation system in the United Arab Emirates\nthat harvested renewable\
    \ energy for smart farm irrigation [72]. This study outcome paved\nthe way to\
    \ developing three operation modes that are available for farmers’ use.\nVRT is\
    \ a major constituent in precision agriculture that deploys ﬁeld maps, GPSs, and\n\
    GNSSs to establish the precision of input applications. A study of a data fusion\
    \ method\nfor yield and soil sensor maps [21] evaluated fusion results on ﬁelds,\
    \ highlighting their\nusefulness in decision support for drainage, irrigation,\
    \ and variable yield goals. It un-\ncovered hidden areas of lost yield potential\
    \ using soil sensing, EC, pH, organic matter,\nand topography data fusion. Researchers\
    \ in Beijing, China, developed a new method\nusing image segmentation and pixel-level\
    \ visual features to accurately classify ﬁeld and\nroad areas in GNSS recordings\
    \ of agricultural machinery, surpassing existing methods\nand demonstrating a\
    \ superior performance for high-frequency GNSS trajectories [46]. A\nmultisensor\
    \ data fusion approach was used by Whattoff et al. for creating variable depth\n\
    tillage zones [27]. Variable depth tillage (VDT) reduced costs, labor, and fuel\
    \ consumption.\nA multisensor data fusion approach was developed to map soil properties\
    \ for VDT imple-\nmentation, showing the depth of tillage needed in different\
    \ areas. This approach proved\nuseful in guiding VDT operations for efﬁcient soil\
    \ management.\nOne study in Germany integrated computer-aided farming, an IoT-based\
    \ pH sensor,\nand VRT for effective VR liming, and the lime requirement was successfully\
    \ determined\nin situ by establishing a buffer curve [11]. A ﬁeld evaluation of\
    \ a VR aerial application\nwas conducted in the study of Martin and Yang [23]\
    \ utilizing prescription maps for aerial\nglyphosate applications with variable\
    \ rate nozzles. Accurate spray deposition within 20 feet\nAgriculture 2023, 13,\
    \ 1593\n17 of 26\nof the target was conﬁrmed using multispectral imagery, boosting\
    \ conﬁdence in variable\nrate application and encouraging adoption. Italian authors\
    \ Corbari et al. [73] explored the\nintegration of a satellite-driven soil–water\
    \ balance model and meteorological forecasts to\nenable precision smart irrigation.\
    \ It discussed model performance and emphasized the\nimportance of using consistent\
    \ data for the calibration and validation of soil hydrological\nparameters [73].\
    \ The short communication of Jang et al. [22], “Spatial Dependence Analysis\n\
    as a Tool to Detect the Hidden Heterogeneity in a Kenaf Field”, presented high-throughput\n\
    phenotyping as having potential in precision agriculture. This study demonstrated\
    \ its\napplication for revealing ﬁeld heterogeneity and suggested its use for\
    \ better analysis and\nmanagement in plant breeding and precision agriculture.\
    \ In [57], Kim et al. emphasized\nthe importance of evaluating drought effects\
    \ during the vegetative stages of soybean,\nindicating the potential of using\
    \ phenotypic traits as selection indicators for breeding\ndrought-resistant soybean\
    \ cultivars, especially considering the escalating crop damage\ncaused by drought\
    \ and global warming.\nAnother study asserted precision agricultural applications\
    \ in agroforestry. Tree species\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation is important\
    \ when combatting climate change, as well as\nmonitoring ecosystem health 17.\
    \ Researchers used images from SENTINEL-2 to propose\nmethods to determine tree\
    \ type distribution in a wide forest area using UAV images [14,17].\nThey effectively\
    \ distinguished evergreen, deciduous trees, and grassland areas, aiding in\nforest\
    \ planning and preparing for climate change impacts. Ma et al. [14] used a random\n\
    forest classiﬁer with satellite images to improve texture feature separation among\
    \ tree\nspecies. The overall classiﬁcation achieved 86.49% accuracy and a 0.83\
    \ Kappa coefﬁcient,\nalthough altitude, slope, and aspect inﬂuenced tree distribution.\
    \ These outcomes were\nimportant in species classiﬁcation and biodiversity monitoring,\
    \ as well as in informing\ninventory estimation [14].\nAn evaluation of soybean\
    \ wildﬁre prediction via hyperspectral transmission imag-\ning was performed with\
    \ Python, which detected bacterial wildﬁre in soybean leaves\nwhere different\
    \ varieties exhibited distinct spectral signatures. This allowed the precise\n\
    detection and differentiation of healthy and diseased plants effectively with\
    \ high accu-\nracy (97.19% and 95.69%) in early disease detection, conﬁrming its\
    \ usefulness in soybean\nplant monitoring [32].\nAasim et al. [44] focused on\
    \ establishing the efﬁcient and reproducible in vitro re-\ngeneration of common\
    \ beans through a combined approach of in vitro regeneration and\nmachine-learning\
    \ algorithms. ML models, particularly ANN algorithms, were used for\nprediction\
    \ and optimization. The ML and ANN models demonstrated superior perfor-\nmances,\
    \ proving their efﬁcacy in analyzing and optimizing complex conditions in plant\n\
    tissue culture protocols for breeding purposes.\nA computer vision and deep-learning-enabled\
    \ weed detection model for precision\nagriculture was proposed in [25] integrating\

    \ combined multiscale object detection and ELM-based\nweed classiﬁcation. The\
    \ results showed improved outcomes over recent approaches, and\nfuture extensions\
    \ included integration with IoT and smartphones.\nAt the same time, a novel procedure\
    \ involving machine learning and UAV-based\nimagery was developed to accurately\
    \ identify crops and weeds, offering potential integra-\ntion into autonomous\
    \ weed management systems and contributing to improved precision\nagriculture\
    \ practices with reduced resource consumption [45].\nAt Sairam Institute of Technology\
    \ in India, a ﬂood detection system based on the\nIoT, big data, and a convolutional\
    \ deep neural network (CDNN) was developed [30].\nThe CDNN algorithm demonstrated\

    \ to alleviate the strain on agri-food production, the introduction of alternative\n\
    nutrient sources can be explored, particularly through the utilization of cultured\
    \ meat and\n3D-printed meat as substitutes for traditional animal meats, thus\
    \ reducing the demand on\nanimal husbandry. In China, the production of lab-grown\
    \ meat using muscle stem cells\nnecessitated edible 3D scaffolds created through\
    \ electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing,\nshowcasing the signiﬁcant potential of\
    \ prolamin scaffolds for cultivating cultured meat [74].\nSimilarly, the construction\
    \ of 3D-printed meat analogs from plant-based proteins has been\nconducted, improving\
    \ the printing performance of soy protein- and gluten-based pastes\nfacilitated\
    \ by rice protein. This study examined the rheological properties and printing\n\
    performances of edible inks made from soy protein isolate (SPI), wheat gluten\

    \ the 3D-printing\nperformance, holding potential for the 3D printing of plant-based\
    \ foods and constructing\nmeat analogs simulating real meat properties [75].\n\
    Several studies have shown why the adaption rate of these studies is slow, and\n\
    one case study conducted in Chumphon Province, Thailand, by Kasetsart University\n\
    examined the adoption of smart farming technology among durian farmers, highlighting\n\
    that factors such as age, occupation, access to extension services, and farm size\

    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\
    \ to ensure data security [20].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n21 of 26\nTable 3.\

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n22 of 26\n6. Future Developments Required\nIn recent\
    \ years, the agricultural sector has recognized the potential beneﬁts of adopting\n\
    new digital technologies. However, the slow rate of adaptation can be attributed\
    \ to several\nroadblocks and uncertainties associated with these advancements.\
    \ Despite the challenges,\nthere is a growing demand for organic foods [78], leading\
    \ to a shift from sustainable\nagriculture to smart organic farming. To capitalize\
    \ on this emerging opportunity, certain\nsteps need to be taken.\nOne crucial\
    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\
    \ novel agricultural\napproaches, we can pave the way for a more efﬁcient, sustainable,\
    \ and productive future\nin agriculture.\n7. Conclusions\nPrecision agriculture,\
    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\
    \ paper serves as a valuable resource for farmers and companies seeking\nto adopt\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. By providing insights into IoT devices,\n\
    automation systems, data analytics, and precision-farming techniques, this paper\
    \ fos-\nters awareness and understanding of the opportunities and challenges in\
    \ smart farming.\nArmed with this knowledge, companies can make informed decisions\
    \ regarding technology\ninvestments and strategic planning while promoting sustainable\
    \ farming practices and\ncollaboration within the industry. By embracing Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies, farmers and\ncompanies can enhance their agricultural operations,\
    \ optimize resource utilization, and\ncontribute to the collective progress toward\
    \ smart farming’s promising future.\nAuthor Contributions: E.M.B.M.K., A.T.L.,\

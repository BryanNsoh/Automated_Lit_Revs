    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\

    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown

    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    India, there is an exponential rise in population nutrition requirement. To meet
    up with both the ends, the agricultural techniques should be perfected for optimal
    yield and quality. Irrigation and soil property monitoring system using sensors
    can be automated and operated wirelessly to achieve optimal water supply control
    and surveillance. The objective of this paper, is to automate the whole wireless
    sensor network (WSN) system with a control over water pumps and dripper valves.
    The humidity, temperature and pH sensor’s percepts provide a feedback, to control
    the water content of the soil. The system has an low-cost and energy reliable
    ZigBee for sensor data transformation, high-range GPRS system for data storing
    and analysis, and the whole system is powered by Solar panels which makes it self-sustainable.
    Customizable options for different crop with different requirements make it a
    versatile WSN system for automated irrigation based water management. Similar

    largest sectors to contributing 17.9% General Directorate of Pharmaceutical Affairs
    (GDPA) to the economy till 2014. Over 58% of the rural households depend on agriculture
    as their principal means of livelihood. While such a huge population is facilitated
    by this sector it still lacks the considerable amount of modernization and advancement
    to be implemented on field. Such developments would not only serve for a better
    production and quality enhancement but also introduce the much needed ease of
    operation with detailed monitoring. With new advancement in Technology it is required
    to update the conventional systems of day to day matter like Agriculture and especially
    irrigation for better and efficient yield and control. There has been a long tradition
    of measuring crop water use and crop water requirement to assess irrigation performance.
    In Doorenbos et al. [1] related crop water use to reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) and crop coefficient (Kc), which account for all crop-specific variables.
    Kc values calculated by traditional methods by Alan et al. [2] represent average
    to optimum agricultural status under stress-free conditions and fail to describe
    variations within and across fields. Tasumi et al. [3] showed Actual Kc estimates,
    however, have inherent variations because of physical, physiological and management
    factors. A real-time and continuous closed-loop irrigation control system integrates
    soil property monitoring, irrigation scheduling and control for remote and large
    agricultural fields making it a real help for cultivators. Here the research project
    is objectified to evaluate water content along with temperature and pH of the
    soil for targeted crop Potato (also called Solanum tuberosum) and run pump systems
    to provide adequate water and proper monitoring for a healthy and optimal yield.
    The Control is done by a PIC16F877A Microcontroller which is a RISC controller.
    Temperature Humidity and pH as parameter are fed to the evaluating PIC with the
    help of LM35 Temperature sensor, Soil moisture sensor and SEN10972 pH Sensor kit.
    The percept provided by the sensors are sampled and used to evaluate real-time
    weather condition. Thus a proper monitoring system with a valve control can be
    made to run on solar powered system making it self-sufficient in energy requirement.
    For providing better view of this research work this paper is organized in such
    a way that initially the overall system designed is overviewed. The types of sensors
    implemented on the irrigation field are discussed briefly and last the empirical
    evaluation of the observed results and discussed. 2 Related Work With Advancement
    in various fields of technology a number of enthusiastic individuals have tried
    to bind two ends of technological advancement in electronics with trivial practices
    of agriculture. Especially when talking about Irrigation the idea of automated
    and precise watering to conserve water resources and reduce effort is very tempting.
    Consistency of supply with precise monitoring is one of the prime objectives.
    The automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by variable
    frequency speed is based on traditional design method of pipeline irrigation system,
    combines the frequency conversion and automation technologies, and divides the
    field into irrigation subareas according to pressure rating. Each subarea delivers
    water automatically according to appropriate pressure rating, which can greatly
    enhance irrigation uniformity as proved by He et al. [4], Using the advantages
    of remote sensing data regarding any land mass can be gathered in form of images
    portraying their characteristics. The same has been done by Abuzar et al. [5]
    in their paper where they compared the satellite data for satellite-based ET and
    NDVI to derive Kc. Consistency and slight over supply of water was observed as
    the overall product of the experiment. The real work in automation and design
    of the smart irrigation has been done with real time sampling. Reche et al. [6]
    used the WSN with Ad hoc. Humidity and temperature sensing to get large sampling
    rate and direct sprinkler control using the network. Similar ideology has been
    followed majorly worldwide for sensing feedback from moisture sensor and temperature
    sensor to understand current requirement of the soil. Nilesh et al. [7] in IEEE
    2013 INDICON presented a Microcontroller based drip irrigation system presented
    a work with DTMF tones are used for the communication between farmer and monitoring
    station. A low cost method that can be applied to small scale land. In a latest
    attempt over the same subject Vellidis et al. [8] published in Springer 2015 about
    integrated irrigation scheduling decision support system using wireless sensor
    array with center pivot irrigation system. In an extensive and real time project
    Kim et al. [9] used the WSN for real time sampling of data using Bluetooth and
    control of irrigation system. While using this system the Plug and play option
    was offered by for sensor making it versatile for big field. Sensor stations were
    made at particular areas which read real time feed for soil temperature humidity
    nutrition content etc. In another paper Kushal et al. [10] tried a similar monitoring
    technique with pH, humidity and temperature. They cited that precipitation of
    phosphorus present in fertilizers would talk place if the soil already rich in
    calcium and manganese. At the same time pH level when mitigated to form salts
    lead to over salt contents which are again not good fertilization and hence not
    fit for Agriculture it-self. Following the same trend in advance manner Sonali
    et al. [11] found in their research that high pH value soils have toxic value
    of aluminium and manganese. It was also found those soil organisms that help in
    agriculture are hindered by high acidic soils. Crops with moderate fertilizer
    requirements do best overall in soil with pH 5.5–6.5. 3 System Overview This irrigation
    system consists of four main units as shown in Fig. 1. Mainly the irrigation field,
    in the field the designed wireless sensor are implanted in a Mesh topology pattern.
    The percept received from the field is send to the WSN-PPU (wireless sensor’s
    percept processing unit). For cheap and fast mode of transmission Xbee Series
    2, Zigbee sensors were used. The received signal is analysed in WSN-PPU and appropriate
    command to pass to the Wireless sensor network actuator controller (WSN-AC) unit.
    According to the type of field and water availability either sprinkle or Drip
    or surface irrigation methodology [12] can be implemented to water the irrigation
    field. The received precept and the corresponding actuator pair dataset are stored
    in the Sensor’s Data Analysis Unit (WSN-DAU) for further usage. This unit can
    be aided either by internet service controller or by Bigdata service [13]. Fig.
    1 System overall configuration Full size image The overall implementation of existing
    systems that can be seen in Literature surveys has been for research purpose and
    testing only. Also the previous works as specified in the Literature surveys requires
    expensive systems that cannot be afforded by general low scale farmers. There
    is rarely any real implementation of such smart control methods that are seen
    in India. The proposed methodology would be fit for both large scale and small
    scale farmers with more customizable options. For a large scale field, feed from
    multiple humidity sensors can determine the effectiveness of irrigation system
    for uniform distribution of water at the same time conserving water as it only
    supplies required amount as programmed with maintained humidity. As for a greenhouse
    or small scale land such system will reduce the need of skill and other involved
    hardships over irrigation and nutrition testing. In this paper the principle behind
    WSN-PPU is explained in detail with appropriate results. Monitoring WSN nodes
    in the field, are the basic parameter sensors deployed in the monitoring area
    of the soil environment, these units are used to realize the monitoring function.
    The general flow diagram is shown in Fig. 2. The functions of these Nodes are
    defined as follows: Fig. 2 WSN flow diagram Full size image Collecting the temperature,
    Soil moisture and pH data of the soil area to be monitored. The Moisture, temperature
    and pH sensors installed on the monitoring nodes can meet the above needs and
    realize the linearization and temperature compensation for the data collected.
    Setting up a wireless network based on the ZigBee protocol. A great number of
    monitoring nodes and base station a dynamically assembled into a wireless network
    based on the ZigBee protocol, via which the pH, temperature and other data, shall
    be routed to a base station. 4 Sensors on Irrigation Field The proposed field
    environment monitoring system based on a WSN can be divided into three parts:
    base station, monitoring nodes and WSN-PPU for the irrigation area being detected.
    Many number of monitoring nodes, has been distributed in working area to be detected,
    constituting a monitoring network. Now each node can collect parameters such as
    pH, soil moisture and temperature which can indirectly tell us the amount of dissolved
    oxygen, electrical conductivity rate. Also is capable of operating data packaging,
    collected parameter storing in memory and determining the constituents of the
    soil on the basis of pH detected; the data obtained from the nodes is sent to
    the remote monitoring centre by the base station via ZigBee module setup; the
    monitoring centre analyses and processes the soil quality parameters gives a display
    for soil contamination and its suitability, in addition any missing constituents
    in soil, and does the decision making in choosing the type of soil to be cropped
    and the amount of water to be irrigated at different instants of time. The end-user
    can also be implemented with all-weather detection on field area via WSN-DAU.
    The whole setup monitoring system exhibits characteristics like large storage
    capacity, easy display, low power consumption, cheap cost, and no influence on
    the normal environment. With an open effort to many other papers [5] the wireless
    sensor network was found to be predominantly more precise than satellite imaging
    and more favoured for real time sampling. Also a number of controllers were used
    for parameter evaluation and comparison ranging from 8085 to PIC to DSP. It was
    found that apart from humidity and temperature many researchers overlooked the
    Nutritional context of the field probably to be objective specific only i.e. Control
    of irrigation. However pH is a cumulative expression for acidic or basic nature
    of the soil which can be considered as parameter that can be controlled by exploiting
    the acidic or basic concentration of the water that is being used in irrigation.
    The research project prerequisites of few concepts like controller, sensors and
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee, which are essential to the hardware. The
    overall Microcontroller unit is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Overall controller unit
    Full size image 4.1 Soil Moisture Sensor Soil moisture sensor used here is SEN-13322
    that measure the volumetric content of water in the soil indirectly by using some
    other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant,
    or interaction with neutrons as a proxy for the moisture content. There are two
    large exposed pads which function as probes for the sensor, they together act
    as a variable resistor. The more water that is in the soil means the better the
    conductivity between the probes will be and will result in a lower resistance.
    The VCC and GND pins are connected to the PIC. Our analog readings will vary depending
    on what voltage is used for VCC as well as the resolution of the ADC pins. There
    is a comparator inbuilt in the sensor which compares the analog output from the
    soil obtained through the probes. This output ranges from 0 to 5 V, the reference
    voltage is 5 V. The PIC is used to calculate the moisture through a set of coding
    and algorithm defined within a program. The sensor is serially connected to the
    ADC pins of PIC which converts the analog input to digital and the PIC processes
    the input and the comparator process through the algorithm defined. This gives
    the moisture result in the LCD screen. For better result the sensor probes are
    inserted more than half of its length inside the soil and are kept for some few
    seconds. The ADC module of PIC microcontroller which we are using has 8 inputs
    for 40 pin Devices. The conversion of analog signal to PIC ADC module results
    in corresponding 10 bit digital number. PIC ADC module has software selectable
    high and low voltage reference input to some combination of VSS, R1, R2. Here
    analog input is converted to channel 1–10 bit digital number with low voltage
    reference (Vref−) 0 V and high voltage reference (Vref+) 5 V. The output will
    be displayed using one LCD. One can change the Vref− and Vref+ by configuring
    the ADCON1 register. 4.2 Temperature Sensor National Semiconductor’s LM35 IC has
    been used for sensing the temperature. The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit
    temperature sensors, whose output voltage is linearly proportional to the Celsius
    (Centigrade) temperature. The LM35 thus has an advantage over linear temperature
    sensors calibrated in degree Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a
    large constant voltage from its output to obtain convenient Centigrade scaling.
    The LM35 is rated to operate over a −55 to +150 °C temperature range. This makes
    it suitable for field work. The LM35 is calibrated to an accuracy of 1 °C. Its
    measurement range is from −55 to 150 °C. The output is linear and each degree
    Celsius equals 10 mV, thus 150 °C = 1500 mV and −55 = −550 mV. 4.3 pH Sensor pH
    sensor consist of a pH combined electrode with output probe that is connected
    to the PIC with the help of an amplification circuit serially. The best thing
    about the setup is it outputs data from the probe over serial. There is a definite
    need of different buffer solutions to observe the pH value like red for pH 4.0,
    yellow for pH 7.0 and blue for pH 10.0. The pH circuit converts the current generated
    by hydrogen ion activity into the pH. The current that is generated from the hydrogen
    ion activity is the reciprocal of that activity and can be predicted using this
    following Eq. (1) $$E = E^{0} + \frac{RT}{F}\ln \left( {\alpha x_{H + } } \right)
    = E^{0} - \frac{2.303RT}{F}pH$$ (1) where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the
    temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday constant. Along with the probe Buffer
    solutions are maintained. For dilution of water in order to maintain the pH level
    of the soil the irrigation water uses is mixed with KCl solution with required
    H+ ion and OH− ions. The concentration of ions are controlled in order to obtain
    two separate pH buffer solution Buffer solution 1 with Acidic nature has pH =
    4 and Buffer solution 2 with pH = 9 has the Basic nature. A simple digital pH
    meter can be made with a very cheap operational amplifier TL082 (with Dual JFET-input),
    two 9 V batteries, a digital multimeter, and a pH probe (SEN 10972). The TL082
    works as a unity gain buffer between the high impedance value of the pH probe
    and the multimeter. Two batteries power a high-input-impedance op-amp. The pH
    probe is connected to the non-inverting input. This proposed circuit is so small
    and so simple that there is no need of a circuit board. In this method, one BNC
    connector is used to connect to the pH probe. In theory, a pH probe produces 41–59
    millivolts (mV) per pH unit and at pH 7, the probe produces 0 V. For acid pH values
    it produces negative voltages and positive for basic pH values. At 7.02 pH calibration
    buffer the voltage is 4.4 mV. With pH 3.00 calibration buffer, the output voltage
    measured with the digital multimeter is 167.9 mV. Hence, 167.9–4.4 = 163.5 mV
    (for 4.02 pH) Thereby, 163.5/4.02 = 40.67 mV (per pH unit) Now for 100 mV, the
    pH is: 100/40.67 mV = 2.45 (pH units difference from 7.01) 7.02–2.45 = 4.57 pH
    In this way the soil testing results in acidic conclusion. This same method was
    tried with different buffer solutions of soil by adding acidic and basic drops
    in specified proportions and the graph in Fig. 7 was obtained. Hence the pH calculated
    is then serially input to the PIC through ADC module. This PIC does the arithmetic
    and other logical operations according to the coding and algorithm defined. The
    output of this is displayed in the LCD screen which is interfaced with the microcontroller.
    4.4 Microcontroller PIC 16F877 is the microcontroller used in the project from
    Microchip family. There are numerous reasons behind selecting this microcontroller.
    It has 14 bit core, 40 pin DIP, works on up to 20 MHz It also has flash memory
    for rewritable purpose. This microcontroller is very easy to be assembled, program
    and also the price is very cheap. The erasing time is almost unnoticeable because
    once new program are loaded into the PIC, the old program will automatically be
    erased immediately. PIC 16F877A already made with 368 bytes of Random Access Memory
    (RAM) inside it. Any temporary variables that are used inside the program are
    stored inside the RAM thus eliminating the need of external memory. The size of
    program code that can be stored is about 8 k words inside PIC16F877A ROM. 1 word
    size is 14 bits which is more than enough for the system. The crystal oscillator
    that can be connected to the PIC microcontroller range from DC to 20 MHz. The
    ADC module of PIC microcontroller which we are using has 8 inputs for 40 pin Devices.
    The conversion of analog signal to PIC ADC module results in corresponding 10
    bit digital number. PIC ADC module has software selectable high and low voltage
    reference input to some combination of VSS, R1, R2. Here analog input is converted
    to channel 1–10 bit digital number with low voltage reference (Vref−) 0v and high
    voltage reference (Vref+) 5 V. The output will be displayed using one LCD. The
    ADC resolution that is the minimum voltage required to change between bits for
    PIC 16F877A is 0.004887 V. 4.5 Solar Power System Solar power is the most abundantly
    available resource the human being can ever get. Though it hasn’t been used even
    up to it’s 5% potential. Nowadays solar panels are put into use in large scale
    even to run a whole building. Solar panel has proven itself in many ways, cooking,
    firing, electricity etc. In our research project we are using a small solar panel
    of 7.5 × 7.5 cm dimensions, which is enough to charge a 12 V rechargeable battery
    which in turn powers the whole circuit including the PIC and the motor valves.
    The solar panel has a discharging current of 200 mA and provides 2 W power. The
    solar panel is connected to the battery through a dc to dc chopper circuit. The
    circuit is responsible to transfer the dc power generated in the solar grids to
    the battery. The battery here serves as the storage device. This battery is connected
    to the power input point of the PIC. Hence there is a continuous supply of power
    to the central unit in case of rain, sun or no sun. The case when there is no
    solar energy available, the recharged battery powers the circuit for 4 h as per
    the practical testing showed. But in order to increase its driving time, one can
    always go for bigger solar panel. The project also includes a solar panel to make
    it-self sustainable. The solar panel charges under the sun and a chopper circuit
    used to store the energy in a chargeable battery and works during day and night.
    Hence there is no need of external power supply whatsoever. The overall implementation
    of this research work is shown Fig. 4. Fig. 4 a Overall hardware view. b Moisture
    sensor in the field. c pH sensor in the field Full size image 5 Sensor Design
    The research project implements an Xbee Series 2 hardware that enables several
    different flavours of standards-based ZigBee mesh networking. Mesh networking
    is the heart of creating robust sensor networks, the systems that can generate
    immensely rich data sets or support intricate human-scale interactions. It has
    a typical (indoor/urban) range of 40 m; best (line of sight) range is 120 ms.
    Transmit/Receive current of 40/40 mA and firmware (typical) is a ZB ZigBee mesh.
    There are 11 digital input/output pins and 4 analog input pins. Other features
    are low power, low bandwidth, low cost, addressable, standardized, small and popular.
    It uses a whip/wire antenna sticking up from the body of the radio. It’s simple
    and offers omnidirectional radiation, meaning the maximum transmission distance
    is pretty much the same in all directions when its wire is straight and perpendicular
    to the module [14]. A wireless sensor network consists of receiving and transmitting
    module. The transmitting node can be either in the field or at the base station.
    Unlike Wi-Fi, it’s not an open source. The ZigBee module uses two Xbee modules
    in order to send and receive data. For an application like agricultural monitoring
    system the best suited system is ZigBee because of its appropriate distance range,
    fast data transfer rate and also it is cheap as compared to others. 5.1 Data Transmitting
    and Receiving Process The data transmitting process is nothing but the data to
    be transferred from the monitoring nodes on the field to the receiver at the base
    station. The data transferred are soil moisture, temperature and pH values of
    the soil. The pH setup needs an amplification circuit [15] which has been explained
    earlier in the pH section. The transmitting side has Xbee series-2 module which
    is connected to the receiver side through a local network created in application
    programming interface (API 2) mode. The port A0 to A5 in the PIC is used for collecting
    data purpose. The inputs are given at port A0 to A2 and outputs are collected
    at port A3 to A5. After that the module checks for any further available WSN functions.
    If there exist a signal, the data is transmitted; otherwise the process is repeated
    again. The receiver also has Xbee series 2 module used which resides at the base
    station. The data is transmitted via ZigBee wireless sensor network and is received
    in analog form which is then converted to digital values through ADC converter
    in the PIC. Now the digital values are stored in the database. Then check for
    any reception request signal available from the transmitter side, if yes repeat
    the process otherwise wait for the next signal to be transmitted. Figure 5 shown
    the data flow diagram for data transmission and reception. Fig. 5 Transmission
    and receiving process data flow diagram Full size image The Table 1 shows the
    variations in the different analog values with respect to variation in distance
    from the receiver system. The analog ouput values of the moisture sensor, the
    temperature sensor and the pH sensor output are all tabulated as A1, A2 and A3
    respectively. The receiver side is connected to the system and the transmitter
    side is in the field with the sensors. The RX1, RX2 and RX3 are the received values
    of A1, A2 and A3 pins respectively. The Xbee S2 has the best working range of
    120 m. The output was taken after every 3 m distance up to 120 m and was tabulated
    as shown above. The tabulation concludes that the best working range of Xbee S2
    module is 97 m, since beyond 97 m the output in the LCD screen was either theoretically
    wrong or practically impossible. Hence the display of error values tells that
    beyond 97 the values may or may not be true, but within 97 m the Xbee module can
    be used with accurate measures. Table 1 Transmission and reception percept Full
    size table The project deploys a computer to configure the XBee and to send and
    receive data directly from our laptop. The XBee is made to be soldered directly
    into a printed circuit board. The use of Xbee explorer adapter is made to connect
    it to computer’s USB port using a fairly standard USB cable. The whole setup is
    built over a breadboard and is interfaced through a PIC microcontroller. The transmitter
    side is connected to the soil sensors and receiver side is connected to the evaluation
    board. 6 Empirical Evaluation As a part of this research project, different aspects
    of the hardware along with standalone modules were tested for different conditions
    to analyse sampling scenario efficiency. The Project module was tested in a field
    of area nearly 16 sq. feet with sub terrain soil commonly found in Tamil Nadu.
    The Priority given is most for pH followed by Humidity and temperature at bottom.
    The system first analyses the pH data that is provided by the sensor. The pH rating
    is checked for the ideal pH range (In case of a potato it is from 5 to 6 pH).
    The relative pH, temperature and humidity of the soil once measured were given
    to the soil and a valve control was established with a simple irrigation dripper.
    The pH data gives an account of compatibility of the soil with the crop and fertilizers
    to be used. The farmer can decide from the readings that weather the crop to be
    sown and fertilizers to be used will result in a good yield or not. Soil Moisture
    Sensor has two probes that basically provide a bridge to be facilitated by conducting
    nature of moisture. The probes are distanced by 3 cm and have an effective area
    of radius 28 cm, beyond which sensor is ineffective. The test was done by keeping
    temperature constant first at room temp T = 32 °C and the probe was inserted in
    soil and then water was supplied to the periphery from dry condition to saturated.
    The same experiment was repeated with T = 37 °C. The Moisture content was noted
    and result was shown in graphical form. The Inference made was that the sensor
    nearly shows the uniform character for a temperature with rise of moisture content
    nearly 12%. With sampling done in real time scenario the sampling rate of moisture
    sensor was kept very large to once in every 1 s keep keen surveillance. However,
    knowing that pH change in soil is very time taking process and conserve energy
    consumption the pH of the soil was sampled after every 1 h. The following Table
    2 shows the values obtained on the field testing for 8 days. The minimum and maximum
    values are indicated along with the mean/average value for that particular day.
    Hence from the Fig. 6, the result from this table is that the pH for that particular
    crop ranges from 6 to 6.7, moisture varies from 24 to 61% and temperature varies
    from 24 to 34 °C. Fig. 6 Percept’s average values on the field Full size image
    Table 2 Sensor readings per day Full size table The following graph Fig. 7 illustrates
    the variation of output voltage between the electrode and reference electrode
    with the pH value. The digital pH meter setup explained in the earlier section
    was used to obtain the curve other than the ideal straight line. This curve shows
    the accuracy of the pH electrode which is very slightly deviated from the ideal
    value, hence proving it to be correctly working. Fig. 7 pH Electrode voltage variation
    with pH level Full size image The following graph Fig. 8, displays the hourly
    variation in the humidity of the soil tested for approximately 12 h duration.
    The moisture varied from 24 to 35% on a normal day for a particular crop field
    in Chennai. Fig. 8 Moisture hourly variation in a day Full size image Unlike the
    above graph temperature doesn’t show ups and down in the curve as shown in Fig.
    9. Since, the testing was done on the soil of Chennai, naturally the humidity
    will be high and so will be the temperature. The temperature values are also taken
    on hourly basis and variations were recorded. There is gradual increase and decrease
    in the temperature curve when tested on the same field for 12–15 h duration. As
    shown in the figure below, the temperature varies from 26 °C at 8 am to 33 °C
    in the afternoon and again back to 24 °C in the evening. Fig. 9 Soil Temperature
    hourly variation in a day Full size image The pH value was tested on a field continuously
    for 10–12 days span and the values were recorded. The graph shown below is drawn
    with the help of the data obtained. The pH value varied from 5.5 to 7 as shown
    in the Fig. 10. The crop upper limit and lower limit was specified and there was
    a slight overcoming of the value at pH 7 on the third and fourth day, which can
    be due to many reasons like over watering the plants or cool weather or less fertilizer
    usage, improper ploughing etc. Fig. 10 pH recordings Full size image 7 Conclusion
    The research experiment conducted rendered lot of interesting facts regarding
    the characteristics of the soil. The overall humidity content not only described
    how quickly the soil was losing water but also this loss was making it slightly
    less acidic nature which was loss of H+ ions. Once the pH was found to be out
    of ideal region (5–6) water content was diluted for desired characteristic and
    drippers were turned on. This might overshoot the ideal humidity line. The average
    Soil moisture content was nearly maintained to the desired level. For initial
    level of growth we assumed the moisture content of soil ideally to be 30–31%.
    The average output for the tested soil was found to be 28%. (Note that this value
    is low as it initially required compensate the dryness of the soil. Hence this
    value is below the set ideal value) The overall system provided real time monitoring
    and control to water content, temperature and pH of the soil with acceptable water
    over supply level. As a part of the research project further development can be
    made in User Interface system and design of the mechanical structure. With advancement
    in mobility and communication technology a smart phone app can be designed for
    a well-organized real time data display and other functionality. Again for more
    precise and sensitive control better sensors like ion selective electrodes can
    be used for an extensive research scenario. References Doorenbos, J., & Kassam,

    Agriculture plays an important role in the making and development of a country.\
    \ In India, agriculture is \nthe primary source of living for more than about\
    \ 60% of its population. The agriculture-related issues \nalways hinder the development\
    \ of a country. The enhancement of traditional agriculture methods and \nits modernization\
    \ towards smart agriculture is the only solution for agriculture problems. Hence,\
    \ by \nconsidering this issue, a framework is presented for smart agriculture\
    \ using sensor network and IoT. The \nkey features of this system are the deployment\
    \ of smart sensors for the collection of data, cloud-based \nanalysis, and decision\
    \ based on monitoring for spraying and weeding. The smart farming approach \n\
    provides valuable collection of data, high precision control, and automated monitoring\
    \ approach. \nThe proposed system presents smart agriculture monitoring system\
    \ that collects and monitors the \nsoil moisture, environmental temperature, and\
    \ humidity. The measured soil moisture, temperature, \nand humidity are stored\
    \ in ThingSpeak cloud for analysis.\nKEywoRdS\nInternet of Things (IoT), Precision\
    \ Agriculture, Productivity, ThingSpeak Cloud Platform, Wireless Sensor \nNetworks\
    \ (WSNs)\n1. INTRodUCTIoN\nPrecision agriculture is a method in which farmers\
    \ optimize inputs such as water and fertilizer for \nthe enhancement of productivity,\
    \ quality and yield (Srbinovska et al., 2015). The term precision \nagriculture\
    \ also encourages for minimizing pests and diseases through specially target application\
    \ \nof precise amount of pesticides. Smart agriculture or precision agriculture\
    \ is an integrated farm \nmanagement framework which constitutes a holistic management\
    \ approach aiming to optimize the \nyield per unit of farming land. Increasing\
    \ the quantity and quality of agricultural products while \nutilizing less inputs\
    \ such as fertilizers, water, pesticides, energy, etc., results in cost reduction\
    \ with \npositive environmental impact (Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017). Therefore,\
    \ rather than applying the \nsame amount of fertilizers over the entire agricultural\
    \ field or applying fertilizers to specially target \narea helps in overall cost\
    \ reduction. The smart agriculture solution measures the variation in field \n\
    conditions and adapts the fertilization or feed strategy accordingly (TongKe,\
    \ 2013). Farmers as the \nprincipal stakeholders usually make complex decisions\
    \ without proper information and execute the \nInternational Journal of Agricultural\
    \ and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n\
    2\ndemanding field operations. Therefore, smart agriculture solutions are best\
    \ designed considering \nfarmers at the center of the process. The solutions of\
    \ smart agriculture complements and transforms \nthe skills and experiences gained\
    \ naturally through the generations (Chhetri et al., 2017). The smart \nsolution\
    \ can complement the farmer’s capabilities in three main processes. The three\
    \ sub-processes \nare presented in Figure 1. The sub-processes are data collection,\
    \ decision making, and intervention. \nThe data collection is a part where remote\
    \ sensing and sensor networks are utilized. In the decision \nmaking part, expert\
    \ systems and machine learning can be exploited. The third part is an intervention\
    \ \nwhere intelligent machinery and robotic agents can be utilized for field operations.\
    \ The complete \ntypical process cycle includes data collection for measuring\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, PH, \nhumidity, or multi-spectral images.\
    \ The data collection process is followed by the data analysis which \nproduces\
    \ a description for the pesticides, irrigation, fertilizers, and harvest. The\
    \ last component of \nthe process is an automated intervention which executes\
    \ the description maps on the field area using \nvariable rate technology machinery.\
    \ This cycle can monitors the possible areas of concern like soil, \nvegetation,\
    \ or the environment. In addition to this farmer, related sub-processes smart\
    \ agriculture can \nbe designed to provide extra benefits. The benefits for external\
    \ functions such as soil and environment \nmonitoring, traceability of food, and\
    \ specific bookkeeping facilitating national planning (Mekala and \nViswanathan,\
    \ 2017). The recent survey presents the decreasing level of waters and drying\
    \ up of major \nwater resources such as rivers and tanks, presents efficient utilization\
    \ of water resources (Veena et \nal., 2018). The technological evolution of WSNs\
    \ and IoT made it possible to monitor the environment \nand agricultural fields\
    \ for gaining the production (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). \nThese technologies are\
    \ in different levels of maturity and adoption across all over the world. \nTherefore,\
    \ more than often technology introduction to different communities needs to be\
    \ planned \nand driven by the relevant authorities. The blind technology or solutions\
    \ should account for the wide \ndiversity of agriculture for the following characteristics\
    \ particularly farm size, farming types, farming \npractices, level of yield,\
    \ and employment (Patil and Kale, 2016). These are the major challenges in \n\
    the technology of smart agriculture. The technology and their solutions should\
    \ be customized and \nadapted accordingly. In general, the factors that affect\
    \ technology adoption in agriculture are yield gap, \nfarm size, and the learning\
    \ required for the integration of new technologies with the existing practices\
    \ \n(Elijah el al., 2018). On the other hand, smart agriculture solutions affect\
    \ farming economics through \nmultiple channels. Hence solution design should\
    \ evaluate farming economics in different levels of \nanalysis. The smart agriculture\
    \ solution can reduce operational costs by optimizing the user inputs. \nFigure\

    \ can grow enough to increase \nthe operating benefit. The smart agriculture solutions\
    \ are built on the several enabling technologies \ninvolving sensor technology,\
    \ global navigation satellite system (used for positioning), remote \nsensing,\

    \ woRK\nThe major rising issues of agriculture such as decreasing water levels\
    \ (rivers and tanks) and \nenvironmental factors that need to be addressed and\
    \ requires a solution based on smart agriculture. \n(Liqiang et al., 2011) presented\
    \ a system for monitoring crops utilizing temperature and moisture \nsensors.\
    \ (Ocampo et al., 2017) developed an algorithm based on temperature and soil moisture\
    \ values \nand the sensed information is processed through the gateway for controlling\
    \ water quantity. Their \nproposed system has duplex communication links and power\
    \ through photovoltaic panels. Their \nsystem utilizes a cellular network interface\
    \ for data transmission and its calculations for irrigation \nscheduling. The\
    \ advancement in the field of wireless sensor networks has helped the evolution\
    \ of \nmany approaches for precision agriculture applications. (Chaudhary et al.,\
    \ 2011) have presented a \nsystem that utilizes WSNs for monitoring and controlling\
    \ greenhouse parameters. It is observed from \nthe study of different agriculture\
    \ fields that outcomes from agriculture are decreasing day by day. The \nadoption\
    \ of new technologies for precision agriculture promises an increase in production\
    \ rate and \nalso reduces the extra manpower requirements. There exist many studies\
    \ contributing to the benefit \nof farmers which provides an efficient system\
    \ based on new technologies for increasing the overall \nproduction rates (Varman\
    \ et al., 2017). (Keshtgari and Deljoo, 2011) developed a system that uses a \n\
    distributed wireless sensor networks system. Their proposed system is designed\
    \ for providing real-\ntime monitoring of the agriculture field and controlled\
    \ irrigation scheme for increasing productivity \nutilizing water resources efficiently.\
    \ The system provides the design in detail including real-time \nfield sensing\
    \ and controlled irrigation utilizing the software. The designed system provides\
    \ a low-\ncost efficient solution for irrigation control using WSNs. The system\
    \ using WSNs for precision \nagriculture highly depends on the field parameters\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity \nlevels. Sensor nodes were\
    \ deployed below the soil for the collection of parameters and these sensor \n\
    communicates among others using communication protocols and transmits their measured\
    \ data to the \ncontrol station through the sink node. (Zhao et al., 2017) have\
    \ designed a communication protocol \nfor quick transmission of the sensor data\
    \ to the sink node. Their proposed design delivers very few \nduty cycles and\
    \ results increase in the lifetime of the monitoring system. (Bachuwar et al.,\
    \ 2018) have \ndeveloped a system that utilizes sensors and UART (universal asynchronous\
    \ receiver transmitter) \ninterface. The transmission is carried out through hourly\
    \ sampling, buffering of data, its transmission, \nand at last the validation\
    \ of status. The experimental results present attenuation in radio frequency \n\
    signals because of sensor deployment under the soil and the deployment cost is\
    \ comparatively high. \n(Gayatri et al., 2015) presents a solution for monitoring\
    \ agricultural fields along with the irrigation \nInternational Journal of Agricultural\
    \ and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n\
    4\ncontrol utilizing GPS (global positioning system) enable sensors. Their system\
    \ is capable for providing \ntimely response but the drawback is deployment cost\
    \ and the attenuation which caused by deploying \nsensors under soil. (Dan et\
    \ al., 2015) presented a greenhouse monitoring system based on WSNs and \nIoT\
    \ integration with cloud. Their system is capable of logging and storing data\
    \ in cloud periodically \nand present an effective solution for greenhouse monitoring.\
    \ \n(Heble et al., 2018) have presented a cost-effective solution of farming where\
    \ the water resources \nare limited. The designed system considers low-cost sensors\
    \ and easy circuitry and designed an \nautomatic water flow control system. The\
    \ real-time monitoring considers sensing of temperature and \nhumidity and displaying\
    \ them on LCD. Their designed system provides the water efficiently to the \n\
    needed plants measured according to the present moisture level. (Reche et al.,\
    \ 2014) have proposed \nan irrigation scheduler system based on low cost and time-dependent\
    \ microcontroller. Their designed \nsystem comprises of sensor network for the\
    \ detection of soil moisture and temperature levels. The \nreal-time sensed data\
    \ is processed to the users through SMS using GSM module.\n(Nawandar and Satpute,\
    \ 2019) presented an irrigation system consists of soil moisture sensors and \n\
    irrigation controllers. Their system provides a wireless link among the farmer\
    \ computer and irrigation \ncontroller. The designed system can be adopted where\
    \ the water quality is poor or limited. They have \nimplemented a decision support\
    \ system for the optimization of irrigation control, the use of fertilizers, and\
    \ \nwater for the development of crops. (Channe et al., 2015) designed a smart\
    \ agriculture system based on \ncloud computing and the Internet of Things. The\
    \ cloud platform is utilized for achieving load balancing \nand resource’s dynamic\
    \ distribution. (Rajeswari et al., 2017) presented a system based on the control\
    \ \nnetwork and IoT platform. Their design also presents an information management\
    \ system for storing and \nprocessing data. The stored data can be accessed to\
    \ facilitate various researches on agriculture. Table 1, \npresents the comparative\
    \ study of a conducted literature survey of different agriculture approaches.\
    \ Most \nof the solutions provided for smart farming or precision agriculture\
    \ does not provide a cost-effective \nsolution for farming. The system for irrigation\
    \ presented by (Reche et al., 2014) is the most efficient \nsolution for smart\
    \ agriculture as their approach provides the real time analysis of data. The designed\
    \ \nmodel presents a cost-effective solution for smart agriculture. The proposed\
    \ system measures the real-\ntime field parameters and stores the data in a cloud\
    \ platform for real-time analysis.\n3. SySTEM dESIGN\nThe prime objective behind\
    \ our design is to present a smart agriculture system based on IoT and \nsensor\
    \ network that can control the irrigation and fertilizers for high crop production.\

    5\ndesign requires soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and air monitoring sensors\
    \ for designing a \nsystem without human interventions. Figure 2, presents the\
    \ proposed framework for smart agriculture \nbased on sensor networks and IoT.\
    \ The proposed design consists of four layers of operation which \nare sensor\
    \ deployment, middleware, communication, and application layer.\n3.1 Sensor deployment\
    \ Layer\nSensor deployment in the agriculture field is the first layer of operation.\
    \ The proposed system uses a \nsoil moisture sensor, temperature, and humidity\
    \ sensor and air monitoring sensor for the collection of \nfield data. The deployed\
    \ sensor nodes are presented in Figure 3. These sensor nodes are responsible \n\
    for collecting real-time field data and regular monitoring of the agriculture\
    \ field. The soil moisture \nsensor measures the soil moisture level, temperature,\
    \ and humidity sensor to measure the relative \ntemperature and humidity levels.\
    \ Similarly, an air monitoring sensor is used to estimate wind speed \nand directions.\
    \ These sensor nodes communicate with each other and transfer the sensed information\
    \ \nto the sink or master node. \nThe sink node is Arduino Uno based microcontroller,\
    \ which is responsible for collecting field \ndata and transferring information\
    \ further to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for storage and its \nanalysis. The\
    \ hardware used for the experimentation collects data in real time (soil moisture\
    \ level, \nrelative temperature & humidity and wind speed). The sensor nodes communicates\
    \ with each other \nwirelessly and transfers sensed data to sink node which is\
    \ GSM enabled. This sink node is responsible \nfor gathering the field information\
    \ and transferring data to the cloud for analysis and storing.\n3.2 Middleware\
    \ Layer\nMiddleware is the second operation layer of our proposed system. This\
    \ layer is responsible for \ncontrolling the actuators and automating the agriculture\
    \ process. The collected values beyond the \nthreshold are transferred to the\
    \ controller for their analysis in the ground station. These operational \nlayers\
    \ carefully monitor the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and wind speed as\
    \ these factors \nFigure 2. IoT based framework for smart agriculture\nInternational\
    \ Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue\
    \ 2 • April-June 2021\n6\ndirectly impact agricultural yields. The system is configured\
    \ considering three factors; in the first \nfactor when the soil moisture is observed\
    \ below its threshold value an alert message is generated and \nsend to the user\
    \ through e-mail. The automated system then generates a query for turning ON the\
    \ \nwater motor for soil irrigation. When the required irrigation level is covered\
    \ the system automatically \nturns OFF the water motor. The factor considers the\
    \ rise in relative temperature and humidity values \nbeyond the threshold. The\
    \ system sends an automated generated alert and suggests to open the flap \nof\
    \ greenhouse or poly-house for maintaining the ambient atmosphere. The third factor\
    \ is the wind \nspeed and its direction which is monitored by air monitoring sensors.\
    \ When air monitoring value \nsucceeds threshold, systems generate an alert for\
    \ covering the region and targeted plants, protecting \nthem from harm. The middleware\
    \ layer is responsible for above mentioned three operations. These \noperations\
    \ are carried out in the ground station using the ThnigSpeak platform based on\
    \ the real-\ntime analysis of sensed field data. Controlling these three factors\
    \ in the targeted agriculture region, \nincrease the overall crop production with\
    \ efficient use of resources.\n3.3 Communication and Cloud Analysis Layer\nThe\
    \ third operational layer of the proposed system is the communication layer. This\
    \ layer uses \nArdunio Uno based microcontroller and responsible for communicating\
    \ with the deployed sensors. \nThe collected data is transferred to the base station\
    \ through this gateway wirelessly as it is comprised \nof the GSM module. This\
    \ module is WiFi-enabled and communicates the information wirelessly. The \ndeployed\
    \ sensor monitors the field data such as moisture, temperature, humidity, wind\
    \ speed, and \ncommunicates them to the gateway node. An IP protocol is running\
    \ in the controller gateway which \nsends the collected information to ThingSpeak\
    \ cloud for analysis and making decisions.\n3.4 Application Layer\nThe advancement\
    \ in the field of cloud computing and edge computing provides an effective solution\
    \ \nfor the issues of smart agriculture application. The designed model uses the\
    \ ThingSpeak cloud platform \nfor the collection of field data and provides efficient\
    \ storage and analysis. In this operational layer, \nFigure 3. Deployment of Sensors\
    \ for data collection\nInternational Journal of Agricultural and Environmental\
    \ Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n7\nvarious channels\
    \ are created for specific field parameters that represent their regular monitoring\
    \ and \nstoring of data fields with time and date. The gateway node transmits\
    \ the particular measured data to \ntheir respective channels. Table 2 represents\
    \ the sample of an observed dataset from the agricultural \nfield in the ThingSpeak\
    \ Platform. In table 2 column 1 represents the time and date of recorded instance,\
    \ \ncolumn 2 represents their entry numbers. The rest of columns represents values\
    \ of soil moisture in \npercentage (amount of water present in soil), temperature\
    \ (in degree Celsius), humidity in percentage \n(amount of moisture present in\
    \ air) and wind speed (in meters per second). The data is analyzed using \nMATLAB\
    \ in ThingSpeak cloud for calculating irregularities and predicting the results.\
    \ These data \nvalues are plotted using MATLAB for its time-based analysis in\
    \ the ground station. The agricultural \nfield data can be monitored from anywhere\
    \ at any time, remotely using web service.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe performance\
    \ of the system is realized by deploying sensor modules in the agriculture field\
    \ and \nanalyzing real-time collected in ThingSpeak IoT Platform. The hardware\
    \ setup consists of Arduino \nUno and other various sensors for collecting field\
    \ data. The hardware and software utilized for \nexperimentation are discussed\
    \ below and presented in Figure 3.\n4.1 Hardware Used\nArduino Uno Microcontroller\n\

    \ Sensor\nThe soil moisture sensor is deployed for calculating the percentage\
    \ of water quantity present in the soil. \nThe required average percentage of\
    \ the water content in soil varies for different agriculture domains \nTable 2.\

    \ The moisture sensor is used to measure \nthe percentage of water in the soil\
    \ and to transfer the collected measurement to the controller for \nmaking control\
    \ actions in terms of turning On/Off Water motors. The soil moisture sensor consists\
    \ of \ntwo attached electrodes that need to be placed in the upper layer of soil.\
    \ The soil moisture sensor is \nan analog sensor and it provides an analog output\
    \ to the controller. The output of the moisture sensor \nis converted to a digital\
    \ value (10 bit) and hence the average percentage is calculated.\nTemperature\
    \ and Humidity Sensor\nVarious crops are evolved as temperature and humidity sensitive.\
    \ DHT11 a digital sensor is utilized for \nmeasuring temperature and humidity\
    \ values. This sensor provides the early detection of temperature \nand humidity\
    \ values so that some precautionary steps or preparations can be implemented for\
    \ the \nupcoming season to increase crop production. The temperature and humidity\
    \ values play an important \nrole in deciding the accurate cultivating time of\
    \ crops. \nAir Monitoring Sensor\nFresh air is very much important for the nourishment\
    \ of crops and plants. The amount of polluted air \nmay degrade the growth or\
    \ may sick crops and plants. Therefore, the monitoring of air quality is an \n\
    important parameter for the growth of plants and crops. MQ135 air monitoring sensor\
    \ is used which \nprovides an analog output. This sensor detects the wind speed\
    \ and the presence of toxic gases in the air. \nThe output in the form of analog\
    \ is converted to 10-bit digital form and then presented in percentage.\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi\nRaspberry Pi provides the sensor interface to the gateway node and performs\
    \ computing and networking \noperations. It is the most important part of the\
    \ Internet of Things platform. It provides the wireless \ntransmission of sensed\
    \ information to the cloud so that the data can be accessed remotely. The Pi \n\
    model B is utilized for this framework which has a quad-core ARM processor, HDMI\
    \ and USB ports, \nGSM module and storage SD slot. \n4.2 Software Used\nThingSpeak\
    \ IoT Platform\nThingSpeak Cloud platform is used for the real time analysis of\
    \ ground data. This cloud platform \nprovides the facilities for processing of\
    \ data in case of any adversaries. An observed sample of ground \ndata is presented\
    \ in Table 2. It is used to plot the sensed information of field in terms of soil\
    \ moisture, \ntemperature, humidity and air quality.\nMATLAB Function\nMATLAB\
    \ function of ThingSpeak platform is utilized for presenting the comparative study\
    \ of previous \nand current stored values. The observed data can be analysed implementing\
    \ various machine learning \nand deep learning algorithms for their evaluation.\
    \ \n5. RESULTS ANd ANALySIS\nThingSpeak IoT platform provides services such as\
    \ data aggregation, visualization, and data analysis of \nlive streams. The sensed\
    \ field information is transmitted to the cloud platform using gateway module\
    \ \nand instant visualization of data is created and alerts are generated and\
    \ transmitted using web service. \nThe MATLAB analysis of ThingSpeak stored data,\
    \ runs a MATLAB code for processing, visualizing, \nand analyzing data streams.\
    \ Based on experimental setup the proposed system collects real-time field \n\
    information such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These\
    \ sensed instances \nare transmitted to the cloud system for their timely analysis.\

    \ the generated plots \nfrom following sensed data (a): Soil Moisture, (b): Temperature,\
    \ (c): Humidity and (d): Air quality. \nThe cloud platform represents the graphical\
    \ representation of sensed agricultural field data. The \nfield information is\
    \ visualized in real-time utilizing cloud applications. It is observed from Figure\
    \ \n4, that the field data is updated and plotted through ThingSpeak analysis.\
    \ The graph represents the \nvariation in the sensed values in different instances\
    \ and plotted accordingly. Field 1 is set for soil \nmoisture channel, field 2\
    \ corresponds to temperature channel, field 3 for humidity, and field 4 for air\
    \ \nquality measurement. The different fields update their data and stores every\
    \ upcoming value every \n3 to 6 minutes.\nThe MATLAB function of the ThingSpeak\
    \ platform is utilized and a MATLAB code is executed \nfor the visualization of\
    \ temperature comparison for three days and to find the relation between the \n\
    relative temperature and wind speed. Figure 5, presents the MATLAB based visualization\
    \ of three days \nmeasured values of temperature and relative temperature values\
    \ with wind speed. This visualization \nhelps in predicting the upcoming weather\
    \ for considering changes and implementing operations for \nimproving crop production.\
    \ In agriculture, the efficient use of water is an important factor. This system\
    \ \nmainly focuses on the effective utilization of water in agriculture along\
    \ with the weather prediction. \nThe work is mainly based on the moisture content\
    \ of the soil, and relative temperature and humidity \nvalues. This system allows\
    \ a sufficient supply of water to the agriculture field and accurate prediction\
    \ \nof weather for increasing the crop yields. \nThe prediction of upcoming weather\
    \ plays an important role in maximizing crop yields. The \nproposed system based\
    \ on the MATLAB analysis of recently recorded temperature values of three \ndays\
    \ predicts the weather report. Figure 6, presents the histogram of temperature\
    \ variation at different \ntemperature ranges. The weather prediction is calculated\
    \ using the MATLAB analysis of recorded \ntemperature values. \nFigure 4. Generated\

    \ and this further helps in \npredicting the percentage of moisture content in\
    \ soil for the coming days. Weather prediction helps \nin calculating the percentage\

    \ user through notification whenever the soil is in dry condition means high resistance.\
    \ Based on \nthe threshold values of moisture sensor an automatic operation of\
    \ soil irrigation through water motor \nis initiated. \nThe soil moisture content\
    \ varies for different types of agricultural fields. The designed system is \n\
    capable of pumping water to the field whenever required. The automated operation\
    \ of the water motor \nturns off automatically when the percentage wet level of\

    \ system is capable of \nproviding continuous monitoring of the agricultural field\
    \ and triggers the operation of the motor as \nper the requirement. The performance\
    \ of the system is evaluated considering two major performance \nmetrics. Average\
    \ response time and standard deviation at the same cloud platform and different\
    \ cloud \nplatforms. The response time and standard deviation are measured for\
    \ the same clod platform and \ndifferent cloud platforms for the evaluation of\
    \ the overall system’s performance.\nTable 3, presents the analysis of the proposed\
    \ framework for average response time and standard \ndeviation at the same cloud\
    \ and different cloud platforms. The observed standard deviation and \nresponse\
    \ time of the system for the same clout platform are 10.63 milliseconds and 13.57\
    \ milliseconds. \nSimilarly, for different cloud systems, the standard deviation\
    \ and response time are recorded as 16.24 \nmilliseconds and 25.17 milliseconds.\
    \ These observed results are compared with other cloud-based \napproaches (Reche\
    \ et al., 2014; Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) and it is analyzed that the performance\
    \ of \nthe proposed framework is better than others and concludes that the system\

    \ the literature on applications of remote sensing for monitoring soil- and\n\
    crop- water status for irrigation purposes. The review is organized into two main\
    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\
    \ sensing approaches for precision irrigation\nto estimate crop water status,\
    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\
    \ canopy structure (height and Leaf Area Index);\n(iv) crop status; (v) canopy\
    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\
    \ photo to grayscale image, and then conversion to false colors. The upper part\
    \ of the image\n(darker soil color) corresponds to the most drained part of the\
    \ ﬁeld during the winter season, which\nwas then excluded from measurements. Results\
    \ of the experiment are published by Alvino et al. [83],\nreporting the effect\
    \ of shallow water tables on peach trees grafted on three peach seedlings.\nThere\

    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

    \ agricultural sector is one of the major users of water resources. Water is an\
    \ important\nasset that needs to be preserved using the latest available technologies.\
    \ Modern technologies and\ndigital tools can transform the agricultural domain\
    \ from being manual and static to intelligent\nand dynamic leading to higher production\
    \ with lesser human supervision. This study describe\nthe agronomic models that\
    \ should be integrated with the intelligent system which schedule the\nirrigation\
    \ and fertilization according to the plant needs, and monitors and maintains the\
    \ desired soil\nmoisture content via automatic watering. Solar fertigation is\
    \ a fertigation support system based on\nphotovoltaic solar power energy and an\
    \ IoT system for precision irrigation purposes. The system\nmonitors the temperature,\
    \ radiation, humidity, soil moisture, and other physical parameters. An\nagronomic\
    \ DSS platform based on the integration of soil, weather, and plant data and sensors\
    \ was\ndescribed. Furthermore, a three-year study on seven ETo models, such as\
    \ three temperature-, three\nradiation-, and a combination-based models were tested\
    \ to evaluate the sustainable ETo estimation\nand irrigation scheduling in a Mediterranean\
    \ environment. Results showed that solar fertigation and\nHargreaves–Samani (H-S)\
    \ equation represented a nearby correlation to the standard FAO P–M and\ndoes\
    \ offer a small increase in accuracy of ETo estimates. Furthermore, the hybrid\
    \ agronomic DSS is\nsuitable for smart fertigation scheduling.\nKeywords: crop\

    \ experiences several challenges in food and ﬁber pro-\nduction to feed a growing\
    \ population by 2050 [1]. Water, energy, and food security are\ncrucial for a\
    \ sustainable long-term economy [2]. A large amount of water is consumed in\n\
    the farming sector and about 70% of groundwater and river water is used in irrigation\
    \ [3].\nAgriculture will always be considered one of the major users of water\
    \ resources and is still\nrequired to be more efﬁcient especially in arid and\
    \ semiarid climates.\nIrrigation water management has to perform the particular\
    \ processes that could\nincrease the food production using the more crop per drop\
    \ strategy [4]. Improving irrigation\nmanagement could be provided by advanced\
    \ technology and smart irrigation systems.\nAutomating crop irrigation supports\
    \ the optimum amount of water without the avail-\nability of labor to control\
    \ valves and analyze the plant growth status. The developmental\nphases in IoT\
    \ and WSN technologies and the recent advances in sensors for the implemen-\n\
    tation of irrigation systems for agriculture, have sped up the evolution of smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystems [5].\nReal-time irrigation scheduling is important in saving\
    \ water by applying the required\nquantity to satisfy plant needs. The irrigation\
    \ process needs a high level of ‘precision’\nto optimize the crop growth and water\
    \ input, while reducing adverse environmental\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12051012\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n2 of 24\nimpacts\
    \ [6,7]. The water application in the precision irrigation process must be able\
    \ to\ncontrol the water applied per unit of time within a ﬁeld [6].\nNumerous\
    \ works have been performed by various research groups in the smart\nirrigation\
    \ domain, and many reviews works investigated the current trend in the area of\n\
    smart irrigation [5,6,8–14].\nTo improve water use efﬁciency, it is important\
    \ to monitor particular factors that\ninﬂuence crop growth and development [15–17].\
    \ Monitoring in the perspective of smart\nirrigation also entails real-time data\
    \ acquisition related to soil, plant, and weather parame-\nters. An effective\
    \ real-time irrigation scheduling event requires monitoring of the factors\nthat\
    \ affect plant growth and development and an optimum strategy for the delivery\
    \ of the\nrequired quantity of irrigation water.\nMonitoring the smart irrigation\
    \ process is based on three types, such as soil-based,\nweather-based, and plant-based\
    \ monitoring [11].\nSoil moisture monitoring includes measuring the soil water\
    \ availability which has\nbeen used widely for irrigation scheduling [18]. The\
    \ disadvantage of soil moisture-based\nirrigation scheduling is that plant water\
    \ uptake and stress do not only respond to the soil\nwater content but also to\
    \ atmospheric parameters, nutrient content, root zone salinity, and\npest and\
    \ disease infestation.\nWeather-based monitoring includes the real-time estimation\
    \ of reference evapotranspi-\nration (ETo) using the collected weather parameters\
    \ and, thus, the water lost by plants and\nsoil [6,10]. Several studies have reported\
    \ using weather parameters for irrigation schedul-\ning. Effective within-season\
    \ climate prediction could assist farmers in managing irrigation\nand minimizing\
    \ risk [19,20], but more studies using medium- or long-term meteorological\nforecasts\
    \ are needed to improve the irrigation precision [21].\nMonitoring plant–water\
    \ indices, such as the correlation between crop water stress and\nsoil water deﬁcit\
    \ provides an optimum estimation of irrigation scheduling. The sensitivity\nof\
    \ the measurement for determining plant–water deﬁcit conditions at a particular\
    \ crop\nstage highly inﬂuences the efﬁcacy of plant-based irrigation scheduling\
    \ [9]. The primary\ndrawback in the application of plant-based sensors for commercial\
    \ irrigation scheduling\nis that they do not provide a direct measurement of the\
    \ amount of irrigation water to be\napplied to crops [22].\nA smart design of\
    \ monitoring tools including accurate integration of soil, weather,\nand plant\
    \ sensors is, however, important for a successful operation of an adaptive decision\n\
    support system (DSS) [6,11,23]. Solar fertigation uses sustainably powered energy\
    \ by\nphotovoltaic panels to manage smart irrigation and to assist farmers in\
    \ decision-making\nprocesses with IoT technology. A novel irrigation control strategy\
    \ using a hybrid predictive\nmodel based on weather and crop data, and real-time\
    \ sensors were described.\nFurthermore, the experimental setup reported and analyzed\
    \ three years of ETo data\ncollected from seven different Mediterranean climates\
    \ using the real-time solar fertiga-\ntion system, and the real-time API weather.\
    \ Therefore, the data were analyzed by using\ntemperature-based and radiation-based\
    \ models which were further compared to the Food\nand Agriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) of the United Nation’s recognized Penman–Monteith\n(P–M) model for their\
    \ statistical attributes.\n2. The Proposed System: Smart Irrigation System\nSolar\
    \ fertigation depends on low-cost WSN, almost autonomous from the energy point\n\
    of view, monitors and transmits locally or towards the on-cloud software platform.\
    \ The\nprototype detected soil and environmental parameters for checking crop\
    \ growth directly in\nthe ﬁeld and for sustaining farmers in the decision-making\
    \ phases connected to the growth\nprocesses of the cultivated crops [24].\nAn\
    \ information system for irrigation facilities management could be more efﬁcient\
    \ if it\nincludes a WSN that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs).\
    \ The study\nused a wireless sensor network application for irrigation facilities\
    \ management based on\nradio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) and quick response\
    \ (QR) codes.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n3 of 24\nThe studied system is an automatic\
    \ fertigation system that elaborates crop water\nneeds and collects historic and\
    \ real-time data. It achieves effective utilization of water\nand fertilizers\
    \ with the help of an automatic fert-irrigation system for crops by taking into\n\
    consideration the plant and soil needs.\nIt is designed and developed with the\
    \ ability of intelligent decision making in terms of\ncrop watering based on ETc\
    \ considering features such as crop type, growth stage, weather\ndata and conditions,\
    \ humidity, temperature, and soil and plant sensors.\nThe proposed fertigation\
    \ system consists of physical modules electrically powered\nby a photovoltaic\
    \ power supply and a cloud computing infrastructure for managing the\nphysical\
    \ modules in an automated way. In fact, despite the informatics infrastructure,\
    \ it is\npossible to control and activate the fertigation phases according to\
    \ the crop type and their\ngrowth phase, create a history of operations, and share\
    \ data by using a tracking system on\nenvironmental conditions (Figure 1).\n \n\

    \ modiﬁcations could be performed according\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n5 of 24\n\
    to the particular needs of the crop and the farmer. The agronomic database contains\
    \ precise\nvalues related to fertigation needs for each crop type according to\
    \ the seasonal period\nand growth phase; based on the agronomic database and WSN\
    \ data related to soil and\nenvironment, the control unit deﬁnes the type and\

    \ each crop.\n2.4. Real-Time Monitoring and Suggestions\nSoil and plant sensors\
    \ were used by DSS. Soil moisture, humidity, pH, and soil\nelectrical conductivity\
    \ (EC) were used for real-time monitoring of irrigation and fertigation.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the leaf wetness sensor monitored real-time plant moisture levels in\nleaves\
    \ and supported irrigation and water systems. Dendrometer sensors were used for\n\
    monitoring changes in plant water content (only for fruits).\nReal-time monitoring\
    \ data were used for irrigation and nutrient suggestions and\ncorrection strategies.\n\
    2.4.1. Irrigation Scheduling\nCrop Evapotranspiration (ETc)\nETc is the evapotranspiration\
    \ from disease-free, well-developed crops, cultivated in\nopen ﬁelds, in optimum\
    \ soil water conditions, and receiving complete production under\nthe provided\
    \ environmental conditions.\nETc is estimated, using the crop coefﬁcient approach,\
    \ by multiplying the ETo by a crop\ncoefﬁcient (Kc) [26] which follows as:\nETc\
    \ = Kc × ETo\n(1)\nwhere ETc represents crop evapotranspiration (mm d−1), Kc represents\
    \ crop coefﬁcient,\nand ETo represents reference crop evapotranspiration (mm d−1).\n\
    ETo is the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface, not short of water\
    \ and\nis one of the major factors for determining optimum irrigation water management.\
    \ Soil\nsensors measured the ETo based on soil properties (i.e., soil permittivity,\
    \ electrical resistance,\nand soil water potential, among others). The collected\
    \ ETo values were used for irrigation\nscheduling at the ﬁelds.\nMost of the effects\
    \ of weather parameters are integrated into the ETo equation. Conse-\nquently,\
    \ as ETo is an index of climatic demand, Kc differs predominately with the particular\n\
    crop features and only to a limited extent with climate. This transfers the standard\
    \ Kc\nvalues between the ﬁeld and the climate. This has been a major reason for\
    \ the wide accep-\ntance and beneﬁcial aspects of the crop coefﬁcient approach\
    \ and the Kc factors analyzed in\nprevious literature [26]. Kc data of the most\
    \ important crops at different developmental\nstages were collected in a database\
    \ according to the FAO manual–56 methods (Section 3.5).\nAt the present time,\
    \ the irrigation strategy of the system is based on Hargreaves–\nSamani (H–S)\
    \ (Section 3.3); however, the Penman–Monteith (P–M) formula could also be\nuploaded.\
    \ Furthermore, an experimental set-up of seven ET crop models is reported in\n\
    Section 3 and were used for the implementation of the ET equation in the DSS.\n\
    The P–M model is recognized as the standard method for ETo assessment which\n\
    provides the best performance in Mediterranean environments [26–28]. However,\
    \ the\nneed for collecting a relatively large number of parameters (e.g., relative\
    \ humidity of the\nair, solar radiation, or wind speed) in different climates,\
    \ which are generally difﬁcult to\nestimate with good accuracy, restricts the\
    \ extensive utilization of this model [28]. Therefore,\nalternative methodologies\
    \ requiring lower cost observations have been developed, such as\nHargreaves–Samani\
    \ (H–S), Blaney–Criddle (B–C), Thornthwaite, Priestley–Taylor, Makkink,\nand Turc,\
    \ among others [29]. The use of simpler models for ETo estimation with a lower\n\
    level of parameters could affect accurate irrigation water management, obtaining\
    \ irrigation\nschedules of low quality with a bad impact on water savings and\
    \ crop yield.\nThe H–S model uses daily maximum and minimum air temperature data\
    \ as the\nonly input. This empirical model is one of the most commonly used in\
    \ various studies.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n6 of 24\nIt is recommended by Allen\
    \ et al. [26] as the best estimation model. As an empirical\nmethod, H–S involves\
    \ empirical coefﬁcients. While H–S could be tested with some standard\nvalues\
    \ of these coefﬁcients, several studies [26] recommended testing H–S at locations\n\
    with comparable weather. ETo values using the H–S depend on the local temperature\n\
    (Figure 2). Maximum, minimum, and mean temperature and UV-radiation parameters\
    \ are\nrequired. UV-radiation can be estimated for a particular day and location;\
    \ however, only\nmaximum, minimum, and mean temperature are the parameters that\
    \ require observation.\nThe H–S method is generally preferred to other more complicated\
    \ methods since it provides\nreasonably adequate performance and requires only\
    \ maximum, minimum, and mean\ntemperatures [30].\nWeather parameter data, such\
    \ as temperature and humidity (DHT22, by Aosong\nElectronics), UV-radiation (SQ-100\
    \ solar radiation sensor, by Apogee Instruments), wind\nspeed, and rainfall were\
    \ recorded by sensors mounted on the system.\nRainfall (Effective Rainfall)\n\
    The rainfall patterns in the local climate signiﬁcantly affect crop growth and\
    \ produc-\ntion. The rainwater that is disposed of in the shape of deep percolation\
    \ or run-off stores in\nsome other resources of the nature and could be utilized\
    \ in any other usage or part of it is\nabsorbed by the soil which remains stored\
    \ for a longer time and in a fresh form. The plant’s\nroot zone can easily utilize\
    \ and uptake the water for its growth, nourishment, and further\ndevelopment.\
    \ Part of the water content that is utilized by the crops and soil is effective\n\
    rainfall, which is different in every region of the world depending on its climate,\
    \ rainfall\nyearly durations, soil structure and texture, root depth, and variety\
    \ of planting factors [31].\nThe proposed system was based on an empirical method\
    \ that estimates the amount of\nthe effective rainfall consumed by evapotranspiration,\
    \ with reference to the utilized rainfall\n(RU), meaning the water content between\
    \ the wilting point and the ﬁeld capacity, limited\nto the layer of soil occupied\
    \ by the roots [32]. The empirical expression is presented as:\nEffective rainfall\
    \ = fc (1.253 × p0.824 − 2.935) × 10 [0.001 ET]\n(2)\nwhere fc is the correction\
    \ factor which depends on the usable water stored in the root-zone;\np is the\
    \ total monthly precipitation (mm); and ET is the total monthly evapotranspira-\n\
    tion (mm).\nLuo et al. [31] reported that estimation and utilization of effective\
    \ rainfall with DSS\ncould be a signiﬁcant method to design irrigation saving\
    \ strategies. Examples of this are\nvalidated in Texas, USA [33], Jimma–Ethiopia\
    \ [34] and Wuhan, China [31].\nDuring the rainfall occurrence, for example for\
    \ two days, the soil water potential\ndata of the system (soil sensors) recorded\
    \ similar moisture values continuously for four\ndays (depending on climate).\
    \ After this, regular irrigation water was provided as per\nregular schedules.\n\
    Crop Factors\nThe collection of crop factors leads to the development of a crop\
    \ database for the\nsuccessful running and efﬁcient management of irrigation.\
    \ The database illustrates the\ncrop factors, including crop growing stages, stage\
    \ lengths (days), depletion factor (p), crop\ncoefﬁcient (kc), yield factor (ky),\
    \ and root depth Zr (Figure 2).\nThe aforementioned crop data for each crop type\
    \ was installed into the system. To\ndetermine the amount of water applied by\
    \ the irrigators into the ﬁeld, during an irrigation\nevent, automatic calibration\
    \ of the particular growth stage and stage length of the crop\nwere compared with\
    \ the available humidity at the ﬁeld.\nFrequent readings were taken by the system\
    \ during these irrigation phases (soil\nsensors). The system continued the irrigation\
    \ until the exact values for the p-factor, kc, and\nky were reached. When the\
    \ irrigator completed irrigating the ﬁeld, the average depth of\nirrigation water\
    \ passing through the valves and the respective discharge were read for the\n\
    measurement of the ﬁeld being irrigated. The rate of water discharge and the depth\
    \ of\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n7 of 24\nwater applied depends on the particular\
    \ values of the p-factor, kc, and ky, as they differ in\nevery crop type.\nZr\
    \ of crops depends on the available soil moisture considering compaction levels\
    \ of\nthe particular soil. Determining the average Zr of each type of crop [26],\
    \ the soil moisture\nsensors were installed at a particular soil depth and distance\
    \ in the ﬁelds. The ﬁeld was\nirrigated by a couple of irrigators placed at a\
    \ particular distance from each other. The soil\nmoisture sensors, after reaching\
    \ the moisture at a particular soil and root depth, sent the\ninformation to stop\
    \ the irrigation promptly.\nFor irrigation scheduling, the effective Zr of the\
    \ available crop was considered, irre-\nspective of growth stages. Most of the\
    \ plant’s roots were located in the upper portion of\nthe root zone; therefore,\
    \ irrigation scheduling was managed to a shallower depth than the\ncrop’s full\
    \ root depth. Soil moisture content was estimated two times; one on a daily basis\n\
    and one before each irrigation application during the ﬁeld experiments. Using\
    \ the soil\nmoisture data acquired by the system (soil sensors), the depletion\
    \ factor (p) of available\nsoil water in the provided crop zr was estimated by\
    \ the equation [35]:\np-factor = 1001n∑1nFCi − θiFCi − WP\n(3)\nwhere n is the\
    \ number of layers of the rooting depth (zr), FCi is the soil moisture at ﬁeld\n\
    capacity, θi is the soil moisture in the ith layer, and WP is the soil moisture\
    \ at permanent\nwilting point.\nThe system can implement the database with data\
    \ collected through the installation of\nplant-based sensors that replace table\
    \ data with real time data.\nAlthough less precise, the use of a database allows\
    \ users to easily manage all the\nparameters which were considered useful for\
    \ optimum irrigation management.\nSoil Water Availability\nSoil water availability\
    \ is the capacity of soil to collect water available to crops. After\nirrigation,\
    \ the soil drains until the ﬁeld capacity. Field capacity is the amount of water\
    \ that\nsoil should preserve at a particular volume. In the absence of a water\
    \ supply, the water\nlevel in the root zone decreases after uptake by the crop.\
    \ As water uptake continues, the\navailable water is tightly held by the soil\
    \ particles, and makes it harder for the plant to\nextract it. Ultimately, a point\
    \ is reached where the plant can no longer extract the available\nmoisture. This\
    \ makes the water uptake zero and leads to the wilting point. Wilting point is\n\
    the water content at which plants start to permanently wilt and is a factor function\
    \ of the\nsoil texture. The total amount of water that can be stored in the root\
    \ zone is a function of\nthe type of soil texture [26].\nAs the water content\
    \ more higher than ﬁeld capacity cannot be held and as the water\ncontent lower\
    \ than wilting point cannot be extracted by plants, the total available water\n\
    (TAW) in the root zone is the difference between water content at ﬁeld capacity\
    \ and wilting\npoint [26] such as:\nTAW = (θFC − θWC) × Zr\n(4)\nwhere TAW represents\
    \ total available water in the root zone (mm), θFC represents water\ncontent at\
    \ ﬁeld capacity (m3 m−3), θWP represents water content at wilting point (m3 m−3),\n\
    and Zr represents root depth (m).\nThough water is available until the wilting\
    \ point, crop water extraction is minimized\nwell before the wilting point. In\
    \ the wet soil, the soil quickly supplies enough water to meet\nthe crop demands.\
    \ However, upon the reduction in the soil water content, water becomes\ntightly\
    \ bound to the soil matrix and is more difﬁcult to utilize. When the soil water\
    \ content\nreduces below a particular threshold, soil water can no longer be transported\
    \ to the roots\nto complete the transpiration demand, ultimately, the crop starts\
    \ to stress. The fraction of\nTAW that a crop can utilize without experiencing\
    \ stress is called readily available water\n(RAW) [26] such as:\nRAW = p × TAW\n\
    (5)\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n8 of 24\nwhere RAW is the readily available water\
    \ in the root zone (mm); and p is the average\nfraction of TAW (0–1).\nAccording\
    \ to soil type, cultivated crop, and root depth the RAW and TAW data were\ncalculated\
    \ and uploaded to the irrigation system.\n2.4.2. Nutrients\nNutrient management\
    \ was supported by the proposed system and easily used for\nfertigation, through\
    \ which crop nutrient requirements were met accurately. Due to the\nmethod the\
    \ water is applied by the system, surface applications of nutrients are sometimes\n\
    ineffective, so the system automatically mixed liquid nutrients with the irrigation\
    \ water.\nThe system allowed the delivery of nutrients and water (fertigation)\
    \ to plants in\naccurate quantities and at the appropriate time for a particular\
    \ stage of plant growth.\nThe major factor in the fertigation process was the\
    \ time, and the key in the application\nwas striking the correct balance for optimal\
    \ plant life with optimal use of water. The\nsystem also performed the fertigation\
    \ application in which the fertigation was based on the\nrelevant amounts of water\
    \ and nutrients that must be given periodically, with no feedback.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ the second type was based on a combination of fertigation application and\n\
    feedback of the necessary data to determine the amount of fertigation needed [36,37].\n\
    The database reports the accurate amount of the nutrient demands related to the\n\
    crop growth stage in a form that becomes available in synchrony with crop demands\
    \ for\nmaximum utilization of nutrients; however, modiﬁcations could be performed\
    \ according\nto the particular needs of the crop and the farmer.\nThe control\
    \ unit compares received information with those stored in the database; thus\n\
    deﬁning the type and concentrations of the fertilizers and regulating the timing\
    \ of the irriga-\ntion. These operations are obtained properly by driving the\
    \ different hydraulic/mechanical\nsections for adjusting fertilizer quantities\
    \ to be introduced into the aqueous solution in\nthe bin. Furthermore, the control\
    \ unit drives the electric pump and solenoid valves, for\ncorrectly distributing\
    \ the fertilizing solution into the different areas of the land; in fact,\nthe\
    \ system is designed in a modular way according to the extension of the land to\
    \ cul-\ntivate. The deﬁnition of agronomic mathematical models is fundamental\
    \ for processing\ndata collected by the WSN and comparing them with those reported\
    \ in the database to\ncreate a dynamic system for optimal fertigation control.\
    \ The agronomic database contains\nprecise values related to fertigation needs\
    \ for each crop type according to the seasonal\nperiod and growth phase; based\
    \ on the agronomic database and WSN data related to soil\nand environment, the\
    \ control unit deﬁnes the type and optimal quantities of fertilizer, the\ntiming\
    \ and the fertigation methods for each crop kind, with the purpose to optimize\
    \ water\nuse and improve the quality and quantity of cultivated products.\nCrop\
    \ Database\nA database for nutrients and irrigation management of nine crops was\

    \ Soil Moisture and Plant Water Content Monitoring\nSoil sensors are speciﬁc devices\
    \ that convert a physical parameter into soft data. The\nsoil sensors are used\
    \ to collect and communicate the parameters, such as soil moisture,\nhumidity,\
    \ and temperature (Figure 2). For estimating the particular water level, sensors\n\
    were connected to the main irrigation canals, while for estimating the water ﬂow,\
    \ they were\nconnected to a water pump. Sensors were further connected to the\
    \ database which was\nperiodically sending the data. The connected database was\
    \ monitoring the irrigation water\nlevels, analyzed the data stored, and compared\
    \ it with the threshold values. The threshold\nvalues of soil moisture were uploaded\
    \ into the database to maintain the irrigation on a daily\nbasis. Using threshold\
    \ values, the system started or stopped the irrigation based on the\nmoisture\
    \ content of the soil. In this way, soil sensors controlled the ﬂow rate of water\
    \ from\nthe tank to the irrigation ﬁeld and optimized the use of water. Soil sensors\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsupported water management decisions, used for continuously monitoring\
    \ water levels\nin the tank and moisture in the soil and provided an accurate\
    \ amount of water required\nfor crop plants. The sensors checked the temperature\
    \ and humidity of soil to retain the\nnutrient composition of the soil managed\
    \ for the growth of crops.\nSoil sensors efﬁciently schedule the irrigation events\
    \ by either decreasing or increasing\nthe intensity/frequency of water, preserving\
    \ the important soil nutrients, and on the other\nside, providing a thirst factor\
    \ to plants at their particular stage of growth. Soil sensors\nempower the farmers\
    \ to manage the water levels without any requirement for a physical\npresence\
    \ in the ﬁeld. They correctly measure the accurate level of soil moisture and\
    \ aid in\nscheduling the irrigation supply and distribution in an efﬁcient method.\
    \ They signiﬁcantly\nhelp in fertigation and irrigation management by analyzing\
    \ the soil parameters affecting\ncrop growth and production (Figure 2).\nThe types\
    \ of sensors used in the smart irrigation system are real-time fertigation moni-\n\
    toring sensors for environmental and soil parameters. The sensor nodes are isomorphic\n\
    and non-rechargeable with the initial energy being the same as E0.\nMQTT is an\
    \ extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for\nconstrained\
    \ devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. All content\n\
    is delivered to the user interface using an MQTT protocol and ActiveMQ message\
    \ broker\ndeployed on AWS as software as a service [25].\nFor real-time fertigation\
    \ monitoring, several sensors, such as DHT22, SHT11, SEN0193,\nand SEN0193 acquired\
    \ environmental and soil parameters during the study period [24].\nPlant sensors\
    \ such as leaf wetness and dendrometer sensor data could be uploaded. Fur-\nthermore,\
    \ data recorded onsite included the irrigation water pH and EC for water quality\n\
    information. The samples were checked for a pH of less than 2. The irrigation\
    \ water was\nthen checked for microbial activities and undesirable physicochemical\
    \ reactions before\nfurther analysis.\nThe leaf wetness sensor, such as the radio\
    \ frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) sensor [44],\nmonitored real-time plant moisture\
    \ levels in leaves and supported irrigation and water\nsystems. The dendrometer\
    \ sensors, such as ZN12-O-WP [45] (only for fruits), were used\nAgronomy 2022,\
    \ 12, 1012\n10 of 24\nfor detailed crop information. ZN12 measures microvariations\

    from the ﬁeld, the platform manages, processes, analyzes, and ﬁnally, displays\
    \ the data in\na simple and user-friendly way. The display factors include ﬁelds,\
    \ crops, environmental\nconditions, irrigation hours, soil humidity, fertilizer\

    \ Models\nThe study consists of different regions in which the range of ﬁelds\
    \ were estimated\nfrom 10 to 12 hectares. The ﬁeld sensors collected soil and\
    \ weather data after every\n30 min, such as temperature (◦C), relative humidity\
    \ (%), solar radiation (MJ m−2), air\nspeed (km h−1), rainfall (mm), and soil\

    where the WSN network could be developed in all parts of the ﬁeld. Moreover, real-\n\
    time API weather data was also connected to the DSS for data collection using\
    \ the web-\nbased resources which are considered as API data. The experimental\

    the Mediterranean region of Italy. Daily meteorological data from seven weather\

    \ The four weather\nstations of Molise region were W1–Campobasso, W2–Ferrazzano,\

    \ W1–Montemesola, W2–\nCastellaneta, and W3–Marina di Ginosa (Table 2). The region\
    \ is known for its Mediterranean-\ntype climate with short and mild winters, and\
    \ hot, long, and dry summers [53].\nThe data were collected on a daily basis while\
    \ a precise quality control check for\nthe ETo variables was performed. This guarantees\
    \ the data homogeneity and addresses\nany error.\n3.2. Data Collection\nData from\
    \ seven weather stations in different Mediterranean zones of Italy were\ncollected\
    \ from solar fertigation systems (soil sensors) and API (MeteoInMolise–http://\n\
    www.meteoinmolise.com/ (5 January 2022)). The collected crop data includes crop\
    \ water\nrequirement, fertilizer requirement, stages of development, stage length\
    \ (in days), depletion\ncoefﬁcient (p), root depth (Zr), crop coefﬁcient (kc),\
    \ and yield response factor (ky). The\ncollected meteorological data includes\
    \ minimum, maximum, and average temperatures;\nminimum, maximum, and average humidity;\
    \ UV-radiation; minimum, maximum, and\naverage atmospheric pressure; actual airspeed;\
    \ and rainfall. The data was then managed\nby a web-based desktop platform for\
    \ further processes.\nThe mean correlation of monthly temperatures and rainfall\
    \ at seven weather stations\nfor the study period was recorded. Minimum and maximum\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nwere recorded on a monthly basis for each weather\
    \ station. A box plot correlation of\nenvironmental parameters, such as minimum\
    \ and maximum temperature, minimum and\nmaximum relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and daily wind speed for three years of data\nwere tested in the study (Appendix\
    \ A, Tables A1 and A2; Figures A1 and A2).\nMean collected parameters, such as\
    \ maximum, minimum, and average temperature,\nrelative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ airspeed, and rainfall for the study period (1 January\n2019–31 December 2021)\
    \ were acquired. In addition, temperature and rainfall trends were\nrecorded as\
    \ linear. However, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R statistical attributes were tested for\n\
    the following temperature-, radiation-, and combination-based models.\n3.3. Temperature-Based\
    \ Models\n3.3.1. Hargreaves–Samani (H–S) Model\nThe lack of available agrometeorological\
    \ data (such as solar radiation, air humidity,\nand wind speed) in all climatic\
    \ regions limits the use of the standard FAO P–M model [26].\nTherefore, Allen\
    \ et al. [26] proposed the application of the H–S model in particular regions\n\
    where only the data related to air temperature is available. The Hargreaves–Samani\
    \ (H–S)\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n13 of 24\nmodel [47] is an empirical approach\
    \ that needs theoretical parameters for ETo estimation.\nThe model is expressed\
    \ as follows:\nETo = 0.023 (0.408) (Tmean + 17.8) (Tmax − Tmin)0.5 × Ra\n(6)\n\
    where ETo represents reference evapotranspiration (mm d−1); Ra represents extraterrestrial\n\
    radiation (MJ m−2 d−1); Tmean represents average monthly/annual temperature; and\
    \ Tmax\nand Tmin are daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (◦C), respectively.\n\
    3.3.2. Blaney–Criddle (B–C) Model\nThe Blaney–Criddle (B–C) model [54] is recommended\
    \ for the daily estimation of ETo\n(mm d−1). The equation is expressed as follows:\n\
    ETo = p (0.46Tmean + 8.13)\n(7)\nwhere ETo represents daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (mm d−1) and Tmean represents\ndaily mean temperature (◦C). In our study, Tmean\
    \ is measured based on daily Tmax and Tmin\n(such as Tmean = (Tmax + Tmin)/2).\
    \ The coefﬁcient p is considered as the daily percent of\nannual daytime hours\
    \ for each day of the year, which may be estimated using the latitude\nand the\
    \ Julian day analysis [26].\n3.3.3. Thornthwaite Model\nThornthwaite [49] proposed\
    \ an empirical model to estimate ETo by comparing the\ncorrelation between temperature,\
    \ precipitation, and changing rate of water in diverse\nregions. This required\
    \ only readily available input data for estimating ETo. This is based\nonly on\
    \ daily averaged temperatures and latitude, the latter variable used to calculate\
    \ the\nmaximum amount of sunshine duration [55]. The equation is expressed as\
    \ follows:\nETo = 16Nm [(10Tm)a1]\n(8)\nwhere Tm represents mean air temperature\
    \ (◦C), Nm represents the number of days in a\nmonth, and al represents the average\
    \ number of daylight hours per day for each month.\n3.4. Radiation-Based Models\n\
    3.4.1. Priestley–Taylor Model\nThe Priestley–Taylor [50] model is tested in a\
    \ diverse range of regions for ETo estima-\ntion. The model was initially developed\
    \ for saturated environments and open water bodies\nwith low wind effects. The\
    \ wind factor multiplied by vapor pressure deﬁcit was further\nsimpliﬁed and joined\
    \ with land cover and site condition data. ETo estimation using this\nmodel has\
    \ provided some good results, depending on the region. The Priestley–Taylor\n\
    method requires only temperature and radiation data and is considered as precise\
    \ among\nthe simpliﬁed methods with reduced parameters [56]. The method includes\
    \ a correction\nfactor known as the advection coefﬁcient with the value of 1.26\
    \ [50] and ranging between\n1.08 and 1.34 for agricultural ﬁelds [56]. The model\
    \ is expressed as follows:\nETo = 1.26\n∆\n∆ + γ(Rn − G) 1\nλ\n(9)\nwhere Rn represents\
    \ net radiation of the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1); ∆ represents the\nslope vapor\
    \ curve (kPa ◦C−1); λ represents the latent heat of vapor (MJ kg−1); G represents\n\
    the soil heat ﬂux density (MJ m−2 day−1); and γ represents the psychrometric constant\n\
    (kPa ◦C−1).\n3.4.2. Makkink Model\nThe Makkink [51] model is also considered a\
    \ reliable and easy method for the esti-\nmation of ETo. Solar radiation is the\
    \ only required parameter as input data for estimating\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n\
    14 of 24\nETo, which in most areas of the world is easily acquired. The equation\
    \ is expressed as\nfollows [51]:\nETo = 0.61 ×\n∆\n(∆ + γ) × Rs − 0.12\n(10)\n\
    where Rs represents solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1); γ represents the psychrometric\
    \ con-\nstant (kPa ◦C−1); and ∆ represents the slope vapor curve (kPa ◦C−1).\n\
    3.4.3. Turc Model\nThe Turc [52] model provides good data in a diverse set of\
    \ environmental conditions.\nIt is considered one of the simplest and accurate\
    \ empirical equations used to estimate ETo\nunder humid conditions. The Turc model\
    \ requires minimum weather parameters such as\nmean daily values of temperature\
    \ and solar radiation (Rs) [57]. The equation is expressed\nas follows:\nETo =\n\
    Tmean\nTmean + 15(Rs × 23.8846 + 50)\n(11)\nwhere Tmean represents daily mean\
    \ temperature (◦C); and Rs represents solar radiation\n(MJ m−2 day−1).\n3.5. Combination-Based\
    \ Model\nStandard FAO Penman–Monteith (P–M) Model\nETo is described as the simultaneous\
    \ loss of water from vegetation and soil surfaces.\nThe quantity of ETo depends\
    \ on the presence of water at the surface, the quantity of\navailable energy (to\
    \ convert the phase of water: latent heat of evaporation, LE), the ability\nof\
    \ an environment to accommodate water vapor (vapor pressure deﬁcit, VPD), and\
    \ the\nprocedure for water transport from the soil surface to the atmosphere (turbulent\
    \ transport).\nNet radiation (Rn) is the primary source of energy, and wind-generated\
    \ turbulence is\nconsidered the transport process.\nETo is considered as a hypothetical\
    \ reference crop with particular characteristics,\nsuch as a well-watered, 0.12\
    \ m grass with an albedo of 0.23, and an aerodynamic surface\nresistance of 70\
    \ s m−1. The equation is expressed as follows:\nETo =\n0.408∆ (Rn − G) + γ\n900\n\
    T+273U2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 U2)\n(12)\nwhere ∆ is the slope of saturation\
    \ vapor pressure at temperature curve (kPa K−1); Rn is net\nradiation at the crop\
    \ surface (MJ m−2 day−1); G is soil heat ﬂux density (MJ m−2 day−1);\nγ is the\
    \ psychrometric constant (kPa K−1); U2 is the wind speed at 2 m above surface\n\
    height (m s−1); es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa); ea is the actual vapor\
    \ pressure\n(kPa); (es − ea) is the saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit (kPa); and\
    \ T is the mean daily air\ntemperature at 2 m height (◦C).\n3.6. Data Analysis\n\
    Data analyses were performed to validate the precision of the proposed system\
    \ and\nAPI results. The statistical parameters such as mean absolute error (MAE),\
    \ mean square\nerror (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Pearson correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient (R) for\neach empirical model were studied to evaluate their effectiveness\
    \ [58]. The MAE estimates\nthe average magnitude of errors without considering\
    \ their sign and test samples of absolute\ndifferences between the observed (system)\
    \ and the estimated (API) data (Equation (12)).\nMSE is an average of squared\
    \ differences between the observed (system) and the estimated\n(API) data or is\
    \ the variance of an error (Equation (13)). RMSE is the square root of MSE or\
    \ is\nthe standard deviation of an error (Equation (14)). R shows the correlation\
    \ with a direct and\ninverse relationship between the observed (system) and the\
    \ estimated (API) data (Equation\n(15)). Statistical correlation of temperature-based\
    \ models (H–S, B–C and Thornthwaite),\nand radiation-based models (Priestley–Taylor,\
    \ Makkink and Turc) were compared with\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n15 of 24\nthe\
    \ standard FAO P–M model [26] to understand the accuracy and acceptable efﬁciency\
    \ of\neach model [59]. The statistical parameters evaluated are as follows:\n\
    Mean absolute error (MAE) = ∑n\ni=1|xi − yi|\nn\n(13)\nMean square error (MSE)\
    \ = 1\nn ∑\nn\ni=1(yi − ˆyi)2\n(14)\nRoot mean square error (RMSE) =\np\n∑n\n\
    i=1(xi − yi)2\nn\n(15)\nPearson correlation coefﬁcient (P) =\n∑n\ni=1(xi − x)(yi\
    \ − y)\np\n∑n\ni=1(xi − x)2(yi − y)2\n(16)\nwhere xi is the forecasted data of\
    \ temperature, yi is an observed (system) data of tempera-\nture, ˆyi is the forecasted\
    \ data, i is the forecasted parameter sequence number (such as 1, 2, 3,\n4, and\
    \ so on), x is mean forecasted data of parameter sequence number, y is mean observed\n\
    (system) data of parameter sequence number, and n is the number of the forecasted\
    \ data.\n4. Results\nResults were collected from meteorological data which include\
    \ minimum, maximum,\nand average temperatures; minimum, maximum and average humidity;\
    \ UV-radiation;\nminimum, maximum, and average atmospheric pressure; actual air\
    \ speed; and rainfall\nduring the study period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December\
    \ 2021. Environmental pa-\nrameters, such as temperature, RH, and wind speed range\
    \ from Tmin = 0.21–18.86 ◦C,\nTmax = 4.07–30.6 ◦C, RH = 54.6 –76.7%, and wind\
    \ speed = 0.75–11.8 km h−1 in Molise\n(Appendix A, Table A1); while 3.09–22.1\
    \ ◦C, Tmax = 10.1–34.5 ◦C, RH = 58.7–80.2%, and\nwind speed = 6.16–16.90 km h−1\
    \ in Apulia regions, respectively (Appendix A, Table A2).\nThe mean ETo data were\
    \ analyzed by six different (three temperature- and three\nradiation-based) methods\
    \ and compared with the standard combination-based FAO P–M\nmethod. Results showed\
    \ that maximum values of solar fertigation ETo were recorded in\nthe summer months\
    \ followed by spring and winter. Meanwhile, total ETo for the solar\nfertigation\
    \ system, H–S, and P–M was revealed as 3032.8, 3049.9, and 2967.3 mm in Molise,\n\
    respectively; while 5362.8, 5384.3, and 5422.2 mm in Apulia, respectively, from\
    \ 1 January\n2019 to 31 December 2021.\nThe estimated monthly and total ETo for\
    \ solar fertigation system, temperature- and\nradiation-based models were collected.\
    \ A signiﬁcant correlation for the data between the\nsystem and the standard FAO\
    \ model was revealed upon their comparison. The combination-\nbased standard FAO\
    \ P–M revealed a close trend to the solar fertigation system with no\nunderestimation.\
    \ The H–S for total ETo shows a highly signiﬁcant correlation with the\nstandard\
    \ FAO P–M. While, B–C and Thornthwaite models overestimated the considerable\n\
    value. Similarly, the monthly and annual estimation of ETo in radiation-based\
    \ (Priestley–\nTaylor, Makkink and Turc) models were acquired. Their correlation\

    \ Tables 3 and 4 revealed that among the tempera-\nture models, H–S provided signiﬁcant\
    \ results when compared to the standard FAO P–M by\nrecording the closest values\
    \ of MAE (0.55), MSE (0.62), RMSE (0.97), and R (0.87) for Molise,\nand MAE (0.64),\
    \ MSE (0.68), RMSE (0.97), and R (0.86), respectively, for Apulia, while the\n\
    furthest values of MAE (0.95), MSE (1.36), RMSE (1.74), and R (1.65) for Molise,\
    \ and MAE\n(0.99), MSE (1.36), RMSE (1.89), and R (1.81) for Apulia were recorded\
    \ by Makkink. Fur-\nthermore, the recorded data majorly showed underestimation\
    \ in B–C and overestimation\nin radiation models with respect to the standard\
    \ FAO P–M.\nFurther ﬁndings show that the solar fertigation system recorded a\
    \ near tendency with\nthe standard combination FAO P–M for MAE, MSE, RMSE, and\
    \ R as 0.52, 0.63, 0.93, and\n0.84, respectively, for Molise, and 0.63, 0.72,\
    \ 0.92, and 0.84, respectively, for Apulia region.\nSimilarly, in temperature\
    \ models, Thornthwaite produced the highest values for MAE, MSE,\nRMSE, and R\
    \ as 0.86, 0.99, 1.37, and 1.28 in Apulia, respectively, and the solar fertigation\n\
    system as the lowest values of MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R as 0.52, 0.63, 0.93, and\
    \ 0.84 in\nMolise region, respectively. Among radiation models, the highest values\
    \ of MAE, MSE,\nRMSE, and R were recorded by Makkink as 0.95, 1.36, 1.74, and\
    \ 1.65 in Molise and 0.99,\n1.36, 1.89, and 1.81 in the Apulia region, respectively.\
    \ An almost similar trend was revealed\nbetween nearby weather stations of the\
    \ Molise region (W2–Ferrazzano; W3–Oratino; and\nW4–Ripalimosani). On the contrary,\
    \ MAE correlation of radiation (Makkink, Priestley–\nTaylor and Turc) models with\
    \ high overestimation to the standard P–M model resulted;\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\
    \ 1012\n18 of 24\nhowever, solar fertigation system and temperature (H–S and B–C)\
    \ models revealed a\nslighter underestimation in the studied Mediterranean climate.\
    \ The MSE correlation was\nperformed which showed a slightly higher trend, while\
    \ the highest correlation by RMSE\nresulted in radiation models. This showed that\
    \ radiation models, particularly Makkink,\nhave less accuracy as compared to temperature\
    \ models.\nIn temperature models, the statistical analysis showed that the second\
    \ best ETo model\nis B–C with slightly accurate values in comparison to the standard\
    \ FAO model. The values\nof MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R revealed as 0.67, 0.84, 1.14,\
    \ and 0.97 in Molise, and 0.70, 0.95,\n1.28, and 0.95 in Apulia, respectively.\
    \ In radiation models, statistical analysis showed that\nMakkink revealed maximum\
    \ values of MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R as 0.95, 1.36, 1.74, and\n1.65 in Molise, and\
    \ 0.99, 1.36, 1.89, and 1.81 in Apulia, respectively. Models overestimated\nthe\
    \ daily ETo mean (3.63 mm day−1) of the standard FAO model while the solar fertigation\n\
    system and H–S slightly underestimated the ETo during the study. RMSE showed a\
    \ slightly\nhigher trend with maximum values in Makkink and minimum in the solar\
    \ fertigation\nsystem. The R statistical attribute for the solar fertigation model\
    \ and H–S showed highly\ncorrelative values to the standard FAO P–M.\nThis study\
    \ validated that radiation models may provide a certain level of accuracy for\n\
    ETo estimation [62]. However, temperature models are recorded to be the best models\
    \ for\nETo estimation in the Mediterranean climate [59].\n5. Discussion\nThe aim\
    \ of the experimental setup was to evaluate the efﬁciency of the solar fertigation\n\
    system by comparing it with three temperature-, three radiation-, and a combination-based\n\
    P–M ETo model for its accuracy in a Mediterranean region subject to signiﬁcant\
    \ spatial het-\nerogeneity in climatic conditions. The analysis was carried out\
    \ using climate records for the\n3-year historical period (1 January 2019–31 December\
    \ 2021) for 7 stations located in 2 differ-\nent agro-climatic zones of Italy.\
    \ Additionally, the study considered temperature and rainfall\ntrends, box plot\
    \ correlation of environmental parameters (Appendix A, Figures A1 and A2),\nand\
    \ statistical attributes among the tested data. The accuracy of monthly mean ETo\
    \ esti-\nmates by all six methods was assessed using ETo estimates by the FAO-56\
    \ P–M equation as\na reference considering stations pooled under different agro-climatic\
    \ zones.\nResults indicated that the performance of the monthly percent correlation\
    \ during the\nvalidation phase between the solar fertigation system and H–S was\
    \ highly correlated with\nthe standard P–M method as reﬂected in near values of\
    \ R and high values of RMSE across\nall zones. Among all the methods evaluated,\
    \ the solar fertigation and H-S approach resulted\nin the best values of correlation\
    \ in both the regions in the study area. Moratiel et al. [29]\nstudied a similar\
    \ trend and showed the non-calibrated H–S model performance to be better\nslightly\
    \ relative to the P–M model. Further correlation comparative analysis showed that\n\
    radiation models were located furthest from the standard model with low precision.\
    \ On the\ncontrary, among the empirical models, H–S was located nearest to the\
    \ standard FAO model.\nThis may result in Makkink followed by Turc as the least\
    \ precise model and Hargreaves\nas the best model among the tested ones. A similar\
    \ trend is illustrated in several other\nstudies [59]. Thornthwaite and other\
    \ relevant empirical models are extensively utilized\nworldwide due to their simplicity\
    \ and reliability of least parameter requirements [55];\nhowever, Xiang et al.\
    \ [61] stated that Thornthwaite [49] underestimates the ETo data\nin humid environmental\
    \ conditions. Several studies have shown that the background\nand the concept\
    \ presented by Thornthwaite [49] do not ﬁt to evaluate the ETo [61]. The\nThornthwaite\
    \ method mostly underestimates ETo under arid conditions and overestimates\nin\
    \ the equatorial humid climate. Priestley–Taylor [50] provides more accurate results\n\
    among radiation methods than other equations under arid environmental conditions\
    \ [63].\nYoder et al. [64] state that it overestimates the ETo in the USA. Cristea\
    \ et al. [65] report\nthat the coefﬁcient is considered as a primary factor of\
    \ variation in results under various\nevaporation surfaces and climatological\
    \ zones. Several studies compared the Makkink\nmodel with the lysimeter and showed\
    \ that observed ETo was lower than the measured\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n19 of\
    \ 24\ndata [64]. Their study provided similar results to the pan evaporation data\
    \ conducted in\nSwitzerland [66]. Another study conducted in sub-humid and semiarid\
    \ regions of the USA\nshows that the Makkink model provides poor data when tested\
    \ along with a number of\nother models [67]. Turc was compared with several other\
    \ empirical models and lysimeter\nin a humid subtropical monsoon condition [68],\
    \ while RMSE of the Turc [52] showed\nthe lowest values among all. Liu et al.\
    \ [57] compared 16 models (including Turc) with\ndata observed using the lysimeter\
    \ at a semiarid zone, though the Turc [52] model showed\nmoderate results and\
    \ outrun Priestley–Taylor [50] and Makkink [51] models. The standard\nFAO P–M\
    \ model is considered the most efﬁcient method for estimating ETo. This model\n\
    is based on aerodynamic and physiological parameters of surface water available\
    \ in the\natmosphere and a huge set of meteorological parameters such as net radiation,\
    \ soil heat\nﬂux, vapor pressure deﬁcit of the air, mean air density, the heat\
    \ of the air, the slope of the\nsaturation vapor pressure, psychrometric constant,\
    \ and (bulk) surface and aerodynamic\nresistances [26]. FAO recommended this model\
    \ as a standard for estimating ETo and is\nvalidated in several studies [62].\
    \ Thus, our study used this model as a reference parameter\nto compare and evaluate\
    \ other ETo estimating models. Although preliminary analysis\nrevealed that weather\
    \ parameters were correlated with station elevations, further research\nis needed\
    \ to discover the effect of other inﬂuencing variables before models for regional\n\
    parameter estimation can be developed. Results showed that solar fertigation and\
    \ H–S\nrepresented a very close correlation to the standard FAO P–M and does offer\
    \ a small\nincrease in accuracy of ETo estimates, but this is offset by the need\
    \ to optimize additional\nparameters for worldwide utilization.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    Solar fertigation is a novel irrigation control system with a hybrid model predictive\n\
    control, based on a weather-based system integrated with a crop database controlled\
    \ by\nsoil moisture, water quality, and plant water status real-time sensors.\n\
    The system can be used by farmers to intelligently control, monitor, and automatically\n\
    schedule irrigation and fertilization strategies. The proposed system further\
    \ optimizes the\nirrigation- and nutrient-water input and maximized the crop yield\
    \ per unit of irrigation\nwater and nutrients. The photovoltaic panels make the\
    \ solar fertigation a stand-alone\nsystem that could also be installed in rural\
    \ or remote locations; furthermore, the prototype\nis a water, nutrient, and energy\
    \ saving sustainable system.\nA smart irrigation system is needed in the future\
    \ that estimates irrigation quality\nbefore irrigation in a rapid, robust, and\
    \ reliable way for ETo modeling based on limited\nenvironmental data and simple\
    \ strategies. The developed model can be installed with the\naim to estimate ETo\
    \ and sustainably manage crop irrigation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    \ \nUniversity of Maryland, College Park  \nUSA \n1. Introduction  \nWorldwide,\
    \ irrigation uses about 69% of available freshwater resources (Fry, 2005). In\
    \ the \nUnited States, 82% of freshwater resources are used for irrigation purposes.\
    \ Major concerns \non future planetary freshwater resources are the effects of\
    \ climate change on changing sea \ntemperature and levels, annual snowpack, drought\
    \ and flood events, as well as changes in \nwater quality, and general ecosystem\
    \ vulnerabilities (US Global Change Research Program, \n2011). Changes in the\
    \ extreme climatic events are more likely to occur at the regional level \nthan\
    \ show in national or global statistics. The unpredictability of climatic events\
    \ is of key \nconcern to farmers in all countries, since the availability and\
    \ cost of irrigation water is likely \nto be compounded by increased regulations\
    \ and competition. Over the past 50 years, the \nurban demand for freshwater in\
    \ the United States has also been increasing (Hutson et al. \n2004), while the\
    \ quality of both surface and groundwater has been decreasing due to \npollution\
    \ from both point and nonpoint sources (Secchi et al. 2007). Nitrogen, phosphorus\
    \ \nand many other inorganic and organic pollutants such as pesticides and herbicides\
    \ are being \nfound at increasing concentrations in groundwater under agricultural\
    \ areas (Guimerà, \n1998). As demands on water and the cost of purification increase,\
    \ the cost of freshwater \nresources will increase and the availability will likely\
    \ decrease for agriculture. Population \ngrowth in the 20th century increased\
    \ by a factor of three while water withdrawals increased \nby a factor of seven\
    \ during the same time, with little hope of these rates slowing in the near \n\
    future (Agarwal et al. 2000). \nIn view of increased competition for resources\
    \ and the need for increased agricultural \nproduction to ensure national and\
    \ global food security, it is clear that we need to increase \nour efficiency\
    \ of irrigation water use, to adapt to these changing conditions. Not only do\
    \ we \nneed to increase the overall efficiency of irrigation water use to optimize\
    \ crop yields, but \nthere is also a need to provide farmers with better information\
    \ on root zone water \navailability and daily crop water use, especially at critical\
    \ times during flowering, fruit set \nand fruit or seed development. Although\
    \ crop yield is oftentimes related to water use, most \ngrowers don’t know the\
    \ water requirement of the crop they grow at any real level of \nprecision. Since\
    \ irrigation costs in developed countries are usually a small fraction of total\
    \ \nproduction costs, there are few incentives for growers to optimize their use\
    \ of irrigation \nwater. Therefore, the amount of water applied is mostly based\
    \ on the availability, rather \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives\
    \ and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n \n234 \nthan actual crop\
    \ water needs (Balendock et al., 2009). The development of precision (low \nvolume)\
    \ irrigation systems  has played a major role in reducing the water required to\
    \ \nmaintain yields for high-value crops, but this has also highlighted the need\
    \ for new methods \nfor accurate irrigation scheduling and control (Jones, 2008).\
    \ For high-value horticultural \ncrops, there is also significant interest in\
    \ using precision irrigation as a tool to increase \nharvest quality through regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation, and to reduce nutrient loss and fungal \ndisease pressures.\
    \ In the near future, farmers will likely have to make decisions on how to \n\
    optimize water use with crop yield, in order to remain competitive. Achievement\
    \ of any \noptimal irrigation capability will depend not only on the use of precision\
    \ irrigation systems, \nbut also on the tools that can help the farmer monitor\
    \ and automate irrigation scheduling, \napplying water precisely to satisfy crop\
    \ water requirements. \n1.1 Scope of the chapter \nThe intent of this chapter\
    \ is not to provide the reader with an exhaustive review of the \nsensor network\
    \ development literature. A simple online search of the keywords “wireless, \n\
    sensor, network, irrigation” provides links to over 1500 journal articles just\
    \ within the \nengineering and biological fields. However, two recent articles\
    \ do provide excellent current \nreviews (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009) and practical\
    \ advice (Barrenetxea et al., 2008) for readers \nwanting more explicit engineering\
    \ and technical advice on the development and \ndeployment of wireless sensor\
    \ networks for irrigation, environmental and other (animal and \nfood safety)\
    \ applications. It is apparent from these and many other articles that the \n\
    development of operational wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for large-scale outdoor\
    \ \ndeployment has many challenges; an excellent discussion of many of the pitfalls\
    \ is given by \nBarrenetxea et al., (2008). For many of the reasons they and others\
    \ have outlined, most \nresearch in the field of sensor networks for irrigation\
    \ scheduling has focused on the \ntechnical challenge of gathering reliable data\
    \ from wide area networks. Barrenetxea et al. \n(2008) note that there are two\
    \ primary components for successful WSN deployments: \n(1) gathering the data\
    \ and (2) exploiting the data. Generally, the engineering component of \nany WSN\
    \ project is tasked with providing hardware that reliably accomplishes the first\
    \ task. \nHowever, understanding the biological and/or environmental domain is\
    \ vital to maximize \nthe trustworthiness of sensor data. Interdisciplinary projects\
    \ and partnerships are more \nlikely to have a greater chance of success, since\
    \ the primary objective of all WSN’s is to \ngather data for a specific use, and\
    \ all partners are focused on that task. However, if we are \ngoing to successfully\
    \ commercialize and deploy sensor networks on farms, the end-user \nmust be involved\
    \ during all stages of the project: from node deployment, to sensor \nplacement\
    \ and calibration, through to data analysis and interpretation (Tolle et al, 2005;\
    \  \nLea-Cox et al., 2010a). It is this part of the process that has often received\
    \ scant attention \nfrom researchers and developers; the successful integration\
    \ of sensor networks and decision \nsupport systems (software tools) is probably\
    \ one of the greatest barriers to successful \nimplementation and adoption of\
    \ these systems by farmers. For this reason, any tools that are \ndeveloped should\
    \ be thoroughly vetted by the end-user for ease-of-use, interpretation and \n\
    applicability. Perhaps most importantly, we should learn from past mistakes where\
    \ various \nwater-saving technologies have often not achieved any real economic\
    \ benefit for the grower, \nin terms of water savings, improved yield, labor cost\
    \ or other use. Sometimes technology \nmerely adds another “management layer”\
    \ that requires additional expertise to interpret and \nwww.intechopen.com\n \n\
    Using Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n235 \n\
    use the information, in order to make a decision. We therefore need to bear these\
    \ \nconsiderations in mind when we develop any irrigation scheduling system that\
    \ aims to \nimprove upon current irrigation management techniques. \nThis chapter\
    \ will firstly summarize the pros and cons of certain sensors and techniques that\
    \ \nprovide promise for use in WSNs for precision irrigation. It will review WSN\
    \ deployment \nand progress, but focus primarily on intensive nursery and greenhouse\
    \ production, since \nthese environments provide some extreme challenges with\
    \ spatial and temporal sensor \nmeasurement, to accurately predict plant water\
    \ use. We recognize that there are many \naspects of plant physiology that provide\
    \ both feedback and feedforward mechanisms in \nregulating plant water use, and\
    \ these may radically change in a crop, pre- and post-anthesis. \nThis chapter\
    \ is not focused on these challenges; it will however attempt to illustrate the\
    \ \npotential of sensor networks to provide real-time information to both farmers\
    \ and \nresearchers — often at a level of precision that provides keen insights\
    \ into these processes. \nOur research and development team (Lea-Cox et al, 2010b)\
    \ is actively working on deploying \nand integrating WSNs on farms, but concurrently\
    \ developing the advanced hardware and \nsoftware tools that we need for precision\
    \ irrigation scheduling in intensive horticultural \noperations. We will illustrate\
    \ some of our progress with these WSN’s in container-\nproduction and greenhouse\
    \ environments, as well as in field (soil-based) tree farms which \nhave soil\
    \ water dynamics more akin to field orchard environments. Finally, we will discuss\
    \ \nchallenges and opportunities that need to be addressed  to enable the widespread\
    \ adoption \nof WSN’s for precision irrigation scheduling. \n1.2 Intensive production\
    \ system irrigation scheduling  \nThe most widespread use of automated irrigation\
    \ scheduling systems are in intensive \nhorticultural, and especially in greenhouse\
    \ or protected environments (Jones, 2008). \nCurrently, many greenhouse and nursery\
    \ growers base their irrigation scheduling \ndecisions on intuition or experience\
    \ (Bacci et al., 2008; Jones, 2008; Lea-Cox et al., 2009). \nOftentimes the most\
    \ basic decision is —“do I need to irrigate today?” While this question \ncould\
    \ seem trivial, plant water requirements vary by species, season and microclimate,\
    \ \nand depend upon any number of environmental and plant developmental factors\
    \ that \nneed to be integrated on a day-to-day basis. Add to these factors the\
    \ number of species \ngrown in a ‘typical’ nursery or greenhouse operation (oftentimes\
    \ >250 species; Majsztrik, \n2011), the variety of container sizes (i.e. rooting\
    \ volume, water-holding capacity) and the \nlength of crop cycles (a few weeks\
    \ to several years), it quickly becomes obvious why \nprecision irrigation scheduling\
    \ in these types of operations is extremely difficult (Lea-Cox \net al., 2001;\
    \ Ross et al, 2001). If done well, daily irrigation decisions take a lot of time\
    \ and \nan irrigation manager often faces complex decisions about scheduling,\
    \ which requires \nintegrating knowledge from many sources. Although these intuitive\
    \ methods for \nirrigation scheduling can give good results with experience, they\
    \ tend to be very \nsubjective with different operators making very different\
    \ decisions. Many times, even \nexperienced managers make an incorrect decision,\
    \ i.e., they irrigate when water is not \nrequired by the plant. It is also surprising\
    \ how many “advanced” irrigation scheduling \nsystems automate irrigation cycles\
    \ only on the basis of time, without any feedback-based \nsensor systems. Thus,\
    \ even with advanced time-based systems, the decision to irrigate is \nagain based\
    \ solely on the operator’s judgment and the time taken to evaluate crop water\
    \ \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural\
    \ Water Management \n \n236 \nuse and integrate other information, e.g. weather\
    \ conditions during the past few days and \nimmediate future. \nThere are many\
    \ sensor technologies that have been used over the years to aid this \ndecision\
    \ process. Various soil moisture measurement devices are available, e.g. \ntensiometers,\
    \ gypsum blocks and meters that directly sense soil moisture; additionally \n\
    pan evaporation, weather station or satellite forecast data can be incorporated\
    \ into \nevapotranspiration (ET) models. However, the widespread adoption of most\
    \ of this \ntechnology has not occurred in the nursery and greenhouse industries,\
    \ for good reasons. \nMany \nsensing \ntechnologies \nwhich \nwere \noriginally\
    \ \nengineered \nfor \nsoil-based \nmeasurements have been applied to soilless\
    \ substrates. Many have failed, largely because \nthese sensors did not perform\
    \ well in highly porous substrates, since porosity is an \nimportant physical\
    \ property that is necessary for good root growth in containers (Bunt, \n1961).\
    \ Even when a technology has been adapted successfully to container culture (e.g.\
    \ \nlow-tension tensiometers), often the technology has been too expensive for\
    \ wide-scale \nadoption, difficult to incorporate into WSNs, or there have been\
    \ precision or maintenance \nissues. Cost and ease of use are key aspects to the\
    \ adoption and use of any tool by \ngrowers, who are often time-limited. \n1.3\
    \ Wireless sensor network development objectives \nIt was imperative to establish\
    \ a list of global objectives for the development of WSN tools \nand strategies\
    \ for our project (Lea-Cox et al, 2010b). Jones (2008) documented the features\
    \ of \nan ‘ideal’ irrigation scheduling system for intensive horticultural production\
    \ systems. He \nnoted that any system should be (1) sensitive to small changes,\
    \ whether in terms of soil \nmoisture content, evaporative demand, or plant response;\
    \ (2) respond rapidly to these \nchanges, allowing for continual monitoring and\
    \ maintenance of optimal water status and \nresponding in “real time” to changing\
    \ weather conditions; (3) readily adaptable to different \ncrops, growth stages\
    \ or different horticultural environments without the need for extensive \nrecalibration;\
    \ (4) robust and reliable; (5) user-friendly, requiring little user training;\
    \ (6) \ncapable of automation, thus reducing labor requirements, and (7) low cost,\
    \ both in terms of \npurchase and running costs.  \nIn addition to these universal\
    \ requirements, Lea-Cox et al. (2008) proposed a number of \nmore specific WSN\
    \ requirements, where (1) users should be able to rapidly deploy sensors \nin\
    \ any production area, to maximize utility and minimize cost; (2) sensor networks\
    \ should \nbe scalable, thereby allowing an operation to begin with a small, low-cost\
    \ system and \nexpand/improve the network over time; (3) nodes (motes) should\
    \ have low power (battery) \nrequirements, preferably with rechargeable power\
    \ options; (4) sensor data should be \nreliably transmitted using wireless connections\
    \ to the base station computer (or internet) \nwith little or no interference\
    \ over at least 1000m; (5) the software interface should \nautomatically log and\
    \ display real-time data from the sensor nodes, in a form that provides \nthe\
    \ user with an easily interpreted summary of that data, preferably as a customizable\
    \ \ngraphical output (6) any software control functions should include relatively\
    \ sophisticated \ndecision tools and discretionary options, to allow for maximum\
    \ flexibility in scheduling / \nactuating irrigation solenoids or other control\
    \ devices.  \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling \n \n237 \nThese engineering objectives are the foundation\
    \ for our specific scientific, engineering and \nsocio-economic objectives (Lea-Cox,\
    \ 2010b), to: (1) further develop and adapt commercially-\navailable wireless\
    \ sensor network hardware and software, to meet the monitoring and \ncontrol \n\
    requirements \nfor \nfield \n(soil-based), \ncontainer \n(soilless) \nproduction\
    \ \nand \nenvironmental (green roof) systems; (2) determine the performance and\
    \ utility of soil \nmoisture and electrical conductivity sensors for precision\
    \ irrigation and nutrient \nmanagement; (3) determine spatial and temporal variability\
    \ of sensors, to minimize the \nnumbers of sensors required for different environments\
    \ at various scales; (4) integrate \nvarious environmental sensors into WSNs to\
    \ enable real-time modeling of microclimatic \nplant ET; (5) integrate soil and\
    \ environmental data into species-specific models to better \npredict plant and\
    \ system water use; (6) develop best management practices for the use of \nsensors,\
    \ working with commercial growers to capture needs-based issues during on-farm\
    \ \nsystem development; (7) quantify improvements in water and nutrient management\
    \ and \nrunoff, plant quality, and yield; (8) evaluate the private and public\
    \ economic and \nenvironmental impacts of precision sensor-controlled practices;\
    \ (9) identify barriers to \nadoption and implementation of these practices; and\
    \ (10) engage growers and the industry \non the operation, benefits and current\
    \ limitations of this sensor / modeling approach to \nirrigation scheduling and\
    \ management. \n2. Irrigation sensing approaches \nThe main approaches to irrigation\
    \ scheduling in soils and the techniques available have \nbeen the subject of\
    \ many reviews over the years. Specific reviews have concentrated on \nmeasuring\
    \ soil moisture (e.g. Dane & Topp, 2002; Bitelli, 2011), physiological measurements\
    \ \n(e.g. Jones, 2004; Cifre et al., 2005) or water balance calculations (e.g.\
    \ Allen et al., 1998). The \nconventional sensor-based approach has typically\
    \ scheduled irrigation events on the basis of \nsoil moisture status, whether\
    \ using direct soil moisture measurements with capacitance or \nTDR-type sensors\
    \ (Topp, 1985; Smith & Mullins, 2001), tensiometers (Smajstrla & Harrison, \n\
    1998) or soil-moisture water balance methods using daily ET estimates (Allen et\
    \ al., 1998). \nSome automated greenhouse systems have used load cells for the\
    \ estimation of daily plant \nwater use (Raviv et al., 2000). However, these load\
    \ cell systems have to be programmed to \naccurately correct for increasing total\
    \ plant mass over the crop cycle, or to adjust to changes \nin wind and temperature\
    \ changes, if deployed in outdoor environments. Nevertheless, if \noperated correctly,\
    \ most of these systems enable much greater precision and improved \nwater use\
    \ efficiency over traditional time-based irrigation scheduling methods. \nJones\
    \ (2004) summarized the main sensor techniques that are currently used for irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling or which have the potential for development in the near future\
    \ in some detail \n(Table 1). The current debate centers around using soil moisture\
    \ sensing techniques, plant \nwater sensing techniques or a combination of both\
    \ techniques. Soil irrigation sensing \napproaches (Table 1) can either be based\
    \ on direct measurement of soil moisture content (or \nwater potential), or by\
    \ using sensors to provide data for the water balance method, which \naccounts\
    \ for inputs (rainfall, irrigation) and losses (ET, run-off and drainage) from\
    \ the \nsystem. The emphasis on using soil moisture content for irrigation decisions\
    \ has been based \non the perception that water availability in the soil is what\
    \ limits plant transpiration, and \nthat irrigation scheduling should replace\
    \ the water lost by plant water uptake and \nevaporation from the rootzone (Jones,\
    \ 2008). \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural\

    \ 2004). Reproduced with kind permission \nof the author and Oxford University\
    \ Press.  \n2.1 Measuring soil moisture \n2.1.1 Water potential or volumetric\
    \ water content? \nSoil (substrate) water content can be expressed either in terms\
    \ of the energy status of the \nwater in the soil (i.e. matric potential, kPa)\
    \ or as the amount of water in the substrate (most \ncommonly expressed on a volumetric\
    \ basis; % or m3 • m-3). Both methods have advantages \nand disadvantages. Soil/substrate\
    \ matric potential indicates how easily water is available to \nplants (Lea-Cox\
    \ et al, 2011), but it does not provide information on how much total water is\
    \ \npresent in the substrate. Conversely, volumetric water content indicates how\
    \ much water is \npresent in a substrate, but not if this water is extractable\
    \ by plant roots. This is especially \nimportant for soilless substrates, since\
    \ mixtures of different components means that \nsubstrates have very different\
    \ water-holding capacities and moisture release curves \n(deBoodt and Verdonck,\
    \ 1972). Sensors that estimate water content (e.g. capacitance and \nTDR-type\
    \ sensors) tend to be more reliable than those sensors measuring water availability\
    \ \n(tensiometers and psychrometers); (Jones, 2008; Murray et al, 2004). A major\
    \ disadvantage \nof almost all soil sensors, however, is their limited capability\
    \ to measure soil moisture \nheterogeneity in the root zone, since they typically\
    \ only sense a small volume around the \nsensor. Variation in soil water availability\
    \ is well known, primarily as a function of variation \nin soil type, soil compaction\
    \ and depth, among many sources of variation (e.g. organic \nmatter content, porosity\
    \ and rockiness). The use of large sensor arrays which may be \nnecessary to get\
    \ good representative readings of soil moisture tends to be limited by cost, \n\
    but this could be overcome by sensor placement strategies.  \nwww.intechopen.com\n\
    \ \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n\
    \ \n240 \nSoilless substrates are used by the nursery and greenhouse industry\
    \ for a multitude of \nreasons, primarily to reduce the incidence of soil-borne\
    \ pathogens, increase root growth, \nand reduce labor, shipping and overall costs\
    \ to the producer (Majsztrik et al., 2011). Over \nthe years, many studies have\
    \ shown large differences between soil and soilless substrates in \nthe availability\
    \ of water to root systems (Bunt, 1961; deBoodt and Verdonck, 1972). Soilless\
    \ \nsubstrates, which in most cases have larger particle sizes and porosity, tend\
    \ to release more \nwater at very low matric potentials (Ψm=-1 to -40 kPa) which\
    \ is 10 to 100 times lower than \nsimilar plant-available water tensions in soils\
    \ (Lea-Cox et al., 2011). Plant-available water \n(PAW) is the amount of water\
    \ accessible to the plant, which is affected by the physical \nproperties of the\
    \ substrate, the geometry (height and width) of the container and the total \n\
    volume of the container (Handreck and Black, 2002). Container root systems are\
    \ usually \nconfined within a short time after transplanting, and shoot : root\
    \ ratios are usually larger \nthan those of soil-grown plants, for similarly-aged\
    \ plants. For all these reasons, maintaining \nthe optimal water status of soilless\
    \ substrates has been recognized as being critical for \ncontinued growth, not\
    \ only because of limited water-holding capacity, but also because of \nthe inadequacies\
    \ of being able to accurately judge when plants require water (Karlovich & \n\
    Fonteno, 1986). Although it is likely that mature plant root systems can extract\
    \ substrate \nmoisture at Ψm less than -40 kPa, Leith and Burger (1989) and Kiehl\
    \ et al. (1992) found \nsignificant growth reductions at substrate Ψm as small\
    \ as -16 kPa (0.16 Bar). This has major \nimplications for choosing appropriate\
    \ sensors for use in soilless substrates (see next section), \nas well as the\
    \ measurement and automatic control of irrigation in these substrates.  \n2.1.2\
    \ Types of soil moisture sensors \nJones (2004) noted the various types of soil\
    \ moisture sensors available at that time. The \nvariety of soil moisture sensors\
    \ (tensiometric, neutron, resistance, heat dissipation, \npsychrometric or dielectric)\
    \ has continually evolved since then; the choices are now \noverwhelming, since\
    \ each sensor may have specific strengths and weaknesses in a specific \nsituation.\
    \ Tensiometers have long been used to measure matric potential in soils (Smajstrla\
    \ \n& Harrison, 1998) and in soilless substrates (Burger and Paul, 1987). Although\
    \ tensiometers \nhave proven to be valuable research tools, they have not been\
    \ adopted widely in greenhouse \nand nursery production, mainly because of the\
    \ problems with using them in highly porous \nsoilless substrates. Tensiometers\
    \ rely on direct contact between the porous ceramic tip and \nsubstrate moisture.\
    \ If the substrate shrinks, or the tensiometer is disturbed, this contact may\
    \ \nbe disrupted. Air then enters and breaks the water column in the tensiometer,\
    \ resulting in \nincorrect readings and maintenance issues (Zazueta et al., 1994).\
    \ A number of next-\ngeneration soil moisture sensors have become available  in\
    \ the past decade from various \nmanufacturers., e.g. Theta probe and SM200 (Delta\
    \ T, Burwell, UK) and  EC5, 5TM and \n10HS sensors (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman,\
    \ WA, USA) which provide precise data in a \nwide range of soilless substrates.\
    \ These sensors determine the volumetric moisture content \nby measuring the apparent\
    \ dielectric constant of the soil or substrate. These sensors are easy \nto use\
    \ and provide highly reproducible data (van Iersel et al., 2011). The Decagon\
    \ range of \nsensors are designed to be installed in soils or substrates for longer\
    \ periods of time and all \ninterface with Decagon’s range of EM50 nodes, datastation\
    \ and Datatrac software \n(http://decagon.com/products). Dielectric sensors generally\
    \ require substrate-specific \ncalibrations, because the dielectric properties\
    \ of different soils and substrates differ, \naffecting sensor output. The conversion\
    \ between water potential and volumetric water \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n241 \ncontent\
    \ (VWC) varies substantially with soil type. It is possible to inter-convert matric\
    \ \npotential to volumetric water content (Lea-Cox et al, 2011) for various sensors\
    \ using \nsubstrate moisture release curves. However, such release curves are\
    \ substrate-specific, and \nmay change over time as the physical properties (e.g.\
    \ pore size distribution) of the substrate \nchanges (van Iersel et al., 2011)\
    \ or root systems become more established. Fortunately, in \nmost irrigation scheduling\
    \ applications, the objective is simply to apply a volume of water \nthat returns\
    \ the soil moisture content to its original well-watered state. Changes in this\
    \ total \nwater-holding capacity (i.e. the maximum VWC reading) can easily be\
    \ monitored for \nchanges over time, i.e. after significant rainfall events or\
    \ by periodically saturating the \ncontainer with the embedded sensor.  \nMore\
    \ recently, hybrid ‘tensiometer-like’ sensors have been developed which use the\
    \ \nprinciple of dielectric sensors to determine the water potential of substrates\
    \ (e.g., \nEquitensiometer, Delta T; MPS-1, Decagon Devices) (van Iersel et al.,\
    \ 2011). An advantage of \nsuch sensors is that they do not require substrate-specific\
    \ calibrations, since they measure \nthe water content of the ceramic material,\
    \ not that of the surrounding soil or substrate. \nUnfortunately, the sensors\
    \ that are currently available are not very sensitive in the matric \npotential\
    \ range where soilless substrates hold most plant-available water (0 to -10 kPa;\
    \ \ndeBoodt and Verdonck, 1972). In addition, it is not clear whether these sensors\
    \ respond \nquickly enough to capture the rapid changes that can occur in soilless\
    \ substrates (van Iersel \net al., 2011). \n2.2 Measuring plant water status \n\
    Automated irrigation techniques based on sensing plant water status are mostly\
    \ in the \ndevelopmental stage, in large part because of the variability of sensor\
    \ readings and the lack \nof rugged sensors and reliable automated techniques\
    \ (Table 1). It is usually necessary to \nsupplement indicators of plant stress\
    \ with additional information, such as crop evaporative \ndemand (Jones, 2008);\
    \ it is also hard to scale up these automated systems for many \nhorticultural\
    \ applications, since a detailed knowledge of crop development is required. \n\
    Plant water use (transpiration) is a key process in the hydrologic cycle, and\
    \ because \nphotosynthetic uptake of CO2 and transpiration are both controlled\
    \ by stomata, it is strongly \nlinked to plant productivity (Jones & Tardieu,\
    \ 1998). Models that can accurately predict \ntranspiration therefore have important\
    \ applications for irrigation scheduling and crop yield. \nHowever, previous evidence\
    \ (Jones, 2004) suggests that leaf water status is not the most \nuseful indicator\
    \ of plant water stress, and cannot therefore be used as the primary indicator\
    \ \nof irrigation need as has sometimes been suggested. In fact leaf water status\
    \ depends on a \ncomplex interaction of soil water availability and environmental\
    \ and physiological factors \n(Jones, 1990). It is now clear that in some situations\
    \ soil water status is sensed by the roots \nand this information is signaled\
    \ to the shoots, perhaps by means of hydraulic signals \n(Christmann et al., 2009)\
    \ and chemical messengers such as abscisic acid (Kim & van Iersel, \n2011). Another\
    \ general limitation to plant-based methods is that they do not usually give \n\
    information on ‘how much’ irrigation to apply at any time, only whether irrigation\
    \ is \nneeded or not. None of the plant-based methods illustrated in Table 1 are\
    \ well-adapted for \nautomatic irrigation scheduling or control because of the\
    \ difficulties measuring each \nvariable (Jones, 2008). Typically, the use of\
    \ any plant-based indicator for irrigation \nscheduling requires the definition\
    \ of reference or threshold values, beyond which irrigation \nwww.intechopen.com\n\
    \ \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n\
    \ \n242 \nis necessary. Such threshold values are commonly determined for plants\
    \ growing under \nnon-limiting soil water supply (Fereres and Goldhamer, 2003),\
    \ but obtaining extensive \ninformation on the behavior of these reference values\
    \ as environmental conditions change \nwill be an important stage in the development\
    \ and validation of such methods.  \n2.3 Hybridizing sensing and modeling techniques\
    \ for precision irrigation scheduling \nWater budget calculations are relatively\
    \ easy to use in scheduling irrigations, since there are \nsimple algorithms available\
    \ to calculate crop ET (typically using Penman-Monteith or other \nmethods) that\
    \ use local meteorological station or pan evaporation data (Fereres et al., 2003).\
    \ \nAll methods are based on calculating a reference ET that is multiplied by\
    \ an empirically-\ndetermined crop coefficient (Kc) for each crop. At present\
    \ there are good estimates of Kc \nvalues for many horticultural crops, even though\
    \ most research has been conducted on the \nmajor field crops (Allen et al, 1998).\
    \ However, there are virtually no KC values for \nornamental species and most\
    \ estimates of woody perennial crop water use are quite \nvariable. Inaccuracies\
    \ in Kc values can result in large potential errors in estimated soil \nmoisture\
    \ contents (Allen et al., 1998). The approach therefore works best where it is\
    \ \ncombined with regular soil moisture monitoring techniques that can help reset\
    \ the model \n(e.g. after rainfall). A particular strength of book-keeping and\
    \ volumetric soil-based \napproaches is that they not only address scheduling\
    \ issues about “when to irrigate” but also \nabout “how much to apply”. Although\
    \ useful for soil-based irrigation scheduling, there may \nbe limitations on how\
    \ quickly these calculations can be manually performed. This is \nespecially important\
    \ for greenhouse and container-nursery operations who may be cyclic \nirrigating\
    \ containerized plants from 4-8 times per day (Tyler et al., 1996) to maintain\
    \ \navailable water in the root zone on hot, sunny or windy days. \nPrevious studies\
    \ with a variety of crop, ornamental and turf species have reported that the \n\
    use of appropriate scheduling methods and precision irrigation technologies can\
    \ save a \nsignificant amount of water, while maintaining or increasing yield\
    \ and product quality \n(Bacci et al., 2008; Beeson & Brooks, 2008; Blonquist\
    \ et al., 2006; Fereres et al., 2003). Many of \nthese empirical approaches have\
    \ successfully incorporated environmental variables into \nvarious models, to\
    \ further increase the precision of irrigation scheduling (e.g. Treder et al.,\
    \ \n1997). It is imperative that we connect our capability for precision water\
    \ applications with a \nknowledge of real-time plant water use. We need to improve\
    \ our ability to predict plant \nwater use in real-time using various technologies.\
    \ As an example of this approach, van \nIersel and his group have shown with various\
    \ studies (Burnett and van Iersel, 2008; Kim and \nvan Iersel, 2009; Nemali and\
    \ van Iersel, 2006; van Iersel et al., 2009; 2010; 2011) that \nautomated irrigation\
    \ using soil moisture sensors allows for the very precise irrigation of \ngreenhouse\
    \ crops in soilless substrates. In addition, they maintained very low substrate\
    \ \nmoisture contents at very precise levels which advances our capability to\
    \ use precision \nirrigation scheduling for  regulated deficit irrigation (RDI)\
    \ techniques (Jones, 2004), to \nincrease fruit crop quality (Fereres et al.,\
    \ 2003), and aid in precision nutrient (Lea-Cox et al, \n2001; Ristvey et al,\
    \ 2004) and disease management (Lea-Cox et al, 2006).  \nMost recently, Kim and\
    \ van Iersel (2011) have demonstrated that the measured daily \nevapotranspiration\
    \ of petunia in the greenhouse can be accurately modeled with \nmeasurements of\
    \ crop growth (days after planting, DAP), daily light integral (DLI), vapor \n\
    pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature. All these environmental fluxes obviously\
    \ affect \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling \n \n243 \ntranspiration on a continuous basis. Ambient\
    \ light affects plant water use due to its effects \non evaporation and stomatal\
    \ opening (Pieruschka et al., 2010). Vapor pressure deficit is the \ndriving force\
    \ for transpiration and also affects stomatal regulation (Taiz and Zeiger, 2006)\
    \ \nwhile temperature affects ET and plant metabolic activity (Allen et al., 1998;\
    \ van Iersel, 2003). \nThe importance of Kim & van Iersel’s empirical modeling\
    \ approach is how they have \ndemonstrated the sensitivity of plant water use\
    \ to these four easily-measured variables. \nThus, with a few inexpensive sensors\
    \ (temperature, relative humidity and photosynthetic \nphoton flux, PPF) and some\
    \ simple software tools that can integrate these variables on short \ntime-scales,\
    \ it now appears possible to predict hourly plant water use for greenhouse crops\
    \ \nwith real precision. It should be noted however, that these models still require\
    \ rigorous \nvalidation for production conditions. \nHowever, for these types\
    \ of models to work in an external environment, it is likely that the \ncomplexity\
    \ of our predictive water use models will have to increase, to incorporate \n\
    additional variables. Water use by perennial woody crop species is much more complicated\
    \ \ndue to external environmental conditions (for example how VPD and leaf temperature\
    \ are \naffected by wind speed and boundary layer effects on canopies; LAI effects\
    \ on PPF \ninterception). For example, Bowden et al. (2005) outlined an automated\
    \ sensor-based \nirrigation system for nurseries that could calculate plant water\
    \ consumption from species \nand genotype-specific plant physiological responses.\
    \ The MAESTRA [Multi-Array \nEvaporation Stand Tree Radiation A] model (Wang and\
    \ Jarvis, 1990) is a three-dimensional \nprocess-based model that computes transpiration,\
    \ photosynthesis, and absorbed radiation \nwithin individual tree crowns at relatively\
    \ short time (15-minute) intervals. The model is \ndescribed more fully by Bauerle\
    \ & Bowden (2011b) and has been modified and previously \nvalidated to estimate\
    \ deciduous tree transpiration (Bauerle et al., 2002; Bowden & Bauerle, \n2008)\
    \ and within-crown light interception (Bauerle et al., 2004). The model applies\
    \ \nphysiological equations to sub-volumes of the tree crown and then sums and/or\
    \ averages \nthe values for entire canopies. Additionally, species-specific physiological\
    \ values can be \nincorporated into model calculations, potentially yielding more\
    \ accurate estimates of whole \ntree transpiration. The model holds potential\
    \ advantages for nursery, forest, and orchard \nwater use prediction in that structural\
    \ parameters such as tree position, crown shape, and \ntree dimensions are specified.\
    \  \nBowden et al. (2005) briefly illustrated how the model estimates of water\
    \ use and plant \nwater requirements are outputted from MAESTRA and used to both\
    \ make irrigation \ndecisions (command executed by a sensor node) and visualize\
    \ model updates via a graphic \nuser interface (Bauerle et al., 2006). Within\
    \ each 15-minute time step, the model adjusts \ntranspiration based on interactions\
    \ between environmental, soil moisture, and plant \nphysiological response. The\
    \ substrate moisture deficit calculation is described in Bauerle et \nal. (2002).\
    \ An updated substrate moisture value is carried into the next time step for input\
    \ \ninto the substrate moisture deficit sub-routine. The calculated moisture deficit\
    \ value is one \nof the input values required to calculate the amount of stomatal\
    \ conductance regulation and \nhence, interacts with other equations to derive\
    \ whole plant water use. Overall, this GUI \n(Bowden et al., 2005; Bauerle et\
    \ al., 2006) provides a user friendly interface to a complex set \nof calculations.\
    \ In this way, whole tree water use estimates can be rapidly visualized for \n\
    either sensor node or human based irrigation decision management. Bauerle and\
    \ his group \nare actively working to further refine the MAESTRA model for incorporation\
    \ into the \nirrigation scheduling decision support system in our current project\
    \ (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b). \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and\
    \ Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n \n244 \n3. Utilizing the power\
    \ of sensor networks \n3.1 Wireless Sensor Networks \nA WSN is typically comprised\
    \ of radio frequency transceivers, sensors, microcontrollers and \npower sources\
    \ (Akyildiz et al., 2002). Recent advances in wireless sensor networking \ntechnology\
    \ have led to the development of low cost, low power, multifunctional sensor \n\
    nodes. These nodes can be clustered in close proximity to provide dense sensing\
    \ capabilities, \nor deployed in a more distributed fashion (Fig. 1). We shall\
    \ describe the commercially-\navailable Decagon Devices WSN, since we have the\
    \ most experience with that system, \nalthough there are other commercial companies\
    \ that have similarly available irrigation and \nenvironmental WSN systems, e.g.\
    \ Adcon Telemetry Int. (Klosterneuburg, Austria; \nhttp://adcon.at), Delta-T Devices\
    \ (Cambridge, UK; http://delta-t.co.uk) and PureSense \n(Fresno, CA; http://puresense.com).\
    \  \nFigure 1 shows the type of WSN that we have deployed in multiple research\
    \ and \ncommercial sites. Whenever necessary, the accumulated data is transmitted\
    \ from each of the \nsensor nodes in the production area using a 900 MHz radio\
    \ card (although other companies \nuse other frequencies), to a ‘base’ datastation\
    \ connected to a personal computer on the farm. \nIncoming data is inputted into\
    \ a software program (e.g. DataTrac v.3.2; Decagon Devices) \nthat is installed\
    \ on a low-cost computer. The software then plots and displays the sensor \ninformation\
    \ from each of the nodes. Data is appended to existing data, so information can\
    \ \nbe graphically displayed over multiple time scales, depending on user preference.\
    \ \nAlternatively, data from a field node can be transmitted directly to a server\
    \ via the internet \nusing a 3G wireless node (e.g. EM50G, Decagon Devices). The\
    \ logged data is then accessed \nfrom the server over an internet website, using\
    \ the same DataTrac software previously \ndescribed. In this way, a grower can\
    \ develop a scaleable network of sensors that allows for \nthe monitoring of soil\
    \ moisture and environmental data, in real time. The advantages of \nthese WSN’s\
    \ are fairly obvious – they provide information at the “micro-scale” which can\
    \ be \nexpanded to any resolution, determined for a specific production operation,\
    \ for specific \nneeds. This system also provides a mechanism for local (i.e.\
    \ a decision made locally by the \nnode, based on local sensor readings /setpoints)\
    \ or the global control (information relayed \nto the nodes from an external database)\
    \ of irrigation scheduling (Fig. 1) , depending upon \ngrower preferences and\
    \ needs (Kohanbash et al, 2011). We are currently in the process of \ndeploying\
    \ and testing next-generation nodes  with these various capabilities. \nAny combination\
    \ of environmental sensors, including soil moisture and electrical \nconductivity,\
    \ soil and air temperature, relative humidity, anemometer (wind speed and \ndirection),\
    \ rain gauge and light (PPF and net radiation) sensors can be connected to the\
    \  \nnodes, according to user needs. Decagon nodes collect data every minute,\
    \ which is averaged \nand logged on a 1, 5- 15-min or greater time scale, according\
    \ to required precision. Longer \nsampling times result in a considerable increase\
    \ in battery life, but power consumption will \nalso vary greatly with different\
    \ systems. With Decagon EM50 nodes, a 15-min average \nsetting typically results\
    \ in > 12-month battery life from 5 ‘AA’ batteries under normal \ntemperature\
    \ (-5 to 40°C) conditions (J.D. Lea-Cox, pers. obs.). Battery life is also affected\
    \ by \nthe number of times the field nodes are downloaded and the settings employed;\
    \ typically \nnodes are downloaded 1-10 times a day. \nwww.intechopen.com\n \n\
    Using Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n245 \n\
    \ \nFig. 1. A schematic of a farm-scale WSN for precision irrigation scheduling\
    \ (adapted from \nBalendock, 2009), to illustrate networks deployed by our group\
    \ (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b). \n3.2 Scaleable, adaptable and reconfigurable capabilities\
    \ \nOne of the most important features of these WSNs is that a grower can purchase\
    \ a small \nnetwork and scale up and/or reconfigure the sensor network to meet\
    \ specific needs, over \ntime. These networks can provide a fixed capability,\
    \ but networks can be more fully utilized \nif a “nimble networks” concept is\
    \ used. In this way, growers can move sensor nodes quickly \nand easily within\
    \ the production area for shorter periods of time, to address current issues \n\
    and problems, e.g. to address the water requirements of a specific indicator species\
    \ in a \ndrought, or to monitor irrigations to reduce the incidence of disease\
    \ in a crop (Lea-Cox et al., \n2006). This nimble network approach can more fully\
    \ utilize WSN capabilities and is one of \nthe most powerful ways of realizing\
    \ a quick return on investment in equipment. We think \nthat there are many situations\
    \ where a grower could have a payback period for a small \nnetwork within a single\
    \ crop cycle, if the information is utilized for better irrigation and \ncrop\
    \ management decisions.  \n3.3 Wireless sensor network development for irrigation\
    \ scheduling \nA number of WSN’s with various topologies (e.g. star, mesh-network)\
    \ have been developed \nand investigated by different researchers in the past\
    \ decade (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009), \nincluding WSN’s for irrigation scheduling\
    \ in cotton (Vellidis et al., 2008), center-pivot \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems,\
    \ Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n \n246 \nirrigation\
    \ (O’Shaughnessy & Evett, 2008) and linear-move irrigation systems (Kim et al.,\
    \ \n2008). The first reported greenhouse WSN was a bluetooth monitoring and control\
    \ system \ndeveloped by Liu & Ying (2003). Yoo et al. (2007) describes the deployment\
    \ of a wireless \nenvironmental monitoring and control system in greenhouses;\
    \ Wang et al. (2008) also \ndeveloped a specialized wireless sensor node to monitor\
    \ temperature, relative humidity and \nlight inside greenhouses. Our group (Lea-Cox\
    \ et al., 2007) reported on the early deployment \nof a WSN within a cut-flower\
    \ greenhouse, where a number of soil moisture and \nenvironmental sensor nodes\
    \ were deployed for real-time monitoring of crop production by \nthe grower. \
    \ \nWith regards to large on-farm WSN deployments, Balendonck et al., (2009) reported\
    \ on the \nFLOW-AID project that has many of the same objectives that we are focused\
    \ upon, i.e., \nproviding growers with a safe, efficient and cost-effective management\
    \ system for irrigation \nscheduling. The FLOW-AID project is integrating innovative\
    \ monitoring and control \ntechnologies within an appropriate decision support\
    \ system (Balendonck et al., 2007; \nFerentinos et al., 2003) that is accessible\
    \ over the internet, to assist growers in long-term \nfarm zoning and crop planning.\
    \ It is especially focused on providing growers with \nregulated deficit irrigation\
    \ and soil salinity management tools. To support shorter-term \nirrigation scheduling,\
    \ a scheduling tool is being developed which allocates available water \namong\
    \ several plots and schedules irrigation for each plot (Stanghellini et al., 2007;\
    \ \nAnastasiou et al., 2008). To assist this advanced scheduling tool, a crop\
    \ response model is \nbeing developed and used to predict crop stress (Balendonck\
    \ et al., 2009). \nWe outlined the major engineering and scientific goals of our\
    \ WSN project earlier in this \nchapter (Lea-Cox et al., 2010a). To explain further,\
    \ this interdisciplinary project is taking a \ncommercially-available WSN product\
    \ (Decagon Devices, Inc.) and retooling it to support the \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ requirements of field nurseries, container nurseries, greenhouse \noperations\
    \ and green roof systems, as analogs for many intensive agricultural production\
    \ \nand environmental management systems. Our global goals are to develop a more\
    \ \nintegrative and mechanistic understanding of plant water requirements, to\
    \ more precisely \nschedule irrigation events with WSN technology. We are working\
    \ across various scales of \nproduction, using small and large commercial farms\
    \ which allow us to take a systems \napproach to defining the hardware and software\
    \ required to meet the needs of these highly \nintensive specialty crop systems.\
    \ In addition to the ornamental industry, there are many \nparallel needs that\
    \ we are addressing for WSN adoption by field-grown fruit, nut and berry \nproduction,\
    \ as well as field and greenhouse vegetable production. As part of the project,\
    \ \neconomic, environmental and social analyses will identify costs and benefits\
    \ of WSN \ntechnology to the industry and society, including barriers to adoption.\
    \ The project directly \ninvolves commercial growers throughout the process, using\
    \ deployments in commercial \noperations as test sites. This will help ensure\
    \ product satisfaction of the next generation of \nhardware and software developed\
    \ by our various teams (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b; \nhttp://www.smart-farms.net).\
    \ Each farm and research test site is instrumented with a sensor \nnetwork(s)\
    \ to provide real-time environmental data for scientific and technological \n\
    development. Data streams are monitored on a day-to-day basis by growers, engineers\
    \ and \nscientists, which drives a daily dialogue between the growers and various\
    \ working groups.  \nThe role of the engineering team is to develop, deploy and\
    \ maintain the next generation of \nwireless sensor networks (Fig. 1). Their major\
    \ task is to develop the hardware and software \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n247 \ncapable\
    \ of supporting advanced monitoring and control of irrigation scheduling, \nimplementing\
    \ a hybrid sensor and modeling approach. A major focus of this effort is the \n\
    development of advanced software which will provide advanced user control, in\
    \ addition to \ndatabase filtering and analysis. The software will refine incoming\
    \ data and provide an easy-\nto-use computer program for a non-expert user to\
    \ easily visualize the information from the \nWSN, and schedule irrigation events\
    \ based on user preference, or utilizing automatic (set-\npoint) control. The\
    \ scientific modeling group (Bauerle et al., 2011a; Kim and van Iersel, 2011;\
    \ \nStarry et al., 2011) are developing and validating the various models, which\
    \ form the basis \nof the species- and environmental-specific software. These\
    \ models interface with the WSN \ndatabase via an open application programming\
    \ interface, which integrates the models with \nthe irrigation scheduling monitoring\
    \ and control functions. This will enable more predictive \n(feed-forward) management\
    \ of water use, based upon the underlying plant and \nenvironmental water-use\
    \ models.  \nThe role of the scientific and extension teams is to ensure that\
    \ the precision and accuracy of \nthe data gathered (and hence the quality of\
    \ the models incorporated in the decision support \nsoftware) are of the highest\
    \ possible quality and reliability. There are a number of critical \nresearch\
    \ objectives that span the various production environments: (a) characterize the\
    \ \nspatial and temporal variability of environmental parameters in both root\
    \ and shoot \ncanopies, since we need to place sensors for maximum precision and\
    \ economic benefit; (b) \ncharacterize sensor performance and precision, so we\
    \ match the right sensor with the right \napplication; (c) integrate the knowledge\
    \ gained from (a) and (b), to ensure that the irrigation \nscheduling decisions\
    \ made (either manually or automatically) satisfy plant water \nrequirements in\
    \ real-time, while placing a minimum burden on the grower for managing \nthe system.\
    \ We elaborate further on some of these critical objectives below in section 3.4.\
    \ \nHowever, our primary project objective is to provide a cost-effective WSN\
    \ that provides \nquality data for minimal cost to growers, both small and large.\
    \ Our grower’s production \nareas range from 0.5 to over 250 ha in extent, with\
    \ multiple irrigation zones / crop species. \nTo that end, our economic and environmental\
    \ analysis team members are gathering specific \neconomic, resource use and environmental\
    \ data from each production site through a series \nof on-farm visits and assessments.\
    \ Larger outreach (survey) efforts across the United States \nwill validate results\
    \ from our intensive economic analysis of the commercial operations in \nthe study.\
    \ Some early WSN deployment strategies and results from the project are \nillustrated\
    \ later in this chapter. Further project information, results and learning modules\
    \ \nare available from our interactive website at http://www.smart-farms.net.\
    \  \n3.4 Sensor network deployment issues and strategies \n3.4.1 Spatial and temporal\
    \ variability \nUnderstanding spatial and temporal variability of environmental\
    \ data is one of the most \nimportant aspects of deploying WSNs in any real-world\
    \ application, since these dynamics \nnot only determine the appropriate position\
    \ of a sensor, but the precision of the sensor data \nis of course greatly affected\
    \ by the immediate environment and the forces acting on that \nenvironment. This\
    \ is the realm of environmental biophysics (Campbell and Norman, 1998; \nJones,\
    \ 1992) and environmental plant physiology (Nobel, 2009) which forms the basis\
    \ of our \nefforts to sense and model the environment.  \nwww.intechopen.com\n\
    \ \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n\
    \ \n248 \nFigure 2 illustrates soil moisture variability from 10HS soil moisture\
    \ sensors at two depths \n(15 and 30cm below the soil surface) in five replicate\
    \ Acer rubrum (Red maple) trees from \nMay through Sept., 2009 (Lea-Cox, unpublished\
    \ data). Sensors were calibrated to the \nspecific soil type found on this farm\
    \ (Lea-Cox, Black, Ristvey & Ross, 2008).  \n \nFig. 2. Soil moisture dynamics\
    \ at 15cm and 30cm depths in the root zone of five replicate \nAcer rubrum trees\
    \ from May through September, 2009. Stacked data from two nodes is \ngraphically\
    \ displayed using an earlier version of DataTrac (v. 2.78, Decagon Devices). \n\
    As can be seen, 15cm data were more variable throughout the entire season (Fig.\
    \ 2). Trees \nwere irrigated for 1-2 hours with drip irrigation on a daily basis\
    \ throughout most of the \nstudy (Lea-Cox, Black, Ristvey & Ross, 2008), except\
    \ after major rainfall events restored the \nsoil water contents above 0.25 m3\
    \ • m-3 (Fig. 2). Changes in daily water content (tree uptake) \nare evident immediately\
    \ after these rainfall events, particularly in the 15cm dynamics. Soil \nmoisture\
    \ dynamics at the 30cm depth were much less variable between trees at all times\
    \ \nduring the season, and soil moisture at this depth did not fall below 0.20\
    \ m3 • m-3 during this \nyear, despite relatively low rainfall totals during the\
    \ summer (data not shown).  \nFigure 3 shows similar soil moisture data from 10HS\
    \ sensors at 15cm depth from Cornus \nflorida trees, but these trees were grown\
    \ in a pine bark soilless substrate in 56-liter containers \nin a container-nursery\
    \ operation. Firstly, note that the average substrate moisture is around \n0.5\
    \ m3 • m-3, since this organic substrate has a high water-holding capacity and\
    \ also because \nthis grower typically irrigates 2-3 times per day, with small\
    \ low-volume microsprinkler \nevents (1.5L in 6 minutes) during summer months.\
    \  \nNote also how quickly substrate moisture decreases with plant uptake when\
    \ morning and \nearly afternoon irrigation events are skipped, due to the relatively\
    \ low amounts of total \nwater in the container (Fig. 3). Note also that real-time\
    \ irrigation applications per tree are \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n249 \neasily measured\
    \ using a small tipping rain gauge with a rain cover, with an additional \nmicrosprinkler\
    \ head inserted under the cover (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b). The volumes displayed\
    \ \n(Fig. 3) give the grower instantaneous feedback and tie soil moisture contents\
    \ directly to \nirrigation events and the volumes applied. We are using the same\
    \ tipping rain gauges to \ngive leaching volumes from pot-in-pot containers with\
    \ an underground drainage system, to \nprovide approximate daily irrigation water\
    \ budgets (i.e. Irrigation + Rainfall - Leaching = \nδVWC ≈ ET) for additional\
    \ indicator species on the farm (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b).  \n \nFig. 3. Typical\
    \ container moisture dynamics before and after irrigation events in four Cornus\
    \ \nflorida trees. Data is graphically displayed using the most recent version\
    \ of DataTrac (v. 3.2).  \n3.4.2 Sensor placement  \nChanges in substrate VWC\
    \ due to daily water use of a crop can be used to control irrigation \nevents,\
    \ but placement of sensors is very important in container production, because\
    \ of the \nnon-uniform distribution of water within a soilless substrate and container.\
    \ van Iersel et al. \n(2011) illustrated this point, by calculating the rate of\
    \ change in substrate VWC. They noted \nthat the maximum rate of decrease in VWC\
    \ occurred at the bottom of the container in a \ngreenhouse study and closely\
    \ followed changes in solar radiation, suggesting that changes \nin VWC were driven\
    \ by root water uptake from the lower part of the container. However, \nthe vertical\
    \ gradient in substrate VWC also changed over time i.e., the VWC of the bottom\
    \ \nlayer decreased much more rapidly than that of the upper layers, likely because\
    \ of the root \ndistribution within the container. Apparently, the lack of roots\
    \ in the upper part of the \nsubstrate resulted in little water uptake from that\
    \ substrate layer, and vertical water \nmovement in the container was not fast\
    \ enough to prevent the middle layers from getting \ndrier than the upper layer.\
    \ If these findings can be generalized for other container-grown \nspecies, it\
    \ would greatly increase our understanding for correct sensor placement in root\
    \ \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural\
    \ Water Management \n \n250 \nzones, simplifying placement and increasing the\
    \ precision of information for controlling \nirrigation events. However, since\
    \ root distribution is affected by irrigation method, optimal \nplacement of soil\
    \ moisture sensors for irrigation control may depend on how the crop is \nirrigated\
    \ (van Iersel et al., 2011). \nSensor placement is especially challenging for\
    \ crops grown in large containers over \nrelatively long periods of time. Barnard\
    \ et al. (2011) examined the spatial and temporal \nvariation in VWC among 10\
    \ tree species in large containers in a container nursery, and \nfound significant\
    \ differences within containers and among species. Based on their initial \nresults,\
    \ they recommended species-specific sensor deployment. For such crops, where root\
    \ \ndistribution within the container may change dramatically throughout the production\
    \ \nperiod, it may be necessary to move the soil moisture sensor as root distribution\
    \ changes, or \nit may be possible to use a soil moisture sensor that can sense\
    \ the substrate water content \nthroughout most of the container. It is therefore\
    \ likely that a hybrid sensor and crop water \nuse model approach will have greater\
    \ degree of precision for automated irrigation \nscheduling, a feature desired\
    \ by many greenhouse and container-nursery growers. \n3.4.3 Using indicator plant\
    \ species \nFor many ornamental operations, it is unlikely that we will be able\
    \ to sense the water needs \nof all crop species being grown. Many growers however\
    \ are familiar with the concept of \nusing indicator species (i.e., species that\
    \ have high and low water use, on average), which \nare used to inform irrigation\
    \ schedules for similar types of plants (Yeager et al., 2007). For \nthis reason,\
    \ we are developing crop models which include a number of these indicator \nspecies\
    \ in the decision support software. Part of this strategy is also to engage the\
    \ larger \nresearch community in the development and incorporation of additional\
    \ specific crop \nmodels (e.g. Warsaw et al., 2009) in future irrigation decision\
    \ support systems. \n3.4.4 Microclimatic data \nThe gathering and seamless integration\
    \ of real-time environmental data is integral to the \ndevelopment and implementation\
    \ of crop-specific (Bauerle et al., 2010; Kim and van Iersel, \n2011) and environmental\
    \ models (Starry, 2011). Typical microclimatic data which is \ngathered by “weather”\
    \ nodes is displayed in Fig. 4. Tools within DataTrac v.3.2 now allow \nfor the\
    \ calculation and plotting of integrated data, such as vapor pressure deficit,\
    \ daily light \nintegral and accumulated degree days, as simple derivatives of\
    \ this instantaneous data. \nApart from the integration of this data into various\
    \ crop, environmental and disease \ndevelopment models, this microclimatic data\
    \ has many other direct practical benefits for \nproducers, e .g. the use of real-time\
    \ T/RH and wind speed data for precision timing of spray \nschedules in the field.\
    \ Longer-term seasonal information for light, precipitation and \nmaximum/minimum\
    \ air and soil temperatures are very informative for growers to assess \ncrop\
    \ growth development and other production variables e.g. residual soil nutrient\
    \ values. \n3.4.5 Predictive irrigation scheduling \nThe integration of real-time\
    \ microclimatic data into crop-specific and environmental water \nuse models is\
    \ the next step in our development path; we have successfully parameterized \n\
    petunia (Kim and van Iersel, 2011), red maple (Bauerle et al., 2011b) and green\
    \ roof  \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling \n \n251 \n \nFig. 4. Weather data from a sensor node\
    \ with a typical suite of environmental sensors, \nincluding total radiation (black),\

    \ T (red) and wind speed (green). \nstormwater runoff (Starry et al, 2011) models,\
    \ and we are verifying and validating those \nmodels with  current research projects.\
    \ Our modeling and engineering teams are interfacing \nthese models with a testbed\
    \ sensorweb system (Kohanbash et al., 2011). In their paper, they \npresent a\
    \ framework for integrating physiological models into WSN for advanced irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling. They note that the ability to gather high resolution data, interpret\
    \ it, and create \nan actionable conclusion is a critical ability for a WSN. \
    \ \nKohanbash et al. (2011) outlined our irrigation scheduling programming logic\
    \ where \ngrowers create a schedule for when water needs to be applied, and then\
    \ the schedule is \ninterrupted as needed. This system provides growers with four\
    \ operating modes: (1) a \nschedule-based controller very similar to what is commonly\
    \ used in the industry. Within the \nschedule, there are two different options\
    \ to over-ride the schedule to decrease the irrigation \ntime (a) a local setpoint\
    \ controller and (b) a global controller. The schedule + local setpoint \ncontroller\
    \ enables the sensor node to make local control decisions based on sensors attached\
    \ \nto the node. The schedule + global controller allows the grower to use data\
    \ from any node in \nthe network, calculated data or model data to control the\
    \ irrigation and consequently \ndetermine if the schedule should be interrupted.\
    \ The fourth mode is a manual override \nmode that allows the grower to water\
    \ in traditional mode, for a given number of minutes. \nThis irrigation scheduling\
    \ flexibility gives a grower the ability to control how water gets \napplied to\
    \ an irrigation zone, with various user-defined parameters. The user can choose\
    \ \nbetween a mode where water will be applied slowly with small delays between\
    \ irrigation \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of\
    \ Agricultural Water Management \n \n252 \nevents to allow water to reach subsurface\
    \ sensors (micro-pulse irrigation; Lea-Cox et al., \n2009) or a mode in which\
    \ water is applied continuously for a specified period of time.  \n4. Challenges,\
    \ opportunities and conclusions \nOf course there are many areas where we need\
    \ additional research and development, to \nprovide the maximum cost benefit of\
    \ WSNs for growers. Challenges include standardizing \nWSN protocols and communication\
    \ frequencies, as they can be confusing for growers and \nresearchers alike. Nodes\
    \ operating at lower frequencies (900 MHz) typically have an \nincreased range\
    \ and can penetrate tree canopies better than higher frequency (2.4 GHz) \nnodes\
    \ with reduced packet loss. Battery-operated nodes are typical; integrating rechargeable\
    \ \ncapabilities into sensor nodes is important, especially if control capabilities\
    \ are going to \nbecome standard, since this will greatly increase power requirements.\
    \ Another challenge is \nworking with large datasets. We have to educate ourselves\
    \ as to the resolution required for \noptimum precision in each environment, keeping\
    \ the ultimate use of the data in mind.  \nThe maintenance and calibration of\
    \ sensors and equipment is an ongoing concern, particularly \nfor growers who\
    \ may be uncomfortable with the technology and equipment. We definitely see \n\
    an opportunity for paid consultants to maintain and remotely monitor WSNs for\
    \ optimum \nperformance. As part of our project, we are developing an online knowledge\
    \ center, to provide \nassistance and guidance about various aspects of WSN deployment,\
    \ sensor use, strategies and \nbest practices. We need to integrate better data\
    \ analysis tools to handle large volumes of data \nfrom sensor networks. We also\
    \ need to do a thorough user interface study on how growers \nactually use computer\
    \ interfaces and to determine what features are needed. Predictive \nmodels for\
    \ plant water use, environmental and disease management tools are rapidly being\
    \ \ndeveloped for growers, but we need to validate and verify these models for\
    \ use in different \nenvironments. Incorporation of models into WSNs for decision-making\
    \ appears to be \nrelatively easy, but there are many details which have yet to\
    \ be worked out.  \nThere are many layers to the socio-economic analysis our economic\
    \ team is performing. Of \ncourse there are many direct benefits of precision\
    \ irrigation scheduling that can be accrued \nby the grower, such as saving on\
    \ water, labor, electricity, and fertilizer costs. However, there \nare many indirect\
    \ (e.g. reduced disease incidence, fungicide costs) and societal benefits \n(reduced\
    \ nutrient runoff, groundwater consumption) that may have much larger benefits\
    \ \nover the long-term for all agricultural producers. Most importantly, we need\
    \ to quantify the \nreturn on investment that a grower could expect to achieve,\
    \ and to be able to scale those \nbenefits for small producers, along with scaling\
    \ WSN deployments. We are also interested \nin documenting perceived and real\
    \ barriers to adoption. Our socio-economic team is \nactively surveying a large\
    \ number of growers with a detailed survey, to compare the use of \nsensor technology\
    \ and irrigation decisions by early and late adopters.  \nIn conclusion, we believe\
    \ that there have been some real advances in WSNs for precision \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ in recent years. Of course many challenges still remain, but we believe \nthat\
    \ WSNs are a fast-maturing technology that will be rapidly adopted by many growers\
    \ in \nthe near future.  \n5. Acknowledgements \nWe gratefully acknowledge grant\

    • We developed a low-cost, low-tech, low-energy, open-source iot-based soil moisture
    sensor. • Both in-field and in-lab single parameter calibration methods are possible.
    • The sensor is usable as a decision-support tool for real-time irrigation monitoring.
    • Do it yourself: all the steps from design to calibration are highly reproducible.
    • Open source data is available for download. Abstract Unsustainable use of water
    resources and climate change will exacerbate the existing tensions surrounding
    resources, especially in the Mediterranean context. Despite investments in costly
    modern equipment, the performance of irrigated agriculture remains below expectations,
    notably because of the lack of available water data and the limited use of decision
    support tools. Although a variety of soil moisture sensors are available on the
    market, they are not widely used by the agricultural community because of their
    high cost and complexity. Access to information at an unprecedented level, via
    easily accessible low-cost and low-tech sensors, may be a major lever for improved
    identification of achievable gains in performance, and to guide actors toward
    efficient water management. To explore this hypothesis, an open source wireless
    soil moisture sensor, low-energy and economically and technically accessible,
    was developed. The tool was designed according to water users’ requirements and
    applied to a Tunisian irrigation scheme subject to major water use efficiency
    issues. The functioning of the wireless sensor network was tested on pilot plots
    over a growing season and compared with commercial sensors. A single parameter
    calibration can be performed in either the laboratory or the field. This low-cost
    sensor can be used for real-time irrigation monitoring and as a decision-making
    tool for water management. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Irrigation is a fundamental aspect of crop production. Summer 2022, already considered
    to be one of the driest and warmest seasons ever recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean
    basin [1], has shown how crucial it can be [2], and what is more, the Mediterranean
    region is considered as a climate change hotspot. The Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change [3] foresees the intensification of extreme hydrological events,
    notably more frequent and longer episodes of water deficit. Agricultural activities,
    largely dependent on water availability, are particularly impacted and threatened.
    Irrigation is a response to agricultural vulnerability to drought. As a result,
    irrigated land has increased in recent decades, and the increase will most probably
    continue in the future. However, pressure on water resources is already critical
    in the Mediterranean region, due not only to the high spatio-temporal variability
    of its distribution but also to increased urban and rural demand. In particular,
    agricultural water demand tends to grow with increasing potential evapotranspiration.
    These tensions have already led to water use restriction policies, user conflicts
    and water shortages [4]. In this context, it is indispensable to improve agricultural
    water management and encourage water-saving practices. Precision agriculture has
    flourished in recent decades and a wide range of monitoring tools including model-based
    control strategies, automation systems, remote sensing or in field sensing [5,6]
    have been developed to improve the performance of irrigated systems. At farm level,
    irrigation management can be supported by using soil moisture probes to improve
    irrigation scheduling and reduce the volumes applied throughout the growing season
    [7,8]. Tensiometers and capacitance sensors that provide information on soil water
    status are already available [9] but are rarely used in farming systems, particularly
    at the farm scale, and even more rarely in the Global South. The different barriers
    to the adoption of precision farming technologies are linked to the user''s socio-technical
    environment, but mostly to (i) economic rationales or (ii) the complexity of using
    these technologies, including the calibration procedures [10,11]. Recent technological
    developments such as onboard electronics and Internet of Things (IoT) offer new
    opportunities to provide alternative monitoring tools for agro-systems and resource
    management [12] that are easier for farmers to use than previous systems. For
    irrigated agriculture in particular, these technologies allow real-time monitoring
    of water flows through water sensor networks (WSN) that can be installed at the
    required spatial and temporal scale. Several studies have demonstrated the technical
    feasibility of monitoring irrigation using these types of systems with different
    telecommunication networks and sensors to monitor weather, soil and plant variables
    [[13], [14], [15]]. Some studies mentioned gains in irrigation performance in
    different agronomic contexts thanks to the use of such tools [[16], [17], [18]].
    Recently, some advances were made in the characterisation and calibration of low
    cost capacitance sensors for IoT networks [19,20]. However, to our knowledge,
    no study has yet gone beyond laboratory prototypes or experiments in controlled
    conditions, and have adapted these innovations to local agrarian contexts. The
    objective of this study was thus to fill this gap by developing a soil moisture
    sensor that is easily adoptable by water users and to share all the steps, from
    design to calibration, operation and maintenance, based on a field reality. To
    this end, we designed an open source, low-tech and low-cost tool with a single
    parameter and physically-based calibration method, tested it in real farmers’
    conditions, and assessed the potential advantages and limits of this technology.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Shaping innovation: Our overall approach We argue
    that for technological innovations to be useful for end users, the innovations
    need to be co-developed with the stakeholders thus making it possible to adapt
    the technology to the local context. A co-innovation process between researchers
    and stakeholders was established to (i) chose the variable to monitor; (ii) build
    the sensor and (iii)evaluate its use. This was done through a loop back procedure
    described in Vandôme et al. [21]. After diagnosing the agrarian context, local
    water management issues and stakeholder needs, a sensor prototype was submitted
    to water users through a demonstration workshop. The feedback provided by the
    workshop participants enabled the production of a second version of the prototype
    that was better suited to local needs and constraints. The creation of an area
    for the design, maintenance and sharing between the actors of the co-innovation
    process – hereafter called Fab Lab – allowed the innovation to continually evolve
    based on the users’ feedback throughout the process. 2.2. Study site and water
    user requirements The Echraf public irrigation scheme is located in the Haouaria
    agricultural plain, at the northern tip of the Cap Bon peninsula in Tunisia (36°59′33.529″N,
    11°2′28.309″E). Drip irrigation of market gardening crops grown on sandy and draining
    soils has resulted in several problems. The reduced soil water holding capacity
    (around 4%) makes irrigation management complex: on the one hand the permanent
    wilting point (PWP) is quickly reached due to rapid drying of the soil; while
    on the other hand, the root profile is quickly saturated during an irrigation
    event, leading to percolation losses. In these conditions, optimal irrigation
    would theoretically involve regular application of low water volumes. In practice,
    this strategy is difficult to achieve for the farmers, due to (i) lack of information
    concerning the water resource (volumes applied, discharge rates, soil moisture,
    surface area irrigated), (ii) the variable flow rates of water supplied by the
    collective network, (iii) poor uniformity of application due to ageing or low
    quality irrigation equipment, and (iv) the recent emergence of drip irrigation
    technology in the region, which has not been combined with any training for water
    users. In the first stages of the co-innovation process, the stakeholders and
    the researchers agreed that, to solve these problems, a soil moisture sensor –
    hereafter termed Pilowtech – should be used in the field to assess crop water
    availability. To further develop this idea, a Fab Lab was set up in the Water
    Users Association (WUA) building where exchanges with farmers led to a set of
    specifications (Table 1) that were then used to design prototype soil moisture
    sensors. The Fab Lab was also used for the production and repair of the sensors.
    In parallel, three pilot farmers volunteered to host tests of the sensors in real
    conditions in three irrigated potato plots throughout the whole crop cycle. Table

    stated needs, we built a network of wireless, low-cost, low-tech, low-power and
    open-source soil moisture sensors. The overall architecture of the network of
    sensors is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (283KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flowchart of the water sensor network. 2.3.1.
    Hardware components The Pilowtech sensor is composed of a soil moisture probe,
    a data acquisition module and a power supply. The capacitance soil moisture sensor
    – model EK1940 v1.2 – was chosen for its resistance to corrosion, its low cost
    and availability. In addition, it operates over a voltage range of 3.3 V to 5
    V, making it compatible with low-power microcontrollers. The data acquisition
    module includes a microcontroller, a communication microchip and small electronics
    (wires, resistors, breadboard). The microcontroller chosen was the Arduino Pro-Mini,
    with a 3.3 V voltage and a frequency of 8 MHz. In addition to the advantages of
    Arduino systems (widely used, easy to use and open-source), thanks to its small
    size, the Pro-Mini is easy to embed and is one of the cheapest controllers on
    the market. It is also compatible with the LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network)
    communication protocol. The LoRa SX1276 communication module makes it possible
    to send and receive data via the LoRA radio network. The whole device is powered
    by a rechargeable Li-ion 18,650 battery (3.7 V and 3500 mAh). To allow onsite
    and instantaneous data reading, a reader was further developed based on an Arduino
    Uno board and a liquid crystal display (LCD) shield. The system is powered by
    a rechargeable Li-ion power bank with a 3.7 V output. To avoid damage caused by
    humidity, the probes were assembled at the end of PVC pipes (Ø40). Silicone was
    used to guarantee a tight sealing at the junction of the probe/pipe and the heat-shrink
    tubing at the wire junctions. The case of the acquisition module was printed using
    a 3D printer. The 3D printing file is available in the research data section at
    the end of this article. 2.3.2. Wireless communication network IoT technologies
    allow wireless communication of data generated by devices via different types
    of networks. The LoRaWAN communication protocol allows data transmission at low
    data rates (0.3–50 kb/s) and over long ranges (≤ 30 km). Compared to other available
    networks, the LoRa network stands out for its low energy consumption [22]. The
    LoRaWAN protocol thus met both our objectives and technological development conditions
    (sparse plots, no need for heavy data packets) and had also been tested in previous
    studies [23]. A private LoRa network was set up in the irrigation scheme. Likely
    due to the topography, two gateways were needed to cover the area that included
    the three experimental plots. The Things Network gateway, which, according to
    the manufacturer, has a range of about 10 km, was installed near the Fab Lab.
    The Things Indoor gateway, which has a shorter range but costs less, was installed
    between two pilot plots in the eastern part of the irrigation scheme. 4G+ airboxes
    were used to provide the Wi-Fi required for the gateways internet connection.
    2.3.3. Software and data workflow The microcontroller was programmed in C/C++
    language using the open source Arduino software (IDE) 1.8.19. The program was
    uploaded from the computer to the Arduino Pro-mini using a FTDI wire. To minimize
    energy consumption, the program code was written to maintain the sensor in sleeping
    mode (low µA consumption). The system woke up at 5-minute intervals to collect
    the analog signal produced by the probe, to convert it into digital data and send
    it through the LoRa network. Theoretically, this optimization enables the sensor
    to be energy autonomous throughout the irrigation season. The Arduino program
    is also available in the research data section. The data produced transited locally
    through the gateway via the LoRa network and was then routed online to the free
    server “The Things Network Cloud (Europe 1)” [24]. Within this server, the gateway
    was declared on the cloud and an application gathering sensor (device) IDs was
    generated. This server allowed real time data reading online but not storage or
    data processing. The free and open-source flow-based programming tool Node-RED
    [25], was thus used to gather the data from this online server and store it on
    a local server via an InfluxDB database [26]. The Node-RED flow is also available
    in the research data section. 2.3.4. User access to data Three different types
    of user access to data were provided through multiple channels to serve end-users
    with different technology literacy levels: (i) an online platform with access
    to data time series; (ii) a mobile phone messaging alert system; and (iii) an
    onsite data reader (Fig. 1). The online data reading is done using Grafana software
    [27], a free open-source data visualization and processing platform. A dashboard
    was produced to visualize data from each pilot farm. The dashboard comprised time
    series graphics for each soil moisture sensor (specified by its location and depth)
    and a map showing the location of the sensors. Data could be combined for visualization
    at different levels (plot, farm, irrigation scheme – the highest level being defined
    by the network). In parallel, Grafana enabled the development of a messaging alert
    system using the Telegram smartphone application and Telegram bots. The alert
    system was set to send a message to the end-user each time the soil water content
    (i) dropped below a threshold value (permanent wilting point), corresponding to
    a certain level of crop water-induced stress; or (ii) reached field capacity,
    in order to stop irrigation. The onsite data reader was designed for instantaneous
    visualization. The farmer has to physically plug the onsite reader into the sensor
    to get an instant display on the LCD screen. The reader can be programmed to display
    the volumetric soil moisture content, or the% refill level of total available
    soil moisture. Both Arduino programs are available in the research data section.
    In all cases, it is necessary to provide the user with data that can be easily
    used and guide their decision-making. The data emitted by the sensors and stored
    on the server are raw data, proportional to the output voltage of the capacitance
    probe. It is therefore necessary to define the relationship between soil moisture
    and raw values, before processing the data using visualization tools. 2.4. Calibration
    of the capacitance probe The capacitance probe operates according to the following
    principle: electric current flows through a coplanar concentric capacitor, which
    is the part inserted into the soil. The capacity is proportional to the relative
    dielectric permittivity of the medium, which itself depends on the soil moisture
    content. The output voltage (0–5 V) is converted into a digital value (10 bits)
    by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. Two calibration
    protocols based on the gravimetric method are proposed to determine the relationship
    between the output voltage and soil moisture. 2.4.1. Calibration in the laboratory
    Laboratory experiments allowed us to determine the relationship between the output
    values of the sensor (ϵ) and the volumetric soil moisture (θv,% volume). The gravimetric
    method was used. Three soil samples (S1, S2, S3) were collected from the 0–30
    cm horizon in three separate plots in the irrigation scheme. In parallel, bulk
    density was measured in each plot using the cylinder method. Samples were first
    dried in a heating chamber at 105 °C for 24 h and then left to cool at room temperature
    (20 °C). The dry soil samples were then used to fill a beaker of known volume
    (150 mL) while making sure the field bulk density was maintained by weighting
    the beaker. The volumetric humidity (θv) could therefore be defined by Eq. (1):
    (1) where θv is the volumetric soil moisture content (%), Vw the water volume,
    Vs the dry soil volume. To determine the relationship, the probe was inserted
    along the entire length of the capacitance device (approximately 6 cm), guaranteeing
    good contact between the soil and the probe. A small volume of water (1.5 mL corresponding
    to an increment of 1% of soil volumetric moisture) was repeatedly added to the
    sample. At each addition, the soil was mixed to guarantee isotropy, left to rest
    for 15 min and then restored to bulk density. The operation was repeated until
    the digital value reached a plateau, corresponding to soil water saturation. The
    digital value of the sensor, ϵ, acquired with the onsite reader, was recorded
    for each known sample volumetric humidity value, θv, in order to establish their
    correspondence. 2.4.2. Field calibration The purpose of field calibration was
    to provide a simple method to locally parametrize the soil moisture sensor without
    the need for sophisticated equipment. A soil sample was collected from each of
    the three pilot plots (samples P1, P2 and P3). The protocol was the same as that
    used in the laboratory with the following adaptations. First, the samples were
    dried in the sun on the roof for two days, followed by 3 h in an oven at 100 °C.
    To check the soil was dry, the sample was weighed on a kitchen scale (precision
    ±1 g), then put back in the oven and weighed again. If the mass of soil was unchanged,
    the soil was considered to be dry. Second, to limit the uncertainty caused by
    the use of a simple kitchen scale, a large mass of soil was used and the sample
    was only weighed at initialization. Bulk density could not be measured in field
    conditions. Consequently, a standard sandy bulk density was defined for the soil
    samples (1.5 kg of dry soil for 1 L in a graduated bucket), for which the θv-ϵ
    relationship was established. Water was progressively added using a 10 mL measuring
    glass (i.e. an increment of 1% θv). Readings were made with the sensor in the
    same conditions as those used for the laboratory calibration. Three replicates
    were made for each soil sample using three different probes in order to study
    the potential variability linked to the capacitance probe and its impact on the
    calibration. 2.4.3. Properties of the soil samples Soil samples from the pilot
    plots were analyzed in the laboratory. Table 2 lists the main soil properties.
    Despite slight local heterogeneities, the soils had most properties in common.
    They are sandy soils (≥ 90%) with low organic matter content (≤ 1%). Water storage
    capacity is low, with permanent wilting points ranging from θv 5% to 7% and field
    capacity ranging from 9% to 11%. Bulk density is about 1.6 g/cm3. Table 2. Soil

    Soil moisture measurements make it possible to understand different physical processes
    such as filling of the total available soil moisture, deep percolation, or surface
    evaporation. The choice of the location and depth of the sensor depends on the
    properties of the type of soil and the processes to be monitored, as well as the
    characteristics of the cropping system. In our study site with a drip-irrigated
    potato crop, the objectives were twofold: to ensure crop water comfort and to
    limit deep percolation. To this end, soil moisture was measured at two depths:
    (i) at a depth of 30 cm, at a distance of 15 cm from the drip line, and (ii) at
    a depth of 60 cm, directly under the drip line. These measurements provided information
    on the structure of the water bulb. On the one hand, we considered that “correct”
    soil moisture at the two locations satisfies crop water comfort and on the other
    hand, that high soil moisture content at a depth of 60 cm – the maximum effective
    rooting depth – leads to deep percolation. Field monitoring lasted from March
    5 to June 15, 2022. Three plots were instrumented with two to three Pilowtech
    sensors each, corresponding to approximately one sensor/0.1 ha. To evaluate the
    quality of the sensors by comparing the data, plots P1 and P2 were equipped with,
    respectively, a commercial capacitance-based sensor (Drill and Drop manufactured
    by Sentek Technologies, “SAND” factory default setting) and a tensiometer (Watermark
    manufactured by Irrometer). Measurement depths and positions with respect to the
    drip line were the same as with the Pilowtech sensors. Time series produced by
    the commercial capacitance sensor were post-calibrated with respect to the average
    of the series produced by the Pilowtech (coefficient of 0.621) in order to adapt
    the measurement of the commercial probe to the local soil type and to allow comparison
    of the data. Installation of the Pilowtech in the field required the use of a
    graduated auger and a fence post to attach the acquisition module. The capacitance
    probe was inserted vertically into the soil after moistening the substrate to
    guarantee a good contact between the soil and the probe. 3. Results 3.1. Design
    of the Pilowtech, a decision-support tool for irrigation management 3.1.1. Hardware
    The hardware design of the soil moisture sensor is easy and quick to make (about
    30min.). The electrical assembly was simplified in order to be as reproducible
    as possible (Fig. 2). The sensor was configured with two analog inputs for two
    capacitance probes, thus allowing soil moisture to be measured at two depths at
    each location. Access to the plug for on-site reading was by means of a screw
    cap at the above-ground extremity of the PVC tube. Download : Download high-res

    the Pilowtech sensor. The numbers refer to Table 4. 3.1.2. Results of calibration
    The results of the laboratory calibration are presented in Fig. 3. The digital
    values returned by the sensor in air and in water were ϵa = 437 and ϵw = 202,
    respectively. The sensor displayed a digital value of ϵs = 434 in the presence
    of dry soil (θv = 0%). The curve decreased, reflecting the inverse relationship
    between moisture content and output voltage: the wetter the soil, the lower the
    output voltage, and therefore the lower the digital value returned. The distribution
    of the data shows a linear trend at low soil moisture content and then an increase
    in the slope above a threshold (around 6% moisture content) suggesting the existence
    of a vertical asymptote. This type of behavior can be described by an exponential
    relationship between ϵ and θ. From these results, we constructed the following
    empirical equation: (2) where k is a parameter depending on soil properties, ϵs,
    ϵw and ϵa are respectively, the sensor output variable, the sensor constant value
    in water and the sensor constant value in the air. Therefore, the expression of
    volumetric soil moisture can be modeled as a function of the output voltage variable
    and three parameters depending on the soil type (k) and the probe used (ϵw, ϵa).
    This model appears well fitted (R2 = 0.972) with respect to the data obtained
    from the laboratory calibration (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (265KB)

    the field calibration performed on the soils of the pilot plots are shown in Fig.
    4. For each of the three soil samples (P1, P2, P3), the calibration is made using
    three different sensors (A, B, C). The results were used to parametrize Eq. (2),
    and the corresponding curves (models) were compared with the experimental data.
    The soil parameter k was determined by searching for an optimal match between
    the gravimetric and simulated soil moisture and minimisation of the error. Table
    3 summarizes the parameters obtained. The results showed that the model based
    on Eq. (2) satisfactorily fitted the data obtained using the gravimetric method
    for all three soils (0.875 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.983). The parameters related to the capacitance
    probe ranged between 182 and 198 for ϵw and between 430 and 479 for ϵa. The soil
    parameters obtained with the same soil sample varied little with respect to their
    mean (3% ≤ cv ≤ 4%). However, parameter k varied more between the different soil
    samples (6% ≤ cv ≤ 10%), parameter k is thus more sensitive to soil characteristics.

    farmer connected to the WSN has access to a personal space on the online platform.
    The data produced by the sensors are gathered for each farm and can be displayed
    according to the desired location, date and depth. The calibration results allow
    the raw data to be displayed in the form of volumetric soil moisture (Fig. 5).
    Time series are available for consultation (historical and real time) and can
    be downloaded in different formats. In the field, the data can be accessed manually
    using the onsite reader. When visiting the plots, by unscrewing the top of the
    protective PVC tube at the desired location and depth, the farmer can simply plug
    in (Fig. 6a). After several trials, the farmers indicated the most practical visualization
    is the one that displays the filling percentage of the total available soil moisture
    (FP = ). This percentage is visualized by means of a progress bar (Fig. 6b). Download

    3.2. On field data evaluation: comparison with commercial water sensors The data
    series produced by the Pilowtech sensors were compared with series produced by
    commercial sensors at two locations. 3.2.1. Ability for monitoring relative soil
    water status The data obtained for plot P2 were compared with the tension measurement
    produced by a commercial tensiometer probe (Watermark) at the same location and
    depths (30 and 60 cm) as the Pilowtech (Fig. 7). Monitoring continued from March
    8 to June 13, 2022, i.e. shortly after planting until the potatoes were harvested.
    The tensiometers were installed on March 25, before the start of the irrigation
    season. Irrigation was regular (frequency of around 3 days) during the development
    stage (April). Irrigation events were less frequent from the midseason until harvest
    (from May to June). The time step for data generation is 4 h for the tensiometer
    and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Irrigation events are clearly identifiable
    from the peak moisture contents measured by the Pilowtech, and from the drops
    in tension measured by the tensiometer. At a depth of 30 cm, tension varied between
    0 and 50 kPa. The volumetric soil moisture measured globally varied between the
    permanent wilting point (  = 5.83% at pF = 4.2) and field capacity (  = 9.41%
    at pF = 2.5). At a depth of 60 cm, the range of soil moisture was slightly higher
    (between 8% and 13%) and the range of tension was lower (between 2 and 15 kPa).
    At both depths, the data produced by the commercial tensiometer and the Pilowtech
    sensor were highly correlated. In the shallow soil layer, the probes are more
    sensitive to water inputs. Their variations make it possible to monitor the entire
    irrigation schedule, and to distinguish between the hydration and drying phases
    of the soil. Close to the maximum rooting depth, the response of both probes was
    less sensitive to drip irrigation inputs. Minor non-percolating irrigation events
    were less or not detected. However, analysis of moisture peaks showed that both
    probes reacted to irrigation events on the same dates. The sensor thus has the
    ability to monitor relative changes in soil moisture. Download : Download high-res

    status in plot “P2”: comparison between the Pilowtech (red curves) and a commercial
    tensiometer sensor (gray curves). The Pilowtech data gap from May 20 to May 23
    was due to a power failure, independently from our system. 3.2.2. Ability for
    absolute soil moisture monitoring In plot P1, the measurements made with a commercial
    capacitance sensor and the Pilowtech (30 and 60 cm) from April 4 to May 3 were
    compared (Fig. 8). The data generation time step of the commercial sensor is 1
    h, and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Comparison of the soil moisture content
    characteristics measured in the plot “P1” (  = 7.00% at pF = 4.2 and  = 10.71%
    at pF = 2.5) showed that the range of moisture content measured by the commercial
    probe and by Pilowtech was globally bounded by the permanent wilting point and
    field capacity. We also compared the potential of detection of irrigation peaks,
    corresponding to local maximum soil water moisture content. Results revealed an
    excellent temporal match, confirming that irrigation events were accurately detected
    by both sensors. The ability of the Pilowtech to measure the intensity of irrigation
    events was further analyzed by comparing the magnitude of changes in soil moisture
    recorded by both probes during the first month of monitoring (Fig. 9). Download

    soil moisture content in plot “P1”: comparison of the magnitude of changes in
    soil moisture recorded by the Pilowtech and a commercial capacitance sensor. The
    magnitude of an event was calculated as the difference between the maximum peak
    moisture measured following an irrigation event and the minimum moisture value
    preceding the same irrigation event. The results showed a good correlation between
    the magnitudes recorded by the two probes for low and medium intensity events
    (∆ < 4%). On the other hand, the gap between measurements by the two probes was
    larger in the case of more intense, higher magnitude events (∆ > 4%). Under these
    conditions, the Pilowtech sensor gave higher amplitudes than those measured by
    the commercial probe. This difference could be explained by the different sampling
    intervals used in sandy soils with high hydraulic conductivity. These behavioral
    variations could also be the result of drift trends the experimental data did
    not allow us to characterise. 3.3. Provisioning and maintenance 3.3.1. A low tech
    sensor with reasonable maintenance requirements The system was designed to be
    low power and to enable several months’ autonomy with a 3.7 V battery. The main
    maintenance tasks during the season were: (i) battery management; (ii) network
    troubleshooting; (iii) hardware maintenance. At the end of the 102-day monitoring
    period, one sensor out of the eight installed needed its battery recharging. The
    first assumption made in the event of a gap in the data time series is that the
    battery is empty. After checking the voltage, the second hypothesis is a network
    failure. A few occasional network interruptions required maintenance tasks over
    the course of the season, the origins of which were identified as follows: power
    supply failure at the gateway or an interruption in Wi-Fi coverage at the gateway
    location. Finally, once the network and the power supply have been checked, a
    gap or an anomaly in the data time series may be due to hardware failure. The
    connectors in the acquisition module and at the junction with the probes should
    then be checked. Direct reading in the field may be necessary to check the quality
    of the data provided by the probe. Out of the 16 probes installed (2 per sensor),
    25% of the probes showed occasional anomalies that required a technical intervention.
    In these situations, the probes produced unstable and inconsistent data in the
    data series that were easy to identify. As these events occurred following irrigation
    events, we assume they were due to faulty seals resulting in leakage into the
    probe''s electronic circuits. In this case, technical maintenance consists in
    removing the damaged probe, and drying or replacing it, and making sure it is
    watertight. The resulting anomalies in soil moisture data time series can also
    be easily cleaned. 3.4. A low-cost sensor with adjustable costs Table 4 summarizes
    the costs required to design a low tech soil moisture sensor. The cost of production
    is adjustable depending on requirements. The components needed for the sensor
    itself cost less than 10€ with an onsite reading system only, less than 15€ for
    a wireless sensor, and a total of slightly more than 20€ for the sensor with a
    double data reading mode. For the wireless solution, setting up a LoRa network
    requires a gateway (costing between 50€ and 300€) and an Internet connection.
    However, this investment is sufficient to network an unlimited number of sensors,
    which allows the costs to be amortized or shared between users. The low cost hardware
    and free software of the Pilowtech thus make the sensor highly affordable. Table

    probes become accessible to any water user? We developed a soil moisture sensor
    based on the specifications and feedback provided by the water users of an irrigation
    scheme. The sensor we developed is (i) low tech, meaning easy to make, maintain
    and reproduce; (ii) low cost, so small farming systems can afford it; (iii) low
    power, and consequently relatively self-sufficient and sustainable over time;
    (iv) meeting farmers’ expectations for monitoring water status in the root zone.
    The data can be accessed in two ways: remotely via an online interface, or in
    the field through direct reading. Calibration is feasible both in the laboratory
    and in the field. The sensor rating curve (Eq. (2)) is given by only one parameter,
    k, characteristic of the soil. This rating equation provides a reliable prediction
    of volumetric soil moisture once it has been parameterized. The sensor allows
    soil moisture to be monitored at two depths and can be used as a decision support
    tool for irrigation scheduling. Comparison with commercial probes highlighted
    the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor for irrigation scheduling and for
    monitoring relative soil moisture. The low recording frequency of the commercial
    tensiometer, capillary hysteresis processes and the low water holding capacities
    of the soils prevented accurate plotting of sandy soil retention curves [28].
    To go further, a laboratory experiment conditions would allow comparison of the
    Pilowtech sensor results with the predictions of the Van Genuchten function for
    a sandy soil [29]. The measurement of absolute soil moisture was satisfactory
    compared with that of the commercial capacitance probe, but the measurement may
    be subject to slight deviation over time. A metrological study, specific to the
    monitoring of the deviation by multiplying the controls and measuring battery
    discharge rates, should enable conclusions to be drawn concerning these effects.
    At the level of the farm or of the irrigation scheme, the number of sensors could
    be multiplied to create a wireless sensor network based on the LoRaWAN protocol.
    The data produced in real-time can be used by different types of stakeholders:
    (i) by farmers as a decision-support tool at the field and farm levels; (ii) by
    irrigation scheme managers and agricultural advisors to assess water requirements
    and advise water users; (iii) by researchers, for whom the production of these
    data will help assess performance gaps, compare practices and feed model scenarios.
    Recent advances in on-board electronics and IoT therefore appear promising for
    the agricultural sector and particularly for water management, to the extent that
    they led to the development of both economically and technically accessible measurement
    tools. The plasticity of these systems is particularly interesting because it
    makes the tool adaptable to the agrarian context: for instance, we were able to
    adapt the data reading system to the users. Moreover, the open source nature of
    the system transforms the traditionally “black box” sensor into a tool that can
    be fully programmed by the user. Thus the user can calibrate the Pilowtech according
    to the characteristics of his/her field, which makes it better suited and therefore
    more reliable than a default pre-calibrated probe. On the other hand, it is important
    to stress that these advantages are not necessarily considered as such by every
    farmer. Indeed, the “do it yourself” approach may be seen as a limitation as it
    requires time to get used to it, more regular maintenance, and a certain level
    of agronomic expertise. These limitations can be overcome by supporting users,
    notably through training or by providing technical support. The scale of the irrigation
    scheme, and user collectives such as water users associations, appear to be a
    suitable environment to host a Fab lab, making it possible to pool maintenance
    interventions and the expenses involved in running wireless sensor networks. The
    Fab Lab also appears as a valuable environment for user training, notably regarding
    the calibration process, which although not requiring any special equipment, may
    nevertheless demand some ability. Another alternative could be for further studies
    to produce tables associating parameter values with major soil types. Currently,
    the use of these technologies is facilitated by the growing importance of the
    community involved in this domain, the multiplication of suppliers worldwide,
    and the trend towards simplification of components and reduction of their costs.
    However, component costs still depend on the market, and are consequently sensitive
    to fluctuations (the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, led to a worldwide shortage
    of electronic chips). Hence, the equipment used in the present study will inevitably
    evolve with technical advances and market changes, which is not a problem as long
    as the equipment remains highly affordable and available from local suppliers.
    In any case, the Pilowtech sensor was designed as an evolving tool, necessarily
    subject to change through re-design and ”bricolage”, as signs of its re-appropriation
    by users [30]. Future studies should focus on the multi-criteria (agronomic, environmental,
    hydraulic, socioeconomic) impacts of the adoption of such tools for irrigated
    agriculture, including paying attention to potential side effects [31,32]. Some
    work remains to be done before massive use of this type of technology is achieved,
    and particular attention will have to be paid to the mechanisms of adoption and
    the means to promote the dissemination of the innovation among farmers and water
    users. After all, there is nothing to prevent the adjustment of this sensor to
    a variety of contexts, for irrigation management of diverse cropping systems or
    for environmental monitoring, at the same time bearing in mind that “not everything
    that can be counted actually counts”. 5. Conclusion The use of new technologies
    for agriculture does not necessarily need to be expensive, complex and energy
    intensive. We designed a low-cost, open source, low-tech and low-energy soil moisture
    sensor for monitoring crop irrigation. The calibration method implemented is simple,
    based on only one parameter, and allows real time monitoring of the fulfillment
    of the water requirements of an irrigated crop, in the present case, potato. The
    irrigation schedule can therefore be adjusted accordingly. Comparison of our low-cost
    sensor with commercial probes in field conditions over a whole irrigation season
    underlined the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor. The sensor can be used
    as a decision-support tool for real-time water management. At the scale of an
    irrigation scheme, the skills and costs of the equipment required to build a wireless
    sensor network could be shared between users. Soil moisture probes are known as
    a driver to achieve water savings, and this study provides a way to make them
    accessible, although they require more regular maintenance than existing commercial
    ready-to-use solutions. We believe that this study contributes to the democratization
    of the use of new technologies in agriculture and provides keys to facilitating
    their adoption, in both the North and the global South. Future work should focus
    on assessing the impacts of the adoption of such innovation, and its adaptation
    to different contexts. Research data All the software required for the design

    Abstract Our planet is facing a serious fresh water crisis and improved management
    of water resources presents significant research challenges. About 70% of the
    world''s fresh water is consumed by agriculture and water application efficiencies
    are typically low. Improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture would
    deliver substantial economic and environmental benefits. To help address the issue
    of low water application efficiency, wireless sensor network technologies can
    be combined with automation to support the efficient production of food in a increasingly
    water limited future. This paper reports on results of combining these approaches
    to irrigate an apple orchard, where existing irrigation scheduling was predominately
    based on time consuming manual acquisition of soil moisture data. The system developed
    allowed fully automated on-farm irrigation based on real-time feedback control
    which increased economic water use efficiency by 73% compared with manual irrigation.
    It is suggested that the application of real-time feedback automation would dramatically
    improve economic efficiency for irrigators with low water efficiency. Whereas,
    for those irrigators already achieving high water efficiency, adoption of the
    technology provides substantial labour and time savings. Previous article in issue

    \ techniques characterized by optimal \nmanagement and best collaboration of various\
    \ irrigation factors, attracts great attention and obtains wide employments in\
    \ \ndifferent irrigation conditions or cultivation processes.  Moreover, it becomes\
    \ well-established in major areas of agricultural \nresearches and across the\
    \ broad spectrum of agricultural techniques especially in specific sectors of\
    \ scientific frontiers, \nincluding soil quality, irrigation scheduling, water\
    \ resource distribution, crop productivity, tillage management, climate \nadaptation,\
    \ and environment monitoring, etc.  This paper reviews the research developments\
    \ and integrated applications of \nprecision irrigation in typical domains of\
    \ mechanism and performance, covering key aspects such as process optimization,\
    \ \nschedule modelling, and effectiveness evaluation, indicating that advanced\
    \ irrigation optimization methods support higher \nproductivity of crop field\
    \ and better environmental conditions of soil;  Current schedule modelling techniques\
    \ provide a set of \ninstructive demonstrations and heuristic descriptions for\
    \ the working principles of precision irrigation and the quantitative \nassessments\
    \ of irrigation productivity;  The novel investigation on effectiveness evaluation\

    \ to achieve the optimized irrigation qualities for water balance condition, soil\
    \ water \nredistribution, and soil moisture uniformity so that the effectiveness\
    \ quality of irrigation infiltration could be improved \nremarkably.  It is concluded\
    \ that precision irrigation owns an outstanding collaborating capability and possesses\
    \ much better \nworking advancement in typical calibration indexes of cultivation\

    introduce precision irrigation techniques to ensure the sustainable \nusage of\
    \ water/soil resource and feed the enormous population all \naround the world[4].\
    \  In this paper precision irrigation is defined as \nthe high-efficient and appropriate\
    \ employment of water and soil \nresources to acquire the optimum growth result\
    \ of crop plants and \nreduce adverse environmental impacts, it is a collaborative\
    \ \nmechanism that controls the land productivity, maximizes the \nrevenue and\
    \ minimizes the conditional impact on surroundings by \nautomating \nthe \ncomplete\
    \ \nirrigation \nperformances[5,6].  \nSimultaneously, as a unique irrigation\
    \ operation, it also involves \nthe optimal management and best coordination of\
    \ all participant \nfactors of the agricultural irrigation process.  This technique\
    \ could \nbe applicable to all operational irrigation methods such as precise\
    \ \ndrip irrigation, subsurface deficit irrigation, and adaptively \nalternate\
    \ irrigation, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.  \nPrecision irrigation\
    \ comprises a wide range of irrigation systems, \nboth at on-farm plot, or scheme\
    \ levels, corresponding to very \ndifferent agricultural requirements and cultivation\
    \ monitoring \nreality[7,8].  Recently, extensive efforts have been made to survey\
    \ \nthe amount and distribution of irrigation water withdrawals[9], as \nthe soil\
    \ water storage, circulation efficiency of groundwater, \nmoisture distribution\
    \ efficiency, and moisture diffusivity, are all \nnecessary to promote the working\
    \ efficiency of precision irrigation \nremarkably.  It is also imperative to determine\
    \ the exact effect of \nsoil water redistribution for irrigation management, as\
    \ well as with \nJuly, 2021                   Liang Z W, et al.  Review of conceptual\

    models, \nGeographic \nInformation System (GIS)-based models, Information and\
    \ \nCommunications Technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) \nmethods, have\
    \ already been used widely in process optimization, \nschedule modelling and effectiveness\
    \ evaluation[10,11], which are \ndiscussed \nin \nthis \npaper. \n \nConsequently,\
    \ \nthe \nfunctional \nclassification of precision irrigation systems is a fundamental\
    \ initial \nstep to serve as a basis for its conceptual and systematic review,\
    \ \ncontributing to the sustainability and stability of irrigated \nagriculture\
    \ demanding high-efficient management of environmental \nresources under existing\
    \ environmental constraints[12].  \nBased on the above-mentioned introduction,\
    \ the rationale and \nsignificance of precision irrigation for agricultural production\
    \ could \nbe fully acknowledged.  In order to demonstrate the conceptual \nand\
    \ systematic progress of precision irrigation techniques, here this \npaper proposes\
    \ a constructive overview concerning its process \noptimization in Section 2;\
    \ then the representative schedule \nmodelling practices of precision irrigation\
    \ are enumerated by \nSection 3; Section 4 discusses the effectiveness evaluation\
    \ of \nprecision irrigation in details, thus its complex influence \nmechanism\
    \ in actual performances could be highlighted; Based on \nthese subsections, Section\
    \ 5 presents the future research trends of \nprecision irrigation; and Section\
    \ 6 concludes this paper eventually. \n2  Process optimization of precision irrigation\
    \  \nIn the interest of implementing persistent aggrandizement of \nprecision\
    \ irrigation effectiveness, which needs high-efficient and \nsupportive irrigation\
    \ equipment that recognizes the conditional \nequilibrium in water-saving operation\
    \ and crop productivity \nintensification[13], the process optimization of precision\
    \ irrigation \nshould be emphasized and realized by balancing the requirements\
    \ \nof condition and cost.  Effective testing and tentative simulation \nare very\
    \ important to facilitate water and energy application for \nsystem design and\
    \ irrigation supervision so that the main objectives \nof irrigation process optimization\
    \ are maximizing water application \nefficiency and distribution uniformity, minimizing\
    \ water loss and \nsoil erosion while keeping the agricultural irrigation costs\
    \ at a \nminimized scale.  \nFrom the review of recently-published literature,\
    \ it could be \nlearned that irrigation optimization should be performed during\
    \ the \ndesigning stage of the irrigation system, including irrigation setups,\
    \ \npumping systems, sprinkler nozzles, irrigation network, and \nintelligent\
    \ control platform.  Table 1 gives a progress \ndemonstration of irrigation optimization.\
    \  There are a set of \ninvestigations concerning the combination of Remote Sensing\
    \ (RS) \nand GIS for precision irrigation.  Various optimization methods \nused\
    \ for actual irrigation, including linear programming (LP), \nnon-linear programming\
    \ (NLP), dynamic programming (DP), \ngenetic algorithms (GA), and simulated annealing\
    \ (SA), have all \nbeen employed frequently for better quality and higher productivity\
    \ \nof crop cultivation.  For example, an optimization method was \npresented\
    \ to improve the water-usage efficiency in tea irrigation \nand analyze the complex\
    \ correlation between irrigation efficiency \nand farming characteristics using\
    \ the Tobit method[39].  Hintsa et \nal.[40] focused on the coefficient coordination\
    \ between crop \nirrigation requirement, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), water use\
    \ \nefficiency (WUE), and field productivity, so that their study \nencourages\
    \ the optimal implementation of precise deficit irrigation \nand reduces a remarkable\
    \ amount of irrigation water by keeping \nstable crop productivity.  A mathematical\
    \ model called Reservoirs \nOperation \nOptimization \nconsidering \nsediment\
    \ \nevacuation \n(RESOOSE) was used to optimize irrigation deficit.  Using \n\
    RESOOSE model the irrigation deficit indexes in soil field could \nbe reduced\
    \ by 16% while maintaining existing benefits[41].   \n \nTable 1  Research progresses\

    equipment for monitoring moisture infiltration \nrate of soil[36-38] \n \nNowadays,\
    \ accurate estimation of soil water balance is \nsignificant to support the availability\
    \ of water resources and \noptimal irrigation management, which makes the process\
    \ \noptimization of precision irrigation necessary.  The determination \nof soil/water\
    \ balance parameters such as precipitation rate, \nevapotranspiration ratio, soil\
    \ moisture, and the leaching behavior of \nenvironmental nutrient phosphorus were\
    \ explained and evaluated \nby the use of lysimeters[42].  Mao et al.[43] and\
    \ Zurweller et al.[3] \nrespectively derived water balance model to simulate both\
    \ \ndownward and upward soil water movement, and optimal Nitrogen \nand irrigation\
    \ management in heterogeneous unsaturated zones.  \nSince the accuracy of soil\
    \ water content and evapotranspiration \nsimulation affect crop yield simulations,\
    \ DSSAT is a useful suite of \nfield-scale, process-based crop models to simulate\
    \ crop growth and \nprocess optimization[44,45].  By comparison, HYDRUS is an\
    \ \neffective hydrological model to investigate the probable effects of \nsubsurface\
    \ drainage on soil water dynamics[46-48].  By using these \ntwo models the scheduling\
    \ procedure of hydrologic needs can be \nsimulated[49,50].  When it comes to the\
    \ utilization of DSSAT \nmodels in precise drip irrigation, DSSAT was used on\
    \ the growth \nand yield occasions of the drip-irrigated crops[2,51].  Accordingly,\
    \ \nBhunia et al.[52], Asfandyar et al.[53], and Feng et al.[54] mapped the \n\
    spatial variation of water resources for irrigation purposes, and the \nimpact\
    \ quantification of center pivot irrigation system uniformity \nas well[4], all\
    \ these endeavors facilitate the process optimization of \nadvanced irrigation\
    \ techniques greatly. \nOn the topic of adaptive process optimization, the optimum\
    \ \nabstraction of groundwater resources was estimated for sustainable \nmanagement\
    \ of precision irrigation[55].  Similarly, a novel \n22   July, 2021         \
    \                Int J Agric & Biol Eng      Open Access at https://www.ijabe.org\
    \                           Vol. 14 No. 4 \nadaptive process optimization for\
    \ the real-time monitoring of \npressurized water irrigation pipeline network\
    \ has been proposed, by \nemploying multi-objective genetic approaches[56].  This\
    \ approach \nrealizes the optimum operational sectoring to increase economic \n\
    profit and decrease consumption cost, whilst satisfies the crop \ncultivation\
    \ demand by considering the temporal balance between \nsoil water content (SWC),\
    \ soil evaporation, and infield spatial \ninfiltration variability.  A novel parameter\
    \ optimization method \nusing Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)\
    \ \nbased upon orthogonal irrigation experiment, which could be \nsuitable to\
    \ the parametric optimization of precision irrigation \nprocess[57]. \nTo summarize\
    \ the process optimization of precision irrigation, \nit could be observed that\
    \ based on these mentioned attempts and \npreparations, more advanced optimization\
    \ techniques for precision \nirrigation were targeted and investigated to obtain\
    \ higher \nagriculture yield and irrigation qualities with a minimum cost; \n\
    especially, it could also be learned that the intelligent optimization \napproaches\
    \ for precision irrigation control, the adaptive equilibrium \nin irrigation parameter\
    \ selection, and the collaborative coordination \nof influential factors for soil\
    \ moisture uniformity and agricultural \ncrop productions, need to be explored\
    \ further in future. \n3  Schedule modelling of precision irrigation \nConcerning\
    \ appropriate schedule modelling of precision \nirrigation, there exist traditional\
    \ researches paid their main \nattentions on scheduling the crop yield per unit\
    \ area, by distributing \napplicable water resource to specific ranged fields\
    \ according to \ntheir corresponding irrigation requirements in soil/water content,\
    \ \nvapor pressure deficit, and groundwater quality for irrigation use.  \nIn\
    \ the past several years, some scholars concluded that those \neffective scheduling\
    \ models characterized by optimum agreement \nbetween their modeled results and\
    \ actual observed outcomes, \ndemonstrate certain inaccuracies and uncertainties\
    \ regrettably[58].  \nIn order to deal with this problem, some recent investigations\
    \ \nacknowledged that a nonlinear system can be simulated by the \nintegration\
    \ of linear sub-systems, which has already been \nconfirmed as a reliable schedule\
    \ modelling technique for the \nauthentication of non-linear optimization systems\
    \ in precise drip \nand alternative irrigation.  Furthermore, Liang et al. have\
    \ paid \ntheir endeavor on the concentration estimation of effectiveness \ncalibration\
    \ for precision irrigation by using turbulent flow \nproperties and neural network,\
    \ thereafter a multi-dimensional fuzzy \ncorrelation computation approach applicable\
    \ for flow energy \ndistribution and clustering characteristics could be provided[59,60],\
    \ \nthus a versatile modelling algorithm for intelligent scheduling of \nprecise\
    \ drip irrigation, covering such indexes as water use \nefficiency, consumption\
    \ of transpiration, saturated hydraulic \nconductivity, and water balance condition,\
    \ could be expected.   \nOn the other side, the new era of big data and ICT make\

    \ mentioned studies contribute greatly \nto the most-developed progress that can\
    \ be employed extensively in \nthe schedule modelling conditions of precision\
    \ irrigation.  \nAlthough most of them only focused on the pure irrigation \n\
    planning and infiltration modelling processes that describe the \ngrowth stage\
    \ of irrigated crop and variation of soil characteristics, a \nmore deliberate\
    \ analysis dealing with inherent characteristics and \ncorrelative influence is\
    \ absent in the current technical development \nof precision irrigation, therefore\
    \ some difficult problems \nconcerning accurate irrigation scheduling and their\
    \ correspondingly \ninfluence \nmechanisms \nare \nstill \nunstudied \nand \n\
    unsettled, \nunfortunately. \n \nAn \nefficient \nand \naccurate \nscheduling\
    \ \nimplementation of precision irrigation will facilitate the cultivation \n\
    monitoring and effectiveness upgrading for crop growth or in-field \nproductivity;\
    \ thereafter, the instructive assessments of correlative \nimpact caused from\
    \ all participant factors of precision irrigation \nschedule modelling, for instance,\
    \ soil water content, surface runoff \nand drainage, infield infiltration rate,\
    \ and water drop penetration \ntime, need to be developed and promoted further.\
    \ \n4  Effectiveness evaluation of precision irrigation \nAs it is well known\
    \ that efficient utilization of water and soil \nresource is becoming increasingly\
    \ essential for irrigation \nprofitability improvement, so that the effectiveness\
    \ evaluation of \nprecision irrigation, especially on water use efficiency, infiltration\
    \ \nrate, moisture diffusivity, cultivation water requirement, and crop \nproductivity,\
    \ is significant and necessary to meet the higher \nrequirements of agriculture\
    \ production nowadays.  In order to \nmake research preparation for the irrigation\
    \ effectiveness \nevaluation, Henrique et al.[100] dimensioned the potential \n\
    effectiveness of drip irrigation using the calibrated Food and \nAgriculture \n\
    Organization \n- \nAgroecological \nZone \nModel \n(FAO-AZM), and paying their\
    \ high attention to the calibrated \nlevels of cultivation water supply simultaneously.\
    \  Similarly, Luo \net al.[101] investigated the quantitative impacts of water-saving\
    \ \nsprinkling on weed growth and plant spread in rice fields, and \nfound that\
    \ the novel water-saving sprinkling method they proposed \nnot only decreases\
    \ irrigation water amount greatly but also \npromotes \nwater \nproductivity \n\
    and \nirrigation \neffectiveness \nremarkably.  According to this realistic demand,\
    \ Christopher et \nal.[102] introduced an innovative effectiveness evaluation\
    \ method \nthat aims to identify predominant geochemical changes in the \ngroundwater\
    \ system, providing a reliable and accurate tool to \ndetermine infiltration opportunity\
    \ time and evaluate irrigation \neffectiveness in the subjects of moisture infiltration,\
    \ water balance \ncondition, and soil water storage.  More relevant researches\
    \ and \non-the-spot investigations on the latest achievements concerning \nthe\
    \ effectiveness evaluation and performance assessment for \nprecision irrigation\
    \ can also be referenced[103].  Some existing \ndifficult problems, such as the\
    \ effectiveness comparisons and \ncorrelative analysis between irrigation schedules,\
    \ the energy \nconsumption of irrigation network, the optimal relative proportions\
    \ \nof deep drainage and tail water, and multi-objective parametric \noptimization\
    \ subject to uncertain agriculture conditions, could be \nsolved in return[104].\

    \  Since the remarkable impacts of \nspecific irrigation approaches on plant growth\

    \  Meanwhile Smith et al.[115] \ndemonstrated the application efficiency using\

    \ \nin order to highlight the constructive impacts of crop cultivation \napproaches\
    \ and precise deficit irrigation, Safi et al.[116] implemented \northogonal irrigation\
    \ experiments concentrating on the treatments \nand evaluations of direct seeding\
    \ and precise deficit irrigation.  \nAccording to the schematic diagram plotted\
    \ by Figure 2, full \nirrigation is recommended first to achieve the highest crop\
    \ yield \nwith low transpiration rate and drainage consumption, then water \n\
    deficit during the later stage is highly recommended for irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ if the economic benefits, water equilibrium condition, \nand irrigation efficiency\
    \ be considered in the studied field region.  \n \nFigure 2  Schematic diagram\
    \ describing the network layout of experimental irrigation plot[43] \n \nAs the\
    \ complicated correlation between soil organic matter, \neffective cation exchange\
    \ capacity (ECEC), exchangeable bases, \nand hydrogen ion concentration (pH) was\
    \ defined, Adejumobi et \nal.[117] determined the effectiveness indexes of precision\
    \ irrigation \non soil quality status.  Since waste water use in precision \n\
    irrigation becomes a widely accepted operation to satisfy the \nrapid-increasing\
    \ water demands in dry areas[118], the crop yield \ncould be promoted remarkably\
    \ during the high-efficient irrigation \noperations in the beginning but reduced\
    \ in the low-efficient \nirrigation operations, as Figure 3 presents their detailed\
    \ evolution \nthroughout irrigation operation processes.  At the same time, \n\
    Warwick et al.[119] investigated the diurnal factors to quantify the \nperformance\

    \ constructive influences \nwith minimum measurement/ computation errors, thereafter\
    \ they \nfurther investigated the emerging effectiveness of precision \nirrigation\
    \ in certain conditions of shallow-rooted crop cultivation.  \nAccordingly, Mojtaba\
    \ et al.[120] and Liang et al.[121] also assessed \nthe distribution uniformity\
    \ of moisture variations in precision \nirrigation occasions when magnetic water\

    \ et al. proposed IoT framework to improve agriculture yield \nby scheduling irrigation\
    \ and fertilization effectively based on the \ncrops’ current requirements[123],\
    \ environmental conditions, and \nweather forecasts[124].  Keswani et al.[125]\

    temperature sensor, humidity sensing device, moisture sensor, \ndaylight intensity\
    \ device (light dependent resistor), to acquire \nreal-time farm information of\
    \ irrigation effectiveness through \nmulti-point measurement[9,126].  Moreover,\
    \ IoT and sensors were \nemployed to efficiently record plant data and watering\
    \ needs[127], \nthereafter the effectiveness evaluation approach was implemented\
    \ \nwith a mobile phone application interface that could be used to \ncontinuously\
    \ monitor and control the efficient watering system.  \nSince all these effectiveness\
    \ evaluation technologies have been \nintroduced to the implementation occasions\
    \ of precision irrigation, \ntheir productive influences on the irrigation quality\
    \ and relevant \nworking properties should be discussed for the interests of \n\
    effectiveness promotion. \nSince the identification and assessment of optimal\
    \ irrigation \nperformance should be studied to determine the exact \neffectiveness\
    \ level of precision irrigation, Önder et al.[112] \nintroduced a risk assessment\
    \ procedure to quantify the \nmostappropriate effectiveness indexes in the actual\
    \ irrigation \nprocess.  Based on this assessment Ge et al.[128] took \nrepresentative\
    \ irrigation treatments to learn the complicated effect \nof sprinkling time intervals\
    \ on the crop growth situation.  \nFurthermore, Table 3 demonstrates current research\
    \ progresses in \nthe effectiveness evaluation of precision irrigation.  Using\
    \ a new \ndrought index[129], a set of useful predicted soil moisture data \n\
    could be obtained from a variable infiltration capacity (VIC) \nestimation over\

    enables the improvement of soil moisture uniformity and \nacceleration efficiency\
    \ for crop cultivation? The inner structure of \nthose optimized irrigation systems\
    \ should be made generic in order \nto standardize the irrigation process and\

    \ \ndevelopment is speeding up, the numerical simulation and adaptive \ncontrol\
    \ of irrigation scheduling need to be synchronized.  Also, \nthe triggering of\
    \ schedule modeling based on the behaviour of the \nirrigation system or the adaptive\

    \ irrigation scheduling \nresponsible for the agricultural production management;\
    \ \n(3) How to define a full set of irrigation effectiveness that is \nrepresentative\

    \ To guarantee the high-efficient \nperformance of precision irrigation, effectiveness\

    \ \nthat evaluation of irrigation effectiveness is one of the most \nimportant\
    \ subjects towards the determination of irrigation \ncapability in various experimental\

    \ mechanisms could \nbe integrated into actual precision irrigation in order to\

    \ \nthe efficiency adaptability; \n2) Dynamic process virtualization of precision\
    \ irrigation \ncapable of exhibiting working behaviour and decision making \n\
    support while keeping a certain quality of crop cultivation, thus the \noptimal\
    \ irrigation performance could be obtained based on current \nexperimental irrigation\
    \ conditions; \n3) Real-time feedback capabilities that will integrate \nenvironmental\
    \ information processing with precision irrigation \nsystem, to better monitor\
    \ and plan the operation of controlled \nprecision irrigation system, thereafter\
    \ the high-efficient schedule \nmodelling of irrigation performance could be expected;\
    \ \n4) Interoperability and adaptability of participant components \nin the precision\
    \ irrigation system, which capable of operating \nirrigation system for multi-objective\
    \ crop cultivation services in \nvarious environmental conditions with stable\
    \ working performance \nand secure information exchanges; \n5) Sustainable effectiveness\

    \  \nIt is worth noting that the novelty of this review lies in the \ncombination\
    \ of theoretical researches and technical employments \nin irrigation practice,\
    \ making it could be conveniently promoted in \na lot of actual applications such\
    \ as irrigation improvement, \nagricultural crop production, and relevant farming\
    \ researches as \nwell. \n6  Conclusions \n(1) This review demonstrates the latest\
    \ optimization \ndevelopments of precision irrigation to ensure higher productivity\
    \ \nof \ncrops \nand \nbetter \nenvironmental \nconditions \nof \nsoil, \nsimultaneously\
    \ \ntheir \npromising \noutcomes \nand \ninteractive \nmechanism could also be\
    \ learned as well.  Many effective process \noptimization approaches such as Takagi-Sugeno,\
    \ Neuro-fuzzy \ninference, Adaptive Colony Optimization/Low Impact Docking \n\
    Mechanism (ACO/LIDM), and genetic algorithm, have been \nexplained, contributing\
    \ to the optimum result of soil water content \nand evapotranspiration simulations\
    \ with higher reliability and \nbetter stability.  The actual optimized results\
    \ demonstrated that \nextraordinary promotions in irrigation performance could\
    \ be \nanticipated through employing appropriate process optimization \napproaches\
    \ when such advanced irrigation techniques of soil water \nbalance models, hydrologic\
    \ models, DSSAT, and HYDRUS \nmodels being applied, therefore the detailed discussions\
    \ and \nconclusive comparisons between objective irrigation influence and \nobtained\
    \ crop productivity are greatly helpful to establish a useful \nresearch basis\
    \ for irrigation improvement and efficiency promotion \nin return; \n(2) The schedule\
    \ modelling of precision irrigation has been \nclearly explained and comparatively\
    \ discussed, including the \ntheoretical and calculative models most suitable\
    \ to illustrate its \nintegrated mechanism verification and combined schedule\

    \ at https://www.ijabe.org                           Vol. 14 No. 4 \nprinciples,\
    \ so that a set of novel modelling methods such as IoT, \nWSN, ICT, have been\
    \ proposed and tested to develop schedule \nmodelling and smart irrigation system\
    \ in the past few years, which \nprovided more instructive demonstrations and\
    \ heuristic descriptions \nfor the working principles of precision irrigation\
    \ and the \nquantitative assessments of irrigation productivity, especially in\
    \ \nrepresentative subjects such as soil evaporation rate, soil water \nredistribution,\
    \ and groundwater quality for irrigation use.  \nFurthermore, in this subject\
    \ many new schedule modelling \nalgorithms have been testified for their excellent\
    \ accuracy and \noutstanding efficiency: AquaCrop, AquaGIS, Surface Energy \n\
    Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), 3-D groundwater flow \nmodel (MODFLOW), QUAL2E-UNCAS,\
    \ etc.  It is an obvious \ntendency that more advanced schedule modelling methods,\
    \ would \nbe expected to enhance scheduling efficiency and agricultural \nproductivity\
    \ in the future; \n(3) Recent irrigation researches have focused on the \neffectiveness\
    \ evaluation to confirm their operational mechanisms \nand constructive influences.\
    \  For the purpose of promoting the \nprocessing efficiency and treatment quality,\
    \ reliable integration of \nreal-time farming information is extremely significant\
    \ so as to \nobtain better irrigation effect and higher production efficiency,\
    \ \nsimultaneously to achieve better irrigation qualities in water-soil \nbalance,\
    \ water redistribution, moisture uniformity, etc.  As typical \nevaluation methods\
    \ have already been used, such as CROPWAT, \nParticle Swarm Optimization-Support\
    \ Vector Machine (PSO-SVM), \nIoT, \nWireless \nSensor \nNetwork \n(WSN) \nframework,\
    \ \nand \nNSAE-ANFIS, to monitor and control the efficient watering effect \n\
    for crop plants, a cogent understanding and process analysis of \ncrop-soil interaction\
    \ would be realized, so that an optimum \nintegration of influential factors and\
    \ operational effectiveness is \nguaranteed and therefore the upgraded agriculture\
    \ yield could be \nexpected thereby, otherwise the deteriorated crop growth, inferior\
    \ \nsoil quality, and low circulation efficiency of water resource would \nbe\
    \ obtained. \nThis review turns out that precision irrigation witnesses great\
    \ \ndevelopment prospects and deserves considerable expectations for \nits \n\
    outstanding \nworking \nefficiency, \naccurate \nproductivity \nmanagement, and\
    \ stable product quality.  It drafts the \ncomprehensive development picture and\
    \ latest investigation status \non typical precision irrigation techniques.  The\
    \ conceptual and \nsystematic progress of precision irrigation in process mechanisms,\
    \ \neffectiveness improvement, intelligent monitoring, integrative \ncontrolling,\
    \ and automated equipment, are the most critical \npreference areas and focused\
    \ frontiers need to be explored for its \nupcoming developments. \n \nAcknowledgements\

    \ Bari, Italy\n* Correspondence: khadra@iamb.it\nAbstract: Monitoring of water\
    \ retention behavior in soils is an essential process to schedule irrigation.\n\
    To this end, soil moisture tensiometers usually equipped with mechanical manometers\
    \ provide an\neasy and cost-effective monitoring of tension in unsaturated soils.\
    \ Yet, periodic manual monitoring\nof many devices is a tedious task hindering\
    \ the full exploitation of soil moisture tensiometers. This\nresearch develops\
    \ and lab validates a low cost IoT soil moisture tensiometer. The IoT-prototype\
    \ is\ncapable of measuring tension up to −80 Kpa with R2 = 0.99 as compared to\
    \ the same tensiometer\nequipped with a mechanical manometer. It uses an ESP32\
    \ MCU, BMP180 barometric sensor and\nan SD card module to upload the measured\
    \ points to a cloud service platform and establishes an\nonline soil water potential\
    \ curve. Moreover, it stores the reading on a micro-SD card as txt ﬁle.\nBeing\
    \ relatively cheap (76 USD) the prototype allows for more extensive measurements\
    \ and, thus,\nfor several potential applications such as soil water matric potential\
    \ mapping, precision irrigation,\nand smart irrigation scheduling. In terms of\
    \ energy, the prototype is totally autonomous, using a\n2400 mAh Li-ion battery\
    \ and a solar panel for charging, knowing that it uses deep sleep feature and\n\
    sends three data points to the cloud each 6 h.\nKeywords: precision agriculture;\
    \ microcontroller; IoT irrigation; ESP32; sensors; BMP180\n1. Introduction\nWater\
    \ scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, is becoming a fast-spreading threat\n\
    impacting livelihood, food security, economic development, and social stability.\
    \ Globally,\nirrigated agriculture represents 70% of freshwater consumption [1,2],\
    \ acting as both a major\ncause and a casualty of water scarcity. Thus, efforts\
    \ towards enhancing on-farm irrigation\nmanagement are crucial to face such challenges\
    \ for the ﬁnite resource.\nOne of the main obstacles that hinders such efforts\
    \ is the lack of cost effective and\nreliable data monitoring systems. Putting\
    \ into consideration the spatially variable nature of\nagricultural systems, the\
    \ availability of low-cost energy autonomous data collection means\nis crucial;\
    \ spatial features mapping being an essential step towards more precise planning\n\
    (scheduling), monitoring, and evaluation of irrigation events [3]. In fact, a\
    \ combination\nof monitoring and modelling techniques is needed to both understand\
    \ spatial variability\nimpacts and assess the accuracy of the models [4]. In this\
    \ study, a low cost IoT soil mois-\nture tensiometer is introduced and lab validated\
    \ to enable soil water potential mapping,\nvisualizing, and archiving in real\
    \ time on a cloud service platform.\n1.1. Soil Water Potential: A Key Parameter\n\
    Together with soil moisture content, soil water potential is key information to\
    \ describe\na soil’s moisture condition which has an essential importance in dictating\
    \ engineering, agro-\nnomic, geological, ecological, biological, and hydrological\
    \ characteristics of the soil mass [5].\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 263. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14020263\n\

    \ to draw\nwater from the soil, or it could be viewed as the force exerted by\
    \ the soil matrix to hold the\nwater [6]. The potential energy of soil water could\
    \ be represented by Equation (1):\nψ = ψm + ψo + ψp + ψg\n(1)\nwhere ψ is the\
    \ potential energy per unit mass, volume, or weight of water and the subscripts\n\
    m, o, p, and g are the matric, osmotic, pressure, and gravitational potentials,\
    \ respectively [7].\nIrrigation scheduling based on soil water potential—obtained\
    \ usually by tensiometers—is\na profound practical solution for rational use of\
    \ water in irrigated agriculture [8]. Thomp-\nson et al. [9] deﬁne the soil water\
    \ potential threshold for a speciﬁc crop-soil system as\nthe threshold below which\
    \ cultivated plants begin to suffer as a consequence of the de-\ncrease in the\
    \ available soil water content. This eventually impacts the plants’ physiological\n\
    well-being due to water stress [10]. Thus, identifying the appropriate soil water\
    \ potential\nthreshold for different crop-soil systems is an essential step towards\
    \ more efﬁcient irrigation\nmanagement [6,9–12]\nSoil water content must be coupled\
    \ with the soil water potential readings to avoid\nover irrigation due to the\
    \ inaccuracy of tensiometers under high tensions (80–100 kPa)\nespecially in ﬁne\
    \ texture soils [5]. Other factors impacting soil water potential include soil\n\
    texture, organic and inorganic content, and soil structure [6].\nThe applications\
    \ of soil moisture tensiometers in irrigation management is well stated\nin the\
    \ literature and several studies have discussed optimization of water productivity\n\
    and irrigation scheduling based on recommended ranges of soil water potential\
    \ for vari-\nous crops [9,13–15].\n1.2. Tensiometers: Advantages and Drawbacks\
    \ of Widely Used Devices\nSoil moisture tensiometers are one of the oldest and\
    \ most widely adopted devices for\nmeasuring soil water tension, comprising a\
    \ porous cup and a vacuum gauge for measuring\nthe equivalent negative pressure\
    \ or water tension in unsaturated soils [16]. Under saturation\nconditions, the\
    \ reading on the vacuum gauge (usually a mechanical manometer) will be\nequal\
    \ to the atmospheric pressure (pointing to zero). As soil moisture decreases,\
    \ water\nis transferred from the tensiometer’s tube to the soil through the porous\
    \ cup creating a\nnegative pressure vacuum until equilibrium is reached. This\
    \ negative pressure is detected\nby the manometer and represents the current soil\
    \ water potential [17–19]. The porous cup\nwall should be permeable to water and\
    \ have an air entry value greater than one atmospheric\npressure even when it\
    \ is saturated, to allow the air to escape once the soil moisture content\nis\
    \ increasing again.\nSince they are relatively cheap, easy to use, accurate, less\
    \ prone to soil tempera-\nture and salinity, tensiometers are widely adopted for\
    \ in-situ monitoring of soil moisture\nconditions [20–22]. However, one of the\
    \ main drawbacks is water cavitation inside the\ntensiometer tube under high tensions\
    \ (80–100 kPa) which can lead to inaccurate readings.\nThus, periodical monitoring\
    \ and maintenance are required to reﬁll the tensiometer with de-\naired water\
    \ following cavitation [23–26]. Another important drawback is the small sensing\n\
    area [2] which raises the need for multiple well-placed measuring points to account\
    \ for the\nspatial variability caused by soil inhomogeneity, plant vigor, and/or\
    \ low irrigation distri-\nbution uniformities, resulting from poor irrigation\
    \ management/infrastructure. Dabach\net al. [27] studied the tensiometer’s optimal\
    \ placement in relation to the spatial variability\nof the soil hydraulic properties,\
    \ root growth patterns, and plants’ root architecture under\nburied subsurface\
    \ drip irrigation systems in sandy loam soil. The coefﬁcient of variation\n(CV)\
    \ for the tension ranged from 10% to 20% when the tensiometers were placed 10\
    \ and\n20 cm from the drippers, while it was found to be lower (CV = 0–5%) when\
    \ the tensiometers\nwere placed at distances of 0 cm and 30 cm from the drippers.\n\
    As above-mentioned, the small sensing area coupled with vulnerability to cavitation\n\
    has made regular systematic monitoring of a ﬂeet of tensiometers scattered through\
    \ the\nﬁeld a common practice, yet a tedious one. Thus, several efforts had been\
    \ dedicated to\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 263\n3 of 11\nautomate soil moisture tensiometers.\
    \ Thalheimer [19] developed a low-cost (72 euros) easy-\nto-build electronic soil\
    \ moisture tensiometer using Arduino Uno microcontroller (MCU)\nand the piezoresistive\
    \ differential pressure transducer MPX5100D (NXP simiconductors,\nEindhoven, The\
    \ Netherlands). The main objective was to reduce the costs and complexity\nof\
    \ the prototype to facilitate rebuilding by potential users, thus data retrieval\
    \ was done\nusing the memory of the MCU board and collected by a mobile pc in\
    \ situ every two weeks.\nPereira et al. [28] built on the same concept using Arduino\
    \ Mega MCU, pressure transducers,\nreal-time clock, and an SD card module. The\
    \ prototype was capable of measuring and\nrecording the tension readings as a\
    \ .txt ﬁle on the SD card coupled with a time stamp.\nIt was then used to automate\
    \ a drip irrigation system under various soil types using\ndifferent tension thresholds\
    \ according to each soil water retention curve. Sanches et al. [29]\nprogressed\
    \ the idea further by adding a DHT22 (AZDelivery—DHT2231—China) air\ntemperature\
    \ and moisture sensor to correct the ﬂuctuations in the transducer readings due\n\
    to the changes in the ambient temperature.\nAlthough these efforts improved monitoring\
    \ of soil water potential by automating peri-\nodical readings of the tensiometers\
    \ along with data collection and storage in a cost-effective\nway, none found\
    \ in the literature have considered developing an IoT-tensiometer capable\nof\
    \ uploading the results into an easily accessible cloud service for real-time\
    \ monitoring by\nfarmers, operators, or researchers.\nThe aim of this work is\
    \ to develop, and lab validate a low-cost, energy autonomous\nsoil moisture tensiometer\
    \ capable of measuring, recording, cloud storing, and visualizing\nsoil water\
    \ tension measurements in real time, on a web service platform.\n2. IoT Tensiometer:\
    \ Development of the Prototype\nThe IoT-tensiometer uses an isolated BMP180 (ZHITING,\
    \ Shenzhen, China) barometric\npressure sensor placed at the top of the tensiometer\
    \ tube just below the closing cap. The\nsensor is connected to the microcontroller\
    \ (ESP32) by four thin wires (0.55 mm in diameter)\nusing an inter-integrated\
    \ circuit interface (I2C). The logic voltage for the BMP180 is 3.3 V\nand it can\
    \ sense barometric pressure up to 110 kPa with high resolution (2 pa), making\
    \ it\nideal to sense any relative variation in the tensiometer vacuum. The brain\
    \ of the prototype\nis the ESP32-WROOM-32D MCU (Espressif Systems, Shanghai, China)\
    \ which is a low-cost\npowerful microcontroller module with an integrated WiFi\
    \ and dual-mode Bluetooth. In\nthis study, the deep sleep feature of the ESP32\
    \ was used to save energy consumption and\nguarantee the autonomous performance\
    \ of the prototype. The ESP32 wakes up every 6 h\n(i.e., time slot is 6 h) to\
    \ sense the tension in the tensiometer’s vacuum via the BMP180\nsensors, write\
    \ the data on the SD card, and send three points to the ThingSpeak cloud\nservice,\
    \ before going back into sleep mode. If the MCU does not ﬁnd any available network\n\
    for 30 s (i.e., “threshold” is 30 s), it prints the following string message as\
    \ a .txt ﬁle on the\nSD card: “NOT able to establish connection”. It then goes\
    \ back to sleep and wakes up again\nafter 6 h. The same happens if the MCU could\
    \ establish the connection but could not ﬁnd\nthe sensors, but the string message\
    \ printed as .txt ﬁle indicates in this case: “Sensor x is not\nconnected”. Figure\
    \ 1 illustrates the code algorithm written in C++ language using Arduino\nIDE\
    \ environment.\nThe prototype is powered by two Li-ion batteries, 3.7 V each and\
    \ connected in series,\nthus giving 7.4 V. The batteries are being charged by\
    \ a 1.1W solar panel through a MT3608\nDC–DC voltage regulator to stabilize the\
    \ input charging voltage coming from the panels\nto 9 V. MT3608 is a small-sized,\
    \ low-cost step-up booster converter module, built for\nconverting or boosting\
    \ voltage as low as 2 V up to 28 V DC. As the ESP32 has two I2C\nconnections,\
    \ two sensors could be connected to each MCU, thus two tensiometers could be\n\
    connected to each MCU Node. Figure 2 shows the connections scheme done with Fritzing\n\
    software. All the components were mounted on a designed and 3D-printed platform\
    \ using\npolyethylene terephthalate glycol material (PTEG). The design considered\
    \ outdoor working\nconditions by minimizing any openings or holes, and by inserting\
    \ the mounted electronic\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 263\n4 of 11\ncomponents as\

    \ soil moisture spatial variability.\nMoreover, it supports studies on allowable\
    \ water potential thresholds for various crop-soil\nsystems, an essential parameter\

    \ Africa, where most irrigation systems are manually operated, water allocation\
    \ and irrigation scheduling are often based on\nuniform application irrespective\
    \ of crop needs and growth stages, which results in nonoptimal water use. Recently,\
    \ a lot of research has\nbeen carried out to improve irrigation water use efciency\
    \ through automation by employing wireless sensor-based monitoring systems.\n\
    Further to the improvement of water use efciency and yield, while reducing costs,\
    \ a feld trial was carried out at a farm in Harare,\nZimbabwe, during the 2016,\
    \ 2017, and 2018 winter seasons to test whether a new approach to the automated\
    \ irrigation systems, one based\non IoT and wirelessly connected soil sensors\
    \ (called hereafter as WCSS), improves water use efciency without reducing yield.\
    \ WCSS\nmethod was compared with three widely used conventional irrigation methods,\
    \ that is, manual scheduling, tensiometer-based scheduling,\nand weather-based\
    \ scheduling. Impacts on water savings and yield of winter wheat crops under drip\
    \ irrigation were evaluated. WCSS\nsaved up to 25% more water compared to typical\
    \ fxed irrigation schedule rates used by wheat growers during the winter season.\n\
    1. Introduction\nGlobally, the demand for freshwater resources has been in-\n\
    creasing, largely driven by a growing population, industrial\nexpansion, and agricultural\
    \ production [1]. When considered\ntemporally and spatially, there are large variations\
    \ in the\navailability of fresh water across diferent regions of the world. In\n\
    Sub-Saharan Africa, it has been observed that the average rainfall\nreceived in\
    \ semiarid zones has been on the decline in the last two\ndecades. Tis is largely\
    \ attributed to the upsurge in drought years\nas a result of climate change and\
    \ global warming [2].\nTe inclement weather conditions characterizing the\nSub-Saharan\
    \ Africa region necessitated investments in ir-\nrigated agriculture [3–5]. Given\
    \ that the bulk of existing\nirrigation systems in small-scale farming is traditional\
    \ food,\nwater canals, and sprinkler systems, high rates of water loss\nhave been\
    \ experienced. For instance, a study of Mutorahuku\nirrigation scheme showed that\
    \ approximately 8m3/hr of\nwater was lost due to damaged canals [6]. Tis is further\n\
    exacerbated by the observation that irrigators assume that\nthe water requirement\
    \ of each plant across a feld is the same\nand ignore diferences in crop water\
    \ requirements due to\nHindawi\nAdvances in Agriculture\nVolume 2022, Article\
    \ ID 8820764, 11 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8820764\nspatial factors,\
    \ which include plant genetics, soil type, and\ntopography [7–9], resulting in\
    \ a blanket application of water.\nSuch anecdotes give credence to the need to\
    \ improve water\nuse eﬃciency in smallholder irrigation systems [10, 11].\nFurthermore,\
    \ eﬃcient water management strategies become\nnecessary to improve agricultural\
    \ productivity to meet food\ndemands for a growing population.\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is often identiﬁed as a solution\nto the myriads of ineﬃciencies related to\
    \ water, fertilizer,\nand herbicide use [12, 13]. Irrigation scheduling, in\n\
    particular, aﬀords farmers the opportunity to use scarce\nwater resources in an\
    \ optimal manner [14, 15]. Over the\nyears, numerous irrigation scheduling techniques\
    \ have\nbeen developed, ranging from satellite-based/arial, soil-\nbased [16–19],\
    \ and microwave-based sensors to those\nbased on evapotranspiration [20, 21].\
    \ However, most of\nthese approaches are implemented in the developed\ncountry\
    \ context, with limited literature for developing\ncountries.\nSeveral authors\
    \ [22–24] also focused on control systems,\nwhich are based on the prediction\
    \ of soil moisture content\nand atmospheric conditions, but without much attention\
    \ to\ndeveloping intelligent agriculture systems that are less costly\nand eﬃcient\
    \ in terms of water and energy use.\nTis paper focuses on wireless-based sensor\
    \ systems for\ncommercial irrigated wheat production at the University of\nZimbabwe\
    \ Farm. Wireless sensor systems and real-time soil\nmoisture data for irrigation\
    \ control are a potential solution\nto the optimization of water application.\
    \ Typically, this is\nachieved by remotely accessing in-ﬁeld soil water conditions\n\
    and\nsite\nspeciﬁcally\ncontrolling\nirrigation\napplicators\n[25–27]. Previous\
    \ studies have demonstrated that optimal\nsensor placement in the ﬁeld can be\
    \ achieved through di-\nviding the ﬁeld into management zones using Electromag-\n\
    netic (EM) mapping [28]. EM mapping allows for the\nsimultaneous collection of\
    \ geo-referenced apparent soil elec-\ntrical conductivity and accurate elevation\
    \ data that can be\ninterpolated to yield a relationship between soil and ﬁeld\
    \ el-\nevation, which reﬂects on the water storage and movement.\nTe aims of this\
    \ paper are twofold: (i) to determine the eﬀect of\nthe wireless-based sensor\
    \ technology or wireless sensor net-\nworks (WSNs) in irrigated wheat on water\
    \ use eﬃciency and\n(ii) to compare the yield of wheat crop between a control\n\
    system using the conventional irrigation system and the\nproposed new treatment\
    \ (wireless sensor technology).\nWSNs comprise systems with radio frequency (RF)\n\
    transceivers, sensing devices, controllers, and power sources\n[29]. Advances\
    \ in wireless sensor technology have brought\nabout the development of multifunctional\
    \ sensor nodes that\nare aﬀordable and use less power. Sensor nodes in a network\n\
    are capable of performing some data processing and the\ngathering of sensory information\
    \ that can be communicated\nwith other connected nodes in the given network. Many\n\
    types of sensors are available, including those that can sense\nphysical properties\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pressure,\nmoisture content, or radiation. Tese\
    \ allow monitoring of\ndiﬀerent environments and are capable of networking with\n\
    other sensor systems for the purposes of exchanging data\nwith external users\
    \ [30, 31].\nWSNs are used for gathering the information needed by\nintelligent\
    \ systems, smart cities, industrial applications, or\nsmart healthcare just to\
    \ mention a few [32, 33]. WSNs\nsupport deployment of networks while covering\
    \ commu-\nnication needs with ﬂexibility in time and space without the\nrequirement\
    \ for a ﬁxed infrastructure [34]. Currently, there\nare several wireless technologies\
    \ that are available on the\nmarket. Tese are ZigBee, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, which\
    \ enable\neasier deployment compared to wired ones, thus avoiding\nany need to\
    \ wire building structures, and thus decrease the\ncosts and drawbacks normally\
    \ associated with the setup\nphase. Te wide possibilities provided by WSNs actually\n\
    allow developing a wide range of applications that include\nenergy cost control,\
    \ ability to monitor environmental data,\nsecurity and control of access environments,\
    \ among others\n[35]. In this regard, sensing actually makes it possible to\n\
    obtain information about the users and their environment.\nTis allows oﬀering\
    \ users customized online services with\nrespect to the state of their environment.\n\
    Another advantage of using wireless transmission is the\nconsiderable reduction\
    \ and simpliﬁed wiring over and\nabove, saving the cost of the wires. Wireless\
    \ sensors also\nallow users to collect data from otherwise impractical sensor\n\
    applications such as keeping a check on hazardous, unwired,\nor remote locations.\
    \ Wireless sensor technology contributes\nextensive installation pliability for\
    \ sensors and an improved\nnetwork robustness [36, 37]. Furthermore, an added\
    \ ad-\nvantage of using wireless sensor technology is the trans-\nportability\
    \ of the sensors, as they can be moved around in\nvehicles to monitor the environment\
    \ “on-the-go.” In ad-\ndition, wireless sensor technology lessens the maintenance\n\
    diﬃculties and costs incurred. Transmission of signals in\ndigital form ensures\
    \ that the noise pickup is minimum, and\nthis becomes a less serious problem.\
    \ Consequently, wireless\nsensors have been deployed in agriculture to aid with\
    \ site-\nspeciﬁc application of irrigation to crops in the ﬁeld.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nIn this section, we present the design of wirelessly connected\n\
    soil sensors for automated irrigation control. Subsequently,\nwe present the ﬁeld\
    \ testing of the sensor in comparison with\nother known sensors and methods of\
    \ irrigation scheduling.\n2.1. Experimental Design and Setup. Field experiments\
    \ were\nconducted on winter wheat at a Research and Development\nstation of the\
    \ University of Zimbabwe, situated at a farm on\nthe north of Harare city during\
    \ the 2016, 2017, and 2018\nwinter seasons. Te topography is mainly a plain ﬁeld\
    \ with\nless than 8 per cent in-ﬁeld elevation diﬀerences that result\nin ponding\
    \ of lower elevation areas. Soils are mostly clay\nloam, and these are inﬂuenced\
    \ by the variability of a ﬂuc-\ntuating water table both in space and time. Although\n\
    electrical conductivity (EM) surveys were not carried out to\nquantify soil variability\
    \ largely based on soil texture and\nmoisture content, an equally versatile method\
    \ of grid\nsampling was used to divide the ﬁeld into management\nzones [38]. After\
    \ spatial data analysis, the soil and land\n2\nAdvances in Agriculture\nsurface\
    \ were partitioned into 3 classes (zones) using the\nk-means clustering algorithm.\
    \ In order to carry out the\ninvestigation of irrigation scheduling, a ﬁeld capacity\
    \ (FC)\nindex was adopted corresponding to speciﬁc irrigation\nthresholds. Irrigation\
    \ scheduling occurred when root zone\nsoil moisture was depleted by the crop with\
    \ the speciﬁc\nthresholds initially set.\nA plot design with 0.25-hectare ﬁeld\
    \ under drip irri-\ngation was developed and implemented to test whether a\nnew\
    \ wireless-based irrigation system performed better than\nconventional irrigation\
    \ methods in terms of water use ef-\nﬁciency and yield. It was hypothesized that,\
    \ compared to\nconventional methods, this automated system could send\ncontinuous\
    \ soil moisture data to a base station programmed\nto open and close valves when\
    \ irrigation was necessary, and\nsigniﬁcant water use savings would be achieved\
    \ without\ncompromising yield. To test this hypothesis, seven irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ were set up on the plot as shown in Table 1, with\neach treatment having three\
    \ replicates. Te seven types of\nirrigation treatments for drip irrigation presented\
    \ in the\ntable show the type of sensor and irrigation set points used in\nthis\
    \ research.\nTe treatments were applied to wheat plants belonging to\na local\
    \ variety of wheat (SC Nduna). Tis variety was chosen\nbecause a local commercial\
    \ seed company (Seed Co. Zim-\nbabwe) recommended it based on its superior performance\n\
    in terms of yield.\n2.2. Wirelessly Connected Soil Sensor System. Te architec-\n\
    ture used to implement the wirelessly connected soil sensor-\nbased system is\
    \ shown in Figure 1. Te system had a low cost,\nlocally designed (Munyaradzi M.\
    \ and Masocha M., Uni-\nversity of Zimbabwe, Deed of Assignment 2020) soil\nmoisture\
    \ sensor, which gave a reliable performance for the\napplication under consideration.\n\
    Te automated system implemented used an ATme-\nga328P microcontroller. Te data\
    \ read by the sensors would\nbe relayed to wireless sensor nodes deployed in the\
    \ plot\nbefore being routed to a base station controller housed in a\npump house\
    \ some 130m away from the nearest node. Te\nbase station controller carried out\
    \ the local processing and\nanalysis needed to predict crop water requirements\
    \ before\noperating relays that control the opening of electronic valves\nallowing\
    \ water to ﬂow to the ﬁeld. Processed information\nfrom the base station is transferred\
    \ to a Web or mobile\ndevice via a GSM/GPRS module. Te hardware settings are\n\
    elaborated in the following section.\n2.3. Hardware Settings. Te WCSS system employs\
    \ some\nsensors for gathering data from the environment and in turn\ntransfers\
    \ it to sensor nodes for further transmission to a local\nbase station. A GSM\
    \ module SIM808 was used to transfer the\nvalues to a mobile/Web server. A data\
    \ SIM card was inserted\nin it to enable real-time data transportation. A resistance\n\
    sensor was used for soil moisture measurement, while for air\nmoisture, an AM2302\
    \ DHT22 (temperature/humidity)\nsensor was used. Teir details are described as\
    \ follows.\n2.3.1. Wireless Sensor Nodes. Te wireless sensor nodes used\nin this\
    \ study operated on license-free radio frequency\n(2.4 GHz) with mesh networking\
    \ capability to assure re-\ndundancy of the communication path with the base station\n\
    in the event of another node’s failure. Tese wireless sensor\nnodes comprised\
    \ the sensors, a microcontroller, RF module,\nand a solar power source with a\
    \ battery that could operate\nwithout sunlight for up to three weeks. Figure 2\
    \ shows a solar\npowered sensor node in the wheat ﬁeld.\n2.3.2. Base Station Controller.\
    \ Te Base Station controlled\nthe electronic valves through which the diﬀerent\
    \ treatments\nwere irrigated. Figure 3 shows a wireless base station in the\n\
    control room. Raspberry pi3 was used to connect to sensor\nnodes through ZigBee\
    \ protocol and to users through the\nInternet or GSM/GPRS module. Mobile interface\
    \ and Web\ninterface provided remote monitoring of the treatments. An\nXBee module\
    \ was conﬁgured as coordinator within the\nRaspberry Pi and connected to the XBee\
    \ module via a USB\ncable. Te Raspberry Pi’s MySQL database received data sent\n\
    by the sensor nodes in the ﬁeld for local processing. For this\nirrigation method,\
    \ two values were programmed to open at\n415 millivolts (mV) and 450 mV, respectively.\
    \ Te two\ntreatment levels are hereafter referred to as WCSS415 and\nWCSS450.\n\
    2.3.3. Locally Built Soil Moisture Sensor. For the detection of\nsoil moisture\
    \ content, we used a locally built resistance\nmoisture sensor. Figure 4 shows\
    \ the soil moisture sensor.\nTe purpose of using the resistance moisture sensor\
    \ was due\nto its low cost nature, and comparable accuracy to other\nexisting\
    \ expensive soil moisture sensors. Tis sensor was\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ of soil moisture content in our\nexperimental setup. Te output voltages of the\
    \ sensors varied\naccording to the amount of water in the soil. If there was\n\
    high moisture content in the soil, the output voltage would\ndecrease, but if\
    \ there was soil moisture depletion, the output\nvoltage would increase. Te soil\
    \ moisture sensor output\nsignal was analog in nature, and a conversion to digital\
    \ was\ndone by the microcontroller. Te processed output was then\nused to control\
    \ the water application through electronic\nvalves. Soil moisture sensors were\
    \ attached to the wireless\nsensor nodes to measure soil moisture at a depth of\
    \ between\n20 mm and 30 mm. Soil moisture measurement was im-\nportant in order\
    \ to obtain information with regard to the\nexact amount of water required to\
    \ irrigate the wheat crop.\n2.3.4. AM2302 DHT22 Sensor. Te DHT22 sensor is a\n\
    common temperature-humidity sensor used to determine\ntemperature and humidity\
    \ in the air (Figure 5). Te DHT22\nsensors are made up of two parts: a humidity\
    \ sensor and a\ntemperature sensor. Te DHT22 sensor is a low-cost device,\nwhich\
    \ is good for 0–100% humidity readings (2–5% accu-\nracy) and good for −40 to\
    \ 80°C temperature readings of\n±0.5°C accuracy. Te DHT22 sensor consumes a maximum\n\
    of 2.5 mA while requesting data and has a body size of\napproximately 15.1 mm\
    \ × 25 m × 7.7 mm, of which 4 pins\nAdvances in Agriculture\n3\nhave 0.1 mm spacing\
    \ between them. Tese variables were\nmeasured at 15-minute intervals and relayed\
    \ to the base\nstation. Te humidity sensor measured the humidity and air\ntemperature.\
    \ Humidity and temperature play crucial roles in\nthe growth of plants. Low temperatures\
    \ cause a reduction in\nthe absorption and movement of water in plants, while\

    \ water.\n2.4. Manual Human Scheduling (TFP). For typical farmer\npractice (TFP),\
    \ a ﬁeld is irrigated 12 hours per week as\nfollows: 4 hours every Monday, 4 hours\
    \ every Tursday, and\n4 hours every Saturday starting at 1000 hours. At each ir-\n\
    rigation event, one liter of water is applied over an hour from\neach emitter.\
    \ Tere were 82 standard emitters spaced 30 cm\napart in a line. In this experiment,\
    \ there were seven treat-\nments, and each had three replications.\n2.5. Tensiometer\
    \ Irrigation Treatment (T10 and T25). In this\nﬁeld experiment, two tensiometer\
    \ treatments were used for\nautomated irrigation. Irrigation was triggered at\
    \ two suction\nthresholds, that is, 10 kPa and 25 kPa. Tus, this treatment\nhad\
    \ two levels, hereafter referred to as T10 and T25 corre-\nsponding to the two\
    \ suction thresholds. Te total amount of\nwater used per drip line for T10 and\
    \ T25 was 13776 liters and\n14108 liters, respectively, for the 2016 season, followed\
    \ by\n14672 liters and 14289 liters, respectively, for the 2017\nseason, and ﬁnally\
    \ 13967 liters and 14178 liters, respectively,\nfor the 2018 season.\n2.6. Evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) Irrigation Treatment (ETc0.75\nand ETc1.0). Te crop water requirement\
    \ is also called crop\nevapotranspiration and is usually represented as ETc.\n\
    Evapotranspiration combines evaporation of water from\nthe ground surface or wet\
    \ surfaces of plants and tran-\nspiration of water through the stomata of leaves.\
    \ Te water\nrequirement can be supplied by stored soil water, pre-\ncipitation,\
    \ and irrigation. Irrigation is required when ETc\n(crop water demand) exceeds\
    \ the supply of water from soil\nwater and precipitation. As ETc varies with plant\
    \ devel-\nopment stage and weather conditions, both the amount\nand timing of\
    \ irrigation are important. Estimates of ETc\ncan be included in a simple water\
    \ balance (accounting)\nmethod of irrigation scheduling to estimate the required\n\
    amount and timing of irrigation for crops. Tis method\ncan be used if initial\
    \ soil water content in the root zone,\nETc, precipitation, and the available\
    \ water capacity of the\nsoil are known.\nTe weather-based drip irrigation method\
    \ (Figure 6) also\ncomprised two treatment levels. For this method, an au-\ntomatic\
    \ weather station was installed at a site located about\n300 m from the experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. Te relays were set to\ntrigger and open the valves at two thresholds,\
    \ that is, crop\nevapotranspiration (ETc = 0.75), here called ETc0.75, and\n(ETc\
    \ = 1.0), here called ETc1.0. Tese treatments are referred\nto as ETc0.7and ETc1.0.\
    \ In a season, the total amount of water\napplied per drip line for (ETc = 0.75)\
    \ and (ETc = 1.0) was\n15350 liters and 13985 liters, respectively, for the 2016\n\
    season, followed by 16531 liters and 13450 liters, respec-\ntively, for the 2017\
    \ season, and 15190 liters and 14896 liters,\nrespectively, for the 2018 season.\n\
    2.7. Seeding and Fertilizer Application Rates. Te crop was\nplanted at a seed\
    \ rate of 150 kgs/ha. Tere were three\nreplicates for each of the treatments.\
    \ Drilling method was\nused for planting at a rate of 2.2 kg of seed per each\n\
    treatment with three replicates in rows 25m long. An\ninterrow spacing of 0.30\
    \ m was used. Preplant dry fer-\ntilizer (compound D) was broadcasted at a 1860\
    \ kg/ha to\neach row of the treatments together with the seed. Fig-\nure 7 illustrates\
    \ the rows that were 25m long. Irrigation\nwas supplied with drip lines (T-TAPE\
    \ TS × 508-12-450,\nT-systems International, Calif with 0.015-m internal\ndiameter,\
    \ 0.30 m emitter spacing, 1.0-L/h emitter dis-\ncharge at 69 kPa, and 0.002-m\
    \ thickness) approximately\n0.50 m apart on either side of the wheat row. Planting\
    \ was\ndone between the 7th and 9th of July for all three seasons\n2016, 2017,\
    \ and 2018. A uniform amount of water was\napplied to both tensiometer treatments\
    \ in the ﬁrst two\nweeks\nof\nplanting.\nTereafter,\nirrigation\noccurred\naccording\
    \ to the threshold levels set on the tensiometers.\nAfter ﬁve weeks, urea fertilizer\
    \ was broadcasted to each\nrow of the two treatments at a rate of 1720 kg per\
    \ hectare.\nWater application was terminated two weeks before\nharvesting the\
    \ wheat crop.\n2.8. Field Installation and Test on Wheat Crop. Te drip\nirrigation\
    \ ﬁeld test and winter wheat crop layout are given in\nFigure 7.\n3. Results\n\
    3.1. Plant Height. Figure 8 shows the achieved average plant\nheight (cm) for\
    \ all treatments in the three seasons for drip\nirrigation. WCSS450 and WCSS415\
    \ treatment had the highest\nplant heights at 76.7 cm and 75.56 cm, respectively.\
    \ Te\nETC1.0 had the lowest average plant height at 71.73 cm over\nthe three seasons.\
    \ Tis shows that our Wirelessly Connected\nSoil Sensor (WCSS) design had the largest\
    \ average plant\nheight over the three seasons. It is, however, important to\n\
    note that the average plant height for all treatments was very\nclose, and none\
    \ of the treatments caused stunted growth.\n3.1.1. Irrigation Water Use Eﬃciency\

    \ 9 shows a\nplot of the amount of water used to produce a kilogram of\nyield\
    \ versus the various treatments for the 2016, 2017, and\n2018 seasons.\nTe WCSS415\
    \ treatment was associated with the least\namount of water (1.54 kg/m3, 1.41 kg/m3,\
    \ and 1.4 kg/m3) in\nthe three years 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Tis\n\
    translates to an average water use eﬃciency of 1.45 kg/m3. It\nwas closely followed\
    \ by the WCSS450 treatment, which had\n1.436 kg/m3. Te ETC0.75 treatment had the\
    \ least water use\neﬃciency at 1.133 kg/m3, which was even lower than the\nfarmer\
    \ practice or control (TFP) at 1.19 kg/m3. All other\nautomation treatments had\
    \ higher water use eﬃciency when\ncompared with the control.\nTese results were\
    \ further conﬁrmed by one-way anal-\nysis of variance (ANOVA). When compared to\
    \ farmer\npractice (TFP), both wireless connected soil moisture sensors\n(WCSS415\
    \ and WCSS450) were more eﬃcient in terms of\nwater use (p < 0.005). Similarly,\
    \ WCSS415 and WCSS450 were\nmore eﬃcient\nwhen\ncompared\nwith\nETc0.75 ETc1.00\n\
    (p < 0.005). Te mean for WCSS415 versus tensiometer at\n25kpa (T25) was statistically\
    \ diﬀerent (p \x88 0.016), while\nWCSS450\nagainst\nT25\nwas\nalso\nstatistically\n\
    diﬀerent\n(p \x88 0.041). Tis indicates that WCSS system performed\nbetter than\
    \ all other treatments in terms of water use eﬃ-\nciency. Both WCSS415 and WCSS450\
    \ versus T10 showed that\nthere were no statistical diﬀerences in the average\
    \ values\nwith p values of 0.209 and 0.306, respectively. Tis implies\nthat the\
    \ tensiometer at 10 kPa performed well in terms of\nwater use eﬃciency.\n3.2.\
    \ Yield. Figure 10 indicates that high yields were obtained\nfrom all treatments\
    \ with no signiﬁcant diﬀerence to tradi-\ntional farmer practice for all three\
    \ seasons. Average yields for\nwinter wheat in Zimbabwe range between 1 ton/ha\
    \ and 7\ntons/ha (Farm Management Handbook, V1-43), with the\nyields for all treatments\
    \ falling within the expected range.\nTe WCSS415 and WCSS450treatments’ average\
    \ yields at\n3.26 tons/ha and 3.24 ton/ha were slightly higher than the\nyields\
    \ for other treatments for the three seasons.\nAn ANOVA test was also used to\
    \ test for diﬀerences in\nobserved average yields. Te comparison of WCSS415 and\n\
    WCSS450 versus farmer practice (TFP) showed no statistical\ndiﬀerence in the mean\
    \ yield for both WCSS treatments with\np values of 0.916 and 0.979, respectively.\
    \ Tis result was at\nvariance with our a priori expectation with respect to yield.\n\
    Tis could have been as a result of system breakdowns that\noccurred in the WCSS\
    \ treatments during the experimental\nseasons. Nonetheless, the WCSS system still\
    \ performed\nbetter than TFP in terms of IWUE.\nFurther\nanalysis\nindicated\n\
    that\nWCSS415\nand\nWCSS450were similar to T10 in terms of average yield with\
    \ p\nvalues of 0.523 and 0.714, respectively. A possible expla-\nnation to this\
    \ is related to the intermittent breakdowns that\noccurred in WCSS treatments\
    \ between seasons when the\nexperiment was being carried out. In addition, Qualia\
    \ birds\nwere also always a menace some weeks before wheat harvest\nat the end\
    \ of each season, thus reducing the yield.\nComparison of both WCSS415 and WCSS450\
    \ versus evapo-\ntranspiration treatments (ETc0.75 ETc1.00) yielded p ≤ 0.001,\n\
    meaning that the means were statistically diﬀerent. WCSS415\nversus T25 also showed\
    \ averages that were statistically dif-\nferent with p-value of 0.012, while WCSS450\
    \ against T25 gave\na statistical diﬀerence with p-value of 0.028. Tis shows that\n\
    WCSS system performed better than all these other treat-\nments in terms of yield.\n\
    4. Discussion\nTe main objective of this research was to assess the\nperformance\n\
    of\nwireless\nsensor\nconnected\nsystems\n(WCSS), viz-a-vis other methods, that\
    \ includes tradi-\ntional farmer practice, in terms of IWUE, yield, and plant\n\
    height. Te analysis should be understood in a national\ncontext where the country\
    \ requires about 400,000 tons of\nwheat with the current production level of approximately\n\
    180,000 tons per year [39]. Furthermore, the country has\nbeen increasingly faced\
    \ with erratic rainfall patterns due\nto climate change. Terefore, the need to\
    \ increase input\neﬃciency in cropping systems is a critical component in\nincreasing\
    \ national agricultural throughput.\nStudy ﬁndings showed that wirelessly connected\
    \ sensor\nsystems (WCSS) performed better than other irrigation\nscheduling methods\
    \ used locally in terms of water use ef-\nﬁciency. Average IWUE indices associated\
    \ with WCSS415\nand WCSS450were 17% higher than TFP. Comparable results\nhave\
    \ been found in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, a study\nin Ethiopia indicated\
    \ that the use of wireless sensors in\nmaize-based systems achieved signiﬁcant\
    \ gains compared to\nmethods anchored on evapotranspiration. IWUE values\nachieved\
    \ are comparable to those that have been obtained in\nother parts of the globe\
    \ [40]. It has been reported that,\ngenerally, wheat IWUE ranges between 0.40\
    \ and 1.83 kg/m3\nglobally when considering yield. For example, irrigation\nwater\
    \ use eﬃciency values of 0.70–1.51 kg/m3 were reported\nin North China Plain [41,\
    \ 42]. High IWUE values are quite\nimportant for farmers and other irrigation\
    \ agencies in areas\nthat have water scarcity. It could be argued that WCSS\n\
    resulted in precise water availability in the root zone and\nthus a positive eﬀect\
    \ on crop growth. By providing the water\nneeded by the crop based on temporal\
    \ and geographical\nscales, the WCSS system produced higher yields than the\n\
    farmer practice (TFP).\nOne of the major factors to consider is the economic\n\
    implication of the type of irrigation used by the farmer. As\nreported in the\
    \ results section, the average irrigation water\nuse eﬃciency (IWUE) for the wireless\
    \ connected sensor\nsystems (WCSS) treatment was higher than that of other\ntreatments.\
    \ On average, WCSS saved up to 25% water\ncompared to typical ﬁxed irrigation\
    \ schedule rates used by\nwheat growers during the winter growing season [43].\
    \ Tis\nimplies that wheat farmers can save about 0.15 USD per kg\nor 450 USD to\
    \ produce about 3 tons of wheat per hectare.\nResults on IWUE also showed that\
    \ high values could be\nrealized either by saving water using WCSS drip irrigation\n\
    system or simply improving yield through optimized uti-\nlization of water. Te\
    \ cost saving associated with the use of\nAdvances in Agriculture\n7\nWCSS is\
    \ likely to increase the probability of long-term\nadoption by commercial wheat\
    \ farmers in the country.\nTere were small diﬀerences in yield between the treatment\n\
    and control across the three seasons. In this regard, WCSS415 and\nWCSS450 had\
    \ 2.14% and 15% higher wheat yield than the TFP. A\nnumber of previous wireless\
    \ sensor-based studies have achieved\nvarying levels of yield increases depending\
    \ on the context. In\ntheir analysis conducted in Texas, onion yields were 93%\
    \ higher\nfor the drip irrigation system compared to the ﬂood irrigation\nsystem\
    \ [44]. It was observed that the earlier ensured that water\navailability had\
    \ been synchronized with the underlying crop\nwater needs. In our study, there\
    \ were external factors that could\nhave resulted in low wheat yield diﬀerence\
    \ across treatments.\nQualia birds were a constant menace in the early stages\
    \ of grain\nﬁlling and could also have a contribution in reducing harvestable\n\
    yield. Te diﬀerences in yield among all treatments could also be\nattributed to\
    \ yield decrease with crop stress, especially in the\ninitial stages when it becomes\
    \ diﬃcult for plant roots to extract\nadequate soil water from considerable depth,\
    \ thus restricting its\nwater uptake capability [45]. Te result is that plant\
    \ growth and\nyield are aﬀected.\nIn wheat production, plant height is an important\
    \ parameter\nthat aﬀects grain potential and other characteristics including\n\
    spike length [46–52]. Findings from this research revealed that\nWCSS450 had the\
    \ highest plant height, while ETC1.0 had the\naverage lowest plant height at 71.73cm\
    \ over the three seasons.\nAlthough no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in\
    \ terms of\nplant height across treatments, this parameter has been shown to\n\
    have a positive eﬀect on wheat grain yield [53]. Moreover, wheat\nresidues can\
    \ also be used for other purposes such as cattle feed\nand bedding for livestock.\
    \ Tis enhances the linkages between\nthe crop and livestock sectors on the farm\
    \ [54, 55].\nTe main aim of this research was to design a low cost,\nwirelessly\
    \ connected, automated controller with soil moisture\nsensors for irrigation scheduling.\
    \ Te researchers designed and\nconstructed a reliable low cost intelligent controller\
    \ that is af-\nfordable by low-income farmers. Te results of this research are\n\
    similar to those of [56–58] who concluded that information-\nbased irrigation\
    \ scheduling is inevitable for tightening the\nspatial-temporal variability of\
    \ the ﬁeld in the advent of global\nwarming. Te control system developed was made\
    \ from cheap\noﬀ-shelf components found abundantly in local laboratory\nstores\
    \ and electronic retail shops with the potential to provide\nmaximum water use\
    \ eﬃciency by monitoring soil moisture at\noptimum levels. Tis is in sync with\
    \ [59–61] among others, who\nfound a 50% reduction in water use in tomato plants\
    \ using soil\nwater-based automatic irrigation system in comparison to daily\n\
    manually irrigated treatments.\n5. Conclusion\nTraditional irrigation schemes\
    \ found in Sub-Saharan Africa\ngenerally have a ﬁxed supply of water irrespective\
    \ of crops,\ntheir stage of growth, and underlying soil conditions. In this\n\
    study, an experiment was carried out to evaluate the per-\nformance of a new wirelessly\
    \ connected sensor system, for\ndrip irrigation scheduling, and its eﬀects on\
    \ plant height,\nirrigation water use eﬃciency, and yield of winter wheat\ncompared\
    \ to other irrigation scheduling methods that are\nnormally used by farmers in\
    \ the region. Te results obtained\nshow that irrigation scheduling methods had\
    \ notable eﬀects\non growth and the yield of winter wheat. Te newly designed\n\
    automatic irrigation controller treatments, WCSS415 and\nWCSS450, respectively,\
    \ used much less water compared to\nother irrigation treatments employed in this\
    \ research. WCSS\nsaved up to 25% water on average, while maintaining yields\n\
    compared to typical ﬁxed irrigation schedule rates used by\nwheat growers during\
    \ the winter season. Considering the\nnecessity for water saving and to achieve\
    \ sustainable food\nproduction, it becomes prudent for irrigation managers to\n\
    move from rigid irrigation delivery schedules to more\nﬂexible delivery systems\
    \ that are more eﬃcient. WCSS ir-\nrigation scheduling also gave higher wheat\
    \ average yield\ncompared with other irrigation scheduling methods (+8%,\n+15%,\
    \ and +29% for typical ﬁxed farmer practice, tensi-\nometer, and weather-based\
    \ treatments, respectively). A\n2.70\n2.80\n2.90\n3.00\n3.10\n3.20\n3.30\nT10\n\

    \ Tis in-\nnovation is appropriate for both small-scale and large-scale\ncommercial\
    \ wheat growers as it can be manufactured using\nlocally available materials such\
    \ as scrap metal. Given the\nintermittent power cuts in the country, the WCSS\
    \ sensors\nshould ideally use a stable and green source of energy such as\nsolar\
    \ power. In addition, farmers must have a basic un-\nderstanding of how to use\
    \ such an ICT based irrigation. It\ntherefore\nbecomes\nimportant\nto\nprovide\n\
    appropriate\ntraining schedules for wheat farmers to increase ICT literacy.\n\
    5.1. Future Work. In this study, we have been able to im-\nplement wireless technologies\
    \ and Internet of Tings (IoT)\nfor eﬃcient irrigation of a wheat crop in Sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa.\nAs for future work, research work must continue with more\nﬁeld trials\
    \ in order to prove that precision irrigation can\nprovide\ngreater\nbeneﬁts\n\
    than\nconventional\nirrigation\nscheduling. Te combination of wireless sensor\
    \ technologies\n(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Cloud Computing should\nprovide\
    \ a precision irrigation system with robust and low-\ncost sensing capabilities,\
    \ identiﬁcation of sensing locations,\ndata gathering, and eﬃcient transfer for\
    \ storage and pro-\ncessing. In addition, more research work has to focus on an\n\
    improved optimization model in order to further reduce the\nwater usage.\nData\

    Keywords:   Precision irrigation, Variable rate application, Center pivot, Lateral
    move, Wireless communication Continuous move irrigation systems have been modified
    since the 1990s to support variable rate irrigation. Most of these systems used
    PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) technology that did a good job of on-site
    control but were expensive to add remote, real-time monitoring and control aspects
    made possible by wireless sensor networks and the Internet. A new approach to
    control and monitoring continuous move irrigation systems is described. This system
    uses a Single Board Computer (SBC) using the Linux operating system to control
    solenoids connected to individual or groups of nozzles based on prescribed application
    maps. The main control box houses the SBC connected to a sensor network radio,
    a GPS unit, and an Ethernet radio creating a wireless connection to a remote server.
    A C-software control program resides on the SBC to control the on/off time for
    each nozzle group using a time on application map developed remotely. The SBC
    also interfaces with the sensor network radio to record sensors on the irrigation
    system monitoring performance and in the field monitoring irrigation soil and
    crop conditions. The SBC automatically populates a remote data base on a server
    in real time and provides software applications to monitor and control the irrigation
    system from the Internet. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) Share Facebook

    \ arises as a result of the rising population since population growth decreases\
    \ \nagricultural land, leading to water scarcity. Agriculture requires large amounts\
    \ of water, but water scarcity forces \nfarmers to irrigate their crops with little\
    \ or low-quality water, leading to the idea of developing smart irrigation. The\
    \ \nchallenge is how to manage the interactions between plants, growing media,\
    \ microclimate, and water using \nmanufactured systems. Good irrigation management\
    \ will minimize the occurrence of poor irrigation design. This \nreview is a way\
    \ to present various methods and approaches for using sensors, controllers, the\
    \ Internet of Things, \nand artificial intelligence in irrigation systems with\
    \ a focus on improving water use efficiency. The study uses \nSCOPUS indexed publications\
    \ and proceedings to study the evolution of irrigation information technology\
    \ over the \nlast eleven years. We hope this review can serve as a source of information\
    \ to broaden the validity of the findings \nof irrigation monitoring and control\
    \ technologies and help researchers identify future research directions on this\
    \ \nsubject. \nKeywords: intelligent irrigation, water efficiency, smart greenhouse,\
    \ internet of things, monitoring and control \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nDue to rising\
    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\

    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\

    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\

    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\
    Decision Support System \nWater management for irrigation requires extensive and\
    \ comprehensive data on dispersed and spatial agriculture. \nIn general, farmers\
    \ have difficulty processing their data because they do not have the experience\

    \ -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nmake irrigation management decisions; this is\
    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n5.2 \nFuzzy Logic Model \nA fuzzy logic\
    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \ncomputations, and output\
    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\
    \ \n6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \nThis review explored the various studies\
    \ and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient \noptimization,\
    \ and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing\
    \ IoT-based \nmonitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses.\

    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

    \ for good crop growth, while traditional\nfarmland irrigation techniques cannot\
    \ fully consider the impact of factors such as natural precipitation\nand crop\
    \ transpiration on crop growth, which can, to a certain extent, result in poor\
    \ irrigation\ndecisions and a complex farmland environment that cannot be monitored\
    \ promptly, thereby reducing\nfarmland production efﬁciency. This study designs\
    \ a farmland irrigation control system based on\na composite controller. Firstly,\
    \ an irrigation control method is proposed to establish a prediction\nmodel for\
    \ future rainfall and crop transpiration using historical meteorological data.\
    \ The composite\ncontroller is designed based on the prediction model to realize\
    \ an irrigation control operation with\nan irrigation value as the control quantity,\
    \ a water and fertilizer machine, and a solenoid valve as\nthe actuators. Secondly,\
    \ an intelligent irrigation control cloud platform based on Java language\nis\
    \ designed to monitor farm information and irrigation operation records in real-time\
    \ to facilitate\nvisual management. Finally, the prediction accuracy is high,\
    \ based on the prediction model results,\nwhich can provide a speciﬁc reference\
    \ basis. The superiority of the proposed controller is veriﬁed\nby simulation\
    \ using MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the proposed controller can be\
    \ well\nsuited for nonlinear control systems and has good control performance\
    \ while ensuring high tracking\naccuracy, strong robustness, and fast convergence.\n\

    \ scarcity is a global concern. As an industry that requires more water resources,\n\
    the research on water-saving irrigation technology is the most urgent. Many scholars\
    \ at\nhome and abroad have conducted extensive in-depth research on water-saving\
    \ irrigation\ntechnology, and a large number of research results have been achieved.\
    \ Regarding the\ndemand to model crop waters, some experts have developed the\
    \ management-oriented\ncropping system model MODERATO [1]. Tolomio et al. [2]\
    \ proposed a dynamic crop\nsimulation model to predict future interactions between\
    \ water and crop. An et al. [3] used\nthe Pearson correlation coefﬁcient method\
    \ to analyze the intrinsic linkage and inﬂuence\nbetween soil–crop–environment\
    \ and tomato water demand patterns. The inherent asso-\nciation and impact between\
    \ the regularity and the regression function of water and crop\nphysiological\
    \ parameters were constructed by combining the through-path analysis and\nmultiple\
    \ regression methods. Zhang et al. [4] proposed a coupled water–crop growth\n\
    (CHC) model to overcome the oversimpliﬁcation of the crop and irrigation modules\
    \ in\nthe water model. Q. Li [5] introduced a new approach named the Sparse Fractional\
    \ Levy\nQuaternion Extended Kalman Filter (SFLQEKF) for predicting stochastic\
    \ time series. It\nhas also been found that natural conditions, such as measuring\
    \ crop physiological parame-\nters, are more efﬁcient than indirect conditions,\
    \ such as measuring soil environment for\nirrigation scheduling methods, by comparing\
    \ asparagus crop studies [6]. A mathematical\nActuators 2023, 12, 81. https://doi.org/10.3390/act12020081\n\

    \ of maize crop and stage water relations under catchment recharge irrigation\
    \ condi-\ntions was developed using the BP neural network, which reﬂects the sensitivity\
    \ of water\nrequirements at each developmental stage of maize [7]. These research\
    \ methods have laid a\nsolid foundation for crop–water interrelationships. Consequently,\
    \ the ability to measure\nthe parameters involved in the individual model accurately\
    \ becomes a key factor.\nThe development of sensor technology has provided technical\
    \ support for accurate\nmeasurements [8]. Vijayakumar et al. [9] used wireless\
    \ sensor network (WSN) technology\nto collect data for accounting and analysis\
    \ to enhance the intelligence of irrigation sys-\ntems with the help of machine\
    \ learning algorithms. Jitendra Kumar et al. developed and\nevaluated a soil moisture\
    \ sensor [10]. Soulis et al. [11] determined the effect of soil mois-\nture sensor\
    \ positioning and the accuracy of soil moisture-based drip irrigation scheduling\n\
    systems under different conditions. It emphasized the selection of suitable soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors for speciﬁc crop needs. Luca Bondesan et al. [12] compared\
    \ the difference between\nirrigation scheduling and variable rate irrigation with\
    \ the inclusion of sensors and conven-\ntional uniform irrigation to demonstrate\
    \ the importance of sensors in irrigation decision\nmaking. In the context of\
    \ research on water-saving irrigation equipment, Djalilov et al. [13]\nstudied\
    \ the main factors of vibrations occurring in electric motors in irrigation facilities.\n\
    They developed a virtual tool to detect and analyze vibrations. Yang Yang et al.\
    \ [14] propose\na crop rows detection algorithm based on the autonomous extraction\
    \ of ROI (region of\ninterest), which can achieve high accuracy and the robust\
    \ extraction of ROI in various maize\nﬁelds. The proposed algorithm can provide\
    \ a new solution to the machine vision-based\nnavigation technology for agricultural\
    \ machinery. The system for driving irrigation equip-\nment using solar photovoltaics\
    \ has also been investigated and proposed [15]. An electronic\npre-wetting detector\
    \ was developed for irrigation scheduling, which can improve irrigation\naccuracy\
    \ [16]. In the study of control methods, Mahmoodabadi [17] proposed a robust fuzzy\n\
    adaptive integral sliding mode controller for nonlinear uncertain chaotic systems\
    \ based on a\nmulti-objective grey wolf optimization algorithm. In the paper,\
    \ a multi-objective gray wolf\noptimization algorithm was used to improve the\
    \ performance of the proposed controller.\nThis method can effectively obtain\
    \ the correct parameters of the proposed controller and\navoid the trial-and-error\
    \ process. J Torres et al. [18] proposed two anti-winding algorithms\nin the framework\
    \ of sliding mode control to restart the necessary action without affecting\n\
    the control action behavior. Alvaro Javier Prado et al. [19] introduced two anti-winding\n\
    control algorithms in the framework of sliding mode control to reset the integral\
    \ control\naction in the discontinuous mode promptly without inhibiting the robustness\
    \ of the whole\ncontrol system against disturbances. Zhang Yang et al. [20] proposed\
    \ a unicycle robot and\ndesigned an adaptive fuzzy controller based on its dynamics\
    \ model to achieve equilibrium\ncontrol. These studies provide effective equipment\
    \ for irrigation. The development of\nnetwork technology is essential for how\
    \ irrigation equipment can be adapted to intelligent\nirrigation systems.\nThe\
    \ rapidly developing wireless network technology has been widely used in people’s\n\
    lives and work in recent years, such as the design of ofﬁce automation systems\
    \ based on\nInternet of Things technology, the research of ﬁre information based\
    \ on computer network\ntechnology, and the research of Chinese medicine health\
    \ rehabilitation [21–23], which helps\nto solve diversiﬁed problems encountered\
    \ in different ﬁelds. Xu et al. [24] present a natural\nlanguage query and control\
    \ interface for LoT platforms that effectively parses natural\nlanguage commands\
    \ entered by users, enabling them to perform more complex operations.\nTace et\
    \ al. [25] proposed an intelligent irrigation system that integrates LoT technologies\n\
    and machine learning algorithms in intelligent irrigation systems. A system based\
    \ on deep\nlearning algorithms was developed to monitor the number and height\
    \ of moso bamboo\nshoots through image acquisition and YOLOv4 modeling [26]. An\
    \ Arduino-based irrigation\ncontrol system was proposed by conducting extensive\
    \ experimental trials to automatically\nadjust soil water content within a speciﬁc\
    \ depth range [27]. Rathod et al. [28] designed\nand developed an automatic irrigation\
    \ system for greenhouses to optimize water use.\nLing Zhu et al. [29] designed\
    \ a ZigBee-based automated irrigation system to achieve real-\nActuators 2023,\
    \ 12, 81\n3 of 18\ntime monitoring, remote monitoring, and alarm functions, providing\
    \ an intuitive on-site\nmanagement platform for irrigation users. Wireless sensor\
    \ network systems have also\nsupported irrigation research in recent years. Ndunagu\
    \ et al. [30] proposed an innovative\nirrigation system using drip irrigation\
    \ methods, which was designed and implemented\nusing wireless sensor networks\
    \ and Thingspeak.com to manage water resources effectively.\nScholars also developed\
    \ wireless sensor networks for drip irrigation systems and multi-\nintelligent\
    \ body automatic irrigation systems [31,32].\nIn summary, with the development\
    \ of technology, intelligent water-saving irrigation\nmethods and systems will\
    \ be the future trend, and research results in this area will be grad-\nually\
    \ applied. Although these controllers are effective, they have certain limitations.\
    \ Their\nmodel designs are often universal and cannot effectively combine the\
    \ weather conditions\nof the irrigated area with the local soil conditions, which\
    \ can easily cause signiﬁcant errors\nin the irrigation operation. For this problem,\
    \ this paper uses predictive algorithms and\ncrop coefﬁcients combined with weather\
    \ data from the summer maize-growing region\nof the Yellow Huaihai Sea to calculate\
    \ crop water consumption. We also use wireless\nsensor technology to monitor local\
    \ soil environment data in real-time and introduce fuzzy\nalgorithms and sliding\
    \ mode control methods to design composite controllers to calculate\nirrigation\
    \ volumes and achieve irrigation control.\nThe signiﬁcant contributions of the\
    \ proposed method are as follows:\n(1) A method of intelligent farm irrigation\
    \ control incorporating multiple models is\nproposed, integrating sensor technology,\
    \ wireless network communication technology, the\nARIMA prediction model, a fuzzy\
    \ algorithm, and sliding mode control.\n(2) An intelligent irrigation control\
    \ system based on Java language is developed, which\nrealizes the whole smart\
    \ irrigation.\nThis paper proposes an intelligent farm irrigation control method\
    \ based on the crop\nwater consumption model, rainfall prediction, a fuzzy algorithm,\
    \ and sliding mode control.\nIt also develops a farmland irrigation control system\
    \ based on this method. The rest of the\nstudy is structured as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the intelligent irrigation control method\nfor farmland and the prediction\
    \ and control models used. Section 3 describes the design of\nthe prediction and\
    \ control models in detail based on our dataset. In Section 4, we compare\nthe\
    \ prediction results and discuss the simulation results of the control model.\
    \ The paper\nconcludes with a summary of our results and directions for further\
    \ research in Section 5.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Structure of Farmland\
    \ Irrigation Control System\nThis paper proposes an agricultural water-saving\
    \ irrigation control system, shown in\na simple schematic diagram in Figure 1.\
    \ In this system, soil monitoring data, multi-year\nmeteorological data, crop\
    \ water consumption model, and expected soil moisture content\nare used as input\
    \ data, and the calculation of farmland irrigation volume is carried out\nbased\
    \ on the fuzzy sliding mode control method. Then the irrigation valve is controlled\n\
    by a computer using a 5G network for automatic irrigation. The soil moisture sensors\n\
    deployed in the system farmland use wireless network communication to obtain real-time\n\
    soil temperature and humidity data. In addition, a time series model is used to\
    \ predict\nfuture rainfall and crop transpiration through multi-year climatological\
    \ data from weather\nstations. The precise control cloud platform developed receives\
    \ irrigation volume data\nand then uses the cloud port to control the water and\
    \ fertilizer machine for regular and\nquantitative irrigation. The water and fertilizer\
    \ machine controls the solenoid valve for\nirrigation through the ﬁeld pipe network\

    The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model predicts future da\n\
    rainfall. The ARIMA model requires the time series to be smooth, and if a non-smoo\n\
    time series is obtained, the first step is to make a difference of order d until\
    \ the data is s\nand the number of disagreements made is the parameter d. The\
    \ expression is: \n∇\U0001D451\U0001D465\U0001D456 = ∇(∇\U0001D451−1\U0001D465\
    \U0001D456) = ∑(−1)\U0001D456\U0001D436\U0001D451\n\U0001D456 \U0001D465\U0001D456\
    −1 \n\U0001D451\n\U0001D456=0\n \nwhere \U0001D465\U0001D456(\U0001D456 = 1, 2,\
    \ … , \U0001D461) is the predicted value and \U0001D451(0, 1, 2, … ) is the number\
    \ of diff\nences. \nThe lagged values were then fitted with p (autoregressive\
    \ term) and q (moving av\nage term) as parameters, and the present and lagged\
    \ values of the model random erro\nwere regressed to build the model [33]. The\
    \ prediction equation of the ARIMA model w\np, d, and q as parameters can be expressed\
    \ as: \n \U0001D44E\U0001D461 = \U0001D7030 + \U0001D7111\U0001D44E\U0001D461\

    \ Rainfall Prediction Model\nThe autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)\
    \ model predicts future daily\nrainfall. The ARIMA model requires the time series\
    \ to be smooth, and if a non-smooth time\nseries is obtained, the ﬁrst step is\
    \ to make a difference of order d until the data is soft and\nthe number of disagreements\
    \ made is the parameter d. The expression is:\n∇dxi = ∇\n\x10\n∇d−1xi\n\x11\n\
    =\nd\n∑\ni=0\n(−1)iCi\ndxi−1\n(1)\nwhere xi(i = 1, 2, . . . , t) is the predicted\
    \ value and d(0, 1, 2, . . .) is the number of differences.\nThe lagged values\
    \ were then ﬁtted with p (autoregressive term) and q (moving average\nterm) as\
    \ parameters, and the present and lagged values of the model random errors were\n\
    regressed to build the model [33]. The prediction equation of the ARIMA model\
    \ with p, d,\nand q as parameters can be expressed as:\nat = θ0 + ϕ1at−1 + ϕ2at−2\
    \ + · · · + ϕpat−p + εt − θ1εt−1 − θ2εt−2 − · · · − θqεt−q\n(2)\nwhere a2 is the\
    \ sample value, ϕi(i = 1, 2, . . . , p), and θj(j = 1, 2, . . . , q) are the model\n\
    parameters; εt is a zero-mean white noise sequence.\nThis model can use the information\
    \ criterion method to determine the parameters\nof p and q. First, the AIC criterion\
    \ (Akaike Information Criterion) is used to weigh the\ncomplexity of the estimated\
    \ model and the accuracy of the data ﬁtted by the model.\nAIC = −2 ln(L) + 2K\n\

    \ According to the comparison results, the composite controller designed in this\
    \ \npaper has a higher control accuracy and better robustness than the PID controller.\
    \ Fur-\nthermore, it can achieve faster error convergence and better tracking\
    \ of the reference sig-\nnal in fault operation mode. \nMoreover, we clearly see\
    \ from the graph that the tracking curves under the SMC \ncontrol are pretty smooth,\
    \ while the ones under the PID control have a more apparent \nchattering phenomenon.\
    \ The reason is that the SMC control exhibits smoother control in-\nputs than\

    Moreover, we clearly see from the graph that the tracking curves under the SMC\n\
    control are pretty smooth, while the ones under the PID control have a more apparent\
    \ chat-\ntering phenomenon. The reason is that the SMC control exhibits smoother\
    \ control inputs\nthan the PID controller, resulting in a smoother tracking response\
    \ for the proposed control.\n5. Conclusions\nThis study has designed an intelligent\

    \ we only adopted soil\nmoisture, rainfall, and evapotranspiration for modeling\
    \ in this paper. Consequently, there\nare still some things that could improve\
    \ irrigation estimation. The following work will\nsufﬁciently consider more relevant\

    \ \nABSTRACT \nReceived: 11 December 2020 \nAccepted: 25 February 2021 \nFood\
    \ is the major source for the existence of the mankind. In order to meet the food\
    \ \nrequirements for the ever increasing population, the quantity of the food\
    \ production has to \nbe increased maintaining the quality standards. Agriculture\
    \ is one such major sector which \nprovides the food for mankind. It not only\
    \ provides food but also supplies raw materials \nfor industries. Implementation\
    \ of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things in \nagriculture helps in\
    \ improving the production with limited resources. The key parameter \nfor the\
    \ sustainable agriculture is moisture content available for the crop from the\
    \ soil. This \ncan be supplied efficiently by controlling the irrigation process.\
    \ In this system an \nintelligent agriculture monitoring system with multiple\
    \ wireless monitoring sensor nodes \nare used at different locations to monitor\
    \ the parameters such as temperature, moisture \ncontent in the soil, humidity\
    \ and rainfall. The data from the various sensors is aggregated \nat each node\
    \ and transmitted to the coordinator station using long range transceiver. The\
    \ \ndata received at the coordinator station is subjected to a rule based decision\
    \ making process \nto efficiently control the irrigation process. Also motor protection\
    \ against the dry run was \nimplemented, which not only protects the motor from\
    \ break down but also avoids the \nunwanted power consumption. All the live data\
    \ is in turn uploaded to the cloud so that the \nuser can have a track of the\
    \ current status of his farm at any time. \nKeywords: \nagricultural internet\
    \ of things, intelligent \nmonitoring, wireless monitoring sensor nodes \n1. INTRODUCTION\n\
    With the ever increasing population, the competition for the \nresources is increasing,\
    \ food is one among them. The entire \nworld is indirectly dependent on the agricultural\
    \ outcome. \nSustainability in agriculture is process of employing suitable \n\
    ways in the field which helps in meeting the ever increasing \ndemand. At the\
    \ same time modernization in agriculture is also \nessential. This modernization\
    \ from the traditional practices, \nstarted with the utilization of tractor in\
    \ the agriculture and this \npaved the way for industrial agriculture [1]. To\
    \ meet the \nchallenges, an automation in agriculture with data driven \nmanagement\
    \ is essential. This can be achieved with the \nInternet of Things. Agricultural\
    \ Internet of things refers to \nmanaging the remote sensors, actuators, autonomous\
    \ vehicles \nthat are deployed in field with the help of internet there by \n\
    intergrating automation and decision support in one system. \nEnergy management\
    \ in agriculture is one of the major issue. \nAgriculture has also its role in\
    \ the emission of green house \ngases. Hence there is a need to schedule or control\
    \ the usage \nof energy resources in agriculture [2]. Climatic changes, \nplantation\
    \ density, soil pollution due to pesticides [3, 4], air \npollution due to road\
    \ transport vehicles are also impacting the \nyield in the agriculture. The crops\
    \ which are closer to roads \nhave greater impact when compared to the faraway\
    \ fields [5]. \nThere are five major types of risks in the agriculture [6]. 1)\
    \ \nproduction- is affected due to change in environmental \nparameters, pests,\
    \ soil minerals, diseases etc. 2) Market risks - \nuncertainty in the prices due\
    \ to the demand and yield. 3) \nInstitutional risks – occurs due to unpredictable\
    \ agriculture \nrelated policy changes in government. 4) Personal risk – it is\
    \ \nrelated to the individual. Factors such as health, family issues, \nincome\
    \ may influence the individual. 5) Financial risk – this \nrefers to financial\
    \ in flow towards the crop maintenance. It also \nincludes availability of loans\
    \ and the rate of interest.  All these \nare some of the parameters that influence\
    \ the agriculture \nproduction. In rural areas due to lack of storage and \ninfrastructural\
    \ facilities, farmers are selling their crop at the \npoint of origin to the middle\
    \ men. They are in turn unaware for \nexisting market prices, therefore middle\
    \ men are fetching huge \nprofits [7]. \nImparting the digital innovations in\
    \ agriculture can \nmaximize the yield and also paves the way for sustainable\
    \ \nagriculture. This can be done by employing the wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ for gathering the field level parameters [8]. Coverage \nand proper connectivity\
    \ of the nodes to the base station is also \nessential [9]. This real time monitoring\
    \ using wireless sensor \nnetworks, generates huge amount of data. Based on the\
    \ useful \nextracted data, the farmers can take timely efficient decisions \n\
    and also controls the irrigation process automatically [10]. The \nvarious sensors\
    \ that are employed in the system are prone to \nvarious attacks, because they\
    \ are deployed in harsh \nenvironment [11]. Various communication technologies\
    \ such \nas RFID, Wi-Fi, LoRa, LTE, IPv6 Low-power Wireless \nPersonal Area Network,\
    \ Blue tooth, Zigbee etc., can be used \nfor data transmission in agriculture\
    \ [12]. Updating the data to \ncloud in turn helps in adding the intelligence\
    \ to data to \nfacilitate for further predictive analysis [13, 14]. \nInstrumentation\
    \ Mesure Métrologie \nVol. 20, No. 1, February, 2021, pp. 39-47 \nJournal homepage:\
    \ http://iieta.org/journals/i2m \n39\n \nUsage of zigbee and Blue tooth for data\
    \ transmission limits \nthe distance between the wireless sensor nodes and central\
    \ \nstation. For data transmission over longer distances multi hop \ncommunication\
    \ can be used, but the disadvantage is the \nincreased \nforwarding \ntime \n\
    and \nadditional \nhardware \nrequirement for multiple hops. In this system HC12\
    \ \ntransceiver is used to overcome this problem, and helps in data \ntransmission\
    \ over longer range. \n \n \n2. RELATED WORK \n \nResearchers had developed many\
    \ models relating to smart \nmonitoring of agricultural parameters to improve\
    \ the \nproductivity and sustainability. Ayyasamy et al. [15], \nproposed an excess\
    \ water removal system. The excess water \nin agricultural land occurs due to\
    \ various reasons such as rain, \nimproper irrigation scheduling, floods etc.\
    \ Removing the \nexcess water from the agricultural land prevents the rotten of\
    \ \nthe plant root.  Maintaining the soil pH helps in preserving \nvarious micronutrients\
    \ such as zinc, manganese, iron, etc., \nsalinity sensor based on BC548 transistor,\
    \ can be used to \nindicate the presence of salt water. Employing solar energy\
    \ in \nthe agriculture helps in the effective utilization of the resources \n\
    [16]. Shi et al. [17], defined a Plant water deficit index (PWDI), \nwhich gives\
    \ the information about the capability of the plant \nroots in absorbing the water\
    \ content from soil. This parameter \nwas analyzed by measuring the root profile.\
    \ \nNagaraja1 et al. [18] proposed a smart system for \nmonitoring using raspberry\
    \ pi, the various parameters that are \nmonitored on the farm land are stored\
    \ in fire base. This data is \ninturn used for the crop prediction by processing\
    \ through \nmachine learning algorithms. Kadar et al. [19] developed an \nAGRI2L\
    \ system. In this the water leakage from the PVC pipes \nare detected by analyzing\
    \ the data from flow rate sensor and \nwater level sensor. The status was intimated\
    \ to farmer using \nmobile app. Doshi et al. [20] proposed an automated farm \n\
    monitoring process by using various sensors and calculated \npower consumption\
    \ per hour in sleep mode, active mode. \nswitching to sleep mode helps in extending\
    \ the life of power \nbank. \nKumbhar et al. [21] proposed an agriculture 3-phase\
    \ \ninduction motor protection system by using R, Y, B voltage \nsensors and vibration\
    \ sensors. This system gives an alert \nmessage using GSM during voltage variations.\
    \ Bulusu et al. \n[22], proposed a detection mechanism for phase imbalance \n\
    fault condition and phase loss condition for the agricultural \nmotor by developing\
    \ a voltage and current measurement unit. \nThe motor is made to trip under the\
    \ imbalance condition with \nthe help of arduino and opto-coupler with relay.\
    \ Ulaganathan \net al. [23] proposed a motor protection system by identifying\
    \ \nthe current overload and phase absence condition. It also \nintimates the\
    \ farmer using GSM module. Balakrishna et al. \n[24] developed a motor status\
    \ tracking and inturn controlling \nsystem raspberry pi module to identify the\
    \ conditions like \nmotor malfunction, no power and no ground water. Android \n\
    application was developed to update these conditions to \nfarmer. Suleman et al.\
    \ [25] developed a multi node monitoring \nsystem consisting of sensors are equipped\
    \ with arduino uno, to \ncollect the micro nutrients such as nitrogen, and potassium\
    \ and \nsoil moisture content from the soil. This data is sent to the \nmaster\
    \ station using xbee module to control the irrigation. \nPrakash Jadhav et al.\
    \ [26] used mesh topology for connecting \nthe multiple nodes and coordinator\
    \ for intelligent monitoring \nin agriculture. \nMost of the work is based on\
    \ the analysis of the agricultural \nparameters at a single node and updating\
    \ the data to user with \nthe help of Internet of things. In case if the node\
    \ fails the entire \nsystem becomes idle. By considering the multiple nodes an\
    \ \nenhancement in the decision making approach can be realized. \nUnder some\
    \ situations, the flow sensor may give false readings \nto identify motor dry\
    \ run because of the air drawn by the motor. \n \n \n3. PROPOSED SYSTEM FRAME\
    \ WORK \n \nThe implementation frame work is categorized into three \nparts 1)\
    \ Wireless monitoring sensor nodes, 2) coordinator \nstation and 3) data logger.\
    \ \n \n3.1 Wireless monitoring sensor nodes \n \nIn the case of large farms, the\
    \ data analysis using a single \nnode may not give the accurate results. Deploying\
    \ multiple \nnodes improves the precision in decision making process. The \nwireless\
    \ monitoring sensor nodes are deployed at various \nlocations in the field to\
    \ capture the agri - environment data. In \nthis proposed system, three nodes\
    \ are deployed at three distinct \nlocations in the field. To conveniently identify\
    \ the nodes, three \nsensing nodes are named as node1, node2 and node3. All these\
    \ \nare stationary nodes, their position in the field is fixed. All the \nnodes\
    \ are powered using the external 6000mAh power bank. \nEach node consists of a\
    \ sensing module, microcontroller and a \ntransmitter. The sensing module includes\
    \ multiple sensors \nsuch as DHT11 -temperature and humidity sensor, soil \nmoisture\
    \ \nsensor \nand \nrain \ndetector. \nArduino \nuno \nmicrocontroller is used\
    \ to gather the data from sensing \nmodules at regular intervals of time.  Further\
    \ this data is \ntransmitted to the coordinator station using HC 12 radio \nfrequency\
    \ (RF) transceiver. The same setup is used for all the \nthree nodes. \n \n3.1.1\
    \ Temperature and humidity sensor \nThe DHT 11 sensor measures the temperature\
    \ and relative \nhumidityin itssurroundings. The temperature is measured \nbased\
    \ on the negative temperature coefficient of the thermistor. \nAs the temperature\
    \ of the surroundings increases the resistance \ndecreases. The relative humidity\
    \ is measured using the \ncapacitive sensing element. Change in relative humidity\
    \ \nresults in the change in the capacitance values. The data frame \nsent by\
    \ the sensor consists of humidity followed by the \ntemperature.  \n \n3.1.2 Soil\
    \ moisture sensor \nThe FC-28 sensor consisting of two probes acts as a variable\
    \ \nresistor. When the sensor is inserted into the soil, it measures \nthe volumetric\
    \ water content present in the soil as a function \nof content of the water in\
    \ the soil. During the presence of \nmoisture in the soil, the resistance decreases\
    \ and the \nconductivity increases [27]. The module outputs the voltage in \n\
    accordance with the resistance. \n \n3.1.3 Rain sensor \nThe FC-37 rain sensor\
    \ is used to sense the presence of rain. \nThe module consists of a control board\
    \ and a rain or collector \nboard. The copper tracks are present on the collector\
    \ board. \nUnder no rain condition, because of dryness the on the board, \nresistance\
    \ is high and the control board produces an output \n40\n \nvalue 1023. During\
    \ the presence of rain, the output value \nreduces from 1023 to 0, in accordance\
    \ with the reduced value \nof the resistance. \n \n3.1.4 HC12RF Transceiver \n\
    It is a serial communication module with multiple channels \nand capable of transmitting\
    \ the data in wireless manner over a \nrange nearing to about 1Km in the open\
    \ environment. It \nconsists of 8 bit STM8S003F3 microcontroller and Si4463 \n\
    transceiver. It supports multiple baud rates with FU1, FU2 and \nFU3 transmission\
    \ modes with FU3 being the full speed mode. \nThe module comes with the default\
    \ setting of baud rate \n9600bps, FU3 mode, (8-bit data and one stop bit), CH001\
    \ \n(433.4MHz). The parameters can be varied with the help of \nAT commands. The\
    \ default settings itself were used in this \nsystem for data transmitting the\
    \ data from each of the nodes to \ncoordinator. \n \n3.2 Coordinator station \n\
    \ \nThe coordinator station consisting of arduino uno, collects \nthe data from\
    \ the nodes 1, 2, and 3 with the help of the HC12 \ntransceiver. The transceiver\
    \ is connected to the serial port of \narduino uno receives the data in wireless\
    \ manner. The \nirrigation motor supplies the water to the field and dewaterting\
    \ \nmotor removes the excess water, accumulated during heavy \nrains. The received\
    \ data is analyzed by the microcontroller and \nthe actuation of the irrigation\
    \ motor and dewatering motor \noccurs accordingly. Both the motors are connected\
    \ to the \ncoordinator station through relays. The current sensor is \nconnected\
    \ in series with the irrigation motor measures the \ncurrent flowing through the\
    \ motor. The ATmega328P \nmicrocontroller is also interfaced with LCD to display\
    \ the \nnode failure status and Buzzer to alert the farmer in the case of \nirrigation\
    \ motor dry run. \n3.3 Data logger \n \nThe ESP8266 acts as the data logger. It\
    \ receives the soil \nmoisture and rain sensor data of all the nodes 1,2 and 3,\
    \ the \ncurrent sensor data, status of the irrigation motor and \ndewatering motor\
    \ from the coordinator station in the \nscheduled intervals of time. The received\
    \ data is in turn \nuploaded to thing speak cloud. It is an open source cloud\
    \ \napplication to send and receive the data. The data is uploaded \nto cloud\
    \ using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) protocol \nover the Internet.\
    \ \n \n \n4. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION \n \nMulti node, multi sensor smart monitoring\
    \ system gathers \nthe agri-environment parameters from distinct locations. The\
    \ \nsensor connection diagram of one node is shown in the Figure \n1 below was\
    \ drawn using fritzing.  \nWireless monitoring node interconnection diagram remains\
    \ \nsame for all the sensing nodes 1, 2 and 3. Aurdino uno is the \nheart of each\
    \ of these sensing nodes. For each node, DHT11, \nsoil moisture sensor, rain detector\
    \ are connected to the arduino \nuno analog pins. The microcontroller reads the\
    \ data from these \nsensors at regular intervals of time. The data is transmitted\
    \ \nfrom the node to the central station using the HC12 RF \ntransceivers. Each\
    \ of the nodes transmits the sensor data along \nwith the node header with a baud\
    \ rate of 9600. Each node has \na unique header, the respective node number is\
    \ specified in the \nheader portion. Therefore the receiver can clearly distinguish\
    \ \nthe received data, by analyzing the header whether it is \nbelonging to node\
    \ 1, 2 or 3. The nodes and coordinator station \nconnectivity diagram is shown\
    \ in the Figure 2. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Interconnection diagram of a node \n\

    \ Images of different water levels accumulated in \npaddy field \n \nAll the nodes\
    \ and the coordinator station are connected \nwirelessly in the form of star topology.\
    \ The central station is \nalso equipped with HC 12 RF transceiver, which now\
    \ acts as \na receiver and collects the data from the three nodes. The \nindividual\
    \ agricultural parameters are extracted from received \ndata and are analysed\
    \ for actuating the motors. Under the \npresence of predominant rain, excess water\
    \ gets accumulated \ninto the field. In the following Figure 3 (a), (b) shows\
    \ such \nsituation of the paddy crop drowned in the water due to heavy \nrain.\
    \ Condition of the crop under mild rain is shown in the \nFigure 3(c). \nThese\
    \ images are captured in the paddy field after heavy \nrain in the region of Andhra\
    \ Pradesh, India, in the month of \nnovember 2020. \nIf the necessary action was\
    \ not taken to remove the excess \nwater out the crop area, the roots become weak\
    \ and it may even \nleads to the death of the plants due to the prolonged stay\
    \ in the \nwater. It results a huge loss to farmers. Therefore the \ndewatering\
    \ motor helps to remove the excess water out of the \nfields. Mild rain situation\
    \ is tolerable as the land takes less \ntime to dry when compared to heavy rain.\
    \ \nBy analyzing the soil moisture and rain sensor data, the \nirrigation motor\
    \ and dewatering motor actuation is controlled \nby the microcontroller at coordinator\
    \ station. The various \ncases and the action taken are shown in the Table 1 below.\
    \ \nThe mapping of the rain and soil sensor analog data to \ndigital data is given\
    \ by Eq. (1). \n \nDigital Value = Signal value\n5\n∗ 1023 \n(1) \n \nThe system\
    \ contains 10 bit analog to digital converter \n(ADC). The soil and rain threshold\
    \ values are set according to \nthe mapped reading. The functioning of the central\
    \ station \nunder various conditions is explained in the Figure 4. \n \nTable\
    \ 1. Action taken at coordinator station under various cases \n \nCases \nParameter\
    \ analyzed \nDecision \nAction taken \nCase \n1 \nAtleast one soil moisture sensor\
    \ indicates soil dry and no rain status \nfrom all three rain sensors \nNo Rain,\
    \ Soil- Dry \nMotor 1- \nIrrigation motor On, Motor 2 - \nDewatering motor off.\
    \ \nCase \n2 \nAll the soil sensors indicate soil wet and rain sensors indicate\
    \ the \npresence of predominant rain fall \nPredominant rain and soil Wet \nMotor\
    \ 1 - \nIrrigation motor Off, Motor 2- \nDewatering motor on. \nCase \n3 \nAll\
    \ the soil sensor indicate the soil is wet and presence of mild rain/ \nno rain\
    \ \nMild rain/ no rain and Soil wet \nMotor 1 - Irrigation motor off, \nMotor\
    \ 2 – Dewatering motor off. \n42\n \n \nFigure 4. Flow chart indicating the control\
    \ process carried out at coordinator station \n \nWhen soil and rain moisture\
    \ sensor data are greater than the \nsoil threshold and rain threshold, it indicates\
    \ that the soil is dry \nand no rain. Therefore the irrigation motor is switched\
    \ on. The \nirrigation motor draws the water from the water source and \nsupplies\
    \ to the field.  Under this condition if the water source \nis dry or the level\
    \ of the water is too low for the motor to \nextract, the motor fails to pump\
    \ the water and its runs \ncontinuously with no water. This condition was termed\
    \ as \nmotor dry run. In long run it may even damage the motor, \nfurther the\
    \ power consumed by the motor leads to wastage of \nresources. To avoid this condition,\
    \ a current sensor ACS712 \nwas connected in series with the irrigation motor.\
    \ When the \nmotor has the sufficient amount of water at its source point it \n\
    draws more current, to pump the water, when compared to no \nwater at the source\
    \ point. Based on this data from the current \nsensor, the microcontroller controls\
    \ the switching of irrigation \nmotor. When the current senor reading is below\
    \ the threshold \nvalue, immediately the irrigation motor is turned off and \n\
    buzzer is turned on to alert the farmer. Therefore the dry run \ncondition is\
    \ avoided, which not only protects the motor but \nalso saves power.  \nIn case\
    \ no data is received from any particular node for a \npredominant amount of time\
    \ due to power failure then that \nparticular node was treated as malfunctioned\
    \ and the status of \nthe same is indicated through the LCD present in the central\
    \ \nstation as shown in Figure 5, as node fail 1 or node fail 2 or \nnode fail\
    \ 3 depending the failed node. Therefore the farmer \ncan take necessary measures\
    \ to make the node operational. \n \n \nFigure 5. Node status on LCD \n \n \n\
    5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \nIn this system, single phase, 0.5 Horsepower,\
    \ 200-240 volts \nmotor was used as an irrigation motor.By analyzing the \nreceived\
    \ data from the three nodes as mentioned in the \nflowchart, the coordinator station\
    \ actuates the irrigation motor \nor the dewatering motor. Before connecting the\
    \ irrigation \nmotor to central station, the m number of current readings \nunder\
    \ the presence of water was noted as wi, where i = \n1,2,3,…m. Similarly the p\
    \ number of recoded readings under \ndry run was noted as nwj, wherej = 1, 2,3,…p.\

    \ \n \nMulti sensor node based precision farming assists in \nsustainable crop\
    \ management with effective utilization of \nwater. Analyzing the data from the\
    \ multiple nodes helps in \nprecise decision making in scheduling the irrigation.\
    \ Major \nfocus of this research also lies in predicting the availability of \n\
    water at the motor inlet by measuring the current consumed by \nthe motor. Monitoring\
    \ the irrigation motor for the dry run \ncondition, not only protects the motor\
    \ but also saves the time \nand money for the farmer. The stagnant water, due\
    \ to heavy \nrains is pumped out of the crop using dewatering motor. This \nsaves\
    \ the crop from prolonged stay in excess water.  In the \nproposed system data\
    \ from the senor nodes to the central \nstation is transmitted using RF transceiver.\
    \ Therefore the \ninternet connectivity for the entire crop area is not necessary.\
    \ \nThe internet connectivity at the central station alone is \nessential to upload\
    \ the synchronized parameters from the \nnodes and status of the two motors to\
    \ the cloud. So that the \nfarmer can monitor the status of the crop from any\
    \ location in \nthe world. \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \n[1] Charania, I., Li, X.R.\

    Sensor Network (WSN) broadly utilized as a part of building decision support system
    for monitoring and controlling different environmental parameter. One of the most
    fascinating fields having an expanding need of decision support system is agriculture.
    The superiority of WSN in agriculture is due to several reasons like high performance,
    increasing the production while decreasing cost, low-power consumption and collected
    distributed data. In this paper, the proposed Automated Irrigation System (AIS)
    is useful to sense temperature, sunlight, humidity, pH and groundwater in the
    field and take decision of water requirements based on results. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Noida, India I. Introduction WSN framework
    comprises of vast number of sensor nodes that are thickly deploying in the interested
    region [1], [2]. It made out of four sections: power supply, communication, processing
    unit and sensors. Sensors sense the information and communication unit gets the
    data from the CPU and after that transmit it to the outside world, Power source
    system supplies energy to sensor nodes and microprocessor in processing unit control
    sensors, execute communication protocols and signal processing set of computer
    instructions on the collected sensor data. The sensor nodes has been designed
    using low power sensing devices, embedded processors, communication kits, and
    power equipment. Sensor nodes communicate with each other and with base station
    using a wireless communication channel [6]. WSN used in various application areas
    like health, military, home and also in commercial application like managing amount
    or quantity of items, supervising product quality, and supervising disaster areas

    \ sensor networks collecting real-time data have been adopted in many industrial\n\
    settings. This paper describes the second stage of an end-to-end system integrating\
    \ modern hardware\nand software tools for precise monitoring and control of soil\
    \ conditions. In the proposed framework,\nthe data are collected by the sensor\
    \ network distributed in the soil of a commercial strawberry farm\nto infer the\
    \ ultimate physicochemical characteristics of the fruit at the point of harvest\
    \ around the\nsensor locations. Empirical and statistical models are jointly investigated\
    \ in the form of neural\nnetworks and Gaussian process regression models to predict\
    \ the most signiﬁcant physicochemical\nqualities of strawberry. Color, for instance,\
    \ either by itself or when combined with the soluble solids\ncontent (sweetness),\
    \ can be predicted within as little as 9% and 14% of their expected range of values,\n\
    respectively. This level of accuracy will ultimately enable the implementation\
    \ of the next phase in\ncontrolling the soil conditions where data-driven quality\
    \ and resource-use trade-offs can be realized\nfor sustainable and high-quality\
    \ strawberry production.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; machine learning; IoT;\

    In the world of big data sustained by ubiquitous applications of sensor networks,\n\
    artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) create signiﬁcant opportunities\
    \ in\nmultidisciplinary ﬁelds, including healthcare, ﬁnancial services, and smart\
    \ agriculture.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld and sur-\nrounding industries contributed USD 1.109 trillion to the U.S.\
    \ gross domestic product\nand provided 10.9% of the total employment in 2019 [1,2].\
    \ This paper introduces a holis-\ntic approach, which includes a sensor network\
    \ with real-time connectivity to the cloud,\nalgorithm-driven controllers, and\
    \ advanced machine learning algorithms to enable a fully\nautomated soil conditioning\
    \ system. This paper aims to improve the sustainability of straw-\nberry production,\
    \ which can easily be scaled to other kinds of special crops. Smart farming\n\
    systems use sensory data and real-time monitoring devices to acquire high-resolution\
    \ data\nfrom the ﬁeld and the environment surrounding the crop to improve the\
    \ crop quality and\nquantity while decreasing cost and increasing sustainability.\n\
    Researchers have focused on the yield prediction sector to support the economy\n\
    and develop a sustainable supply across many different crops. Strawberry fruit\
    \ is an\nessential crop for the U.S. economy, as the U.S. is the second-largest\
    \ strawberry producer\nworldwide, contributing to 26.2% of the world’s production\
    \ with 231 tons in 2017–2018 [3].\nThe importance of the strawberry crop worldwide\
    \ provided the motivation to study the\neffects of the natural environment and\
    \ soil physical characteristics on the quality of the\nstrawberry, and not just\
    \ the yield. One of the major factors that has been continuously\ninvestigated\
    \ through different studies is the water content and its effects on the yield\
    \ and\nstrawberry quality [4,5]. Strawberry cultivars have different demands of\
    \ water content and\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23042247\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n2 of 17\nfertilization\
    \ to reach acceptable levels of both quality and yield [4–10]. Previous literature\n\
    reports that a water deﬁcit has a drastic effect on the strawberry yield and marketability\n\
    (size of the fruit) on most strawberry cultivates [4,7]. At the same time, the\
    \ overuse of water\nincreases the cost and subsequently reduces the water resources\
    \ for other areas [11]. The\ndrip irrigation system for strawberry is an efﬁcient\
    \ way to save 50% more water compared\nto the overhead sprinklers [12]. Furthermore,\
    \ the overuse or wrong kind of fertilization\ncan harm the strawberry size and\
    \ sweetness [8,13]. Wu et al. [10] studied the effect of\nfour different factors\
    \ (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and water) on the\nyield and the\
    \ strawberry sweetness ratio (SSC/TTA), where they found a signiﬁcant effect\n\
    on the yield and SSC when they applied the N fertilizer. While the water content\
    \ had\na signiﬁcant effect on yield, P fertilizers had a signiﬁcant effect on\
    \ the sweetness ratio.\nHowever, they noticed a decline in the yield, sweetness\
    \ ratio, and ﬁrmness when they\napplied fertilizer and water extravagantly [10,14].\
    \ The sweetness ratio and the development\nof the strawberry cultivars are reﬂected\
    \ in the ripening stage of the fruit, which affects\nthe strawberry color [15].\
    \ The combination of all the factors, including water content and\nfertilizer\
    \ levels, with optimal irrigation schedule and techniques, still represent an\
    \ open\nﬁeld for research. As the new technologies help explore and adjust these\
    \ combinations,\nmachine learning and data mining help improve the agricultural\
    \ process for applications\nincluding crop prediction, disease, and weed detection,\
    \ and species recognition [16].\nOver the past decade, most of the research (authors\
    \ of this paper included) focused on\nevaluating the quality of strawberries postharvest\
    \ with little attention to how to control the\nquality of the crop pre-harvest.\
    \ This study proposes a holistic system, which is comprised\nof multiple components\
    \ in the form of a wireless sensor network to collect real-time high-\nresolution\
    \ data from the soil, machine learning algorithms to predict potential harvest\n\
    quality from the measured data and a control system to adjust soil parameters,\
    \ including\nwater content (WC) and electrical conductivity (EC) to achieve desired\
    \ physicochemical\ncharacteristics at the point and time of harvest. The high-resolution\
    \ data which match the\nsoil measurements with the postharvest quality analysis\
    \ has been presented in [17]. As\nthe follow-up publication, this paper will focus\
    \ on the data inference part of the project\nusing machine learning tools, including\
    \ both empirical (neural networks, ensembles of\nneural networks (ENN)) and statistical\
    \ (Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)) approaches.\nFigure 1 shows the proposed\
    \ system in full, where the general aim is to regulate the soil\nwater and fertilizer\
    \ levels both in real-time and on-demand for optimal physicochemical\nqualities\
    \ at the harvest. The study’s results so far prescribe several steps that can\
    \ be taken\nto enhance strawberry cultivation through soil sensor-based real-time\
    \ ﬁeld monitoring. For\ninstance, the control algorithm can be tested in a ﬁeld\
    \ where water levels can be monitored\nand adjusted using real-time smart controllers\
    \ at drip line valves, thus optimizing resource\nutilization based on dynamic\
    \ environmental and weather factors. This article will focus on\nthe data collection\
    \ and model training, which are required to ultimately control the smart\nvalves\
    \ at each drip line.\nPrevious studies have shown less than stellar results regarding\
    \ strawberries’ overall\nsensory qualities, which do not always satisfy the customers\
    \ [18]. As was also shown in the\nliterature, local area information has a signiﬁcant\
    \ effect on the model’s accuracy [19–21].\nThis provides a strong incentive to\
    \ ﬁnd the optimal pre-harvest conditions for different\ncultivars and to develop\
    \ a robust algorithm to determine the relationship between the local\nsoil properties\
    \ and the strawberry’s physicochemical characteristics.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n\
    3 of 17\nFigure 1. The proposed framework with two stages. (a) The ﬁrst stage\
    \ is data collection from the\nﬁeld, data pre-processing, and model training.\
    \ (b) The second stage is testing the developed models\nwith new ﬁeld data and\
    \ implementing the control hardware based on the model predictions.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis study was conducted using data collected from an approximately\
    \ 40 acre com-\nmercial strawberry farm in Plant City, Florida. The reader can\
    \ learn more about the data\ncollection process and the statistical analysis of\
    \ the data in the ﬁrst publication of this\nstudy [17]. As shown in Figure 2,\
    \ a bird’s-eye view is provided for the farm with three\ntime-series data loggers\
    \ from three different regions, each with two terminals connected\nto three sensors.\
    \ The markers in Figure 2 represent the location of each logger, which\nwere strategically\
    \ placed to sample from areas of the ﬁeld with high, medium, and low\nhumidity\
    \ levels based on natural elevation. The sensors measured the soil water content\n\
    (m3/m3), electrical conductivity (mS/cm), and soil temperature (◦C), for the whole\
    \ of\nfour months during the 2018–2019 Florida Brilliance strawberry season [22].\
    \ The precip-\nitation rate (inch /day) data for Plant City, Florida, were included\
    \ in this study [23] for\nthat Florida strawberry season in order to see the effect\
    \ of rain on the water content (WC)\nand electrical conductivity (EC). There is\
    \ a relationship between the soil water content\n(WC), the soil conductivity (EC),\
    \ and the precipitation rate, similar to what has been found\nin the literature\
    \ [17,24]. There is a correlation between the WC level with rainwater, WC\nlevel\
    \ with EC level, and EC level with rainwater where the rainwater obviously increases\n\
    the WC along with the ions and minerals in the soil, which is then reﬂected in\
    \ the EC\nlevel, as reported by Friedman et al. [24]. The soil properties such\
    \ as temperature and WC\nare signiﬁcant factors in crop quality and quantity [16,19,25],\
    \ but since Florida Brilliance\nStrawberries were grown on an open ﬁeld in a plastic-covered\
    \ bed, temperature control\nis not feasible. Based on the results of the preliminary\
    \ analysis of the data and what was\npreviously reported in the literature [17,24],\
    \ the WC and EC were selected as the primary\nfactors in training the ML algorithms.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 2247\n4 of 17\nFigure 2. The satellite view of the farm in Plant\
    \ City, Florida, where the real-time data loggers were\nplaced, and the commercial\
    \ harvest was performed.\nThe dataset includes data points for four harvests during\
    \ the four months of the\n2018–2019 strawberry season, where six different points\
    \ in the ﬁeld were harvested to yield\na total of 24 multivariate data points\
    \ after pre-processing the dataset, as shown in Table 1.\nThe 24 multivariate\
    \ data points include the soil measurements and the corresponding fruit\nsensory\
    \ qualities recorded in a collaborating lab at the University of Florida. For\
    \ each of the\n24 samples, the sensory qualities of the harvested strawberries\
    \ used in the study as output\npredictions include color and soluble solids content\
    \ (SSC). Color is an attractive element\nin strawberry evaluation [18,26] and\
    \ the basic external quality factor for the postharvest\nuses of the fruit, as\
    \ well as a natural indicator of fruit ripeness [15,18,27]. The color of\nstrawberries\
    \ was analyzed using a machine vision system [28] consisting of a light box, a\n\
    Nikon D200 digital color camera, and a computer. The camera settings were set\
    \ to 36 mm\nfocal length, ISO 100 sensitivity, 1/3 s F/11 shutter speed, −1 eV\
    \ exposure compensation,\nand direct sunlight white balance. The system was calibrated\
    \ using a standard red plate\nfrom Labsphere. A software program was used to capture\
    \ images and calculate the average\nL*, a*, and b* values of the strawberry surface\
    \ based on ﬁve replicates [17]. The measure\nof redness, “a*”, was taken on the\
    \ red/green coordinate and considered the deﬁnitive\nindicator of strawberry color\
    \ in this study. On the other hand, SSC is an indicator of sugar\ncontent for\
    \ sweetness, another primary consumer preferred attribute. SSC was conducted\n\
    on the homogenized strawberry samples from each harvest. The samples were blended\
    \ in\na high-speed blender for 5 min, then centrifuged at 5000× g for 20 min to\
    \ obtain a clear\njuice, which was ﬁltered through cheesecloth [17]. The SSC of\
    \ the resulting supernatant\nwas determined using a Reicher handheld digital refractometer\
    \ at room temperature [17].\nUltimately, color and SSC was highlighted as the\
    \ consumer and food industry’s main focus\nfor good strawberry quality [29,30].\
    \ There is a correlation between an increase in sugar\ncontent in the strawberry\
    \ as the fruit ripens [31,32]. Furthermore, previous studies have\nreported the\
    \ quality of a strawberry is at the peak around day 28 from the fruit set [15],\
    \ so\na 28-day postharvest time window was determined for this study as well.\n\

    \ The overall framework proposed in this study\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n5 of 17\n\
    takes inspiration from the fact that the causality between sensory variables and\
    \ product\nquality can be used to develop smart control systems for better quality\
    \ and sustainability as\nshown in Figure 1. The ﬁrst phase of the project involved\
    \ the creation of the dataset from\nan operational commercial strawberry farm\
    \ in Central Florida, which included signiﬁcant\ncollaborations between the stakeholders\
    \ including the farm and two collaborating academic\ninstitutions. Once the data\
    \ were collected, they were pre-processed to group the recordings\nwithin a 4-week\
    \ time window prior to each harvest on account of the studies in the literature,\n\
    which discuss how the quality of a strawberry is at its peak between 28–36 days\
    \ from the\nfruit set [15]. After some statistical preliminary analysis [17],\
    \ which demonstrated non-\nlinear relationships between the primary input predictors\
    \ WC and EC, and the primary\nquality attributes SSC and color, two scenarios\
    \ were considered in this study. In the ﬁrst\nscenario, the WC was used as the\
    \ primary input feature to predict associated strawberry\nqualities, color and\
    \ soluble solids content (SSC) as the model outputs. In the second\nscenario,\
    \ the same outputs were predicted using both WC and EC as joint input features.\n\
    The dataset, even though it was collected over a 4-month period with thousands\
    \ of data\npoints for sensory recordings, still has a challenging size, in light\
    \ of the limited harvesting\ncapabilities, which allowed for 4 separate occasions\
    \ for the harvest on the commercial\nfarms. As a result, the dataset has 24 data\
    \ points and a relatively large feature vector, so it\nis extremely important\
    \ to apply the fail-safe measures to prevent the network from over-\nﬁtting, such\
    \ as early stopping and proper cross-validation. Leave-one-out cross-validation\n\
    was applied in training the algorithms, as described below.\nOne of the recently\
    \ introduced strategies used in training the empirical models is\nsplitting training\
    \ data into two partitions, where the ﬁrst partition is used to train model\n\
    parameters and the second partition is used to calculate model accuracy at each\
    \ step. As\nillustrated in Figure 3, two neural network frameworks were employed\
    \ in the form of\nshallow and ensemble (ENN) neural networks, the ﬁrst to tune\
    \ the early stopping condition\nand the second to train and test the dataset.\
    \ Once the early stopping conditions are reached\n(i.e., the accuracy on the validation\
    \ partition starts to drop for N number of consecutive\ntimes), the training is\
    \ stopped, the epoch number is recorded, and the two partitions\nare combined.\
    \ The neural network is then trained from scratch using the same initial\nparameters\
    \ for the same number of epochs using the entire training set. The ﬁnal accuracy\n\
    is reported on the test set, which is not included in any stage of the training\
    \ process and is\nalternated between cross-validations.\nFigure 3. Methodology\

    6 of 17\n2.1.1. Empirical Methods\nThis study includes a thorough comparison between\
    \ different machine learning topolo-\ngies which fall under two main categories:\
    \ empirical and statistical. The ﬁrst step in this\nstudy compares the results\
    \ of a neural network (NN) to avoid over-ﬁtting on a small dataset\nto an ensemble\
    \ of neural networks (ENN), which helps build a more stable algorithm at\nthe\
    \ expense of error rate.\nFor each run, leave-one-out cross-validation was used\
    \ with 23 samples for training and\n1 sample for testing. The root mean square\
    \ error (RMSE) and prediction error percentage\n(PEP) metrics were used to measure\
    \ the models’ performance for both frameworks. The\nPEP is deﬁned as the root\
    \ mean square error of the network over the quality average (QA)\nfor each feature\
    \ to provide a general understanding of the relative accuracy with respect to\n\
    quantiﬁable metrics for each output, as shown in Equation (1) below. The limitations\
    \ of the\ndataset size have ultimately determined the cross-validation size.\n\
    PEP =\nq\n∑N\ni=1(yi− ˆyi)2\nN\nQA\n∗ 100\n(1)\nNeural Network Data Representation:\
    \ Different topologies were implemented in\nthe form of one or two hidden layers,\
    \ with different numbers of neurons in each layer,\nfor an exhaustive analysis\
    \ with all possible combinations. The input in the ﬁrst scenario\nwas presented\
    \ as the WC averages for the 4 weeks prior to each harvest, whereas in the\nsecond\
    \ scenario, the inputs were the WC and EC averages for the 4 weeks prior to each\n\
    harvest. In both cases, the output was different for each experiment depending\
    \ on whether\nunivariate or multivariate scenarios were used, such as predicting\
    \ color separately, or color\nand SSC together. Each experiment was conducted\
    \ 50 times for statistical redundancy\nand the average RMSE on the training and\
    \ testing sets were recorded. The networks used\nhyperbolic tangent functions\
    \ for activation and RMSE as the cost function, whereas PEP\nwas used to evaluate\
    \ the network prediction error.\nEnsemble of Neural Networks: ENN is an enhanced\
    \ form of a singular neural network,\nwhere an ensemble of networks is used with\
    \ different initial parameters to stabilize the\nprediction. ENN was used to deal\
    \ with the randomness of each model and to improve\nthe stability of prediction\
    \ across all the models, especially considering the size of the\ndataset. Combining\
    \ ensembles of neural networks with leave-one-out cross-validation\ngave us an\
    \ unbiased and reliable estimation for the model performance and generalized\n\
    the error [36]. Each experiment was conducted 50 times for statistical redundancy\
    \ and\nrecorded the average RMSE on the training and testing set. The networks\
    \ use hyperbolic\ntangent functions for activation and RMSE as the cost function,\
    \ whereas PEP was used to\nevaluate the network prediction error.\n2.1.2. Statistical\
    \ Method\nA robust and statistical model was added to corroborate this study—the\
    \ Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR), which has gained immense popularity in recent\
    \ years—to\nexplore the value of a statistical approach. GPR is a powerful probabilistic\
    \ model to deal\nwith noisy and small datasets [37], gives us well-calibrated\
    \ probabilistic outputs, and\nprovides the prediction with its conﬁdence interval.\n\
    Gaussian Process Regression: GPR is a non-parametric probabilistic model which\n\
    uses the Bayesian approach to give a probabilistic output. It uses independent\
    \ variables to\ndetermine the uncertainty in the model prediction and improve\
    \ the model selection [38].\nGPR uses the mean of the input data, m\n\x10\nX ∼\
    \ Rd\x11\n; in the ﬁrst case, the input data were\nthe WC averages, and in the\
    \ second case, the input data were the WC and EC averages of\nthe 4-week time\
    \ scales prior to each harvest and the covariance kernel matrix, k\n\x10\nx, x\n\
    ′\x11\n, to\ncalculate the prior probability distribution and predict the posterior\
    \ probability distribution.\nGPR maximizes the likelihood of Y given X, while\
    \ ϵ ∼ N\n\00, σ2\nxx\n\x01\nis the noise associated\nwith the data with a zero\
    \ mean and variance σ2\nxx.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n7 of 17\nf (x) ∼ GP(m(x),\
    \ k(x, x′))\n(2)\nk(x, x′) = σ2exp(−d(x, x′)2\n2l2\n)\n(3)\nY = f (x) + ϵ\n(4)\n\
    Working with GPR on a small dataset helps in saving resources, while computing\
    \ the\nkernel matrix as the model complexity, (n3), is tied to the data dimension\
    \ [37–39]. GPR is\nstill sensitive to over-ﬁtting with a small dataset, so the\
    \ squared exponential (SE) kernel\nwas used to calculate the prior in our experiments,\
    \ while adding white noise to overcome\nthe model over-ﬁtting, as described in\
    \ literature [40,41].\nThe leave-one-out cross-validation technique was applied\
    \ to improve the performance\nand avoid over-ﬁtting, where 23 samples were used\
    \ for training and one sample for testing.\nThe input–output pairs followed the\
    \ same pattern as before for each experiment, depend-\ning on whether univariate\
    \ or multivariate scenarios were used, such as predicting color\nseparately or\
    \ color and SSC together. RMSE was used to measure the models’ performance\nfor\
    \ both the univariate and multivariate responses, whereas PEP was used to evaluate\
    \ the\nnetwork prediction error.\n3. Results\nThe results overall suggest that\
    \ the color of a strawberry can be best predicted from\nthe water content (WC)\
    \ of the soil averaged across the 4 weeks immediately preceding\nthe harvest.\
    \ Including the electrical conductivity (EC) in the input space for predicting\n\
    both color and sugar content simultaneously generally resulted in higher RMSE\
    \ values.\nThe RMSE results on the testing set for all neural network topologies,\
    \ including singular\nand ensemble frameworks as well as the GPR models, are shown\
    \ in detail in Tables 2–4.\nThe algorithms use the input representation in the\
    \ form of weekly averages for WC or\nthe weekly averages for WC and EC, 4 weeks\
    \ prior to each harvest, whereas Figures 4–7\nshow the prediction error percentage\
    \ (PEP) and variance across 50 experiments for all\nthe empirical methods for\
    \ visual illustration. The testing RMSE for each experiment is\ncalculated via\
    \ leave-one-out cross-validation due to the limited size of the dataset. The\n\
    mean of RMSE, PEP (error%), and variance of the RMSE for 50 independent runs for\
    \ each\nexperiment are presented for the empirical methods. Where the mean RMSE\
    \ indicates the\noverall performance of a speciﬁc algorithm, PEP indicates the\
    \ prediction error range, and\nthe variance can be used as an indicator of robustness\
    \ in real-life applications.\nFigure 4. (a) Prediction error percentage across\

    \ sophisticated models, as shown in Table 1. For instance, in some cases, when\
    \ the\nnumber of layers and the number of neurons in each layer increased, the\
    \ testing RMSE\nalso increased. Moreover, in most cases, the variance decreased\
    \ as the number of networks\nincreased in the ensemble, as shown in Figure 5b,\
    \ which means an ensemble could provide\nmore robust performance with a trade-off\
    \ in mean RMSE. The color prediction results\nshown in Table 2 display that the\
    \ lowest RMSE is 3.24 and the PEP is 8.9% from the\nexpected range of values,\
    \ at two incidents when NN with one layer and one neuron, and\nan ensemble of\
    \ two neural networks with only one layer and one neuron in each layer\nwas used\
    \ with a variance of 0.04 and 0.01, respectively. Figure 8a shows the comparison\n\
    of predicted versus observed color values for each of the 24 harvest and location\
    \ pairs\nfor the most accurate NN implementations. In a similar fashion, Figure\
    \ 8b is a visual\nrepresentation of the bivariate relationship between the predicted\
    \ and observed color pairs\nfor the same implementation. It is clear that while\
    \ not perfect, the color values have been\npredicted within a reasonable range,\
    \ especially considering the wide dynamic range “a*”\nparameter can take, which\
    \ is the indicator of redness. The highest RMSE is 4.31 and the\nPEP is 11.84%\
    \ from the expected range of values when an ensemble of two NNs with one\nhidden\
    \ layer and ﬁve neurons with a variance of 0.08.\nFigure 8. (a) Predicted versus\

    \ seems to have underperformed compared to the\nempirical methods. It is possible\
    \ that the high variance in the case of the GPR could be\ndue to the presence\
    \ of some sample points, which are such outliers that they signiﬁcantly\nimpact\
    \ the statistical ﬁtting than the empirical back-propagation across the dataset\
    \ [42].\nFigure 9 helps visualize the impact of outlier data points, where the\
    \ majority of the samples\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n12 of 17\nwith GPR models performed\
    \ well compared to the empirical models with an average RMSE\nbelow the best performing\
    \ NN topology for 75% of the observations. The error distributions\nin Figure\
    \ 10 also demonstrate that most errors occur at RMSE values of 2 or less except\n\
    for the outlier points. Figure 10 shows the error histograms for each input–output\
    \ pair\nsetup where the error distributions seem mostly identical. As shown in\
    \ Table 4, the average\nRMSE for color from WC is 3.55 on the test set, and the\
    \ PEP is 9.75% with a variance of 4.43.\nThe average RMSE for color from WC and\

    \ its mathematical importance, combining the color and SSC features together\n\
    can ultimately give us a more precise picture of how to adjust the color and sugar\
    \ content\nfor strawberries and improve the production based on available WC and\
    \ EC averages for\nthe 4 weeks prior to each harvest.\nAs anticipated with small\
    \ data, the RMSE/PEP increases as the number of hidden\nlayers and the neurons\
    \ in these layers increase. However, the population of the ensemble\nseems to\
    \ help the variance of RMSE, as shown in Figure 7b. As can be seen from Table\
    \ 3,\nthe lowest PEP is 14.04% when one NN with one layer and ten neurons was\
    \ implemented\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n13 of 17\nwith a variance of 0.03. The\
    \ highest PEP is 19.04% from the expected range of values, when\nan ensemble of\
    \ one NN with one hidden layer and two neurons with a variance of 0.12.\nThe GPR\
    \ performed better in predicting the color values using only the WC as the\ninput\
    \ compared to using both the WC and EC as input features. Not only is the PEP%\
    \ lower,\nbut also the variance in the root mean square error is smaller. Similarly,\
    \ when predicting\nboth color and SSC, using a univariate input (WC) had a better\
    \ performance than using\nboth WC and EC as inputs, both in terms of error% (PEP)\
    \ and error variance. The reader\ncan ﬁnd detailed numerical values in Table 4.\
    \ This generally matches our observations\nusing empirical models, such as the\
    \ ensemble networks.\n4. Discussion\nOver the past decade, most of the research\
    \ focused on evaluating the quality of spe-\ncialty crops postharvest, whereas\
    \ this study aims to develop a methodology to control\nthe production quality\
    \ of strawberries pre-harvest. Speciﬁcally, this paper discusses the\nalgorithm\
    \ development stage of a sensor-enabled real-time strawberry production moni-\n\
    toring system to improve both resource management and harvest quality. Recent\
    \ studies\ntried to predict the crop yield [16,19,20,34] and classify the quality\
    \ of the harvest based on\ncomputer-vision-developed methods using machine learning\
    \ algorithms [33,43]. One of\nthe studies by Sim et al. (2020) predicted the strawberry\
    \ yield and strawberry growth stage\nusing some environmental parameters (air\
    \ temperature, soil temperature, and photosyn-\nthetic active radiation) and soil\
    \ parameters (soil moisture content, EC, relative humidity,\nand CO2 concentration)\
    \ [44], while Madhavi et al. [45] tried to evaluate the strawberry soil\nnutrition\
    \ from the strawberry leaf color and predict the strawberry growth stage. Another\n\
    study by ElMasry et al. [43] developed multiple linear regression models to predict\
    \ the\nsweetness and acidity of the strawberry crop using hyper-spectral imaging\
    \ in the visible\nand near-infrared regions.\nThis paper presents a nondestructive\
    \ method to predict strawberry quality based on\nappearance (color) and ﬂavor\
    \ (sweetness) from the soil properties (WC and EC) during the\npre-harvest process.\
    \ Compared to the previous studies, the novel contributions of this study\nare\
    \ multi-fold. Speciﬁcally, it introduces both empirical and statistical models\
    \ to ﬁnd novel\ncorrelations between the soil sensory measurements and associated\
    \ multivariate harvest\nquality. Furthermore, it demonstrates that a sufﬁcient\
    \ prediction error can be achieved to\nenable a future real-time implementation\
    \ of a smart controller to exploit environmental\nand climate conditions to reduce\
    \ resource use.\nBased on the structure of the data collected from a commercial\
    \ farm throughout an\nentire Florida harvest season, several predictive models,\
    \ statistical and empirical, were\nproposed to infer the color and sugar content\
    \ of the harvested strawberries from the\nmeasured WC of the soil across a certain\
    \ time period. To the best of our knowledge,\nboth the collected data and the\
    \ subsequently developed algorithms are unprecedented\nin the literature. This\
    \ study demonstrates the performance of the algorithms through\na series of use-case\
    \ scenarios in predicting the univariate and multivariate responses in\nthe form\
    \ of color and sugar content of the produced strawberries as the most important\n\
    physicochemical characteristics for marketability.\nThe average color values in\
    \ the collected data were around 36.4 (a quantitative measure\nfor redness) and\
    \ the average SSC values were 6.4 (a quantitative measure of sugar content).\n\
    To accurately display the performance of each prediction model, these average\
    \ values are\nused to create the PEP metric such that the RMSE values are contrasted\
    \ against the average\nquality values for color and SSC to provide a general understanding\
    \ of the relative accuracy\nwith respect to quantiﬁable metrics for each output.\
    \ In the end, the models were able\nto predict the color and color-sugar content\
    \ within as little as 9% and 14% PEP of their\nexpected range of values, respectively.\
    \ Such accuracy values allow for us to implement the\nnext phase of the project\
    \ in controlling the WC based on predicted color values once the\ndesired quality\
    \ threshold is chosen.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n14 of 17\nThe authors also acknowledge\
    \ the limitations of this study. Speciﬁcally, the data were\ncollected across\
    \ a single harvest season and the number of harvests for quality analysis\nwas\
    \ not enough to create a sufﬁciently generalizable input–output relationship for\
    \ the\nprediction models. Even though widely accepted cross-validation methods\
    \ have been\ndeployed and validated, the study can greatly beneﬁt from additional\
    \ data points which\nare projected to be collected in the upcoming strawberry\
    \ seasons.\nThese ﬁndings suggest several courses of action to implement the proposed\
    \ scheme of\nwork shown in Figure 1, as part of a large soil study in improving\
    \ strawberry production\nusing sensor-assisted real-time ﬁeld monitoring. The\
    \ ultimate goal of the project is to be\nable to control the water levels of the\
    \ soil on-demand to achieve the highest possible harvest\nquality in terms of\
    \ the physicochemical characteristics of the fruit. This study is the ﬁrst\nstep\
    \ toward establishing the relationship between water content, electric conductivity,\
    \ and\nthe quality of the strawberries. A natural progression of this work is\
    \ to implement one of\nthe developed algorithms in an experimental ﬁeld where\
    \ water levels can be monitored and\nmanaged, and the harvest quality can be compared\
    \ to the predicted algorithmic outputs.\nFor example, the control algorithm can\
    \ be tested in a real-world environment where the\nwater levels are monitored\
    \ and regulated by smart controllers at the drip line valves,\nmaximizing resource\
    \ efﬁciency based on dynamic environmental and weather conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    This paper presents the second stage of a system that uses sensor networks to\
    \ collect\nreal-time data for the precise monitoring and control of soil conditions\
    \ in a commercial\nstrawberry farm. The sensor network is distributed in the soil\
    \ to gather data that can infer\nthe ultimate physicochemical characteristics\
    \ of the fruit at the point of harvest. Empirical\nand statistical models, such\
    \ as neural networks and Gaussian process regression models,\nare used to predict\
    \ the most signiﬁcant physicochemical qualities of strawberry, such as\ncolor\
    \ and sweetness. The level of accuracy achieved is as low as 9% and 14% of the\
    \ expected\nrange of values, respectively, which will enable the next and third\
    \ phase of controlling soil\nconditions for sustainable and high-quality strawberry\
    \ production.\nThis paper introduces both empirical and statistical models to\
    \ discover new relation-\nships between soil sensor measurements and multivariate\
    \ harvest quality. Furthermore, it\nshows that it is possible to achieve a sufﬁcient\
    \ level of prediction accuracy to implement a\nreal-time smart controller in the\
    \ future to optimize resource use based on environmental\nand climate conditions.\n\
    The limitations of this study mainly include a lack of sufﬁcient harvests to match\
    \ the\notherwise very-high-resolution multimodal data streaming from the soil\
    \ sensors. This\nmismatch in data inputs and outputs limited the complexity of\
    \ the model used for training.\nIn future studies, more harvest points will be\
    \ included and the effects of different cultivars,\nsoil conditions, and temperatures\
    \ across multiple climates will be studied through multi-\nclimate and multiple\
    \ ﬁeld partnerships.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.E. and I.U.;\

    \ affects viticulture by reducing the production yield and the\nquality characteristics\
    \ of its ﬁnal products. In some observed cases, the consequences of climate\n\
    outages such as droughts, hail and ﬂoods are absolutely devastating for the farmers\
    \ and the sustained\nlocal economies. Hence, it is essential to develop new in\
    \ implementation monitoring solutions\nthat offer remote real-time surveillance,\
    \ alert triggering, minimum maintenance and automated\ngeneration of incident\
    \ alerts with precision responses. This paper presents a new framework and\na\
    \ system for vine stress monitoring called Vity-stress. The Vity-stress framework\
    \ combines ﬁeld\nmeasurements with precise viticulture suggestions and stress\
    \ avoidance planning. The key points\nof the proposed framework’s system are that\
    \ it is easy to develop, easy to maintain and cheap\nto implement applicability.\
    \ Focusing on the Mediterranean cultivated table grape varieties that\nare strongly\
    \ affected by climate change, we propose a new stress conditions monitoring system\
    \ to\nsupport our framework. The proposition includes distributed ﬁeld located\
    \ sensors and a novel camera\nmodule implementing deep neural network algorithms\
    \ to detect stress indicators. Additionally, a new\nwireless sensor network supported\
    \ by the iBeacon protocol has been developed. The results of the\nsensory measurements’\
    \ data logging and imposed image detection process’s evaluation shows that\nthe\
    \ proposed system can successfully detect different stress levels in vineyards,\
    \ which in turn can\nallow producers to identify speciﬁc areas for irrigation,\
    \ thereby saving water, energy and time.\nKeywords: precision viticulture; IoT;\

    \ is getting drier, making it even more vulnerable to droughts and\nwildﬁres.\
    \ High-resolution climate data and regional climate models show that in 50-years,\
    \ an overall\nreduction of mean annual precipitation of 39.1–55.1 mm and an increase\
    \ of mean air temperature of\n1.5–2.3 ◦C are imminent. The consequence of these\
    \ changes will be the increase of annual reference\nevapotranspiration to 92 ±\
    \ 42 mm (6.7%) [1,2]. Some researchers and governments may consider the\n50-year\
    \ window span as a long time to plan and react. The news is disappointing as we\
    \ are already\ngoing through the ﬁrst 10 years of this prediction.\nConsider Ensembles’\
    \ climate projections for 2021–2050 forecasting which state that there was\na\
    \ temperature increase of about 1.5 ◦C and a precipitation decrease of about 7.5%.\
    \ The authors of [3]\npredicted an average reduction in annual net revenue per\
    \ hectare of 891.48 €/ha, corresponding\nto a 39% loss. However, it is worth mentioning\
    \ that the losses have an impact in the cultivation.\nIn particular, the annual\
    \ net revenue showed strong reductions equal to 38%. These changes in\nweather\
    \ conditions allowed the European Union to increase advance payments to farmers\
    \ in 15 of the\n27 Member States in 2017 [4].\nIoT 2020, 1, 337–359; doi:10.3390/iot1020020\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/iot\nIoT 2020, 1\n338\nOn the basis of the ofﬁcial document\
    \ of [5], climate change will have serious socio-economic\nconsequences throughout\
    \ Europe in the long term. Depending on the region within the European\nUnion,\
    \ the impacts of climate change will vary and sometimes from one member state\
    \ to another.\nDrought is likely to increase in Central and Eastern Europe. The\
    \ projected increase in drought and heat\nstress risks is estimated to be in the\
    \ period 2023–60 and is expected to result in decreased crop yields.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that annual losses in agriculture in general could rise up to 8–15 billion euros\
    \ by the end\nof the century. Greece, Portugal and Spain are hot spots that are\
    \ likely to suffer from water scarcity.\nIn addition, a study conducted on the\
    \ effects of climate change on grapevines that respond to water\nstress and drought\
    \ has shown the negative effects of droughts start even before one might expect\
    \ [6].\nThere are also suggestions for earlier grape harvest times in the future\
    \ because they have noticed that\nberries are growing under such arid climate\
    \ conditions will be signiﬁcantly stressed, particularly in\nthe Mediterranean\
    \ area. Even though the use of safety nets is not common and expensive, they will\n\
    probably be helpful in cases of hail and heavy rainfall, but with minimum improvements\
    \ in drought\nand temperature levels concerning investment cost/production annual\
    \ revenue.\nThus, the purpose of the current research is to monitor short-term\
    \ and long-term temperature\nrises, and thus detect viticulture stress. For this\
    \ reason, the Vity-stress framework has been developed\nto measure temperature,\
    \ humidity, UV levels and soil moisture to control the quantity and frequency\n\
    of watering vineyards. Additionally, water stress, leaf bleaching, degradation\
    \ and senescence were\ndetected using RGB cameras. We propose a new holistic framework\
    \ for the detection of stressful\nconditions in a vineyard. The proposed framework\
    \ is called Vity-stress and focuses on analyzing\nmulti-source sensory data via\
    \ intelligent statistical techniques and expert knowledge so as to enable\nproper\
    \ delegate actions based on both temporal and spatial variability and information.\
    \ The Vity-stress\nframework includes a decision support engine for viticulture\
    \ cultivation. In addition, an appropriate\nvalidation system is given and validation\
    \ results are discussed.\nSection 2 presents the most common precision viticulture\
    \ systems, devices, indexes and sensors\nused. In Section 3 we propose the Vity-stress\
    \ framework, and the equipment and telemetry protocol\nsupporting the framework.\
    \ In Section 4 the Vity-stress image detection process and metrics are\npresented,\
    \ and in Section 5 experimental scenarios of the proposed system are presented.\
    \ Finally,\nSection 6 concludes the paper.\n2. Precision Viticulture Systems\n\
    This section outlines the major systems and sensors that assist in the occurrences\
    \ of climate change\naccounting and extrapolation of targeted agricultural guidelines.\
    \ This means combining technological\nsystems and sensors with accurate farming\
    \ practices that provide stability and quality compared to\ntraditional ones under\
    \ difﬁcult environmental conditions.\nSpectral measurements with the use of metrics\
    \ in infrared and visible light (400–1400 nm) offer\nsigniﬁcant results regarding\
    \ vine disease detection and stress. Redundant diseases of the vine and\nthose\
    \ with biotic stress show similar occurrences, both affecting the photosynthesis\
    \ phenomenon and\nthe physical structure of the grapevine leaves, thereby altering\
    \ the absorption of light by the surface of\nthe plant. Furthermore, the discrimination\
    \ between disease and stress is a very complex experimental\naspect that depends\
    \ on environmental conditions, variety and cultivation practices used. Thermal\n\
    infrared (TIR) multi/hyperspectral and sun-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF) approaches\
    \ together with\nclassic solar-reﬂective (visible, near and shortwave infrared\
    \ reﬂectance (VNIR)/SWIR) hyperspectral\nremote sensing are the state-of-the-art\
    \ techniques for detecting water stress [7].\nA case study for the development\
    \ of spectral disease indices for the detection of FD disease in\ngrapevines is\
    \ presented in [8]. Even if hyperspectral devices far much narrower bands (10–20\
    \ nm)\nover the same frequency ranges, they offer more precise measurements. However,\
    \ multispectral\ndevices and imagery taken from UAVs, drones (of low resolution)\
    \ or handheld equipment (of high\nresolution) are more commonly used than hyperspectral\
    \ [9], due to their lower costs. Such low cost\ncomes at the price of environmental\
    \ interference and detection errors ranging from 5 to 15% [8].\nIoT 2020, 1\n\
    339\nThe detection algorithms used (hyper or multi) for noise removal and resolution\
    \ reduction are support\nvector machine (SVM), support vector regression (SVR)\
    \ classiﬁers with different applicable kernels,\nfuzzy logic and knowledge-based\
    \ rule set classiﬁers [10].\nAir monitoring is essential for the detection of\
    \ the consequences of climate disruption, such as hail\nor drought. However, such\
    \ detection is governed by sparse area clustering and periodic measurements\n\
    of poor resolution prone to errors due to the UAV’s speed, distance from the vine,\
    \ vertical camera\nlens orientation and focus. Take Sentinel-2 satellites which\
    \ are able to detect the land’s surface [11].\nAs far as camera lens orientation\
    \ is concerned, drones have been proven to be more efﬁcient due\nto their ability\
    \ to stay still and drones’ are capable of ﬂying smaller distances to the viticulture\n\
    stumps. However, GPS navigation issues leave space for handheld multi-spectral\
    \ detectors performing\nsparse measurements.\nBhanarkar et al. suggests a ﬁeld\
    \ of soil salinity and moisture measurement system by wireless\nsensor network\
    \ (WSN) [12]. This system is energy efﬁcient, low cost, portable and small in\
    \ size.\nThe system architecture consists of water sensors in which when soil\
    \ moisture module detects\nlow humidity, outputs are high level, an 8-bit high-performance\
    \ low power microprocessor and\na compatible radio module which is based on IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 protocol, such as XBee [13]. Sensed data\nare wirelessly transmitted\
    \ via concentrators to cloud data logging services, for soil moisture monitoring\n\
    purposes. Subsequently, growers watch the soil moisture on their computer or mobile\
    \ devices and\ncan water the ﬁeld once the values shown in the sensors are high.\
    \ Based on the Bhanarkar approach,\nKontogiannis is proposing a similar cheap\
    \ and WSN system to support irrigation decisions based on\na customized LoRa transponders\
    \ communication protocol that controls the irrigation process using\na FuzzyNN\
    \ algorithm [14].\nVity-stress RGB camera indexes are described in Section 2.1,\
    \ while we propose the Vity-stress\ncamera framework in order to detect stress\
    \ using 3 RGB cameras in Section 4.\n2.1. Precision Viticulture Metrics and Indexes\
    \ towards Stress\nExisting viticulture systems can be categorized into distinct\
    \ categories of macro-area or high-level\nsurveillance and micro-area or dense\
    \ probing surveillance. Macro-area surveillance is performed by\nmeans of remote\
    \ sensing sensors or infrared, multispectral hyperspectral means. Remote sensing\
    \ can\nbe performed using robots, unmanned air vehicles (UAV), GPS autonomous\
    \ vehicles or cameras in the\nvisible spectrum. Proba-1 launched in 2001 for earth\
    \ observations using a compact high-resolution\nspectrometer monitoring 18 user-selected\
    \ visible and near-infrared wavelengths of 8–12 m pixel\nresolution, acquiring\
    \ more than 20,000 environmental science images [15]. GeoEye is DigitalGlobe’s\n\
    high-resolution (1.65-m) imaging satellite, used by Google Maps, the National\
    \ Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) Landsat 7–9 and EO-1 satellites\
    \ [16]. Sentinel-2 from European Space agency\nsatisﬁes of 12.5 m pixel resolution\
    \ [17].\nIn this remote sensing process, data and models acquired from meteorological\
    \ satellites in the\nEU, such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\
    \ (GOES), for the EU and Africa,\nMETEOSAT, Soil Moisture Active Passive satellites\
    \ (SMAP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) satellites\
    \ in accordance with the dense positioning of meteorological and\ngeodesy stations\
    \ monitoring atmosphere water vapor content [18,19], offer solid grid observations\
    \ and\nnotiﬁcations of severe and abrupt weather incidents.\n2.1.1. Spectroscopy\
    \ and High Frequency Measurements\nThe main multi/hyper spectral measures used\
    \ by these algorithms in order to detect vine stress\nare as follows:\nNormallized\
    \ Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI) [7–10,20]\nNDVI uses wavelengths in order\
    \ to detect greenness accuracies, including grasses, bushes and\ntree canopies\
    \ [21,22].\nIoT 2020, 1\n340\nPhotochemical Reﬂectance Index (PRI)\nIt has been\
    \ used to detect plant water stress [23]. This index focuses on bands at speciﬁc\n\
    wavelengths where photosynthetic pigments are affected by water stress conditions,\
    \ such as the\nchlorophyll PRI index that is related to leaves’ xanthophyl. When\
    \ the PRI is high it is a stress indicator\nfor the plant [24].\nLeaf Area Index\
    \ (LAI)\nLAI is a macroscopic index of the estimated leaf area over the ﬁeld area,\
    \ by measuring reﬂected\nlight near the soil by the plants, due to photosynthetic\
    \ plant tasks. Speciﬁcally, for vineyards LAI\nmeasurements can distinguish severe\
    \ stress events only and can be used as an evapotranspiration\nmetric with doubtful\
    \ results for vineyards, due to the plant orientation (layout lines with 1.2–2.4\
    \ m line\ndistances and 30–80 cm vine distances) [25]. Similar to LAI is the visible-band\
    \ difference vegetation\nindex (VDVI), which is calculated based on the three\
    \ bands of the visible light spectrum (RGB) [22].\nSoil-Adjusted Vegetation Index\
    \ (SAVI)\nThe SAVI index aims at enhancing the contrast between soil and vegetation,\
    \ thereby minimizing\nthe effects of illumination conditions [26]. For a speciﬁc\
    \ amount of vegetation, darker soil substrates\nresult in higher vegetation index\
    \ values. SAVI is an aggregation metric of canopy and NDVI [27].\n2.1.2. Viticulture\
    \ Sensors and Metrics\nSensor deployment plays a signiﬁcant role in monitoring\
    \ of vineyard conditions at the stump level,\ncalled micro-vineyard monitoring.\
    \ This is important for the detection of either stressful conditions or\ndisease\
    \ prosperous ones. Letting aside meteorological stations operating and providing\
    \ micro-climate\narea predictions [28,29], this section focuses only on stump\
    \ level vineyard condition monitoring sensors\nand metrics.\nWireless sensor networks\
    \ for micro-vineyard monitoring are only for real-time monitoring tools\nclose\
    \ to the vineyard. Its dense spatial and temporal measurements can offer smooth\
    \ data logging\ncapabilities and timely alert triggering, indicating the exact\
    \ problem areas [30]. As indicated by [31],\nweather swings affecting strawberry\
    \ grape variety can be easily measured using HOBO sensors and\nZigbee transceivers\
    \ in the ﬁeld.\nWireless sensor network deployments offer the advantage of low-cost\
    \ implementations of\nprecise and regular measurements concerning thermal or hyper-spectral\
    \ cameras or satellite images.\nIn addition, hybrid solutions using both WSNs\
    \ and image sensing can achieve better results, no matter\nthe cost of the equipment\
    \ [32] may be. The main beneﬁt of WSN deployment is that its continuous\nmeasurements\
    \ offer the ability of climatic cartography and zoning over geographic information\
    \ system\n(GIS) layers, which can be initially heuristically assigned based on\
    \ elevation, sunbathing and past\nyield references, and thereafter dynamically\
    \ updated by WSN measurements.\nOn the other hand, the deployment of WSN requires\
    \ additional maintenance. The wireless\ntechnologies used by WSN viticulture networks\
    \ in viticulture are ZigBee, LoRaWAN, 3G/4G,\nNB-IoT, Wi-Fi and custom RF. Apart\
    \ from 3G/4G, the technologies used are of low power footprint,\nproviding battery\
    \ operated sensor motes with long lives [33]. However, the existence of standardized\n\
    communication protocol for sensory measurements and alerts makes implementations\
    \ cumbersome\nbetween different types of technology and manufacturers.\nMost of\
    \ the micro-vineyard WSNs include sensors and metrics for temperature, humidity\
    \ and\nleaf wetness measurements and trends near the vine leaf area [34]. Additional\
    \ sensors, including\nopen type rain gauge sensors, wind speed sensors and direction\
    \ sensors [35], whose deployment is\nexpensive, are part of the upper-level micro-climate\
    \ meteorological sensor grid whose measurements\nand predictions can be easily\
    \ acquired either by microclimate meteorological reference points or open\naccess\
    \ meteorological initiatives [29]. Speciﬁcally, for rain fall and precipitation\
    \ measurements, the EU\nIoT 2020, 1\n341\ncountries stationary also utilize their\
    \ global positioning system (GPS) geostationary grids [18], as part\nof the E-GVAP\
    \ EU initiative [36].\nSoil ground sensors measurements for water content play\
    \ a signiﬁcant part in the micro-vineyard\nmonitoring.\nSince vine roots cannot\
    \ reach depths greater than 60–90 cm, their water ground\nreservoirs are considered\
    \ as surface ones and the soil moisture sensors’ deployments are easy to setup,\n\
    and provide temporal predictions by utilizing fuzzy and neural network algorithms\
    \ [14]. There are\nthree types of soil moisture sensors: (1) matric potential\
    \ sensors, (2) time domain reﬂectometry (TDR)\nand time domain transmissometry\
    \ sensors (TDT) and (3) capacitance sensors. Matric potential is\nthe measurement\
    \ of how tightly the water is constrained by the soil and is measured by tensiometer\n\
    devices that use a water-ﬁlled tube and a ceramic holed tip, expressing the tube–soil\
    \ water absorbance\n(tension) to kPa of the tube generated vacuum. The advantage\
    \ of tensiometers is their medium cost\nand high accuracy when properly maintained.\
    \ Their disadvantage is that they require signiﬁcant\nmaintenance, thereby making\
    \ them a fair solution for small vineyards of less than 5000 sq.m.\nBoth TDR and\
    \ TDT sensors use guided electromagnetic waves to measure soil dielectric constant\n\
    and its variations due to soil moisture content [37,38]. TDR sensors measure soil\
    \ reﬂectance using\npulses and measuring pulse response, while TDT sensors use\
    \ closed frequency oscillated wire loops\nand PLL detectors to measure phase shifts.\
    \ These sensors are extremely low priced, 10–20 times lower\nthan the cost of\
    \ a tensiometer sensor, and of medium maintenance, which only includes cleaning\
    \ and\nreplacing of rotten electrodes. In this category of TDR soil sensors, soil\
    \ moisture resistance sensors are\nincluded, which measure direct soil conductivity\
    \ by ampliﬁcation. These sensors are considered by far\nthe cheapest solution,\
    \ costing no more than 5e, but often require monthly electrode replacements in\n\
    order to provide accurate measurements [14]. As far as tensiometers are concerned,\
    \ TDR, TDT and soil\nconductivity sensors can provide accurate multiple soil depth\
    \ adjustments. Finally, capacitance sensors\nare similar to TDR sensors with the\
    \ difference that capacitance sensors determine the dielectric soil\npermittivity\
    \ by measuring the charge time of a two-electrode capacitor, using the soil as\
    \ a dielectric.\nCapacitance sensors are much more expensive than TDR, TDT and\
    \ tensiometers with a cost magnitude\nof 5–10 times more than tensiometer sensors,\
    \ but require even less maintenance, and provide more\naccurate measurements in\
    \ different soil depths.\nSensory measurements of solar intensity and radiation,\
    \ are used for the monitoring of\nmicro-vineyards. To date, some secondary indices\
    \ are recognized, particularly in relation to grapevine\ncultivation. The heliothermal\
    \ index (HI) is the index that uses the daily temperature and solar\nirradiance\
    \ to calculate the mass of leaves’ photosynthetic products. Furthermore, the biologically\n\
    effective degree days (BEDD) is an index that uses the sensory measured daily\
    \ temperature difference\nbetween highest and lowest temperatures over the daily\
    \ micro-climate min-max temperatures [32,39].\nFurthermore, the statistical climate\
    \ indices used to characterize suitability for viticulture: growing\ndegree-days\
    \ (GDD), the Huglin index (HI), the accumulated growing degree days (AGDD—the\
    \ index\nfor predicting the grape growing stage) and the average growing season\
    \ temperatures (GST) can also\nbe calculated from temperature measurements [40,41].\n\
    The solar intensity of reﬂective photosynthetic plant radiation is measured using\
    \ by quantum light\nsensors [42]. These quantum light–photosynthetically active\
    \ radiation (PAR) sensors, or ceptometers\nmeasure the number of photons absorbed\
    \ in 400 to 700 nm band and thus provide a voltage index\nof the photosynthetic\
    \ photon ﬂux density (PPFD) gradient or the LAI metric canopy value [43].\nCeptometers\
    \ and PAR meters are expensive devices due to their ability to self calibrate\
    \ the monitoring\nfrequency range of reﬂective radiation. Furthermore, the solar\
    \ duration time is measured using light\ndependent resistors (LDRs).\nMeasuring\
    \ solar radiation luminescence, manufactured leaf-shaped sensors are commonly\
    \ used\nto quantify emission or reﬂection of ﬂat, diffuse, uniform surfaces (\
    \ cd\nm2 ), and pyranometers measure\nsolar power ( W\nm2 ) in a wide spectral\
    \ range of 500 to 2800 nm. The frequency of measurements taken is\neither daily\
    \ or hourly solar near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), infrared (IR), falling radiation\
    \ and optical\nlight energy that can be absorbed by vineyards. Pyranometer sensors\
    \ can monitor a wide range of\nIoT 2020, 1\n342\nfrequencies of either NIR or\
    \ IR received solar power. Appropriate sensors for solar ionizing radiation\n\
    UVA, UVB and UVC can offer ionizing power measurements in the range 315–400 nm.\n\
    There are also three types of sensors. The ﬁrst one is a CO2 sensor placed in\
    \ a cane near the\ntrunk of a vine plant, in the upper cane area in order to measure\
    \ vineyard anaerobic respiration.\nDendometers, or digital caliper meters that\
    \ are used to measure the swelling and shrinkage, growing\nor ripening canes as\
    \ an indication of growth or plant stress [44]. Finally, a US patent of bipolar\n\
    electrodes wrapped around the canes of a vine plant in order to measure cane nutrient\
    \ ions moving\nfrom cane to the vine leaves and plant potential is proposed by\
    \ [45]. The next section of the Vity-stress\nframework is presented.\nIn Section\
    \ 3 the Vity-stress framework is presented which detects stressful conditions\
    \ in a vineyard.\n3. The Vity-Stress Framework\nThe quantity and frequency of\
    \ watering vineyards are two important factors, especially under\nclimate change\
    \ conditions (decreased water availability, high temperatures and heatwaves, frost,\n\
    etc.). The design of decision support logic takes into consideration all elements\
    \ related to the climate\nchange, like historical and real-time meteorological\
    \ data, weather forecast, water availability and\nquality. Additionally, it takes\
    \ into consideration the age and growth stage of grapevines, the variety\nand\
    \ planting rate, the different growing techniques, the irrigation device, the\
    \ soil quality, the soil\nmoisture from sensors embedded in the ground and plant\
    \ appearance.\nThe framework scheme involves the following application axes and\
    \ assessments as illustrated in\nFigure 1:\nStep 1: Identifying and quantifying\
    \ the impacts of climate change. Concentrating on drought and\nstudying of commonly\
    \ cultivated variety of table vines. Identifying of variability level/extent\n\
    within a viticulture ﬁeld and how climate change affects the qualitative characteristics\
    \ of the\nproduct as well as crop yield are addressed with the use of cheap sensors\
    \ built in a uniform\nsensor network.\nStep 2: Evaluating the effects. Classiﬁcation\
    \ logic using support vector classiﬁer is utilized, based\non the acquired measurements\
    \ from the sensors and micro-climate meteorological station\nmeasurements. The\
    \ signiﬁcance of the measurements are evaluated and ranked accordingly in\nhierarchical\
    \ classes.\nStep 3: Visualising the effects in real-time. An additional presentation\
    \ layer provides classes and\nmeasurement visualization for the appropriate GIS\
    \ service, provided by the framework.\nStep 4: Providing viticulture stump detailed\
    \ output response to farmers. Sensors assist the precision\nprotocols’ selection\
    \ process (assessment methodology as presented at Section 3.1) and facilitate\
    \ their\napplication, using data mining and machine learning processes. Such incorporation\
    \ provides GIS\nreal-time measures’ visualization, alerts to farmers on phenomena\
    \ initiation, predicts its duration,\nalong with indications and sensory trained\
    \ model feedback for the deployed framework WSN.\nThe proposed Vity-stress framework\
    \ decision logic classiﬁcation leads farmers to a proposition\ncalled assessment\
    \ rules. A summary of the assessment rules is presented in Section 3.1.\n3.1.\
    \ Vity-Stress Framework Assessments\nScientiﬁc literature indicates that there\
    \ is a close relationship between territorial factors (climate,\nsoil and viticulture\
    \ practices) and grapevine growth and quality [46]. Precision viticulture is a\n\
    site-speciﬁc, integrated information farming system which recognizes that the\
    \ productivity of\nvineyards can be inherently variable, and consequently that\
    \ is useful to establish zones of different\npractices within a vine plantation.\
    \ Environmentally sustainable wine-making is used to optimize\nthe production\
    \ of vineyards through the use of natural resources, while minimizing unintended\n\
    environmental impacts. This is achieved by collecting measurements related to\
    \ the vine status,\nclimate factors, soil characteristics and micro-vineyard conditions,\
    \ and associate these measurements\nwith assessment plans in order to turn this\
    \ information into assessment policies.\nIoT 2020, 1\n343\nFigure 1. Proposed\
    \ Vity-stress framework that includes (1) sensory packs and a camera module as\n\
    data input; (2) cloud-based decision support logic; and (3) precision farming\
    \ suggestions as delivered\noutput to the farmers via the mobile phone application.\n\
    Rare rainfall and ﬂoods are the number one sources of water in regions that are\
    \ semi-arid or\nfully arid where it is hard to manage water supply. In this section,\
    \ proposed aridity risk assessment\nmethods, parts of an assessment plan or precision\
    \ practices that can be the output of measurements\nbased on support vector classiﬁcation\
    \ machine (SVC), are described. These assessment methods can be\npart of the ﬁnal\
    \ decision output of the proposed Vity-stress framework, in order to prevent soil\
    \ aridity,\nfuture aridity events and abrupt cases that need incentive care.\n\
    The availability of soil moisture affects both the yield and the quality of grapes,\
    \ especially sugar\ncontent and color. For this purpose, we submit a decision\
    \ on the support framework for the monitoring\nof micro-vineyards in cases of\
    \ stress and therefore the scheduling of speciﬁc actions to be taken by\nfarmers\
    \ in the context of the proposed Vity-stress output response.\nControlled Irrigation\
    \ processes\nThese are the most commonly used responses that take into account\
    \ and use existing water\nsurplus, offering time-based irrigation practices or\
    \ water content controlled ones. It is essential for the\nirrigation process to\
    \ tightly couple with the ﬁeld measurements in order to provide more efﬁcient\
    \ smart\nirrigation practices based on fuzzy controllers or pre-trained neural\
    \ networks or both [14]. If no water\nsurplus from rivers, streams, lakes or other\
    \ subterranean cavities is available, then other precision\nmethods need to be\
    \ used.\nWater harvesting\nAnschutz proposes various water harvesting techniques\
    \ in order for growers to cope with soil\nmoisture [47]. Typically, water harvesting\
    \ is a collection of runoff. Runoff may be collected from roofs,\nground surfaces\
    \ or seasonal streams into wells or plastic underground tanks. We point out that\
    \ water\nsystems that harvest runoff from roofs or ground surfaces fall under\
    \ the term rainwater. Systems that\ncollect runoff from seasonal streams are grouped\
    \ under the term ﬂoodwater harvesting.\nIoT 2020, 1\n344\nIrrigating vineyards\
    \ using wastewater\nVineyards can be irrigated by waste water. Etchebarne suggests\
    \ that in order to maintain\nquality, especially for the wine grape, growers should\
    \ maintain a perfect balance between fertilizing\nfactors which are responsible\
    \ for water quality [48]. We carried out an experiment on water quality\nand compared\
    \ their study with other ones derived from the bibliography and showed that the\n\
    nutrients concentrations and contents of the water could be directly linked to\
    \ wastewater origins.\nThe amount of water supplied varies and depends on climatic\
    \ conditions—especially in arid or\nsemi-arid regions—and whether the product\
    \ is wine grapes or table grapes.\nUsing organic fertilizer such as manure\nSamra\
    \ tested the impact of using cattle manure with a low level of mineral nitrogen\
    \ to meditate\nmineral nitrogenous fertilizer for Thompson seedless grapevines\
    \ [49]. The study lasted three years\nbetween 2004 and 2006 and the results showed\
    \ that using cattle manure at 5 kg/vine gave higher\nvalues of leaf area than\
    \ using no organic fertilizers at all. Additionally, the truck thickness was the\n\
    second factor that we examined presenting that cattle manure increased truck thickness\
    \ by about\n6%. Cattle manure increased the berry weight and diameter by about\
    \ 35.5%. That is because cattle\nmanure provides useful organics to the soil,\
    \ as it contains organic matter that helps improve the\nnatural chemical characteristics\
    \ of the soil, increasing water retention while helping to better aerate\nthe\
    \ soil and drainage. Furthermore, pyrolysis generates carbon-rich organic materials\
    \ generate by\nbiomasses, such as biochar [50], without causing side effects in\
    \ the soil, while improving locally soil\nfertility and moisture.\nWater constraint\
    \ natural materials\nAttapulgite is a natural soil clay natural material and its\
    \ characteristic is to enhance soil\nperformance [51]. It is capable of absorbing\
    \ the excess nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium and\nyields all that in the soil\
    \ and the plants. Attapulgite performs high soil aeration and increases the\n\
    soil moisture retention capacity by decreasing water use. Stocks of high quality\
    \ of attapulgite can\nbe found in the South East Grevena (mount Kisavos), in Greece.\
    \ Attapulgite products are a series of\n100% natural, environmentally friendly,\
    \ clay soil improving materials; however, they are rare to ﬁnd in\nnatural mineral\
    \ rock. Due to the very high surface area and absorbency of attapulgite in water,\
    \ if used\nin powder form it can decrease watering needs, enhance nutrient absorption,\
    \ improve soil aeration and\nfertility, increase the strength and growth of plants\
    \ and is suitable for all outdoor and indoor plants,\ne.g., fruit trees, vegetables\
    \ and vine plants. Similarly, zeolite can be easily incorporated in the garden\n\
    or potting soils as a substrate. Due to zeolites’s special characteristics, it\
    \ is an excellent material for\nuse as a water concentrate in vineyards as well\
    \ as in soil mixtures for water preservation [52]. In this\ncategory we include\
    \ any kind of rainwater constrained invention that provides this water to the\
    \ roots\nof the vine plant in a controlled periodic manner with the use of mechanical\
    \ means.\nAppropriate vine pruning techniques\nVine pruning is an assessment to\
    \ be applied for the next seasonal crop rather than to directly\ncountermeasure\
    \ the effects of an ongoing drought. However, it is a signiﬁcant measure for the\
    \ farmers\nto react in the near future.\nSection 3.2 presents the Vity-stress\
    \ system proposed by the authors, supporting the proposed\nframework.\n3.2. Vity-Stress\
    \ Monitoring System\nWe propose a densely deployed sensor network of cheap sensors\
    \ deployed near the vines along\neach vine lane. The proposed sensors include\
    \ temperature, air humidity, leaf wetness and soil moisture\nIoT 2020, 1\n345\n\
    resistance sensors, TDR soil moisture sensors, pyranometer sensors, UV sensors\
    \ and digital calipers,\nas proposed in the framework to implement sensors packs.\n\
    These sensors are provided in autonomous packs in devices that include the following\
    \ sensors:\n•\nTemperature and air humidity sensor pack;\n•\nTemperature and leaf\
    \ moisture sensor pack;\n•\nTemperature and two soil moisture sensors (TDR or\
    \ resistive) pack;\n•\nThree resistive soil moisture sensors pack;\n•\nPyranometer\
    \ and UV (preferably UVA or UVB) sensor pack;\n•\nLeaf wetness and digital caliper\
    \ pack.\nThese low-cost sensor packs include a (Bluetooth Low Energy) BLE sensor\
    \ that transmits data\nperiodically (with a duration of 30–120 s), using the iBeacon\
    \ protocol [53,54] to a central point of\nconnection called Vity-stress concentrator\
    \ (VSC). The entire system of the sensors and concentrator is\ncalled the Wireless\
    \ Vity-stress Network (WVN).\nDue to the short range communication of the BLE\
    \ beacons (no more than 50–100 m) several\nconcentrators need to be placed inside\
    \ a vineyard forming a dense WSN of multiple gateway points.\nThe concentrators’\
    \ cost supporting the Vity-stress framework must be at minimum 10–20 times less\n\
    than the cost of a multispectral camera, thereby minimizing the cost per farmer.\
    \ The VSCs acquires\nmeasurements from sensor motes (packs) called Vity sensor\
    \ beacons (VSBs), spread out in the ﬁeld,\nvia proper Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based\
    \ application telemetry protocol transmitted periodically,\nencapsulated under\
    \ the iBeacon frame [53], which lacks complexity and is more commonly used than\n\
    its predecessor Eddystone TLM [54]. The proposed protocol is called the Vity-Stress\
    \ Protocol (VSP)\nand its functionality is presented at the following Section\
    \ 3.3.\n3.3. Proposed Vity-Stress Protocol\nWe propose a new data transmission\
    \ protocol for the process of receiving of sensory measurements\nfrom the Vity-stress\
    \ sensor packs to the concentrator, called the Vity-Stress Protocol (VSP).\nThe\
    \ Vity-Stress Protocol (VSP) is designed for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology\
    \ which uses\n2.4 GHz radio frequencies. In order to construct the VSP framework,\
    \ a slightly different approach of\nthe iBeacon protocol is proposed, taking advantage\
    \ of Data Type 2 major and minor ﬁelds. In this\napproach, Data Type 2 is now\
    \ called Vity Class, whilst UUID major and minor values have their initial\nnames\
    \ as they are predeﬁned from the iBeacon protocol. The VSP structure is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Vity-Stress Protocol structure.\nIn this protocol the\
    \ existing iBeacon minor and major ﬁelds are used for the encoding process of\n\
    telemetry data, since these values are rarely used by beacon advertising services.\
    \ A similar approach to\niBeacon major and minor ﬁelds reuse for interactive real-time\
    \ indoor positioning services is presented\nby [55]. The VSP is encapsulated in\
    \ the iBeacon frame [53]. The VSP does not include the default value\nof Data\
    \ Form 2 which is equal to 0xff; that it is a called VSP class and is ﬁxed depending\
    \ on the sensory\ntype used.\nThe high-level architecture communication between\
    \ the beacon sensors and the concentrator is\nillustrated in Figure 3. Our protocol\
    \ suite operates as follows:\n•\nEach beacon device cannot communicate with other\
    \ beacon device and can only communicate\nwith the concentrator.\nIoT 2020, 1\n\
    346\n•\nEach beacon device has a unique identiﬁer (UUID).\n•\nFrames are 30 bytes\
    \ long.\nThe network architecture consists of two entities, the transmitter and\
    \ receiver, as shown at Figure 3.\nThe transmitter (sensor pack) contains an entity\
    \ equipped with arbitrary sensors and a concentrator\nwhich supports BLE version\
    \ in order to collect the results. The sensors takes vine environmental\nmeasurements\
    \ of air humidity, temperature, soil moisture, leaf wetness and solar radiation.\n\
    The purpose of the VSP-capable beacons is to create inexpensive battery-operated\
    \ sensor kits that\nmeasure (e.g., humidity, temperature, soil moisture, leaf\
    \ wetness, solar radiation), taking advantage\nof the major and minor ﬁelds of\
    \ the massively used iBeacon protocol, which for VSP are not ﬁxed,\nunique and\
    \ change based on the values received from the beacon attached sensors. The major\
    \ and\nminor values are 16 bits long, providing up to two 16 bit sensor measurements\
    \ per transmitted beacon\nframe. If more sensors are attached to a beacon frame,\
    \ time multiplexing is applied, according to VSP\nmode 2.\nFigure 3. Vity-Stress\
    \ Protocol entities: sensors and sensor packs used communicating over BLE iBeacon\n\
    protocol with the camera concentrator.\nThe VSP protocol functional states are\
    \ divided into two modes. The ﬁrst mode has the ability to\ntransmit the data\
    \ from speciﬁc sensors (up to two measurements/frame) within an interval beacon\
    \ time\nset to 1–5 min, as shown in Figure 4a. The second mode of operation is\
    \ capable of transmitting sensory\nIoT 2020, 1\n347\ndata more than two sensory\
    \ values, by sending arbitrary time frames per beacon interval, known as\nthe\
    \ beacon interval. For example, in mode 2, temperature and humidity sensor measurements\
    \ can be\ntransmitted in the ﬁrst beacon frame, followed by soil moisture and\
    \ solar radiation measurements that\ncan be transmitted by the second beacon frame\
    \ (as shown at Figure 4b). The VSP classes are conﬁgured\ndepending on the sensor\
    \ type ﬁeld, as shown at Table 1. If the value of the VSP class is conﬁgured\n\
    as 0x01, which equals το b’00000001’, then, the received value is derived from\
    \ a temperature sensor.\nIf the value of humidity is conﬁgured as 0x02, which\
    \ equals b’00000010’, the received value is derived\nfrom the humidity sensor.\
    \ If the value of the VSP class is conﬁgured as 0x04, which equals b’00000100’,\n\
    the received value is derived from the soil moisture sensor. If the value of VSP\
    \ class is conﬁgured\nas 0x08, which equals b’00001000’, the received value is\
    \ derived from the leaf wetness sensor. If the\nvalue of the VSP class is set\
    \ as 0x10, which equals b’00010000’ in the binary system, the received\nvalue\
    \ is derived from the pyranometer sensor. The values 0x20, 0x40 and 0x80 respectively\
    \ are set for\nfuture use.\n(a)\nMode-1: Single VSP frame\nperiodic transmission\n\

    \ priority are in ascending order towards the MSB of the Data Type 2 class\nﬁeld.\
    \ If only one sensor measurement is transmitted, it is stored in the major ﬁeld\
    \ of the VSP. Then the\nminor ﬁeld receives the value of the most negative number\
    \ (0x8000) so that the concentrator BLE\ndecoder recognizes that there is only\
    \ one measurement of the sensor in this frame.\nThe authors’ VSP proposal is for\
    \ an easy to implement version of a protocol using existing\nbeacon protocol implementations.\
    \ Furthermore, the iBeacon protocol maintains a Universally Unique\nIdentiﬁer\
    \ (UUID) ﬁeld that identiﬁes each deployed sensor pack and beacon Tx power to\
    \ determine\nbeacon’s distance. The wavelength of the VSP beacon can be calculated\
    \ using TxPower using the\nreceived signal strength indicator (RSSI).\nValidation\
    \ results of the Vity-stress framework are presented in Section 5.\n3.4. Vity-Stress\
    \ Concentrator Architecture\nWe propose the use of a concentrator device used\
    \ to collect measurements from sensors placed\ninside the vineyard ﬁeld. The concentrator\
    \ will be responsible for: a) collecting periodic measurements\nreceived by the\
    \ nearby VSP capable sensors (beacons) and b) collecting images from the nearby\n\
    vineyard trees with the use of its embedded camera subsystem. The Vity-stress\
    \ concentrator (VSC)\ncamera subsystem utilizes three RGB cameras positioned peripherally\
    \ to cover a viewing angle of 120◦\neach, so altogether they cover a viewing angle\
    \ of 360◦.\nCommunication between sensors and concentrator equipment is one way.\
    \ The concentrator\nequipment receives periodically transmitted iBeacon frames\
    \ and decodes their PDU payloads\naccordingly, based on the proposed Vity-Stress\
    \ Protocol (VSP). Communication is between the\nconcentrator devices and the cloud\
    \ data logging service where the decision logic resides uses either\nNB-IoT or\
    \ 3G/4G cellular technology. The concentrator device includes 3-camera system\
    \ RGB cameras,\nwith infrared capabilities, z-placed 120◦ apart. Figure 5 presents\
    \ the proposed Vity-stress system\nconcentrator prototype equipped with RGB cameras.\n\
    In detail, the illustrated concentrator includes three RGB cameras on the z-plane\
    \ that can be\nattached to a metal pole of 60–90 cm z-axis height, supported the\
    \ metal pole pointy ground penetration\nedge (Figure 5, (3)). The concentrator\
    \ device includes a 6 V, 7–10 Ah battery pack that is charged\nby a 2 W-6 V panel\
    \ placed on top of the concentrator, assuring its autonomous operation. There\
    \ are\nthree RGB cameras placed at 120◦ apart at the same height around the outer\
    \ polygon surface of the\nconcentrator (Figure 5, (5)). These camera modules are\
    \ also equipped with IR night vision capability.\nDue to the energy cost of 6–7\
    \ Ws of the 3-camera component to take a snapshot and a max\ntotal of 2 min in\
    \ order for the Vity-stress image detection process to complete and upload the\n\
    calculated indexes, the Tp period for acquiring a scenery image measurement takes\
    \ more than\n1 h, to avoid battery depletion. The concentrator processing unit\
    \ includes a quad core-ARM RPi\nmicroprocessor with 512 MB of RAM for the image\
    \ detection processing tasks. The processing unit\nalso includes an embedded BLE\
    \ transponder for the reception of VSP protocol beacon frames and\na Wi-Fi transponder\
    \ for close-range communication—uploading to the VSP’s cloud service imagery\n\
    data and sensory measurements.\nIoT 2020, 1\n349\nCommunication between the concentrator\
    \ and the Vity-stress sensory packs spread in the vine\nlines is performed with\
    \ the use of the concentrator’s BLE module. The concentrator operates in sensing\n\
    periods (Tsens). During these periods, camera modules remain mainly inactive,\
    \ keeping them in a low\npower state, and its BLE component (Figure 5, (4)) stays\
    \ in an off state. When the Tsens interval expires,\nthe camera modules are powered\
    \ on sequentially by taking photos. Then the image processing step is\nperformed,\
    \ while the BLE transponders scan and log nearby beacons measurements (up to 60–80\
    \ m\nradius) using the VSP protocol.\nUpon image processing and measurement acquisition\
    \ completion, the external communication\nmodules with the Vity-stress cloud are\
    \ powered on. At ﬁrst, the Wi-Fi transponder (Figure 5, (4))\nsearches for open\
    \ Wi-Fi access points with an Internet connection to transmit its annotated images\
    \ and\nmeasurements, and if that fails using its 3G/4G USB dongle (Figure 5, (7)).\
    \ The protocol used for data\nuploads to the cloud is via JSON and HTTP POSTS.\n\
    The cameras are used to implement a cheap 360◦ panoramic plane image detection\
    \ system that\nuses image pre-processing, mask ﬁltering and deep convolution neural\
    \ networks (CNNs) for the\ndetection of vine stress signs and yield potential.\
    \ The concentrator image detection process and\nproposed metrics are presented\
    \ at Section 4. The cameras are connected via appropriate USB interface\nto the\
    \ processing unit, capable of enabling one camera at a time. The image capturing\
    \ periods are\nset by the Vity-stress cloud service and are propagated to the\
    \ concentrator as feedback parameters\nwhenever the concentrator uploads new measurements\
    \ or images. Since the image detection process\nis performed by the concentrator,\
    \ there is no need for image uploads but detected segments and index\nvalues.\
    \ Nevertheless, image uploads are necessary for the validation purposes. Section\
    \ 4 describes the\nprocess of the image detection as well as the proposal indexes\
    \ derived by vineyard images.\nFigure 5. Vity-stress concentrator device with\
    \ RGB cameras and MCU attached.\nWith respect to existing multispectral camera\
    \ technologies used extensively for the acquisition of\nperiodic on the spot or\
    \ UAV delivered LAI/NDVI/heat measurements, the Vity-stress concentrator\ncan\
    \ offer a much cheaper, closer at real time with high image resolution. This is\
    \ achieved with the\nuse of cheap CMOS RGB cameras and the implementation of convolution\
    \ neural network algorithms\n(CNNs), for vine stress and also yield detection\
    \ [56].\nIn Section 4 the proposed the Vity-stress image detection process is\
    \ presented, which the VSC\ndevices implement.\nIoT 2020, 1\n350\n4. Proposed\
    \ Vity-Stress Image Detection Process\nFor the processing of detecting viticulture\
    \ stress using optical means called Vity-stress\nconcentrators (VSC), we manufactured\
    \ a device. This device is equipped with three RGB cameras\nwith attached infrared\
    \ transmitters, and offers night vision capabilities too. The VSC cameras are\
    \ 120◦\napart, offering a 360◦ vision coverage at a vertical height of 80–120\
    \ cm. We give more details on this\nVSC equipment at Section 5. These VSC devices\
    \ implement the Vity-stress image-detection process,\nas illustrated in Figure\
    \ 6.\nLeaf bleaching occurs at high temperatures, making the leaves take on a\
    \ “bleached” look, due to\nthermal breakdown of the leaf tissue. This process\
    \ is irreversible, and permanently reduces a vine’s\ncapacity for photosynthesis.\
    \ If the water stress continues, embolisms (air pockets) may form in leaf\nvessels\
    \ or shoot xylem, and the leaves begin to disintegrate and become senescent.\n\
    In serious circumstances, vines or shoots collapse. These cases (senescence, bleaching)\
    \ can be\ndetected separately by the use of two separate instance segmentation\
    \ CNNs that estimate: (1) the\ncoverage pixel area of senescence in vineyard contours,\
    \ (2) a probabilistic approximation of leaf\nbleaching of detected leaves over\
    \ total leaf areas in vineyard contours and (3) the yield production\nexpressed\
    \ as a cumulative multiplication of contour detection probability by detection\
    \ area size in\npixels. The proposed process test-bed outcome is illustrated in\
    \ Figure 7.\nFigure 6. Image detection process for the detection of viticulture\
    \ stress.\nThe proposed process uses four independent stages of detection. The\
    \ ﬁrst stage includes the\ncompletion of the ﬁltering, image selection and calculation\
    \ of the vegetated area from the RGB cameras.\nThe second stage includes the segmentation\
    \ and analysis of the viticulture area bounding box and the\nidentiﬁcation of\
    \ the vineyard ROIs areas. From this process the proposed viticulture leaf index\

    351\nR-CNN method adds to the Faster R-CNN an object mask prediction process in\
    \ parallel with the\nexisting bounding box R-CNN process. Mask R-CNN is simple\
    \ to train, and adds only a small overhead\nto Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps\
    \ [57,59,60].\nIn order to identify viticulture cultivation regions of stress:\
    \ The leaf regions of stress are indicated\nby the use of (1) a single shot detector\
    \ (SSD) semantic segmentation process [61], for the detection of\nbleaching as\
    \ shown at the top left and top right subﬁgures, 1 and 2, of Figure 7 a color\
    \ mask applied in\nthe previously detected Mask R-CNN ROIs, while calculating\
    \ the areas of discoloration, in order to\ncalculate areas of leaf stress as shown\
    \ at the bottom left subﬁgure, 3, at Figure 7. Then a new proposed\nindex value\
    \ is calculated called viticulture stress index (VSI), based on Equation (2).\n\
    VSI =\n∑m\ni=1 EROIi · pi + ∑l≤n\ni=1 E′\nCi\nVLI · max {EBBOXCi }\n(2)\nwhere\
    \ ROIi, i = 1 ... m are the bounding boxes of the selected by the SSD algorithm\

    \ as conﬁdence probability and\nE′\nCi the pixel areas of the instance ROIs masked\
    \ by an instance segmentation algorithm such as the\nMask-RCNN algorithm [57],\
    \ where: E′\nCi ≤ ECi.\nFigure 7. Image detection test-bed examples of the proposed\
    \ framework detection steps.\nFinally at the forth optional stage the viticulture\
    \ coverage area yield is detected and recorded as\nan absolute number of grape\
    \ bounded contours detected by the SSD algorithm, with conﬁdence more\nthan 0.75\

    \ System Experimentation\nSystem experimentation includes experimentation with\
    \ the VSP and VSP capable sensors’\nexperimental scenarios of coverage and frame\
    \ loss. Our experimentation and a validation of the\nproposed VSC image detection\
    \ algorithm with respect on detecting vineyard water stress follows\nusing RGB\
    \ images, taken from the VSC component.\n5.1. Experimental Scenario and Results\
    \ of the Vity-Stress Protocol\nVity-stress system and protocol experimental scenario\
    \ included the deployment of ﬁve pieces of\nVity-stress sensory equipment as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3, in the 2.83 hectare viticulture ﬁeld of debina\nvine variety [28],\
    \ at the area of Zitsa, Ioannina Greece, owned by the author Dr. Kontogiannis.\n\
    The vineyard consisted of lanes that are 100 m long with inter-lane distances\
    \ of 1.60–1.80 m.\nThe purpose of this scenario was to test the operation of the\
    \ VSP, and determined the maximum\ncoverage area.\nIn order for the VSP to be\
    \ examined, three beacon devices were placed. One of the beacon devices\ncontained\
    \ the VSP class of the VSP that consisted of a soil moisture sensor and a spot\
    \ temperature\nsensor, and the other two of the beacons contained humidity and\
    \ temperature sensors. Those two\nbeacon sensors included one RGB LED each that\
    \ indicates optically the levels of temperature and\nhumidity using red color\
    \ beeps for temperature (1 ◦C resolution) and blue color beeps for humidity\n\
    (5% resolution).\nThe beacons were initially placed in the same lane at distances\
    \ of 20 m (case 1) in order to cover\nas much area of the ﬁeld as possible. Then\
    \ they were switched into different vine lanes at the same\nimaginary line, using\
    \ the same 20 m distance between beacons (case 2). In both cases the received\n\
    signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the frame loss were measured, under a speciﬁed\
    \ frame reception\nwindow using 350 ms beacon interval and a maximum of 36,000\
    \ beacon frames in 1 m beacon distance.\nMeasurements were performed with the\
    \ use of an Android phone application. In this experimental\nscenario the Android\
    \ phone was placed 5 m from the center beacon, thereby having a maximum\ndistance\
    \ of 40 m from the farthest VSP beacon. The results have claimed that both cases\
    \ 1 and 2\nshowed no signiﬁcant variations in frame losses at the same distances.\
    \ The results for cases 1 and 2 are\npresented in Table 3.\nTable 3. Validation\
    \ results. Frame loss over distance for case 1 and case 2 VSP beacon deployments.\n\

    2560\n47.52\n80\n5120\n4150\n85.77\nExperimental results showed that the vineyard\
    \ did not signiﬁcantly affect the loss of signal\nbetween the farmer’s mobile\
    \ phone and the beacon device. From the Table 3 results, an energy\nconserving\
    \ beacon’s deployment scenario indicated a maximum distance between VSC and beacon\n\
    equipment of 20 m. Since the beacons were placed in the vine lanes and the VSC\
    \ must also have\nbeen in a vine lane, a VCS and four beacons occupied an area\
    \ of up to 800 m2, if enforced in a square\nIoT 2020, 1\n353\nplacement conﬁguration.\
    \ If the vineyard area beacon coverage was planned in a less energy efﬁcient\n\
    manner (of 40 m distance between VSC and beacon device) the coverage area using\
    \ one VCS and four\nbeacons can reach up to the 0.60 hectares.\nTable 4 shows\
    \ the Tx power of the beacons frames received by the mobile phone device over\n\
    distance (RSSI value is −59 dBm at 1 m). The deviation of RSSI values for cases\
    \ 1 and 2 has also\nbeen measured.\nTable 4. Received signal strength indicator\
    \ (RSSI) validation results over distance for case 1 and case 2\nbeacon deployments.\n\

    ±7\n40\n−75\n±8\n60\n−78\n±4\n80\n−81\n±2\nAccording to Table 4 there is a signiﬁcant\
    \ deviation in the RSSI measurement for cases 1 and 2\nwhen the distance between\
    \ beacons and mobile phone is ±7 dBm. Nevertheless, such deviation in the\nsignal\
    \ strength does not signiﬁcantly affect less the packet loss. For the intended\
    \ use this variation can\nbe set as non important.\nFinally, the maximum coverage\
    \ that was tested reached 92 m away in the same vineyard row and\n82 m from the\
    \ beacon device between different vineyard rows (worst case 2). The mean packet\
    \ loss\nin both cases was more than 95%. From the Vity-stress system experimentation,\
    \ the implementation\nsimplicity of the iBeacon protocol on top which the VSP\
    \ protocol operated offered adequate\nmeasurement results even with 60 m distances\
    \ between the collector device and the beacon equipment.\nThe beacon frame interval\
    \ can be increased up to 5–10 min in order for the device to conserve energy.\n\
    The Vity-stress system also presented increased scalability and portability over\
    \ other sensor network\nsystems, since the iBeacon protocol was the most supported\
    \ protocol over BLE, thereby giving the\nability for the system even to operate\
    \ without a concentrator device and just only a mobile phone with\nan appropriate\
    \ data logging application.\n5.2. Validation of the Viticulture Stress Index\n\
    In this scenario the VSC concentrator equipment, as illustrated in Figure 5, has\
    \ been tested.\nAt ﬁrst connectivity and data logging capability of the VSC were\
    \ validated the measurements of\nTable 3. The VSC equipment ARM microprocessor\
    \ included a 4G USB dongle along with the three\nUSB connected cameras in order\
    \ to upload the measurements and images to the Vity-stress cloud\napplication\
    \ service (AS). The VSC concentrator included the image detection logic for the\
    \ calculation\nof the VSI index (see Equation (2)). That is, at ﬁrst it ran the\
    \ SSD image segmentation algorithm\nusing a pre-trained network in order to identify\
    \ ROIs of interest (leaves areas, instances of vines—see\nEquation (1)), and then\
    \ applied on those ROIs only appropriate HSV ﬁlter masks in order to detect leaf\n\
    discoloration (yellowish contour areas indicating stressed leaves). The SSD algorithm\
    \ and its conﬁdence\nlevel thresholds were used for the detection of the vineyard\
    \ area segments per captured image.\nThe calculation of VSI index value was performed\
    \ using the Equation (2) where the nominator included\nonly the masked pixel areas’\
    \ sum of all detected contours of yellow mask ﬁltering discoloration that\noccurred\
    \ inside the SSD vineyard segments detected. Since the max power consumption of\
    \ the\nVSC concentrator during 4G data transmission and image capturing was at\
    \ 1.2–1.3 W, The VSC ARM\nmicroprocessor was programmed to power on once every\
    \ 30 min and to operate for 5 min. During those\n5 min of operation the VSC turned\
    \ on its camera modules; captured three distinct image frames and\nIoT 2020, 1\n\
    354\nexecuted the SSD and mask process for the VSI calculation; calibrated the\
    \ mean from previous snapshot\nvalues and the three cameras distinct frames using\
    \ an EWMA process; and uploaded the masked\nsnapshot images and calculated VSI\
    \ values from the AS.\nIn Figure 8, the top left three images which are indicated\
    \ as the number 1, present a non stressed\nscenario at the tested vineyard. The\
    \ top right image indicated as 2, shows an area in the same vineyard\nwhere low\
    \ water stress was detected, while the bottom right image shows the detection\
    \ of a highly\nstressed vineyard lane, as detected by our algorithm, and indicated\
    \ values of the VSI index. In this\nexperimental scenario the SSD algorithm has\
    \ been used to detect the vineyard areas (bounding boxes)\nin each image and the\
    \ associated prediction conﬁdence level. We set to distinct threshold conﬁdence\n\
    levels for the detection of vineyard segments in images: th = 0.5 and th = 0.7\
    \ accordingly.\nFigure 8. Vineyard stress contours detected at the SSD bounded\
    \ segments by the VSC concentrator:\nin minimum stress cases, low stress cases\
    \ and high stress cases.\nThese threshold values indicate that contour areas detected\
    \ as vineyards with conﬁdence level\nabove the threshold value are taken into\
    \ account in the VSI index value calculation along with their\ndetected conﬁdence\
    \ values expressed as probabilities of occurrence (pi). The VSI index-calculated\n\
    results for the cases of (1) not stressed, (2) low stressed and (3) high stressed\
    \ vineyards are presented at\nTable 5.\nTable 5. Viticulture stress index (VSI)\

    \ have shown that using the SSD algorithm with vineyard conﬁdence level ≥0.5\n\
    characterized as not-stressed VSI index limits gets between 0.01 and 0.23. For\
    \ low-stressed vineyard\nVSI index limits, values ranged from 0.24 and 0.45 and\
    \ for highly stressed ones, VSI index limits\nreceived values that were greater\
    \ than 0.45.\nWhen the detection conﬁdence level for SSD was greater than 0.7\
    \ (previous accurate vineyard\narea detection), for not stressed vineyards, VSI\
    \ index values ranged between 0.01 and 0.15. For low\nstressed vineyards, VSI\
    \ index limits received values from 0.16 to 0.32 and for highly stressed vineyard\n\
    VSI index values were greater than 0.32. However, the proposed image processing\
    \ results would need\nIoT 2020, 1\n355\nfurther validation of the acquired stress\
    \ index values and yield. This additional information would\nbe provided by a\
    \ densely deployed wireless sensor network (WSN) and future VSC deployment and\n\
    planned and funded experimentation.\nLighting differences are a serious aspect\
    \ for the Vity-stress index calculation (for the senescence\ndetection). Since\
    \ part of this process includes the detection of areas of color differences, it\
    \ is highly\nsusceptible to light variations. However, if performed to a speciﬁc\
    \ vineyard ﬁeld, appropriate color\nmark range calibrations are performed with\
    \ the use of farmers’ feedback in cases of erroneous stress\nalerts. Additionally,\
    \ multiple images are taken during the day and the VSI masking process is calculated\n\
    as a mean daily average value.\nVSI CNN segmentation processes (SSD and Mask-RCNN)\
    \ for the detection of leaf areas are much\nmore controlled, since the cloud post\
    \ processing training process depends only on collected and\nannotated images\
    \ from each speciﬁc vineyard where the VSC concentrators are installed. During\
    \ this\ntraining process a series of at least 500 images needs to be collected\
    \ by the VSC devices to the\ncloud application service. Then a ﬁltering and image\
    \ annotation process are performed by hand\nfor the removal of images that are\
    \ of excessive lightning or no lighting and for the annotation\nprocess of vineyard\
    \ and lead areas. The building of the SSD and Mask-RCNN model uses the\npre-trained\
    \ mobile-net v2 models where the additional classes of vineyard and leaf areas\
    \ are added.\nFinally, the trained model for each vineyard is placed on the Vity-stress\
    \ cloud repository and it is\ndownloaded by each VSC component separately. Upon\
    \ downloading the model, the VSI calculation\nprocess is performed in real-time\
    \ by the device and the mean detection process time is also calculated.\nResults\
    \ have shown that using a 1 GHz single ARM core/512MB, the SSD process’s mean\
    \ time range\nis 3–12 s and the Mask-RCNN process’s mean time is from 6 to 18\
    \ s.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes a new framework called the Vity-stress\
    \ framework, for vine stress detection\nand the application of climate change\
    \ mitigation policies towards stress. It focuses on existing\nviticulture techniques\
    \ metrics and indexes used for vineyard monitoring and stress detection.\nTaking\
    \ one step further, we propose the Vity-stress framework, incident detection and\
    \ assessment\nmethodology for the classiﬁcation and assessment of vines’ stress.\
    \ The target of the Vity-stress\nframework is to detect and analyze stressful\
    \ conditions, such as very high temperatures due to climate\nchange, water needs,\
    \ low levels of soil moisture, low air humidity and very high solar radiation.\n\
    The Vity-stress framework is supported by a new proposed real-time system that\
    \ includes sensors\nfor the process of vine climate monitoring and therefore the\
    \ identiﬁcation, quantiﬁcation, evaluation\nand classiﬁcation of the stressful\
    \ occurring events. The proposed system provides response output to\nfarmers according\
    \ to the proposed framework.\nWe proposed the Vity-stress system proof of concept\
    \ implementation is supporting the\naforementioned proposed framework deployed\
    \ with temperature, humidity, leaf wetness, resistance\nsoil moisture, TDR soil\
    \ moisture, pyranometer and UV sensors and digital calipers. Communication\nbetween\
    \ sensors and the concentrator is one way. The concentrator is called the Vity-stress\
    \ concentrator\nand is equipped with three RGB cameras attached to infrared transmitters.\n\
    The Vity-stress image detection process ﬁlter selects and calculates the vegetated\
    \ area, and uses\ndeep learning neural networks algorithms and image masking for\
    \ the detection of the vine location,\nstress and yield. The evaluation results\
    \ of the SSD stress areas segmentation algorithm can successfully\ndetect no stressed,\
    \ low stress and high stress in the vineyard. The purpose is to replace the use\
    \ of\nexpensive multisprectal cameras. The aforementioned Vity-stress concentrator\
    \ receives iBeacon frames\nwithin a beacon interval and decodes the payload based\
    \ on the authors’ proposal Vity-stress telemetry\nprotocol. The Vity-Stress Protocol\
    \ (VSP) takes advantage of the data type of the payload bytes which\nwe use to\
    \ change depending on the sensors’ measurement and the initial conﬁguration.\n\
    Experimental results show both the applicability of Vity-stress beacons (sensors)\
    \ and VSP used\nthat cover vineyard areas and log micro-climate sensory measurements,\
    \ and pinpoint the signiﬁcance\nIoT 2020, 1\n356\nof using RGB cameras to detect\
    \ vineyard stress. The RGB image stress detection process, applied by the\nVSC\
    \ concentrator, successfully detected and classiﬁed the vineyard stress contours\
    \ in three different\ncases: (1) no stress, (2) low stress and (3) high stress.\
    \ The proposed image stress detection algorithm’s\nprocessing time was also calculated\
    \ to be less than 1 min, which signiﬁes the system’s close to\nreal-time functionality.\n\
    The Vity-stress system’s deployment of cheap beacons spread in the viticulture\
    \ ﬁelds and the\nuse of the farmers’ mobile phones in order to acquire notiﬁcations\
    \ and ﬁeld measurements that\nindicate the appearance of abiotic stress are signiﬁcant\
    \ system capabilities. Since irrigation is a key\nconcept for table grape varieties\
    \ for grapevines, the availability of sensory measurements will further\nenhance\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Taking into consideration all elements related to climate\
    \ change from\nﬁeld distributed sensory kits will also provide new irrigation\
    \ practices and precision methods for\nsustainable vineyard agriculture.\nAuthor\

    Abstract

    This research introduces a Smart Watering System powered by Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) for

    precision agriculture. The system utilizes real-time monitoring and irrigation
    management to provide

    crops with the right amount of water based on their individual needs. The method
    aims to enhance

    agricultural yields, reduce labor costs, and improve water e¨ciency. By deploying
    a network of affordable

    wireless sensors in the ¦elds, soil moisture levels are continuously tracked,
    and the data is sent wirelessly

    to a central controller. Using advanced wireless protocols, the system analyzes
    the data and determines

    the optimal watering requirements for each crop. The technology is scalable and
    easy to install in larger

    agricultural ¦elds. Research ¦ndings indicate that the system can increase crop
    yields by up to 30% and

    improve water usage e¨ciency by up to 60%. Adopting this smart irrigation monitoring
    service powered

    by WSN allows farmers to conserve water, save time and money, and improve overall
    pro¦tability in

    sustainable agriculture.

    1. Introduction

    An important part of agriculture is irrigation, which makes sure that crops have
    enough water to grow.

    Traditional irrigation techniques, however, can be ineffective, resulting in water
    waste and higher

    expenses for farmers. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), there
    is a chance to put in

    place smart irrigation systems that may maximise water consumption while preserving
    agricultural

    productivity (Amarendra Goap et al., 2018, Karamiet al., 2021, Neha et al., 2019).

    The wireless sensor networks (WSN) used in this paper''s smart irrigation monitoring
    service provide for

    real-time data collection and analysis on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
    The gateway node

    transmits the data gathered by the sensors to a server for processing (Andres
    et al., 2020). The server

    then processes the data using algorithms to provide farmers useful information
    about the water

    requirements of their crops.

    The WSN-based monitoring system is composed of a number of ¦eld-deployed sensor
    nodes, a gateway

    node that gathers data from the sensor nodes and sends it to a server, and a web-based
    user interface for

    farmers to access the data (Fadi Al-Turjman, 2019, J. Gao et al., 2018). (Emmanuel
    et al., 2020; H. Ben

    Hammouda et al., 2015) The sensor nodes continually gather data on soil moisture,
    temperature, and

    humidity and communicate it to the gateway node. The data is subsequently sent
    from the gateway node

    to a server for archival and analysis. The server processes the data using data
    analytics techniques to

    produce useful information about the water needs of crops. Figure 1 depicts the
    data-§ow diagram and

    domain architecture reference-model for the monitoring service.

    The algorithms that calculate the best time and volume of water application are
    the foundation of the

    system''s functionality. Based on the crop type and development stage, these algorithms
    analyse the

    gathered data to determine the quantity of water that crops need and recommend
    applying. This strategy

    guarantees that water is only applied when required, minimising waste and increasing
    crop output. The

    Page 3/18

    suggested method gives farmers precise and timely information on when and how
    much water to apply,

    with the goal of increasing irrigation e¨ciency. The system may gather data from
    several places in the

    ¦eld utilising WSN (A. Z. Abbasi et al., 2014; H. Al-Sakran et al., 2013), which
    enables a more accurate

    depiction of soil moisture levels. The device can also spot patterns or abnormalities
    in the data, warning

    farmers of possible problems like overwatering or underwatering.

    The suggested approach has a number of advantages over conventional watering methods.
    First off, it

    lessens water waste by giving farmers up-to-date knowledge on their crops'' water
    requirements. It also

    helps farmers to use water more e¨ciently, which boosts agricultural yields and
    lowers water expenses.

    Thirdly, it encourages environmental sustainability by minimising irrigation''s
    negative environmental

    effects and lowering water waste. A ¦eld experiment of the system is run at a
    corn farm to assess its

    e¨cacy. The research resulted in a 40% decrease in water use while preserving
    crop output, highlighting

    the system''s potential to increase agricultural sustainability.

    The rest of this essay is structured as follows. A brief summary of the related
    work on intelligent irrigation

    systems is given in Section 2. The system architecture and components are thoroughly
    explained in

    Section 3. The experimental setup and ¦ndings are presented in Section 4. The
    study is concluded in

    Section 5 which also explores the possibility of further research.

    2. Literature Review

    The analysis demonstrates how water shortage is a signi¦cant problem for agriculture
    and how smart

    irrigation systems are a good way to maximise water use. For the purpose of maximising
    irrigation,

    several research have suggested the use of wireless sensor networks to gather
    information on soil

    moisture, temperature, and humidity. These studies show how wireless sensor networks
    may be used to

    monitor and manage irrigation systems in real time.

    The review also covers the many parts of a smart irrigation system, such as sensor
    nodes, wireless

    sensor networks, communication protocols, and algorithms. The ideal amount and
    time of water delivery

    are suggested by these algorithms based on information on soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. The

    review emphasises how crucial it is to choose the right algorithms and models
    based on the kind of crop,

    soil, and environment. Also evaluated the literature already in existence on WSN-based
    smart irrigation

    systems, emphasising their success in streamlining water use and enhancing agricultural
    production.

    The Agro-IoT system is one existent system that makes use of wireless sensor networks
    and Internet of

    Things (IoT) technology. This system is made up of multiple sensor nodes that
    track temperature,

    humidity, and soil moisture among other things. The central server, where it is
    processed and examined,

    receives the data that the sensor nodes have collected. The system also has a
    smartphone application

    that gives farmers access to real-time information on crop conditions and empowers
    them to plan

    irrigation effectively. Similarly, the WaterSense system is an established technology
    that utilizes wireless

    sensor networks and IoT capabilities. This system measures soil moisture levels
    and provides real-time

    information on crop water needs using a network of soil moisture sensors. Farmers
    may view the data

    Page 4/18

    and use the system''s mobile application to decide how much irrigation to use,
    optimizing water usage

    and enhancing crop yield in the process. The integration of IoT with wireless
    sensor networks holds great

    promise in revolutionizing precision agriculture and empowering farmers with actionable
    insights for

    sustainable and e¨cient farming practices (Jazaeri et al. (2016).

    The LoRaWAN-based WSN model is an other existing model. This approach enables
    communication

    between sensor nodes and a gateway node by using the LoRaWAN protocol, a low-power
    long-range

    wireless communication protocol. The gateway node gathers and sends data to a
    centralised server for

    processing, while the sensor nodes are deployed in the ¦eld to detect soil moisture,
    temperature, and

    humidity. After processing the data, the central server uses a user interface
    to give farmers real-time

    information on crop water needs.

    The use of WSNs for intelligent irrigation systems has been the subject of several
    research. For precision

    agriculture, Akyildiz et al. (2002) developed a system based on WSNs. The system
    used sensor nodes to

    detect a variety of variables, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture,
    and it sent the data to a

    processing hub for storage and analysis. When compared to conventional irrigation
    techniques, the

    scientists found that crop output and water utilisation had signi¦cantly improved.
    WSN-based smart

    irrigation systems have been successfully implemented, according to several research.
    For instance, a

    WSN-based irrigation system created by Lia Gao et al. (2013) increased agricultural
    productivity by 20%

    while using 45% less water. In a similar vein, Shuangde Zhang (2014) claimed that
    a WSN-based

    irrigation system resulted in a 50% decrease in water use and a 10% improvement
    in crop output.

    Similar to this, Joaquin Gutierrez et al. (2014) suggested an intelligent watering
    system for vineyards

    employing WSNs. The system was made up of several sensor nodes placed all around
    the vineyard that

    detected different things including soil moisture and leaf temperature. The technology
    provided the ideal

    timing and volume of water application depending on the data after wirelessly
    transmitting the gathered

    data to a central point for analysis. When compared to conventional irrigation
    techniques, the scientists

    found that crop output and water utilisation had signi¦cantly improved.

    The evaluation also touches on how crucial user interfaces are to smart irrigation
    systems. Farmers may

    get real-time data on crop water requirements and make knowledgeable irrigation
    decisions thanks to

    user interfaces. The use of web-based interfaces for remote data access has been
    suggested in several

    studies, making it simpler for farmers to control irrigation systems from any
    location.

    The analysis comes to the conclusion that wireless sensor networks and smart irrigation
    systems have

    the potential to greatly enhance agricultural water use. The choice of relevant
    algorithms and models, as

    well as the creation of user interfaces that are user-friendly and available to
    farmers, are necessary for

    these systems to be successful. The solution that is being suggested in this study
    attempts to overcome

    these di¨culties and make a positive impact on the creation of successful smart
    irrigation systems.

    A Smart Monitoring Service for Irrigation The current irrigation method of using
    WSN is new (K. H. Dhara

    and A. B. Makwana, 2015; Loubna Hamami et al., 2020), however the farmers have
    not yet fully

    embraced it. It is mostly used by researchers to carry out experimental experiments.
    A novel idea in

    agricultural applications, the wireless sensor network (WSN), inspired several
    academics to do study in

    this area. The current irrigation method of using WSN is relatively new but holds
    immense potential to

    revolutionize agriculture through its real-time monitoring and precision water
    management capabilities.

    Wired sensor systems may now handle particular challenges thanks to recent advancements
    in wireless

    sensor network (WSN) technology (Md Mohinur Rahaman et al., 2022; Mehdi Gheisari
    et al., 2022). Wired

    sensor systems may now handle speci¦c challenges thanks to recent advancements
    in wireless sensor

    network (WSN) technology (A. Z. Abbasi et al., 2014).

    3.1 Soil Evaporation Model

    Prediction of soil moisture is essential for effective irrigation management.
    The Penmen approach was

    thought to produce the most precise ¦ndings with the least amount of inaccuracy
    in relation to the live

    grass reference crop. It was found that, depending on the location of the land,
    the pan approach would

    provide us with appropriate precision. The following equations illustrate the
    FAO Penman-Monteith

    technique for calculating ET0:

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), G = heat §ux density of soil
    [MJ m−2·day−1], μ2 = 

    wind speed at height of 2 m [ms−1], T = daily mean air temperature at 3 m height
    [°C], Rn = crop surface

    net radiation [MJ M−2 day −1], ea = actual vapor pressure [kPa], es = saturated
    vapor pressure [kPa], es-ea

    The soil moisture estimation is mainly depending upon the evapotranspiration.
    The other most frequently

    used method based on extra-terrestrial radioactivity and temperature to evaluate
    ET0 (G. H. Hargreaves

    and Z. A. Samani, 1985)

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), Tmax and Tmin = max. temperature
    and min.

    temperature (°C), Ra = extra-terrestrial radiation (MJm−2 day−1).

    Ritchie purposed another method for the estimation of ET0 (C. Jones, 1990) based
    on solar radiation and

    temperature. It is expressed as

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum and
    minimum

    temperature (°C); and Rs = solar radiation (MJm−2 day−1).

    When

    A method for measuring evapotranspiration based on neurofuzzy (NF) inference was
    developed because

    it shows greater accuracy than combinations of air temperature, wind speed, and
    solar radiation (M.

    Cobaner, 2011). The NF model is dependent on relative humidity, solar radioactivity,
    and air temperature.

    The weather forecast sensors installed at the farm have anticipated the wetness
    of the soil. According to

    L. Ruiz-Garcia (2009), soil temperature, radiation, air temperature, and relative
    humidity all affect how

    much moisture evaporates from the soil. In order to e¨ciently irrigate farmland,
    a sensor-based and IoT

    constructed architecture (Figure 4) has been developed for gathering, processing,
    and transmitting the

    various physical parameters (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture,
    soil temperature, and

    radiation).

    3.2 WSN Architecture

    The mobile ad hoc network of WSNs, access points, routers, gateways, and multi-point
    relays shown in

    Figure 2 form a sophisticated architecture for seamless communication and connectivity
    among WSN

    nodes, coordinators, relays, gateways, and routers. As highlighted by Mir A et
    al. (2002), Rathore M et al.

    (2018), and P. Singh et al. (2013), access points serve as ¦xed-point transceivers,
    granting local nodes or

    those within wireless range easy accessibility. Meanwhile, multipoint relays play
    a vital role in

    Page 7/18

    establishing connections to various networks, including the Internet and mobile
    service provider networks.

    When it comes to packet transmission, routers skillfully navigate through available
    open paths in the

    network, e¨ciently choosing the optimal route. Lastly, the crucial task of linking
    the two networks falls to

    the coordinator, ensuring seamless communication between them. This intricate
    architecture forms the

    backbone of the smart monitoring service for irrigation, allowing real-time data
    collection and analysis for

    precise water management in agricultural ¦elds (Jazaeri et al. (2021).

    The WSN nodes have the ability to forward data to the access point (base station)
    as well as sense data.

    The nodes may move around and can communicate with distant access points while
    having coverage

    and mobility range. Access points have the ability to acquire and process data
    and are connected to a

    wider network, such as the Internet (Kenny Paul et al., 2022; S. M. Kamruzzaman
    et al., 2019). Layered

    construction is seen in Figure 3. Each node has a connection to a close neighbour.
    When the node travels

    farther, it connects with the access point (base station) through 2 or 3 hops.
    Low-power transceivers

    connect each node to the closest neighbouring layer WSNs. 

    Assume that there are three levels of WSNs around the base station. WSNs at Layer
    1 link directly. Before

    connecting directly, layer 2 WSNs make connections to layer 1 WSNs acting as coordinators.
    Prior to

    connecting to layer 1 WSNs and the access point, layer 3 WSNs establish connections
    to layer 2 WSNs

    serving as coordinators. The layer 1 WSN1 and WSN6 connections to the access point
    are depicted in the

    image. It denotes a hop count of 1. WSN 2 and WSN 3 are likewise depicted in the
    picture at layer 2. The

    ¦rst hop is to WSN1, while the second hop is through WSN1. For layer 2, the hop
    count is 2. In other

    words, WSN 2 is connected to WSN 1, which is connected to the access point (base
    station). 

    WSN 4 and WSN 5 are likewise depicted in the picture at layer 3. Three hops are
    required for their

    connection—one to layer 2 WSN, one to layer 1 WSN, and one to the access point.
    For layer 3, the hop

    count is 3. As a result, WSN 5 connects to WSN2, WSN1, and ¦nally the access point.
    The access point is

    connected via WSN4 before WSN3, WSN1, and WSN3. Wireless LAN (802.11b) access
    points are used to

    link the clusters. Connectivity to the Internet is made possible via the access
    points. Users with mobile

    devices and distant clients can access the archived and real-time queryable sensor
    data. The WSNs are

    shown in Figures 2 and 3. Every access point and gateway are connected. Each gateway
    uses LPWAN to

    interact with the cloud.

    3.3 Proposed System Architecture

    The fundamental design of a wireless sensor network-based irrigation monitoring
    system is depicted in

    Figure 4. The sensor nodes, gateway node, cloud, and Internet are the system''s
    four key parts.

    Sensors: The tools that gather environmental data are known as sensors. Temperature,
    humidity, soil

    moisture, and light intensity sensors are all present in this situation. The gateway
    devices receive the

    wirelessly sent sensor data and pass it along to the cloud computing platform
    for processing and

    analysis. This information may then be used by the cloud computing platform to
    decide when and how

    Page 8/18

    much to irrigate the crops. The platform may also transmit instructions back to
    the gateway components

    to regulate the irrigation system.

    Gateway: A device known as a gateway is used to gather data from sensors and transmit
    it to a server. A

    Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) module, a WiFi module, a microcontroller unit (MCU),
    and RAM are all

    included with the gateway.

    Server: The server is the key element of the system that stores and processes
    the sensor data. It receives

    the data from the gateway and, after analysing it, issues orders to the actuators.

    Devices that carry out activities in response to orders sent from the server are
    known as actuators. The

    actuators in this instance consist of a water pump, a solenoid valve, and a fertiliser
    dispenser. The MCU

    in the gateway, which gets commands from the server through the WSN module, manages
    these devices.

    A WSN has an ID and monitors moisture among other things. Every node is a WSN.
    Each WSN takes

    measurements at certain depths inside the soil at designated locations within
    a crop. Three similarly

    spaced depths of sensors are employed. A network is created when a collection
    of WSNs use ZigBee to

    communicate. Each network has an access point that uses LPWAN to receive messages
    from each node. 

    Data is continually gathered by the sensors and sent to the gateway. Data from
    the sensors is gathered

    by the gateway and sent to the server via the WiFi module. To ascertain the plants''
    watering needs, the

    server receives the data and processes it. The server issues orders to the actuators
    based on the analysis

    to carry out the required tasks, such as turning on the water pump or opening
    the solenoid valve. Through

    the WSN module, the server sends commands to the MCU in the gateway, which then
    uses those

    commands to operate the actuators.

    The smart irrigation monitoring system we suggest carries out the following duties:

    Smart irrigation uses moisture sensors and actuators to water channels.

    Installs each soil moisture sensor at a certain depth in the ¦elds using a sensor
    circuitry board.

    Makes use of a variety of actuators (solenoid valves) that are positioned along
    water lines and that

    regulate moisture levels that are too high during a certain crop time.

    Monitors evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration) and moisture in fruit
    plants such as

    grapes and mangoes using sensors positioned at three depths.

    Calculates and tracks real water requirements for irrigation and absorption

    Each sensor board is enclosed in a waterproof shell and uses the ZigBee protocol
    to connect to an

    access point. A WSN is made up of a number of sensor circuits.

    The data is received by the access point, which then sends it to a related gateway.
    Data is

    transformed at the gateway before being sent through LPWAN to a cloud platform.

    The platform''s analytics examine the moisture data and interact with the water
    irrigation channels''

    actuators in accordance with the amount of water needed and previous data.

    Page 9/18

    Sensors take measurements at predetermined intervals, and actuators respond to
    the intervals''

    needed values after analysis.

    The platform sets the preset measurement intervals of T1 (for example, 24 hours)
    and the preset

    actuation interval of t2 before uploading the programmes to the sensors and actuators
    circuits. 

    An algorithm downloads and updates the programmes for the gateways and nodes.
    Sensed

    moisture readings that surpass certain thresholds then send off the alert.

    Operates at the data-adaptation layer and, at regular intervals, identi¦es the
    malfunctioning or

    inaccessible moisture sensors.

    The monitoring system''s prototype was created using an open-source SDK and IDE.

    3.4 Experimental Setup 

    Typically, the experimental setup for the Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service
    utilising Wireless Sensor

    Networks (WSN) consists of a network of sensors that monitor soil moisture content,
    temperature, and

    humidity levels. The sensor nodes are wirelessly linked to a central node or gateway,
    which is in charge of

    gathering data from the nodes and transmitting it to a platform for cloud-based
    data storage. Figure 5

    displays photographs of the planned model prototype that was placed in several
    agricultural areas to

    gauge the soil''s temperature and moisture content.

    To operate the hardware, a software programme is created and run on the ESP8266
    microcontroller. The

    node was positioned close to the plant to feel its surroundings, and it is wirelessly
    connected to the main

    station through an ESP8266 microcontroller that serves as both an access point
    and a server. The

    ESP8266 module also communicates with the main station via serial communication.
    Each zone in the

    planted area has sensors for soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature, and
    solar light brightness. To

    obtain correct data, this division is carried out depending on the sensing range
    of the sensors. The

    ESP8266 module is used to wirelessly link all the parameters that correspond to
    the de¦ned zone before

    sending them to the sink node. After that, each sensor node''s data is assembled
    and delivered via serial

    connection from the sink node to the main station. The main station collects the
    data and uses an

    application to process it in order to decide on irrigation while simultaneously
    saving the information in a

    database. The decision command was transmitted through serial connection to an
    ESP8266 module,

    then converted and sent wirelessly to the actuator node. The actuator node then
    uses a relay module to

    operate the water pumps. Figure 5 depicts the deployment of sensors in various
    agricultural ¦elds,

    including farm ¦elds, house gardens, and plant-in-pot ¦elds.

    The sensor nodes are positioned across the agricultural area, and the data they
    collect is evaluated to

    establish the best watering schedules for the crops. The central node or gateway
    is often connected to

    the irrigation system, enabling remote monitoring and management of irrigation
    procedures. According to

    studies, using WSN technology for irrigation monitoring has increased irrigation
    e¨ciency by an average

    of 30%. Accordingly, farmers may now use up to 30% less water, which saves them
    a lot of money and

    has a less negative impact on the environment.

    Page 10/18

    4. Results And Discussion

    In addition, farmers can now manage irrigation practises from any location thanks
    to the system''s remote

    monitoring and control capabilities, which has increased production and e¨ciency.
    The Smart Irrigation

    Monitoring Service''s use of WSN has shown encouraging results. The method has
    made it possible to

    use targeted and accurate irrigation techniques, which has reduced water waste
    and enhanced

    agricultural yields. The ¦ndings from the experimental design are as follows:

    Soil Moisture Content: The percentage of soil moisture is measured by the soil
    moisture sensors. The

    results can range from 0% to 100%, where 100% represents fully saturated soil
    and 0% represents

    severely dry soil. For most crops, a soil''s ideal moisture content ranges from
    50% to 70%.

    Temperature: The sensors monitor the ambient temperature in either Celsius or
    Fahrenheit.

    Depending on the sensor''s specs, the numbers received can range from -40°C to
    125°C or -40°F to

    257°F. Most crops do best at a temperature of 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F).

    Humidity: The humidity sensors calculate the environment''s % relative humidity.
    The results can vary

    from 0% to 100%, where 100% represents totally saturated air and 0% represents
    excessively dry air.

    For most crops, a humidity level between 40% and 70% is ideal.

    Irrigation Frequency: Based on the moisture content of the soil and other environmental
    parameters,

    the experimental values also take irrigation frequency into account. Depending
    on the needs of the

    crop, the frequency might range from many times per day to once per week.

    Water Consumption: The Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service utilising WSN also
    measures the

    quantity of water utilised for irrigation, which can assist farmers in streamlining
    their water

    consumption and lowering expenses. Depending on the needs of the crop and the
    surrounding

    environment, the experimental numbers can range from a few litres to several thousand
    litres per

    day.

    The outcomes of employing the WSN-based Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service have
    been quite positive.

    Farmers have been able to optimise irrigation practises thanks to the technology,
    which has led to

    considerable water savings and higher crop yields.

    5. Conclusion and Future Scope

    Smart irrigation monitoring services using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have
    revolutionized

    precision agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring of crucial environmental
    variables such as

    humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. This technology has proven highly successful
    in optimizing

    irrigation schedules and conserving water resources, resulting in a remarkable
    30% improvement in

    irrigation practices. By embracing smart irrigation with WSNs, farmers have experienced
    increased crop

    yields, reduced water waste, and a smaller environmental impact. The future holds
    immense potential for

    even greater advancements, including enhanced data analysis through technologies
    like Arti¦cial

    Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, as well as integration with other smart
    agricultural technologies

    Page 11/18

    like drones and precision farming. To further enhance the effectiveness of smart
    irrigation monitoring,

    future work could focus on developing advanced AI algorithms that can predict
    crop water requirements

    more accurately and dynamically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time
    weather and soil

    conditions. Additionally, exploring the use of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms
    to create a seamless and

    interconnected network of smart agricultural devices and systems would open up
    new possibilities for

    data exchange and decision-making. Collaborative efforts between researchers,
    industry experts, and

    farmers are essential in driving these innovations forward, ultimately shaping
    a sustainable and e¨cient

    farming landscape for the future.

    \ \n \n \n338 \n \nABSTRACT \n \nLow yields in upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) are\
    \ frequently linked to poor crop management practices \nalong with a lack of high\
    \ yielding varieties, abiotic and biotic stressors. Drought (lack of water), \n\
    overwatering (waterlogging/flooding), extreme temperatures (cold, frost, and heat),\
    \ etc, all \nnegatively impact crop and other plant growth, development, yield,\
    \ and seed quality. Drought or \nmoisture stress is the most important factor\
    \ affecting upland rice under changing climate. Global \nclimate change also exacerbates\
    \ the vulnerability of upland rice production. Upland rice plants \nundergo physiological\
    \ and biochemical alterations as well as morphological changes as a result of\
    \ \nmoisture stress. Different moisture stress affects the yield of upland rice\
    \ ranging from 18-97% yield \nloss. As a result, crop management with broad, integrative\
    \ and multi-disciplinary methodologies is \nrequired to increase productivity\
    \ and profitability. Different mitigation strategies to overcome \nmoisture stress\
    \ and increase upland rice yields have been addressed in this review.  \n \n \n\
    Keywords: ROS; AMF; PPFM; PGPR and Sensor. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \nCrop plants\
    \ are subjected to a variety of \nenvironmental stresses, many of which impair\
    \ \nplant growth and development, reducing crop \nplant yield [1]. Abiotic stress\
    \ is the most \ndamaging element to crop growth and yield \naround the planet.\
    \ According to research, abiotic \nstressors are also more detrimental when they\
    \ \noccur in mixtures of abiotic stress factors. \nDrought, salinity and temperature\
    \ are the most \ncommon abiotic stressors that limit agricultural \ndevelopment\
    \ and productivity around the world. \nThe availability of water is the most critical\
    \ factor \nlimiting the productive potential of higher plants \namong the abiotic\
    \ stressors [2]. Soil moisture \nstress is the most harmful of these factors.\
    \ \nGlobal climate change may exacerbate the \nvulnerability of upland rice production.\
    \ Abiotic \nconstraints account for a large portion of the \ndifference between\
    \ yield potential and actual \nagricultural output, especially in developing \n\
    nations. Drought stress causes physiological              \nand biochemical changes\
    \ in upland rice plants, \nas well as morphological changes which limit \nupland\
    \ rice production [3]. Barrero et al. [4] also \nreported \nwater \ndeficit \n\
    or \nsurplus \nduring                   \nthe \ngrowing \nseason \nand \ntemperature\
    \                    \nextremes \nassociated \nwith \nclimate \nchange       \
    \           \nare abiotic factors that affect upland rice \nproductivity.  \n\
    \ \nUpland rice production uses less irrigation water \nand needs less labour.\
    \ It is suitable for sloping \nfields that are prone to erosion, as well as \n\
    drought-prone locations. Upland rice is currently \nthe daily staple diet for\
    \ about 100 million people. \nAsia accounts for over two-thirds of the world's\
    \ \nupland rice area. Upland rice covers 12% of the \nentire rice-growing area\
    \ in the world. According \nto recent figures, Asia, Latin America, and Sub-\n\
    Saharan Africa accounted for 65, 10%, and 25% \nof total upland rice area across\
    \ 71 nations, \nrespectively, equalling 8.8, 1.2, and 3.2 m ha. In \nAsia, Latin\
    \ America, and Africa, upland rice \naccounted for 6, 19, and 32% of total rice\
    \ area, \nrespectively. In most Asian countries, upland rice \naccounted for less\
    \ than % of total rice \nproduction. It accounts for 13% of India's total \nrice\
    \ growing area of 44.71 m ha [5]. Upland rice \nproductivity is extremely low,\
    \ around 1.0 t ha-1 \ncompared to lowland rice output, which is 5-6 t \nha-1 [6].\
    \ Water stress is a major limitation of \nupland rice and maintaining yield and\
    \ nutritional \nquality under different conditions will require \nextensive research\
    \ on crop selection and \nmanagement [7].  \n \n2. WATER/ \nMOISTURE \nSTRESS\
    \ \nIN \nUPLAND RICE \n \nThe major environmental limitation in lowering \nrice\
    \ yields is a lack of water. When the                    \nwater supply to the\
    \ roots becomes insufficient or \nthe \ntranspiration \nrate \nbecomes \nexcessive,\
    \                \nplants \nexperience \nwater \nstress. \nDrought           \
    \               \nis the main cause of water deficit stress, which is \ndescribed\
    \ as a period of excessively dry                \nweather that results in a soil-water\
    \ deficit                   \nand resulted in plant-water deficit [8]. Drought\
    \                   \nis \nwidely \nregarded \nas \nthe \nsingle \nmost      \
    \            \ndamaging environmental stress, reducing crop \nyield more than\
    \ any other factor. Drought is a \nmajor limiting factor in crop yields and production\
    \ \naround the world, among the several abiotic \nstress. \n \n \n \n \nLangangmeilu\
    \ et al.; Int. J. Environ. Clim. Change, vol. 13, no. 10, pp. 337-347, 2023; Article\
    \ no.IJECC.103308 \n \n \n \n339 \n \n2.1 Classification \nof \nWater/ \nMoisture\
    \ \nStress \n \nHsiao (1973) classified water stress into: \n \ni. Mild stress:\
    \ plant water potential reduces \nby -5 to -6 bar, corresponding to an increase\
    \ \nof 8-10% in relative water content (RWC) \ncompared to well-watered plants\
    \ under mild \nevaporative demand of the atmosphere. \nii. Moderate stress: plant’s\
    \ water potential \nlowers by -12 to -15 bar or RWC by 10 to 20 \n% compared to\
    \ well-watered plants under \nlow evaporative demand of the atmosphere. \niii.\
    \ Severe stress: plant water potential \ndeclines by more than -15 bar or 20 %\
    \ RWC \ncompared to well-watered plants grown \nunder low evaporative demand of\
    \ the \natmosphere. \n \n2.2 Effect of Drought on Morphological \nCharacteristics\
    \ of Rice \n \n“Drought stress reduces the number of tillers [9], \nimpairs plant\
    \ height” [10] and the germination of \nrice seedlings. “As a result, a common\
    \ adverse \neffect is a reduction in biomass production. Leaf \nrolling is usually\
    \ associated with soil water deficit \nas \nan \neffective \nmechanism \nto \n\
    reduce \ntranspiration \nloss. \nRolling \nrapidly \nreduces \neffective leaf\
    \ area and transpiration, and this is a \nuseful drought-avoidance mechanism in\
    \ arid \nareas” [11]. “High seedling vigour, salt exclusion \nat the root level,\
    \ ion compartmentation in \nstructural \nand \nolder \ntissues, \nhigh \ntissue\
    \ \ntolerance, receptive stomata that close within \nminutes of exposure to salt\
    \ stress but partially \nreopen after acclimatization and upregulation of \nantioxidant\
    \ \nsystems \nare \nkey \nfeatures \nfor \nimproved performance under salinity.\
    \ Tolerant \ngenotypes often tend to exclude salt from flag \nleaves and panicles”\
    \ [12]. \n \n“Upland rice was found to be particularly \nsensitive to water stress\
    \ during the early \nreproductive stages. Stress during this period \nincreased\
    \ the number of growing degree days \nrequired \nnot \njust \nto \nachieve \n\
    the \nnext \ndevelopmental stage, but also to attain maturity, \naffecting the\
    \ development time from seed to \nharvest. When water is retained, the water \n\
    content in the 0-0.6 m soil layer is reduced to \nalmost 50% of the water accessible\
    \ to plants and \nthe stomatal conductance of the axial leaf \nsurface \nand \n\
    leaf \narea \nindex \ndecreases \nsignificantly, indicating severe stress. Farmers\
    \ \nwith limited irrigation water can prevent water \nstress by watering during\
    \ the panicle initiation \n(PI) period and saving water for later periods” \n\
    [13]. “Drought stress at the reproductive stage \nlowered plant height, the number\
    \ of days to \ncomplete heading, flag leaf area, chlorophyll \ncontent, and panicles\
    \ hill by a significant amount” \n[14]. \n \nDrought before and after heading\
    \ significantly \nimpacts brown and milled rice rates by lowering \nquality. It\
    \ also has an impact on tillering, floret \ninitiation and subsequent spikelet\
    \ sterility, as well \nas grain filling and the terminal period of rice \ncultivation\
    \ (Table 1). “Terminal drought is the \nmost destructive abiotic stress factor\
    \ for rice \ngrain yield. Plant antioxidant responses were \naltered in several\
    \ studies on the effects of \ndrought \nstress \nand \ndehydration, \nshowing\
    \ \nphysiological adaptability” [15]. \n \nTable 1. Effect of stress at the reproductive\
    \ \nstage on yield of upland rice [16] \n \nS. No. \nStress \nYield loss \n1.\
    \ \n \nMild \n18–39% \n2. \n \nModerate \n70–75% \n3. \n \nSevere \n80–97% \n\
    \ \n2.3 Effect on Physiological Aspects \n \n“Drought stress impacts a variety\
    \ of physiological \nsystems in plants and causes a variety of \nphysiological\
    \ responses that enable them to \nadapt to drought stress. \nIncreased \nwater\
    \ \nproductivity during water stress necessitates the \noptimization \nof \nvarious\
    \ \nphysiological \nmechanisms” [17]. The understanding of rice's \nphysiological\
    \ reactions to drought should aid \nongoing \nresearch \ninto \ndeveloping \n\
    drought \nresistance in upland rice. \n \na. Effect on Photosynthesis: Due to\
    \ a \ndecrease in Rubisco activity, a Calvin cycle \nenzyme, severe drought conditions\
    \ inhibit \nphotosynthesis \n[18]. \nHowever, \nas \na \nprotective mechanism,\
    \ the quantity of \nRubisco activase increases during drought \nstress, which\
    \ rescues Rubisco sites [19]. \nThe \nenzymes \ninvolved \nin \nC4 \nphotosynthesis\
    \ are more drought-resistant \nthan those engaged in C3 photosynthesis, \naccording\
    \ to Pandey and Shukla [20]. Over \nreduction of the photosynthetic electron \n\
    transport chain may occur if PSII activity \n \n \n \n \nLangangmeilu et al.;\
    \ Int. J. Environ. Clim. Change, vol. 13, no. 10, pp. 337-347, 2023; Article no.IJECC.103308\
    \ \n \n \n \n340 \n \nexceeds demand, which increases the \ncreation of reactive\
    \ oxygen species (ROS). \nAs a result, there must be a balance \nbetween photochemical\
    \ activity and photo \nassimilates demand. Drought drastically \nreduces PSII\
    \ activity in rice plant flag \nleaves, according to Pieters and Souki \n[21].\
    \ “Drought also has a deleterious \ninfluence on photosynthesis by affecting \n\
    photosynthetic \npigments. \nChanges \nin \nphotosynthetic pigment concentrations\
    \ are \ndirectly linked to plant biomass and yield” \n[22]. “Other pigment carotenoids\
    \ play \nfurther roles in the structure of chloroplast \nphotosystems, \nlight-harvesting\
    \ \nand \nphotoprotection, as well as helping plants \nto endure drought” [23].\
    \  \n \n“Plants grown under water-deficient conditions \nhave reduced stomatal\
    \ conductivity to conserve \nwater. Due to decreased stomatal conductance, \n\
    carbon monoxide (IV) fixation is reduced and \nphotosynthesis rate decreased,\
    \ resulting in less \nanabolic production for plant growth and yield. \nThe highest\
    \ stomatal conductance was recorded \nat 77 DAS while the lowest at DAS of upland\
    \ \nrice” [24].  \n \nb. Effect on protein and Lipid synthesis: \nWater deficit\
    \ brings about quantitative and \nqualitative changes in plant proteins. In \n\
    general, proteins in the plant decrease \nduring \nwater \ndeficiency \ndue \n\
    to \nthe \nsuppressed synthesis, more pronounced in \nC3 \nthan \nC4. \nThe \n\
    main \nproteins \nsynthesized in response to water stress \nare late embryogenesis\
    \ abundant (LEA)-\ntype proteins, desiccation stress proteins, \nproteins that\
    \ respond to ABA, dehydrins, \ncold \nregulation \nproteins, \nproteases, \nenzymes\
    \ required for the biosynthesis of \nvarious \nOsmo \nprotectants, \nthe \ndetoxification\
    \ enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX, \nPOD, GR). \n \nWater deprivation affects nitrogen\
    \ metabolism in \nplants and water-deprived plants have been \nfound to initiate\
    \ protein hydrolysis, resulting in an \nincrease in amino acids in plant tissues\
    \ [24].  \n \nABA is a growth regulator, involved in stress \ntolerance. A dynamic\
    \ accumulation of ABA in \nresponse to water stress has been well studied in \n\
    rice. It has a role in mediating plant responses \nagainst drought stress conditions\
    \ through a \nseries of signal transduction pathways.  \nDrought results in the\
    \ variation of fatty acids \ncomposition. Lipid peroxidation is the well-known\
    \ \neffect of drought and many other environmental \nstresses via oxidative damage.\
    \  \n \nc.  Oxidative \nstress \naccompanied \nby \ndrought stress: “Enzymatic\
    \ antioxidants \nare superoxide dismutase (SOD) and \nperoxide dismutase (POD),\
    \ while non-\nenzymatic ones are ascorbic acid and \nalpha-tocopherol. Superoxide\
    \ dismutase \n(SOD) is an enzyme that alternately \ncatalyzes the dismutation\
    \ (or partitioning) \nof the superoxide radical into either \nordinary \nmolecular\
    \ \noxygen \n(O2) \nor \nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Superoxide is \nproduced as\
    \ a by-product of oxygen \nmetabolism and, if not regulated, causes \nmany types\
    \ of cell damage” [24]. The non-\nenzymatic \nplant \nantioxidants \ncan \nbe\
    \ \nclassified into two major types:(1) Ascorbic \nacid AA-like scavengers and\
    \ (2) pigments \nsuch as carotenoids.  \n \n“Defence mechanisms in the crop for\
    \ restricting \nthe damage caused by ROS can be done by \nincreasing antioxidants,\
    \ either enzymatic or non-\nenzymatic antioxidants. These antioxidants have \n\
    a role in protecting the crop from damage due to \noxidative stress” [25]. Boy\
    \ et al. [26] observed \nthat “drought induces the production of ROS and \nantioxidant\
    \ activity of four local upland rice \ncultivars in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.\
    \ Drought \ntolerant cultivars of Habo and Sunggul had \nhigher activities of\
    \ SOD, POD, AAred as well as \nα-Toch with lower content on free radicals of O2\n\
    - \nand H2O2 compared to non-drought tolerant \ncultivars”. \n \n4. MITIGATION\
    \ \nSTRATEGIES \nFOR \nDROUGHT STRESS IN UPLAND \nRICE \n \nIt includes the use\
    \ of drought-resistant varieties, \ntillage, \nmoisture \nconservation \ntechniques,\
    \ \nirrigation scheduling, adjusting the date of \nsowing, seed priming, use of\
    \ growth regulators, \nsilicon, antitranspirants, CaCl2, biofertilizers, etc.\
    \ \n \n3.1 Varieties  \n \nThe first drought tolerant, early duration (90-95 \n\
    days) variety Vandana was developed in 1992 \nfrom Central Rainfed Upland Rice\
    \ Research \nStation of Central Rice Research Institute at \nHazaribag, using\
    \ drought tolerant and high \n \n \n \n \nLangangmeilu et al.; Int. J. Environ.\
    \ Clim. Change, vol. 13, no. 10, pp. 337-347, 2023; Article no.IJECC.103308 \n\
    \ \n \n \n341 \n \nyielding indica genotypes. Further efforts led to \nthe development\
    \ of varieties like Anjali (2002), \nVirendra (2006), CR Dhan 40 (2008) and \n\
    Sahbhagidhan (2011). lndira Barani dhan-1 and \nShushk Samrat were developed and\
    \ released \nsimultaneously at IGKV, Raipur, and NDUA&T, \nFaizabad, \nrespectively.\
    \ \nIn \n2005, \nDFID \n(Department for International Development) and \nBirsa\
    \ \nAgricultural \nUniversity \nin \nRanchi \ncollaborated to develop two popular\
    \ upland \ncultivars, BVD109 and BVD110 [27]. Pandey and \nVelasco [28] listed\
    \ the characteristics of upland \nrice varieties such as short duration rice cultivars,\
    \ \nmodified root systems with thicker and deep \npenetrating roots, lodging resistance,\
    \ early vigour \nand drought tolerance. \n \n“Rice cv. Tulsi is recommended for\
    \ Eastern India, \nfor upland ecological cultivation systems where a \ncrop experiences\
    \ natural cycles of water deficit \nand water sufficiency, depending upon the\
    \ \nmonsoon rains” (Srivalli et al., 2003). Jinsy \n(2015) compared four different\
    \ varieties like \nAiswarya, Uma, MAS 946 -1 (Sharada) and PMK \n(R) 3 under flooded\
    \ and aerobic conditions. The \neffect of varieties on water productivity, rooting\
    \ \ndepth and root volume was significant, with MAS \n946 –1 (Sharada) recording\
    \ higher values. \nMagwanga and Kirungu, [24] observed “a \nsignificant reduction\
    \ in yield from two upland rice \nvarieties IRAT 109 and Lemont under water \n\
    deficit but IRAT 109 exhibited a relatively higher \nyield index under water deficit\
    \ conditions. The \nimproved yield could be attributed to the ability to \nescape\
    \ drought conditions due to its ability to \nmature early”. \n \n3.2 Tillage \n\
    \ \nYoichiro et al. [29] investigated how upland rice \nresponded to various agronomic\
    \ approaches and \nfound that harvest index, root length, and grain \nyield were\
    \ all higher with deep tillage and straw \nmulch. While Gopal et al. [30] reported\
    \ that “soil \nstructure is improved in upland rice grown under \nzero tilled\
    \ direct-seeded rice (ZTDSR) due to \nreduced compaction from zero tillage”. Zero\
    \ \ntillage beds also provide the opportunity for \nmechanical weed control and\
    \ improved fertilizer \nplacement as existing weeds are burned down \nby using\
    \ herbicides such as paraquat @ 0.5 kg \na.i. ha-1or glyphosate @ 1.0 kg a.i.\
    \ ha-1. \n \nNo-till with 100% covered surface with residues \nstored (122–172\
    \ mm) more soil moisture (0–40 \ncm soil depth) in comparison with that for the\
    \ \nconventional \ntillage \nwith \n100% \nresidue \nincorporation (110–161 mm)\
    \ and enhanced \nproductivity and profitability of upland rice [31]. \nUpland\
    \ \nrice \ngrown \nunder \nrice–rapeseed \n(Brassica campestris Var. Toria) system\
    \ in \nrainfed conditions with two tillage systems CsT- \nconservation \nand \n\
    CT- \nconventional \ntillage, \nsignificantly showed lower bulk density and \n\
    penetration resistance (0–15 cm) and higher \nwater infiltration rate under CsT\
    \ than CT. The soil \nwater holding capacity (WHC) and soil moisture \ncontent\
    \ (SMC) in rapeseed were significantly \nhigher under CsT than those under CT\
    \ at 0-\n15 cm and 15–30 cm depths according to Das et \nal. [32].  \n \n3.3 Seed\
    \ Priming  \n \nIt is a viable and instant method for establishing \ndrought tolerance\
    \ in rice. Seed priming is the \nprocess of hardening the protoplasm of seeds.\
    \ \nThere are many types of priming such as hydro \npriming, \nhalo \npriming,\
    \ \nosmopriming \nand \nhormonal priming. When compared to non-\nprimed seeds,\
    \ Sheela [33] found that seed \ntreatment with water for 12 hours and KCl (2.5%)\
    \ \nfor 18 hours produced the highest grain and \nstraw production. Brooks et\
    \ al. [34] evaluated the \nbenefit of different seed priming found that seeds\
    \ \nprimed with 0.05% MgCl2 were highly effective in \nimproving a variety of\
    \ attributes such as mean \nemergence time (MET), emergence index (EI), \nvigour\
    \ index (VI), and fresh and dry weight of \nshoot and root. Under normal, mild\
    \ drought \nstress, and severe salinity stress, the METs of \nhydro primed (control)\
    \ seed were 1.08, 4.70, and \n4.70 days, respectively, but the METs of seed \n\
    primed with MgCl2 seed were 0.53, 3.40, and \n1.63 days. The results demonstrated\
    \ that \nosmopriming with 0.05% MgCl2 is an effective \nstrategy for helping upland\
    \ rice seedlings resist \nabiotic stress conditions by improving seed \nemergence\
    \ and seedling growth. \n \n3.4 Sowing \n \nBased on weather forecasting, proper\
    \ planning of \nsowing time is required. Timely sowing ensures \nhigher rainwater\
    \ use efficiency. Early or delayed \nsowing leads to lower rice production. The\
    \ best \ntime to seed direct-seeded rice (DSR) is about \n10-15 days before the\
    \ monsoon begins to \nmaximize the utilization of monsoon rain [35]. \n \n“Method\
    \ \nof \nsowing \nincludes \nbroadcasting, \ndibbling and row seeding by using\

    \ under appropriate management were \n300 and 400 seeds m-2 (67.5 and 90 kg ha-1for\

    \ of “pregerminated seeds \nresulted in higher growth attributes and yield. To\
    \ \nensure uniform crop establishment, upland rice \nshould not be drilled deeper\
    \ than 2.5 cm and \nplanting at the optimal time increases total yield \nby 40-50%\
    \ and improves rainwater usage \nefficiency” [35].  \n \n3.5 Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ \n \n“Proper irrigation scheduling enables the farmers \nto schedule water rotation\
    \ among the various \nfields to minimize crop water stress and \nmaximize the\
    \ yield. It reduces the cost of water \nand labour. The most used irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nmethod is the IW/CPE ratio method i.e. the ratio \nof irrigation water (IW)\
    \ applied to cumulative pan \nevaporation (CPE). Narrower the ratio, the wider\
    \ \nthe irrigation interval. Higher grain yield, straw \nyield and biological\
    \ yield were observed when \nirrigated at IW/CPE ratio of 1.2” (Jolly, 2017).\
    \ \nAparna (2017) observed higher grain yield, straw \nyield and HI were observed\
    \ when irrigated at 3 \ncm depth at 10 mm CPE. \n \n“Irrigation schedule for rice\
    \ under limited water \nsources: \nFor \nsummer \nrice \nunder \nlimited \nresources\
    \ of water, phasic stress irrigation can \nbe practiced to the advantage of saving\
    \ a \nsubstantial quantity of irrigation water without any \nsignificant reduction\
    \ in yield. About 20-30% more \narea can be irrigated with the same water \nresources\
    \ by adopting one of the following \nphasic stress irrigations given below. Depending\
    \ \nupon the schedule, water-saving ranges from 24-\n36% of the requirement for\
    \ 5 cm continuous \nsubmergence \nthroughout \nthe \ncrop \ngrowth”          \
    \    \n[37]. \n \nMicro irrigation methods: Nowadays micro-\nirrigation is gaining\
    \ popularity among rice \nfarmers. “Sprinkler and drip irrigation methods \nhave\
    \ the potential to increase irrigation water           \nuse efficiency by reducing\
    \ runoff and deep \ndrainage \nlosses \nand \nevaporation. \nGrowth \nattributes\
    \ such as plant height and tiller              \nnumber hill-¹ were found to be\
    \ higher under \nsprinkler irrigation at 125% Epan” [38]. Anusha et \nal. [39]\
    \ reported that drip irrigation at 2.0 Epan \nthroughout \ngrowth \nstages \n\
    recorded \nhigher \nproductive tillers (no hill-1), panicle length, panicle \n\
    weight, grain and straw yield. \n \n3.6 Moisture Conservation Methods \n \nMulching\
    \ is the one of moisture conservation \nmethods. It will reduce evaporation losses\
    \               \nand thereby increases soil moisture storage. \nOrganic and polythene\
    \ mulches are the two \ntypes used in upland conditions. Ellilot et al. [40] \n\
    reported that rice straw mulch with 3 t ha-1 \nrecorded \nhigher \nroot \nbiomass,\
    \ \nshoot                    \nbiomass and yield compared with no straw \nmulch.\
    \ Yadav et al. [31] also observed that “no-\ntill with 100% covered surface with\
    \ residues \nalong with brown manuring (BM) stored (122–\n172 mm) more soil moisture\
    \ (0–40 cm soil \ndepth), recorded the lowest weed biomass and \ndensity. Therefore,\
    \ the cultivation of upland rice \nusing no-till along with BM mulching enhanced\
    \ \nthe productivity and profitability of rice cultivation \nin Indi”a. \n \n\
    3.7 Use of Silicon and CaCl2 \n \n“Silicon can alleviate water stress by decreasing\
    \ \ntranspiration. Transpiration from the leaves \noccurs mainly through the stomata\
    \ and partly \nthrough the cuticle. As Si is deposited beneath \nthe cuticle of\
    \ the leaves forming a Si-cuticle \ndouble layer, the transpiration through the\
    \ cuticle \nmay decrease by Si deposition” [41]. “Calcium \nhas been shown to\
    \ ameliorate the adverse \neffects of water stress on plants and is involved \n\
    in signalling anti-drought responses. Calcium \nappears to play a central role\
    \ in many defense \nmechanisms that are induced by drought, and \nCa2+ signalling\
    \ is required for the acquisition of \ndrought tolerance or resistance. Application\
    \ of \nCaCl2 (1%) as seed treatment helped in \nmitigating the harmful effect\
    \ of drought stress” \n(Devi, 2013). \n \n3.8 Use \nof \nBiofertilizers \nand\
    \ \nMicroorganism \n \nPink \nPigmented \nFacultative \nMethylotrophs \n(PPFM)\
    \ are methylobacterium that can reduce \ndrought stress by producing ROS scavenging\
    \ \nenzymes, by increased production of proline and \nproduction of ACC deaminase\
    \ which converts \nACC to ammonia and alpha-keto butarate \nwherein normal reaction\
    \ ethylene formation \noccurs. Other biofertilizers like Trichoderma, \n \n \n\

    \ 337-347, 2023; Article no.IJECC.103308 \n \n \n \n343 \n \nVAM can be used to\
    \ mitigate against stress as \ntheir colonization in the root reduces drought-\n\
    induced changes by enhanced root growth, \nimproved acquisition and storage of\
    \ water in rice.  \n“Upland rice is a rice ecotype that differs from \nirrigated\
    \ ecotype rice; it is adapted to both \ndrought \nstress \nand \naerobic \nconditions.\
    \                  \nBacteria and fungi were isolated from roots of \nupland rice\
    \ in Xishuangbanna, China and the \nPGP ability of 17 endophytic and 10 rhizospheric\
    \ \nisolates from upland rice roots was evaluated \nunder \nwell-irrigated \n\
    and \ndrought-stress \nconditions, and 9 fungal strains increased rice \nseedling\
    \ shoot length, shoot and root fresh \nweight, \nantioxidant \ncapability \nand\
    \ \nproline \ncontents” [42]. \n \nManagement of drought stress through the \n\
    application \nof \nplant \ngrowth \npromoting \nrhizobacteria (PGPR) is now considered\
    \ an \neffective strategy in the present scenario of \naltered environmental conditions\
    \ of the world. \nKarmakar et al. [43] isolated some potential \nmicrobial resources\
    \ (PGPR) from drought-\naffected upland rice fields rhizospheric soils of \nSouth\
    \ Bengal. Isolate 1 and 6 showing PGP \ntraits \nwere \nidentified \nas \nspecies\
    \ \nof \nMycobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp. and both \norganisms showed a positive\
    \ influence (through \nan increase in germination percentage, root \ngrowth, shoot\
    \ growth, fresh weight and dry \nweight) \non \nthe \nstudied \nrice \ngrowth\
    \ \nand \ndevelopment under induced drought. Hence, \nthese two isolates are expected\
    \ to alleviate \ndrought stress in the upland rice for their                 \
    \ \nnature of plant growth promotion under drought \nstress. \n \n3.9. Biotechnological\

    \                   \n[4]. \n \n3.10 Sensor  \n \nDursun \nand \nOzden, \n[46]\
    \ \nconducted \n“an \nexperiment using a wireless sensor network for \nlow-cost\
    \ wireless controlled irrigation solutions \nand real time monitoring of the water\
    \ content of \nsoil. Data acquisition is performed by using solar \npowered wireless\
    \ acquisition stations for the \npurpose of control of valves for irrigation.\
    \ The \nBase station unit is programmed to read and to \nevaluate sensors data,\
    \ to control valves and to \ncommunicate with other units. 10 HS coded pre-\n\
    calibrated Soil Moisture Sensor of Decagon has \nbeen used to measure the water\
    \ content of soil. \nThe sensor unit sends moisture data with sensor \nnumber.\
    \ The Valve unit changes the position (on \nor off) after receiving the data from\
    \ Base station \nunit and the irrigation system start to work. The \nobtained\
    \ irrigation system not only prevents \nmoisture stress due to climate change\
    \ but also \ndiminished excessive water usage, ensuring of \nrapid growing weeds\
    \ and derogating salification. \nCost effective solar power can be the answer\
    \ for \nall our energy needs. Solar powered smart \nirrigation systems are the\
    \ answer poor farmer”. \nSimilarly, Harishankar et al. [47] performed “a \ncase\
    \ study on power-efficient water irrigation \nsystem using solar power in which\
    \ the controller \nwas connected to the soil sensor and water \nsupply valve.\
    \ The water valve was turned \nON/OFF based on the water level monitored by \n\
    the \nmoisture \nsensor. \nWhen \nthe \nsoil                      \nmoisture content\
    \ reaches the required value,                \nthe valve is fully closed and power\
    \ to driver \ncircuit is killed and controller is put into                   \
    \       \nsleep \nmode \nfor \nlow \npower \nconsumption.                    \
    \ \nVisa vice, when the moisture in the soil is dried \ndue to high temperatures\
    \ under changing \nclimate. This way the whole system works \nautomatically \n\
    and \nhelps \nto \nmitigate \nthe             \nmoisture stress effect on crops\
    \ under changing \nclimate”.  \n \nSensor-based IoT system was used for water\
    \ \nirrigation by Kansara et al. (2015) in which the \ncontroller controlled the\
    \ opening and closing of a \nsolenoid valve based on the water level of the \n\
    soil. A series of weather alerts were sent to the \nuser via a mobile application\
    \ to update the \ntemperature and humidity of the environment \nunder changing\
    \ climate, which had a direct \ninfluence on the water level of the soil. This\
    \ way \nit helps plants to avoid stress conditions. Using \nATMEGA 328, a water\
    \ sprinkler system for smart \nirrigation \nwas \nreported \nby \nKumar \net \n\
    al.                    \n[48,49] using temperature, humidity and soil \n \n \n\
    \ \n \nLangangmeilu et al.; Int. J. Environ. Clim. Change, vol. 13, no. 10, pp.\

    \ The water sprinkler was \ncontrolled based on the soil moisture level to \n\
    save \nwater \nand \nthereby, \nreduce \nstress \nconditions. \n \n3.11 Omic Approaches\
    \ \n \n“The intrinsic genes for sophisticated abiotic \nstress in plants may be\
    \ identified as omics \ntechnology \nadvance. \nProteomics \nand \nmetabolomics\
    \ have been demonstrated to be \nquickly growing fields, allowing researchers\

    \ are predicted to significantly \nenhance \ncereal \nproduction. \nSimilarly,\
    \ \ntranscriptomics profiling is particularly valuable in \nguaranteeing a full\
    \ understanding of regulatory \nmolecules and networks that are involved in \n\
    stress tolerance communication” [15, 50-54]. \n \n4. CONCLUSION \n \nThe development\
    \ of high-yielding drought-\nresistant cultivars is a mandatory component for\
    \ \nmost rice growers in changing climates. In this \nregard, many researchers\
    \ proved to have some \nscientific \nway \nof \nproper \nmitigating \nand \nmanagement\
    \ to meet the demands of a rising \nglobal \npopulation \nunder \ndifferent \n\
    climatic \nchanges. \nHence, \nmany \ndroughts \nresistant \nvarieties viz. IRAT-109,\
    \ CR Dhan-40, Vandana, \nTulsi, etc. along with the HRD gene that \nundergoes\
    \ SRI (System of Rice Intensification) \ntechnique with low/ reduced tillage operation\
    \ via \nhormonal priming specially PGPR that are sown \nat appropriate early dates\
    \ in the month of May-\nJune using ATMEGA 328, a water sprinkler \nsystem for\
    \ smart irrigation is recommended. In \nthe case of drought sensors, transcriptomics\
    \ \nprofiling is valued in guaranteeing a full \nunderstanding of regulatory molecules\
    \ and \nnetworks that are involved in stress tolerance \ncommunication. Application\
    \ of silica on the rice \nleaves leads to the formation of cuticle double \nlayer\
    \ by influencing the reduction of transpiration \npull which ultimately enhances\
    \ the moisture level \nthat makes it tolerable to drought stress.  \n \nCOMPETING\

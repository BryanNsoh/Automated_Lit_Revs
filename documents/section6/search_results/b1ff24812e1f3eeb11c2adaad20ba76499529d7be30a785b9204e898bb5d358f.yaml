  description: The rapid growth of industrial digitalization in the Industry 4.0 era
    is fundamentally transforming the industrial sector by connecting products, machines,
    and people, offering real-time digital models to allow self-diagnosis, self-optimization
    and self-configuration. However, this uptake in such a digital transformation
    faces numerous obstacles. For example, the lack of real-time data feeds to perform
    custom closed-loop control and realize common, powerful industrial systems, the
    complexity of traditional tools and their inability in finding effective solutions
    to industry problems, lack of capabilities to experiment rapidly on innovative
    ideas, and the absence of continuous real-time interactions between physical objects
    and their simulation representations along with reliable two-way communications,
    are key barriers towards the adoption of such a digital transformation. Digital
    twins hold the promise of improving maintainability and deployability, enabling
    flexibility, auditability, and responsiveness to changing conditions, allowing
    continuous learning, monitoring and actuation, and allowing easy integration of
    new technologies in order to deploy open, scalable and reliable Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT). A critical understanding of this emerging paradigm is necessary
    to address the multiple dimensions of challenges in realizing digital twins at
    scale and create new means to generate knowledge in the industrial IoT. To address
    these requirements, this paper surveys existing digital twin along software technologies,

    The rapid growth of industrial digitalization in the Industry 4.0 era is fundamentally
    transforming the industrial sector by connecting products, machines, and people,
    offering real-time digital models to allow self-diagnosis, self-optimization and
    self-configuration. However, this uptake in such a digital transformation faces
    numerous obstacles. For example, the lack of real-time data feeds to perform custom
    closed-loop control and realize common, powerful industrial systems, the complexity
    of traditional tools and their inability in finding effective solutions to industry
    problems, lack of capabilities to experiment rapidly on innovative ideas, and
    the absence of continuous real-time interactions between physical objects and
    their simulation representations along with reliable two-way communications, are
    key barriers towards the adoption of such a digital transformation. Digital twins
    hold the promise of improving maintainability and deployability, enabling flexibility,

    and prototypesSecurity 1. Introduction The emerging 5G network is expected to
    bring instantaneous connectivity to billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    in turn enabling the digital transformation of Industry 4.0 for companies, customers,
    and investors. According to a recent study [1], 85 percent of IoT platforms will
    contain some form of digital twinning by 2025, driving projections of market growth
    from $3.1 billion today to $48.2 Billion in the next five years. A digital twin
    (DT) is a virtual model or representation of a physical object, a process, or
    a system, synchronized and updated from real-time data, at a specific frequency
    and fidelity [2]. The concept of twins was initially introduced by the United
    States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Apollo program in
    the 1970s, where virtual replicas of space vehicles on Earth were built to mirror
    the condition of the equipment during the mission [3]. Then, the concept of DT
    was introduced by John Vickers and Michael Grieves [4] in the Product Lifecycle
    Management (PLM) as a virtual instance (twin) of a physical system [5]. Presently,
    the concept of DT is used in a wide variety of domains, such as manufacturing
    [6], healthcare [7], smart cities [8], smart agriculture [9], smart grids [10],
    and mechanical engineering [11], to enhance the performance, enable proactive
    maintenance to extend the physical system’s life [12], enhanced productivity,
    and faster innovation with reduced costs [13]. Typically, DT systems are generated
    and then synchronized using bidirectional data flows between the real-world physical
    components and their virtual replica counterparts [14]. Furthermore, a DT can
    enable continuous prototyping and testing on-demand without interruption, thereby
    assuring and self-optimizing use cases, such as 5G network and beyond [15], [16].
    In IoT use cases, it creates virtual replicas of IoT devices in various application
    scenarios [17] and maintains a device twin for every connected device. Despite
    the promise of DT, existing work on DT focuses primarily on the modeling perspective
    [18], [19] and pays less attention to simplifying the control and management of
    industrial IoT networks. Additionally, technology adopters report several barriers
    to this digital transformation including prohibitive complexity with network deployments,
    security risks, and need for new business models and practices. Security and privacy
    are the main concerns for sharing IoT data among distributed DT infrastructures
    [20]. In particular, data in theDT Network (DTN) is fed back between the physical
    object and the virtual model, thus making the virtual model vulnerable to cybersecurity
    attacks [21]. Defending against such attacks is critical for scenarios like remote
    robot surgery, intelligent transportation systems, and federated EU-US airport
    operations [22]. Similarly, DT require continuous interaction between real-world
    objects and their virtual representation in real-time and with reliable two-way
    communications [23]. However, due to the dynamic behavior and frequent changes
    in the network environment, it becomes challenging to ensure stringent reliability,
    low latency, and real-time requirements over the future wireless broadband 5G
    and 6G networks [24]. Research on DTs for 5G networks and beyond is still in its
    infancy, and the current implementations focus on limited and specific scenarios,
    such as network optimization, in which DTs act as a simple network simulation
    tool to solve the operation and maintenance problems. Yet, DTs could be considered
    an indispensable part of the entire lifecycle of the physical network in the future,
    serving more important issues in future networks beyond 5G, such as in network
    planning, construction, maintenance, optimization, automation, orchestration,
    etc. Additionally, since different standardization bodies are developing various
    DT standards, it is more challenging to define a more unified reference architecture
    of DTs. For example, Tao et al. [13] proposed a five-dimensional framework of
    DTs that involves physical entities and represents a virtual entity, service,
    twin data, and the connection between various components. ISO [25] is developing
    a standard for a DT manufacturing system; the Digital Twin Consortium (DTC) is
    drafting a DT architecture that embodies the entire domain of devices and processes
    [26]; the Digital Twin Web Association (DTWA) is defining the concept of Web of
    Digital Twins (WoDT) [27] to exploit service-oriented architectures to build digital
    twins document specification for the web of things; and the Building Digital Twin
    Association (BDTA) is promoting another DT architecture in the construction sector.
    In spite of the promising benefits of DT that are analyzed in few survey reports,
    none of them focus on articulating the fragmented international standards and
    dealing with the diversity of software implementations. Rather, existing surveys
    mainly review DT from the modeling perspective and focus on physical objects and
    their virtual twins, while reference architectures and networks which provide
    communication support for DT, are often missing. For instance, Schleich et al.
    [28] surveyed the recent advances in DT and its enabling technologies and showcased
    different use cases across the product lifecycle involving the design, manufacturing,
    use, and recycling phases. Likewise, Lim et al. [29] analyze the state-of-the-art
    of DT approaches in smart manufacturing and Product Life Management (PLM), and
    highlight tools and models used for creating DT for PLM engineering. Similarly,
    Wu et al. [2] surveyed recent advances in DT Network deployment in different application
    domains. Regardless of how a DT is defined, the literature provides very little
    insights into its deployment in future IoT applications with the forthcoming 5G
    network. Moreover, the discussion about the challenges, prospects, and trends
    in future networks have not been investigated either. Finally, there are no studies
    to understand and fill the gap between a company’s awareness of the DT and their
    current levels of adoption. To address these limitations, this paper makes the
    following contributions: • We present findings based on a comprehensive literature
    survey on DTs in IoT and 5G scenarios, comprising both research projects and tooling;
    • We discuss standardization efforts in the realm of DTs ; • We describe a number
    of use cases, explaining how DTs can help these use cases; • We present open research
    challenges, trends, and prospects; and • Finally, we present details of our project
    called Hyper-5G that is addressing some of these challenges. The organization
    of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a deep introduction to the DTs
    concept and discusses its properties. In Section 3, we delve into diverse DTs
    standardization, specifications, and describe their different reference architectures.
    Section 4 delves into available open source and commercial software implementations
    of DT tools to enable the future digitalized industry. We present in Section 5
    recent projects that have been initiated to facilitate the integration of DT in
    real-world applications. Section 6 describes diverse use cases and how DT can
    serve various applications. Section 7 discusses open challenging issues that still
    represent barriers towards large-scale adoption of DT. Section 8 articulates key
    research directions towards enhancing the digital twin lifecycle towards removing
    organizational, technical and technological barriers and increase its acceptance
    level in many industries. Finally, Section 9 provides concluding remarks describing
    potential future directions in this realm. 2. Overview of the digital twin concept
    The concept of DT is poised to make drastic changes in the future of industrial
    IoT environments. This section delves into the central concept of digital twins
    and discusses its main properties. 2.1. Understanding the key concepts of the
    digital twin The purpose of a DT is to build effective communication between the
    physical world and the information world. This means using a large amount of data
    collected effectively from the physical world to create a virtual representation
    of the physical world. In this section, we delve into its key concepts. 2.1.1.
    Types of digital twins There are different types of digital twins, depending primarily
    on the use cases and real-world scenarios in which they are used. We will describe
    different use cases in Section 6. Shyam et al. [30] identify four types of digital
    twins as follows: • Discrete versus Composite: The scope and scale of the DT depend
    on the use case in which it will be used. One type of DT known as Component/Part
    Twins is one where the DT represents the model of an individual part of the production
    system. For example, more complex systems will involve multiple DT instances and
    aggregates that will be assembled and composed together to form the whole DT representation.
    Conversely, small-scale systems may involve a single/atomic DT instance to represent
    the physical assets in the DT, which is therefore called a discrete DT. Hence,
    a discrete DT is a lower level of abstraction of more complex systems, i.e., systems
    of systems or composite DTs. • Product versus Facility: This type of DT is also
    known as Asset Twins. It represents a manufactured product, which encapsulates
    the exact manufacturing conditions of each final product, such as a pump, gas
    turbine, electric motor, etc. The main objective of this type is to monitor the
    use of a specific asset or entity, which may involve information about its failure
    and real-time operations. The facility DT revolves around manufacturing or production,
    which consists of the union of different individual assets, e.g., an assembly
    of unique product twins. • Simulation versus Operational: In the early stages
    of a product life cycle, a DT often focuses on modeling and simulation scenarios
    before the asset begins to be processed. Next, once the asset is made available
    in the physical real-world system, the focus is more on the operational and maintenance
    challenges. Comparable to DevOps (Development and Operations), this type is considered
    Simulation and Operational (SimOps) DT; thus, the simulation is more project-oriented.
    At the same time, the operations involve the entity’s operation and maintenance
    life cycle. • Analytics-versus Physics-based: This model uses historical and real-time
    data for representing an entity and predicting its current and future states,
    either based on empirical/analytic models or physics-based algorithms. The former
    use artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., statistics) to predict the behavior
    of an asset using available historical data. The latter makes use of physical
    laws (e.g., fluid dynamics, atomic, molecular, and optical), material properties
    (size, shape, the density of the particles, tensile strength, compressive resistance,
    elasticity, grain, and their intrinsic mechanical properties), etc. to generate
    insights to allow predicting the behavior of an asset or a product. Similarly,
    Alves et al. [31] have introduced typology of different types of Digital Twins
    for smart farming. For example, imaginary DT represent objects that imagined by
    designers but has not been created in physical world. Monitoring DT are connected
    to physical objects or processes in near real-time to supervise its operations
    and condition in the surrounding environment. Predictive DT use mathematical and
    statistical modeling to forecast the future states and behavior of physical objects.
    Prescriptive DT use artificial intelligence to provide corrective and preventive
    actions to help the physical process in decision-making. Autonomous DT does not
    need human intervention to feed decisions to the physical system, but autonomous
    provides fully control of the system behavior. Finally, Recollection DT stores
    large amounts of variant data and extract significant value from it for providing
    the traceability of products and keep a historical record. However, these types
    remain conceptual, as they can be implemented as part of the main DT, e.g., they
    can be considered as small instances of the main DT. 2.1.2. Characteristics of
    a DT Since DT has been applied to different use cases and since each use case
    generates its own DT characteristics [32], [33], [34], there are no generic characteristics
    that can be applied to all scenarios. In this section, we will discuss, without
    loss of generally, the main characteristics that a DT should possess. These properties
    are described in Table 1. A key characteristic of any DT is the presence of network
    connectivity. This is needed since the physical object and its virtual replica
    communicate to exchange the physical twin status and changes along the lifecycle,
    and share context representation about their surrounding dynamic environment.
    Thus, the networking interfaces/devices should guarantee seamless connection,
    synchronization, and continuous data stream exchange, either using direct point-to-point
    communication, or even indirectly, through brokers, proxies, gateways, or cloud-based
    connections. Table 1. Key characteristics of a DT. Characteristics Description
    Network connectivity It involves both the connection from the physical to a virtual
    environment and the connection from the twin to the physical world. Physical entity/asset
    An asset, an object, an entity, a process or a product that exists in the real
    physical world. Physical environment The real world environment in which the physical
    entity exists, such as a factory, construction, hospital, manufacture, smart city,
    etc. Virtual entity The virtual replica of the physical entity, i.e., the DT prototype
    and its instances when synchronized with their physical replica Virtual environment
    A virtual representation of the physical environment, which may involve Unity
    3D, AR/VR, and metaverse tools. Synchronization The virtual replica (object, system,
    or process) should be synchronized with the real world so that any change in the
    physical world should be reflected in its digital representation, which feeds
    back insights into the reverse direction. Twinning Rate As the physical and twin
    worlds should be synchronized, they should therefore agree on the frequency with
    which data is exchanged, i.e., the rate with which synchronization occurs. State
    The current behavior or values of all parameters that define a state (or multiple
    states) of either the real-world or virtual entity/environment. Physical Process
    The process in the real-world environment within which the physical entity engages
    changes or impacts the behavior of the physical twin. Virtual Process The virtual
    process (e.g., analytics, computational techniques, etc.) employed in the virtual
    twin that will change or impact the state of the virtual replica. Fidelity The
    accuracy of the DT model to describe the physical assets, no matter how complex
    the physics or geometry are. Fidelity can be assessed when considering the frequency
    of the model updates. Parameters Includes all kinds of information, meta-data,
    and processes exchanged between the physical entities and their twins, e.g., temperature,
    production scores, and processes. 2.1.3. Data and models The DT exists in the
    virtual environment in a digital format, i.e., represented in different data sources
    and models (e.g., file structures like JSON and XML that hold DT meta data) that
    transform data into DT information for various applications. The DT data can present
    itself in the following forms: • Time Series Data: Time series insights are used
    to collect and analyze historical data about physical assets and perform data
    analytics (e.g., regression) on them [35]. They also provide timestamped temporal
    and real-time data that can be stored in time series, as well as NoSQL databases
    that can be used to synchronize the physical assets with their twins. • Master
    Data: Typically, those data are stored in enterprise data stores (e.g., Enterprise
    Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)). For example, physical
    assets comprise multiple sensors capable of gathering ERP real-time data and transmitting
    operational status [36]. DT requires an Enterprise Knowledge Graph [37]. The latter
    comprises concepts and instances defined using ontologies and computational agents
    to ensure that Master Data Management (MDM) represents generic data of physical
    objects belonging to organizations, such as clients, providers, products, and
    locations, through distinct layers. • Transactional Data: Operational, transactional
    data represent the next frontier in Digital Process Twins. It describes the virtual
    representation of an actual business process, which in turn describes the accurate
    model of the business process and the real-time status data received from the
    process that helps to exert control over the process through adjusting the DT
    . An example of transactional data can be found in Computerized Maintenance Management
    Systems (CMMS), Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Business Process Management
    (BPM), and production systems. The DT models can be of the following types: •
    Physics-based Models: This is one of the traditional models used in simulation
    and co-simulation, where multi-physics get real-time data, engineering calculations,
    discrete physics, and where machine learning are integrated with physics-based
    models to investigate several predictive scenarios. The latter are used for predicting
    damaged structures, maintenance planning, uncertainty, operational parameters,
    etc. [38]. • Analytics-based Models: Typically, advanced machine learning algorithms
    and mathematical and statistical models are used in the virtual twin environment
    to predict the current and future of the physical asset. They can also create
    recommendations, operate on analytical data, and extract insights to help predict
    future behavior, simulate different scenarios, and perform other analytics tasks
    [39]. • Visual Models: the recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual
    Reality (VR), metaverse, Geographic Information systems (GIS), and Building Information
    Modeling (BIM) makes it possible to integrate visual models (e.g., Unity 3D models,
    Internet of 3D worlds) into the DT [40]. For example, integrating Google Maps
    Street View with the DT can make updates in real-time as objects move and change
    on it continuously. • Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Models: DES models [41]
    can be used to create a full DT of the production and manufacturing process, as
    they abstract the machine group’s behaviors into complex event-driven operations.
    For example, by combining computer-aid modeling method to create higher multi-fidelity
    simulation models provides higher accuracy analysis and rapid decision-making
    in Industrial 4.0. 2.2. Key properties of digital twins In this section, we discuss
    four main properties of DT using which they can be evaluated for their effectiveness.
    These include: (i) representativeness and contextualization; (ii) reflection and
    replication (iii) persistency; and (iv) composability. • Representativeness and
    Contextualization Digital twins represent the physical objects as logical objects
    in specific application context [17]. Indeed, representativeness of a DT refers
    to how effective are the models’ behavioral representation of real-world objects,
    how virtual replicas are built, and how synchronize their states by reasoning
    about events and modifications to the context. Therefore, any DT framework should
    consider the source of data and the surrounding environment in which data are
    collected and to support context-awareness features to understand the context
    of data collection [42]. The representativeness and contextualization in DTs are
    made possible through the simplification and generalization of the models’ behaviors
    • Reflection and Replication DT mirrors the states and the behavior of the real-world
    objects and reflects all the changes that happen in the physical systems, i.e.,
    features, status, data, events, actions, and all the other information characterizing
    the physical object to their virtual replicas. Reproducing the status of the physical
    entities requires reliable communication that reflects any changes to the virtual
    entities at the same rhythm and rate of these changes. Additionally, physical
    objects can be virtualized, instantiated, and replicated several times in a virtualization
    space. The replicated instances should be consistent and synchronized (i.e., time
    and status synchronizations) with the physical one [43]. Replicability is, therefore,
    a desirable property to support the intertwining between real-world space and
    DT replicas. • Persistency As the DT is expected to replicate the physical objects,
    it must always be highly available and provide persistent data in the digital
    system [44]. The availability of DT is provided during the lifecycle of the process,
    i.e., during the design, creation, operation, crashes, maintenance, upgrade, and
    even after the destruction of the physical objects. Hence, the DT should always
    be persistent in all possible scenarios, i.e., virtual objects should be resilient
    and stay available all the time. • Composability The DTs can often aggregate different
    entities to represent more complex systems in the virtual space. This ability
    of grouping together different objects into a single, composed object to perceive
    the changes and behavior of individual objects and the whole system represents
    the composability of digital twin [45]. Digital twins need to take care of complex
    aggregation of physical objects. Table 2. Digital twin standardization efforts.

    concepts DT can be compared to different existing other concepts, e.g., simulations,
    emulations, digital shadows, digital thread, etc. While digital twin itself refers
    to a virtual replicate of the real-world system that receive data from the physical
    system and send decisions to perform closed-loop control, it differs significantly
    from other concepts. In particular, DT can be distinguishable from simulation,
    which attempts to simulate the internal state of an object as close as possible
    to what could happen to an object. DT can be also be differentiated from emulation,
    as an emulation involves an emulator that tries to imitate the external behavior
    of an object as closely as possible. Furthermore, DT can be confused to digital
    shadows, as both offer digital representation of objects and processes. However,
    data flow in digital shadows is a one-way process [46], i.e., data can only go
    from the physical object to the virtual object so that changes in the physical
    world results in changes to the virtual world, but not vice versa. Additionally,
    DT uses the digital thread [47] data to perform custom closed-loop control and
    build on powerful representations for the design, evaluation, and recording of
    the life cycle management of a product or system. The digital thread is considered
    as the framework that connects siloed elements of the DT and provides an integrated
    view of an asset throughout the manufacturing lifecycle. 3. Standardization efforts
    for digital twins Different standardization efforts are undertaken by multiple
    foundations and organizations, such as the International Standards Organization
    (ISO), the Industrial Digital Twins Association (IDTA) and the Digital Twins Consortium
    (DTC). These multiple efforts create some challenges for unifying digital twins
    into systems. In this section, we discuss the current standardization efforts
    in the area of the DT. Table 2 summarizes the list of projects with the same aim.
    3.1. DTC reference architecture The DTC Reference Architecture has been established
    by the Digital Twin Consortium in collaboration with the Object Management Group
    to drive awareness, adoption, security, and interoperability for unifying multivendor
    digital twin ecosystems [48]. It also provides insights towards designing and
    building scalable industrial manufacturing processes by enabling continuous improvement
    in lifecycle management [49], enabling a circular product-based approach and influencing
    policies, standard requirements, and the development of DT technology. The DTC
    group defines standard requirements and use cases. Specifically, it defines the
    reality capture [26] that embodies the entire domain of devices and processes,
    which collects conditions of a physical object or space to provide a faithful
    and transparent representation of real-world conditions in the virtual representation
    of the DT framework. Additionally, the group advocates consistent best-practices
    methodologies, formal methods for digital master, digital twin representation
    and interlinking, and DT maturity model [50]. Furthermore, the DTC group provides
    a library of reference implementations for digital twins, publishing and amplifying
    architectures [51], leveraging frameworks and open-source code implementation
    [52] that help build an extensive, multi-faceted DT ecosystem in large-scale,
    complex environments. The group also introduced a Security Maturity Model [53]
    to identify the appropriate approach to security mechanisms for IoT. The Capabilities
    Periodic Table (CPT) [51], shown in Fig. 1, has been established to elaborate
    a requirements-definition framework that works with any architecture or technology
    and makes it easier to design, deploy, and run digital twins for a wide range
    of industrial purposes. At its core, the architecture uses a Composable Digital
    Twins (CDT) reference model to help with the development of digital applications
    based on composable enterprise architectural patterns. These CDTs focus on developing
    microservice-based orchestration and reusable Packaged Business Capabilities (PBC)
    to support interoperable, multi-technology, and multivendor applications [51].

    Fig. 1. Composable digital twin reference model. The Composable Digital Twin Reference
    Model is a layered architecture that encompasses the following layers: • Composed
    Digital Twins Experiences: PBCs are provided to offer a unique modular composition
    that targets the goals and opportunities offered by the DT, i.e., by combining
    different configurations, real-time data, decision-support tools, data types,
    models, etc., to create reusable business capabilities. • Digital Twins Composition
    Platform: it provides necessary tools for orchestrating, integrating, and composing
    applications based on the necessary use case requirements, which offers a high
    level of agility and flexibility towards fulfilling the business requirements.
    • Packaged Business Capabilities: PBCs can be used in the DT platform to compose
    the DT and offer a certain level of security and trustworthiness across the DT
    orchestration platform. • Data Fabric: it provides the tools, algorithms, and
    mechanisms to enable digitalization, supply services and processes, and bring
    alive the DT, i.e., by ensuring data availability at the right time at the right
    place. 3.2. Industrial digital twin association (IDTA) The Asset Administration
    Shell (AAS) [54], [55], [56] has been introduced by the IDTA as a standardized
    digital asset representation to ensure manufacturing systems’ interoperability.
    Part 1 of the AAS specification [54] defines several protocols to serialize AASs
    in different formats, such as JSON, XML, or AML. AML (Automation ML) [57] is an
    open, vendor-neutral, XML-based, and free data exchange format for industrial
    automation and control systems, defined in the IEC 62714 series. It describes
    how information about assets can be exchanged safely between industrial partners.
    The document describes the metamodel for information of an Asset Administration
    Shell and its submodels, as well as the exchange format for the transport of information
    from one partner in the value chain in an interoperable way. It introduces a comprehensive
    UML model and XMI representation of details of the AAS for mapping suitable technologies
    to be used in different life cycle phases (such as XML and JSON for exchange between
    partners via the .aasx exchange format, AutomationML for the engineering phase,
    OPC UA information models, and RDF for reasoning). The definition of attribute-based
    access control (ABAC) protects system resources from unauthorized access [58].
    The specification includes APIs and interfaces for getting to AAS information
    so that you can view, change, query, and run information and active functionality.
    It also includes the infrastructure for connecting multiple AASs through a registry,
    discovery services, endpoint handling, and other things [Wagner2017]. 3.3. Industry
    IoT consortium (IIC) A reference architecture for DT [59] has been introduced
    by the IIC to integrate many vendors and technologies and help them to manage
    their complexity. Common features have been introduced to fulfill many DT vendors
    requirements, including Document Management, 3D representation, modeling, simulation,
    data modeling, model synchronization, connected analytics, etc. Additionally,
    the IIC introduced practical guidance [60] on digital twins that includes the
    definition, benefits, architectures, and building blocks to implement them. The
    proposed document describes the relationship among DT systems as a level of abstraction
    (e.g., discrete, composite, hierarchical, association, peer-to-peer DT). Fig.
    2 illustrates the DT data, computational models, and service interfaces. Data:
    a DT should contain data about its real-world twin that are required by the models
    to represent and understand the states and behaviors of the real-world twin. In
    many cases, it may consist of data in the full lifecycle of the real-world object,
    in the case of equipment, data during the design phase (specifications, design
    models, production process, and engineering data), production phase (data about
    a worker, production equipment, material and parts, production methods and quality
    assurance data), operation phase (data about installation and configuration, real-time
    and historical state and status, as well as maintenance records) and even end-of-life
    procedural data. It may also contain business data, such as transaction records.

    Fig. 2. Constituents of the IIC’s digital twin. Models: A DT should contain computational
    or analytic models that are required to describe, understand, and predict the
    twins’ operational states and behaviors and models that are used to prescribe
    actions based on business logic and objectives about the corresponding real-world
    object. These models may include physics or chemistry, engineering or simulation
    models, data models based on statistics, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). It may also include 3-D and augmented reality models to aid human understanding
    of real-world objects’ operational states or behaviors. Service (interface): a
    DT should contain a set of service interfaces for industrial applications or other
    digital twins to access its data and invoke its capabilities. 3.4. Internet engineering
    task force (IETF) IETF has recently introduced a reference architecture for network
    digital twin [61] in which it identifies four key elements to compose a DT network,
    i.e., data, models, interfaces, and mapping, as shown in Fig. 3. First, data are
    collected from the network elements (e.g., physical and virtual equipment, links,
    routers, middleboxes, controllers, NFV functions, etc.). Then they are stored
    inside the data repository to provide timely and accurate data service support
    to build various DT models. The collected information includes configuration data,
    operational state data, topology data, trace data, metric data, and process data.
    Data are also used by the DT platform to represent the states of both physical
    and virtualized network instances and describe their behavior inside the DT .
    Second, data are used to develop a comprehensive representation of the data using
    DT models. Diverse models can be composed, e.g., service models, data models,
    dataset models, or knowledge graphs, to represent a high-level abstraction to
    provide insights and dynamics on how the live physical network operates and infer
    reasoning data that the DT can utilize to serve various network applications.
    Third, interfaces are used to ensure the interoperability of the DT network with
    existing business applications. Standardized southbound and northbound interfaces
    are needed to (i) interface with the physical network infrastructure to provide
    real-time data collection and control on the physical network, and (ii) interface
    between the DT network platform and applications to help in delivering application
    requests to the DT network platform and exposing the various platform capabilities
    to applications. Download : Download high-res image (155KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Key elements of IETF digital twin network. Finally, the
    mapping is needed to establish a real-time interactive relation between the physical
    network and the twin network or between two twin networks. One-to-one (pairing,
    vertical) mapping also helps to keep the physical network and its virtual replicated
    network in sync with continuous flows, give a clear picture of the current situation,
    improve the network’s performance and upkeep, and get the system to behave the
    way you want it to. One-to-many (coupling, horizontal) mapping is also needed
    to synchronize among virtual twin networks with occasional data exchange. Furthermore,
    the mapping enables the (i) repeatability of the experiments, as it offers the
    capacity to replicate network conditions on demand; and (ii) reproducibility by
    enabling replaying successions of events under different controlled variations
    of the network state to validate changes in different use cases, such as network
    optimization and network fault recovery. IETF has introduced a three-layer DT
    reference architecture that encompasses the Application Layer, Digital Twin Layer,
    and Physical Network Layer, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (372KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. IETF reference architecture
    of DT network. • Physical Network: it represents network infrastructure (mobile
    access/core network, a transport network, a datacenter, an IP bearer network,
    a backbone, etc.) that span across single or multiple autonomous systems and in
    which all or parts of their equipment exchange data with their virtual replicas
    in the DT instance. Digital Twin Layer: represents the virtual replicas of the
    physical layer and includes three key subsystems: (i) Data Repository subsystem,
    which is responsible for collecting and storing real-time operational and historical
    network data from different networks to build and update various models used by
    the DT; (ii) Service Mapping Models subsystem offers data metamodel instances
    that can be used by the network applications to improve the flexibility, agility,
    and programmability of the network. It includes both basic models (i.e., network
    element models and network topology models) implemented in the DT model, describing
    the basic configurations such as environmental information, operational state,
    link topology, etc. In addition, functional models encompass various data models
    used for different tasks such as network analysis, emulation, diagnosis, prediction,
    quality of service assurance, etc. functional models are constructed and expanded
    by multiple complex dimensions, i.e., by network types (mono, multi, heterogeneous
    domains) or by function types ranging from simple state monitoring and traffic
    analysis to more advanced tasks such as network planning, maintenance, optimization,
    and operation. It is possible to combine multiple models to create a more complete
    and complex data model for more specific application scenarios; and (iii) Digital
    Twin Network Management functions that record the lifecycle of all twin entities’
    transactions, monitor and supervise the execution of individual models, supervise
    the performance and resource consumption of the digital network twin, and visualize
    and control other elements of the network such as topology management, model management,
    and security management. • Application Layer: represents all the network applications,
    such as cognitive management, predictive control, closed-loop management, operations,
    administration, maintenance (OAM), and management and orchestration (MANO) that
    can run on the DT platform. The application communicates with the DT platform
    through open network interfaces using request/response-based or event-based communication
    patterns. 3.5. International organization for standardization The ISO 23247 [25]
    has been investigating a novel standardized framework to support the creation
    of digital twins of observable manufacturing elements that include four domains,
    shown in Fig. 5: physical manufacturing, data collection and device control, digital
    twin representations and user domains. The scope of this framework covers the
    following standards: • ISO 23247-1: Overview and General principles [25]. • ISO
    23247-2: Reference architecture [62]. • ISO 23247-3: Digital representation of
    manufacturing elements [63]. • ISO 23247-4: Information Exchange [64]. Download

    ITU-T recommendations The ITU-TY.3090 [65] recommendation has been initiated by
    the ITU-T to describe the functional and service requirements and the architecture
    for twining the physical network with a DT network. The recommendation identifies
    four key characteristics of DTN: (i) Data is the cornerstone of DTN, is collected
    from the physical network and stored in a single source of truth, the data store
    that can be usable by DTN models; (ii) a mapping of the physical network infrastructure
    into its virtual twin replica; (iii) a model is a virtual abstraction that accurately
    reflects a physical network and can be used to interact with network applications,
    and (iv) open interfaces, southbound interfaces connect physical networks and
    virtual twin networks while northbound interfaces exchange information between
    virtual twin networks and network applications. The ITU recommendation has developed
    a three-layer, three-domain, and double closed-loop architecture as shown in Fig.
    6. It can digitally show the running status and health state. It can perceive
    the network state, efficiently mine valuable network information, and explore
    innovative network applications with friendly immersive interactive interfaces.

    standardization effort [92] has been recently initiated by ETSI recommendation
    to define a reference architecture, communication functionality, and properties
    for smart machine-to-machine communication (SmartM2M). The scope of the ETSI recommendation
    involves the following: • D1 Digital Twins and standardization opportunities in
    ETSI: aims to analyze the major characteristics and architectures of Digital Twins,
    identify their significant functionalities, select the candidate communication
    functionalities for standardization, and collection, identify and define use cases
    for industrial IoT, and identify their potential requirements. • D2 Digital Twins
    communication requirements: based on the previous recommendation D1, they aim
    to elaborate a common definition of Digital Twins’ communication functionality
    and properties and standardize their communication requirements. • D3 Digital
    Twins Functionalities and Reference Architecture: aims at providing a DT reference
    architecture by introducing a guideline for the adoption of Digital Twins in SmartM2M
    industries. • D4 Digital Twins support in oneM2M: aims at mapping the reference
    architecture developed in D3 to the oneM2M architecture and capabilities by clarifying
    the existing functionalities in oneM2M and developing their extensions, and developing
    new functionalities and functional entities to support the Digital Twins concepts.
    Furthermore, Context Information Management API (NGSI-LD) Specification [93] has
    been introduced by ETSI to describe different ways to publish, consume and subscribe
    to context information in multiple scenarios involving context entities, aka “digital
    twins”, that represent real-world assets. NGSI-LD describes how the context information
    can be modeled as attributes of DT entities. 4. Digital twin frameworks and prototypes
    The emergence of the DT has increased the development of software solutions and
    frameworks for creating and maintaining digital twin solutions in different industries.
    Table 3 illustrates state-of-the-art software implementation of digital twin technology.
    We identified the following criteria to evaluate different DT implementations:
    (i) open source or commercial, (ii) scalability, i.e., the ability to support
    an increasing number of remote connections from a physical system; (iii) latency,
    i.e., is minimized latency is obtained by optimizing both the communication and
    the computation; (iv) elasticity, i.e., implements a reactive elasticity between
    the cloud and the edge; (v) mobility, i.e., supports mobile physical systems;
    (vi) robustness, i.e., supports reliability of fidelity; (vii) context-awareness,
    and (viii) geo-distribution, i.e., highly distributed DT through elastic orchestration
    of service containers. 4.1. Eclipse Ditto Eclipse Ditto [66] has been introduced
    as an open-source project under the Eclipse IoT initiative to provide a ready-to-use
    functionality to manage the state of DTs. It offers functionalities to perform
    (i) Device-as-a-Service, by mirroring physical assets/devices, offering a high-level
    web API to access devices remotely and interact with digital twins; (ii) State
    management for digital twins, by enabling event-based notification of state changes
    and offering a single source of truth” for a physical asset; and (iii) Digital
    Twin Management, by providing meta-data and metamodel support to query, search,
    and select specific attributes from both the physical system and the virtual DT
    replicas. To this end, Eclipse Ditto offers a range of RESTful APIs [94] that
    can be used to build backend-less IoT applications and help developers to concentrate
    on the application’s business logic to build an enhanced user experience while
    simplifying the integration of various network protocols, brokers, and messaging
    systems [95]. Eclipse Ditto, combined with Eclipse Vorto (explained next), offer
    a generic and flexible Digital Twin framework. 4.2. Eclipse Vorto Eclipse Vorto1
    [67] has been introduced as an open-source project that provides a language for
    describing models and interfaces for IoT DTs. In IoT scenarios, digital twins
    are models of entities in the physical world, such as a multi-sensor device, a
    smart power plant, and other entities participating in IoT solutions. Modeling
    enables IoT solutions and IoT platforms to provision, use, and configure IoT devices
    and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Eclipse Vorto
    addresses the subject of device abstraction, device description, and device integration.
    Digital twins are described using vortolang, which is a domain-specific language.
    Vortolang is used to describe the entities’ capabilities, IoT platforms and IoT
    solutions that can leverage the semantics of these IoT entities. It uses information
    models to provide abstract descriptions of device properties and features. The
    Vorto repository allows the management and sharing of these information models.
    Device manufacturers can publish information models, and developers can then download
    these information models. Vorto’s code generators make it possible to generate
    platform-specific source code from the information model. As a result, integrating
    a device with a specific platform is easier. The vortolang comprises a set of
    metamodel classes defining the capabilities of digital twins. Two top-level classes:
    Information Model and Function Block, describe a DT, and the capabilities of digital
    twins, respectively. Three metamodel classes describe capabilities: Properties,
    Events, and Operations. An Information Model describes a complete DT, such as
    a physical device, and defines the set of interfaces as Function Blocks implemented
    by the DT. A Function Block describes related capabilities that a DT implements.
    Function Blocks are reusable and can be reused across different Information Models.
    A Function Block is composed of properties, events, and operations. 4.3. Eclipse
    BaSyx Eclipse BaSyx2 project has been initiated as an open-source Industry 4.0
    middleware to support various functionalities and software components and implement
    digital twins that conform to the specification of Asset Administration Shell
    (AAS). BaSyx components include a registry component, persistency providers, and
    several container applications for Industry 4.0 applications [96]. BaSyx implements
    a service-oriented middleware architecture [97]. Eclipse BaSyx proposes the Virtual
    Automation Bus (VAB) architecture to offer end-to-end connectivity between physical
    assets and the DT through many heterogeneous communication protocols, brokers,
    and messaging services [68]. BaSyx also allows performing traditional CRUD (create,
    retrieve, update, delete and invoke) operations while ensuring interoperability
    among heterogeneous protocols and facilitating cross-layer interaction with the
    DT through VAB. 4.4. Nvidia Omniverse Nvidia Omniverse [91] has been introduced
    as a platform for building and operating metaverse applications wherever the digital
    and physical worlds meet. It has been updated to support various features for
    the metaverse, such as 3D internet to connect virtual 3D worlds and be viewed
    through a simulation engine. It offers Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-based,
    diffusion model-based neural rendering tools and graph execution engines to control
    behavior, motion, and action procedurally. Thus, it makes it the most advanced
    commercial tool to process the kinematics of complex multipart objects for synthetic
    data generation and DT simulations [98]. In particular, Omniverse includes (i)
    the Replicator application, which is used to generate synthetic data to train
    self-driving cars, robots, and all kinds of computer vision models; ii JT Connector
    for the Siemens JT industry-standard language of product lifecycle management;
    (iii) and the interoperability format of CAD systems, like NX, Creo, Catia, and
    Inventor. 4.5. ScaleOut digital twin ScaleOut DT [69] has been seen as a cloud
    and on-premises service that offers a set of tools for building real-time DT models.
    It defines an in-memory data grid that uses the JSON format to serialize instances
    of digital twins. It also provides machine learning and statistical analysis tools
    for spike and trend change detection using unsupervised learning, as well as for
    anomaly detection for sets of numeric values using supervised learning. Additionally,
    ScaleOut provides cloud-hosted stream processing services through its two components,
    i.e., the ScaleOut Digital Twin Builder software toolkit and the ScaleOut Model
    Development Tool. The streaming service connects to data sources using popular
    event hubs, such as Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, Amazon AWS IoT Core, and Azure Kafka,
    and allows connections via an integrated REST messaging service. It offers a user
    interface (UI) to aggregate real-time continuous analytics and report dynamic
    changes in the state of data sources to the UI 4.6. Davra platform Davra3 [70]
    has been introduced as a full-stack open source Industrial IoT (IIoT) platform
    that helps to define, build and prototype digital twins for building single reliable,
    secure and scalable IoT applications. It offers an open library that facilitates
    making secure API calls to the connecting APIs on the DT. To this end, it defines
    a TwinType Object that retrieves the details of an existing twin, add new objects
    to the platform, add or update (key/value pairs), modify or delete a key from
    it, list all attachments of all Twins, etc. 4.7. FIWARE FiwareDT has been introduced
    in [71] to build real-world physical assets that can be represented as a static
    or dynamic digital entity using a Universal Resource Identifier (URI). These assets
    can have several attributes or properties that hold data and relationships that
    bring the Digital Twin entities together. FIWARE Ecosystem allows modeling DT
    data using a catalog of components and smart data models [99]. FIWARE Community
    has developed NGSI RESTful API to simplify access to DT data and NGSI-LD API as
    the data integration API in the Fiware DT architecture through an open-source
    Context Broker component (e.g., Orion-LD, Scorpio, and Stellio) to simplify the
    development of interfaces to integrate with IoT, robotics, and many other third-party
    systems, as well as to support Digital Twin data processing and monitoring and
    data processing engines (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Flink), monitoring tools (e.g.,
    Grafana), and analysis platforms (e.g., Apache Superset). Additionally, to ensure
    interoperability with existing data models, the FIWARE Foundation has developed
    the Smart Data Models initiative,4 which provides a library of Data Models5 in
    JSON/JSON-LD format compatible with schema.org and NGSIv2/NGSI-LD APIs. 4.8. iTwin
    platform iTwin6 has been expanded to become an open source7 platform for creating,
    querying, modifying, and displaying Infrastructure Digital Twins for any scenario.
    iTwin has been developed using JavaScript to visualize and interact with DT assets
    using web browsers using Bentley cloud services [72], [100]. Additionally, it
    offers iModels API to access and manage DT information and bring DT infrastructure
    with existing servers, silos, politics, and hierarchy, and supports a federated
    data access layer to allow users to query the entire Federated Digital Twin as
    a whole for analytics and insights. iTwin is compatible with existing data format
    specifications (e.g., XML), drawings, documents, and BIM models, allows visualizing
    and analyzing BIM data, reality data, GIS, and IoT data streams in 3D and 4D using
    a web browser, and offers robust tools for viewing, interrogating, and interacting
    with the DT. 4.9. White label digital twin (WLDT) framework The WLDT8 [74] platform
    has been envisioned as an open-source Java-based framework to create Digital Twins
    for IoT applications. It intends to maximize modularity, re-usability, and flexibility
    to effectively mirror smart physical objects in their digital counterparts [101].
    It implements all the features and functionalities of a DT that can run in cloud
    and edge environments, and support a wide range of communication protocols and
    normalized data formats (e.g., CoAP, MQTT, Request/Response, Pub/Sub). The WLDT
    framework supports scalability and extensibility. It allows the creation of a
    modular IoT microservice architecture that easily integrates into the DT network
    through an extensible API. The core layer of the framework, called WLDT Engine,
    allows for defining, handling, and orchestrating the behavior of the twin and
    active modules (denoted as Workers). A Worker can be easily customized through
    a Processing Pipeline layer for processing incoming data or integrating with external
    third party services for data format translation and adaptation. The WLDT framework
    is expected to improve the modularity, re-usability and flexibility of digital
    twins by simplifying twin design and development. 4.10. Fraunhofer advanced asset
    administration shell tools (FA3ST) The FA3ST DT ecosystem9 has been developed
    as an open-source implementation of the AAS specification (including both Part
    1 and Part 2) to support Industry 4.0 [54], [102] applications. It has been augmented
    with a built-in open web service interfaces based on custom AAS model instance
    [103]. FA3ST provides an easy configuration via a JSON file and implements several
    other data formats (e.g., JSON, JSON-LD, XML, AML, RDF, OPC UA NODESET) for the
    AAS environment. It can also interconnect with several communication protocols
    (e.g., pull, pub/sub, MQTT, COAP, and IPv6) and interface and synchronize with
    several 3rd party implementations for the endpoint (e.g., HTTP, OPC UA), such
    as message bus, persistence, and asset connection. Furthermore, FA3ST uses the
    existing implementation of the AAS data model to enable data serialization and
    deserialization. It also offers a hybrid DT by intertwining different DT models
    using stream processing with Apache StreamPipes [104]. 4.11. Cyber–physical systems
    (CPS) twinning The CPS Twinning [76] platform has been conceived as an open-source
    framework for developing, generating, and executing digital twins for cyber–physical
    systems (CPS). CPS twinning uses automation ML (AML) [57] data exchange format
    to generate DT artifacts and automatically generate virtual environments for digital
    twins entirely from the specification. Additionally, the CPS twining framework
    implements another tool called CPS State Replication10 to enable the replication
    mode of CPS Twinning so that digital twin entities follow the states of their
    physical replicas by passively monitoring stimuli. The framework11 offers various
    security modules to support security analysts in monitoring the current state
    of CPS and implement customized security features, such as intrusion detection,
    access control, audit, and accountability. 4.12. XMPro XMPro12 enterprise framework
    has been developed to build real-time applications with fewer efforts at coding.
    It is a business process management (BPM)-based DT platform that consists of three
    main software components: (i) The XMPro App Designer is a low-code visual programming
    UI to create digital twin applications. It offers a visual environment for creating
    customized web pages by dragging blocks from the toolbox, configuring their properties,
    and connect them to diverse data sources; (ii) XMPro Data Stream Designer is a
    low-code integration and orchestration environment to connect real-time IoT data
    with analytics and actions. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to
    enable the design of stream processing through data pipelines, bring real-time
    data processing to a variety of sources, add and remove external data, and apply
    diverse types of machine learning and data mining algorithms to perform data analytics;
    and (iii) XMPro Connectors, which is an extensible library that includes hundreds
    of connectors for various industrial automation solutions, such as cloud PaaS
    environments, IoT platforms, AI/ML tools, etc. In particular, XMPro Connector
    implements the Azure Digital Twin Connector to interact with the Microsoft Azure
    Digital Twin platform. 4.13. Twinbase Twinbase [105] has been developed as an
    open-source platform for merging, managing and distributing DT documents. It creates
    a single interface to access the systems via an API gateway, called Data Link
    [106], which connects the features of a DT to make physical product data available
    and accessible from a single interface [107]. To this end, it stores metadata
    about the systems in a YAML document and implements a microservices’ architecture
    to offer better scalability, maintainability, and robustness against monolithic
    and single service failures. The API gateway facilitates requests and delivery
    of data and services, and ensures authentication. Twinbase contributes to the
    development of DT Web (DTW) [108], an approach introduced by the Digital Twin
    Web Association (DTWA) to develop, maintain and promote the Digital Twin Web initiative.
    At the core of this initiative is the development of DT document, often written
    in YAML, to combine the advantages of existing standards such as Industry 4.0
    Asset Administration Shell specification, the W3C Web of Things Thing Description
    and Microsoft Digital Twin Definition Language. 4.14. Azure DT Azure Digital Twins
    [109] has been introduced by Microsoft as a cloud-hosted enterprise-grade DT platform
    in the form of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Azure DT is a more generic framework
    that allows the creation of twin graphs based on digital models for diverse use
    cases and scenarios. To this end, Azure DT models are created and defined in a
    JSON-like language called Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL), which describes
    all data types, entries, states, properties, events, commands, relationships,
    etc., of the physical assets. Azure DT proposes a set of tools13 to define, create,
    and build DT applications. For example, the Azure DT Builder allows the development
    of DT processes more effectively by building and transforming building information
    modeling (BIM) into digital twins. Additionally, Microsoft has adopted the DTDL
    industry ontology to build diverse applications such as smart buildings (e.g.,
    modeling smart buildings using industry standards (like BRICK Schema or W3C Building
    Topology Ontology)), smart cities (i.e., supporting Open gile Smart Cities (OASC)
    and Sirus to provide a DTDL-based ontology for smart cities, starting with ETSI
    CIM NGSI-LD.), energy grids (e.g., monitoring grid assets, outage and impact analysis,
    simulation, and predictive maintenance), etc. In the energy grid, the ontology
    was created and adapted from the Common Information Model (CIM), a global standard
    for energy grid assets management, power system operations modeling, and the physical
    energy commodity market. The Azure Digital Twins Explorer is a visualization tool
    that demonstrates the interaction with a DT graph of a physical building. 4.15.
    AWS digital twin Amazon has been developing the AWS IoT TwinMaker [89] platform
    as a cloud-hosted commercial service to create digital twins of real-world systems,
    such as buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines. Amazon
    IoT TwinMaker supports commonly used IoT protocols such as Message Queuing and
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and low-power,
    long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN). It can also easily interact with the Amazon
    Sumerian service, which offers capabilities to build 3D modeling and AR/VR interfaces
    to build applications along the lines of a DT. Furthermore, Amazon provides a
    Device Shadow service, which allows the creation of a shadow of a physical device
    and provides its states to the application. Device shadow metadata (i.e., states,
    version, security token, properties, etc.) are stored in JSON file format and
    communication with DT services through RESTful APIs. One example of such a DT
    service is the Hexagon Digital Reality (HxDR) platform, which offers DT capabilities
    for building structures on top of AWS. HxDR creates accurate, real-world digital
    representations of the physical assets (e.g., cities, buildings, structures, and
    landscapes) using data captured from airborne, ground, mobile sensors, etc. Similarly,
    Vertex (Vertex Software Visualization Platform for the Digital Twin) is another
    provider of capabilities for DTs on top of the AWS platform. 4.16. Bosch IoT suite
    The Bosch IoT Suite [90] has been developed as an advanced DT platform to provide
    manufacturing companies with all the needed tools and technologies to build and
    scale their own IoT solutions and to help manage DTs. It offers an open data model
    to enable digital representations of physical devices with unified device APIs
    based on the Eclipse Vorto Information Models. The Bosch IoT Suite14 is built
    on top of Eclipse IoT open-source projects and industry standards. This open approach
    allows customers to enjoy all the benefits of fully managed cloud services while
    avoiding vendor lock-in. As another advantage, partners and customers can influence
    the future development of the Bosch IoT Suite by participating in the underlying
    open-source project communities. Furthermore, the Bosch IoT Suite can integrate
    with AWS and connect to devices using diverse communication protocols (MQTT and
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)) 5. Digital twin-based research projects
    In the past few years, we have seen an increase in research efforts by academia
    and industry for facilitating the transition to DT. We highlight in Table 4 a
    number of these projects, which we will deeply explore in this section. Table

    for cyberSecurity Platform for vIrtualiseD 5G cybEr Range services, aims at developing
    a digital twin to enforce cybersecurity in 5G wireless cellular network [111].
    The project aims at driving a new intelligent evolution to wireless network by
    replicating customized 5G networks and enabling the execution of real-time cyber-exercises
    [112]. The project allows gathering and sharing data between physical and virtualized
    network equipment and developing adaptive operational procedures to predict and
    manage security incidents, complex attacks, and propagated vulnerabilities [21].
    SPIDER project relies on a Service Mapping Model component for creating replicas
    of the 5G network, including User Equipment (UE), RAN and the 5G Core. Moreover,
    SPIDER leverages the Digital Twin Entity Management in the Mouseworld testbed
    [113] to generate network topologies and provision an executable service graph.
    5.2. LEAD LEAD [114] project has been driven by European research teams to create
    DTs of urban logistics networks in six European cities (e.g., Madrid, The Hague,
    Budapest, Lyon, Oslo, and Porto) to evaluate city logistics solutions by reproducing
    digital replicas of complex real-world urban environment, including different
    processes, actors, and their interactions to improve the resilience of the logistics
    chain. The long-term vision of the project is to develop an Open Physical Internet-inspired
    framework for Smart City Logistics that creates the foundations for the future
    European large-scale cities’ network of DTs. The project has been used to deliver
    efficient last-mile logistics and parcel delivery services and operations through
    forecasting and predictions of future states of the entire logistics lifecycle
    [115]. Furthermore, LEAD has been developing a variety of logistics solutions
    for shared, connected, and low-emission logistics operations. LEAD is empowered
    by adaptive agent-based models (ABM) approach that involves modeling, predictive
    analytics and decision-making methods, through the use of historical and real-time
    operational data to build lifecycle-oriented knowledge to develop integrated systems
    of logistics/freight operations in urban, metropolitan and urban areas. 5.3. DUET
    digital twins DUET project [73] has been developed to build an urban DT that creates
    virtual replicas of city environment, by modeling the interactions and the data
    exchange in urban ecosystems to better understand the interrelation between traffic,
    air quality, noise, and other urban factors. DUET project has been used to create
    the so-called T-Cell framework that acts as container for integrating together
    models, data, and simulations in a common environment that emulates real-world
    city ecosystem and helps to monitor and to synchronize the state and behavior
    of the DT with the physical environment [116]. Individual models are mirrored
    and integrated through APIs to form a federation of composable models that can
    be used to perform various analytics-based on both real-time feeds, and historical
    data gathered from IoT devices connected in smart cities’ environments. To this
    end, the DUET project builds large datasets, from both historic and real-time
    data, provides a dashboard to remotely monitor, in closed-loop control procedures,
    the anomalies, and deviations before a disaster strikes. It also builds embedded
    ML and AI functions to better predict different situations [117], such as the
    depreciation of road infrastructure or carbon footprint, thereby transitioning
    to a new age of responsive cities. 5.4. 5G-DIVE The 5G-DIVE [118] project has
    been devoted to the development of 5G connectivity solution that supports distributed
    edge computing use cases, such as deep AI/ML twinning for replica of a robotic
    arm for teleoperation [119], Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM), Massive Machine-Type-of
    Communication (mMTC), Drone Collision Avoidance System (DCAS) and Intelligent
    Image Processing for Drones (IIPFD), etc. For example, for robotic arm, the project
    creates a digital replicas of the Niryo One Robotic manipulator and synchronizes
    their movements in different scenarios. It has been used to send continuous stream
    of commands from the DT applications to the robot arm, compares and analyzes joint
    state vectors of both twins. Another use case developed in the project concerns
    the Business Automation Support Stratum (BASS), which is a orchestrator drivers
    different orchestrator frameworks (e.g., K8s and FogO5). First, 5G-DRIVE creates
    a Docker-based lightweight containerized service to deploy IoT applications. Then,
    these containers are migrated inside Kubernetes pods to achieve global. Next,
    the BASS Vertical Service Descriptor was created to deploy the service through
    the BASS. Finally, DT containers are chained to form en end-to-end system that
    involves a Fog Orchestration Manager (FOM) and a Fog Infrastructure Manager (FIM)
    [120]. 5.5. 5GROWTH The 5GROWTH [121] research project, which stands for 5G-enabled
    Growth in Vertical Industries, has been dedicated to empower multiple European
    vertical industries, such as industry 4.0, transportation, and energy with AI
    and DT -driven automated 5G end-to-end solutions [122]. The project has been foreseen
    to optimize the production line in manufacturing industry, improve the service
    delivery and Service Level Agreement (SLA) in 5G virtualized edge network, offload
    edge computation resources through deployment configurations, and support efficient
    data exchange between physical devices and their virtual components [123]. The
    project has been used to reduce the cost of physical connected objects, improving
    real-time operations for edge network, and achieving faster response to environment
    changes across diverse real-time applications such as visualization and remote
    control, that require ultra-low latency and high reliability [124]. 5GROWTH project
    develops a DT as a Service (DTaaS) [125], in which an Edge Robotic DT can be remotely
    controlled, coordinated and monitored while performing different industrial tasks
    in a factory floor, thereby open new opportunities towards the future manufacturing
    systems, by eliminating defective pieces and repetitively performing accurate
    tasks at high-speed [126]. Finally, 5GROWTH develops a protocol stack published
    as open source15 to enable online network resource allocation [127], service provisioning,
    and autonomous and dynamic management of a 5G network infrastructure [128]. 5.6.
    Iot-NGIN IoT-NGIN [129] has been focusing on implementing Meta-Level Digital Twins
    that allows on-usage interpretation and application of data and information and
    delivers improved efficiency and traffic congestions, in human centered twin smart
    cities. IoT-NGIN supports novel digital twins’ functionality to enable high-availability
    and what-if scenarios. It relies on a microservices-oriented architecture to build
    a distributed ledger (i.e., blockchain) to enforce the security (detection of
    network intrusions, detection of fraudulent ML model poisoning activities) and
    trust of federated DT network, manage the entire lifecycle of multi-faced data
    sharing and metadata management based on the ontology meta-level digital twins’
    data interfaces [130]. The meta-level DT layer abstracts the underlying implementation
    details, by providing a unique interface for utilizing decentralized security.
    Such an approach has been seen in other DT projects such as Asset Administration
    Shell (AAS) [54] and the Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description (TD) [131]. Furthermore,
    within the context of IoT-NGIN, digital twins are employed to mimic the behavior
    of connected IoT devices, facilitate the interaction between the physical and
    the virtual twins, in order to increase the service reliability, boost the performance
    of data services provisioning, and increase lifetime trackability and traceability.
    Additionally, IoT-NGIN is expected to use Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) to control
    of the identity of the physical twins and guaranteeing virtual device identity
    uniqueness in distributed federated DT network. Machine learning services are
    foreseen to deliver the needed abstraction to operate transparently in the physical-digital
    continuum. Finally, the IoT-NGIN project builds a DT models for diverse scenarios,
    e.g., training distributed AI models on traffic flow and parking prediction, event
    detection, crowd management, etc. 5.7. DIGIPREDICT DIGIPREDICT [132] has been
    used to develop a DT to predict the progression of disease in infectious and cardiovascular
    diseases. It deploys edge AI technologies to create digital representation of
    a patient [133] to predict whether COVID-19 patients will develop severe cardiovascular
    complications. the project develops a smart patch with wearable technology for
    collecting a range of medical data and monitor how well the treatment is working.
    5.8. SWAMP project SWAMP [134] has been used to create a DT for smart farming
    [135], by enabling precision irrigation for agriculture [31], optimizing the use
    of water, reducing the energy consumption and improving the quality of crops [136].
    The project aims at reducing the development effort for IoT-based smart farming
    applications, automating smart agriculture platforms by integrating heterogeneous
    technologies such as IoT, Big Data, flying sensors, and Cloud/Fog to predict the
    usage of IoT in smart water management settings 5.9. Hexa-X Hexa-X16 has been
    an immensely successful 6G research project that aims at integrating digital and
    physical worlds with human interaction for a privacy-preserving high-availability
    DTs [137]. It develops a set of use cases including massive network twinning services,
    cooperative robots, human in the loops, telepresence, as well as AI-driven communication
    and computation co-design [138]. Hexa-X develops fully immersive digital twins
    for twinning of the physical sensing/actuators and programmable digital representations.
    Moreover, it helps to flexibly assign heterogeneous resources and dependable network
    services in carrier-grade mobile communication networks beyond 5G, while ensuring
    network slices isolation, privacy-preserving, tightly coupled and seamlessly intertwined
    network, and ensure resilient services. The project extends the concept of DT
    of industrial processes to smart manufacturing, sustainable food production, healthcare,
    ailments of crops and livestock. 5.10. IoTwins IoTwins17 [139] has been used to
    create distributed digital twins for industrial SMEs. It delivers large-scale
    industrial testbeds by leveraging big-data stream processing and combining data
    coming from diverse sources, such as data APIs, embedded sensors in manufacturing,
    maintenance, operations, facility management, and Open Data sources. The project
    goal is to build a reference architecture for distributed and edge-enabled digital
    twins deployed at plant gateways of production plants and processes. Furthermore,
    the project proposes to create hierarchical organization of edge twins for orchestrating
    IoT sensors and actuators in a production locality and cloud twins for performing
    time-consuming and typically off-line parallel simulation, physical simulation,
    on-line and off-line optimization, and deep-learning. 5.11. MeDiTATe MeDiTATe
    [140] has been established as a medical DT as a service for aneurysm prevention
    and treatment, which aims at integrating big data analytics, augmented reality,
    haptic devices, Reduced Order Models (ROM), automated computer aided engineering
    and additive manufacturing in order to implement in silico analysis into clinical
    practice [141]. The project helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases and improve
    clinical practice through the development of software solutions to provide advanced
    training in the healthcare DT domain [142]. Specifically, MeDiTATe proposes to
    develop a healthcare DT pipeline based on reduced order modeling to enable fast
    and interactive evaluation of the hemodynamic parameters of a modified Blalock–Taussig
    shunt to augment pulmonary blood flow in single ventricle lesions [143]. 5.12.
    PREDIS PREDIS [144] has been developing a DT framework including models and methods
    for handling data in radioactive waste management in the nuclear back-end [145].
    The DT framework is used for visualizing, optimizing and supporting work processes
    in decommissioning, performing safety-critical processes under strict qualification
    requirements, dealing with radiological hazards and associated data types, models,
    and sensors in nuclear power plants. Furthermore, PREDIS uses different tools,
    such as geochemical models and chemo-mechanical models, to predict the years-long
    evolution of radioactive waste packages under different scenarios. To this end,
    the project builds an interoperable BIM platform along with 2D and 3D visualization
    of architectural models to demonstrate the viability of waste package management
    and the complexity of involved processes/models. 5.13. Zero-SWARM Zero-SWARM [146]
    has been developing a private 5G network that connects to edge-cloud continuum,
    data analytics, and digital twins to create agile and climate-friendly cyber–physical
    production systems of systems (CPSoS) to address the manufacturing sector in Europe.
    It builds innovative tools18 to improve the reliability of the energy system in
    Europe and make them more resilient to future shocks, improve maintenance operations,
    detect anomalies, forecast demand, etc. Furthermore, Zero-SWARM [147] CPSoS’ architecture,
    specifications, and requirements strive to achieve climate-neutral and digitized
    manufacturing and develop a human-centric, open swarm framework to minimize waste
    and pollution in manufacturing. 6. Digital twin use cases Digital twin use cases
    are applicable across multiple industries and functions, and the number of domains
    that aim to enable DT is growing significantly. We present in Table 5 a summary
    of some DT applications, which we deeply discuss in this section. Table 5. Summary

    attention in several domains, like smart cities [148]. The DT city is expected
    to offer a model of urban planning and construction for future sustainable cities
    by combining metaverse and AI tools to improve urban operational mechanisms and
    simplify urban upgrading. Lehtola et al. [149] have discussed different technologies
    in the DT ecosystem that help city planning and urban development, implement autonomous
    updating of city DTs and build semantic matching with the (BIM) model, geometrical
    matching with the model, and model validation. Bauer et al. [151] have developed
    open-source software components atop of the FIWARE [93] DT ecosystem, which combines
    the lifecycle model for DT with a conceptual model to offer reactive, predictive,
    and forecasting functionalities to extract knowledge to build an urban DT model
    that gathers data from dispersed IoT infrastructure in smart cities. To this end,
    the authors used the ETSI NGSI-LD [71] Information Model and APIs to represent
    IoT entities and their data (e.g., URI, location, properties, sensor information
    or characteristics, etc.) in smart cities. Similarly, Wolf et al. [150] have developed
    a DT platform for smart cities towards enabling accident-free urban life and making
    cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The authors identified
    different needs of stakeholders involved in an incident response, as well as the
    available data before accidents to process (e.g., topography, buildings, administrative
    borders, existing hazard maps, fire and ambulance services, police, local authorities,
    Environment Agency, NHS bodies, and critical infrastructures such as gas, water,
    etc.). Hence, we argue that DT can accelerate livability, workability, and sustainability,
    by treating city-wide data as an asset, thereby removing barriers, enhancing energy
    efficiency, and reducing the environmental impact, helping in mitigating risks,
    and managing resources more effectively. 6.2. Smart agriculture Nowadays, there
    is significant interest in enabling DTs in smart framing, improving the digitalization
    of agricultural and food production, offering advanced data processing techniques
    in agricultural field [136], [152], [153], [154], [155]. DT for smart farming
    can be designed as a service aggregator that offers farmers have an ergonomic
    and simple plug-and-play interface to query relevant data, support the farmers
    in understanding the change better, propose playful and explainable solutions
    using explainable AI, and help to promote knowledge sharing and collaborative
    and inclusive learning. For example, the authors in [9] proposed a conceptual
    framework for designing and implementing a smart agriculture DT system to plan,
    monitor, control, and optimize farm processes, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The framework
    seamlessly integrates sensing and monitoring, smart analyses, and planning of
    smart farming operations. Besides, it offers different features for crops monitoring,
    predictive maintenance of farming machines, autonomous decision-making and recollection,
    prescriptive management of the entire farming lifecycle. Alves et al. [31] have
    presented a DT solution for smart water management in the agriculture domain,
    which creates a virtual replica of a soil probe to build a DT environment that
    displays its information in a dashboard to help farmers better understand the
    state of their resources and equipment. Likewise, Nasirahmadi et al. [158] have
    announced a DT framework in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machinery, and food
    post-harvest processing in the agricultural field. The authors proposed including
    emerging technology such as artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis,
    prediction, and IoT to support the future generation of smart farming. For example,
    gathering real-time data for the lands (physical world) and updating its virtual
    twin to provide a straightforward monitoring tool through the DT interfaces for
    evaluating the soil quality and monitoring the moisture, temperature, organic
    matter, and soil pollutants. Furthermore, it also enables the decision-making
    process of smart farming and digital soil mapping, supervising crop health and
    productivity, identifying key soil characteristics, quantifying the trend of agricultural
    soil conditions, evaluating and forecasting plants’ irrigation requirements, supporting
    irrigation and water distribution planning to reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide
    dosages, improve the underground water, reduce climate degradation and protect
    human health. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to assess irrigation
    efficiency in agricultural fields Download : Download high-res image (409KB) Download

    Digital Twins can accelerate healthcare transformation [159]. The central idea
    is to generate a patient-specific DT from different data sources, including laboratory
    tests, ultrasounds, imaging devices, and genetic tests. It helps to develop digital
    health services that help people assess and treat simple medical conditions using
    AI, i.e., capturing health data in DTs, such as medical history, mood tracker,
    symptom tracker, and auto-capture from fitness equipment and wearable like the
    Apple Watch. That is, the DT can provide baseline first-line information or help
    guide priorities and interactions with physicians to treat more serious or persistent
    conditions [190]. SHENGLI et al. [161] have described the possibility of constructing
    a Human Digital Twin, its architecture, security, and other main issues. The authors
    review the origin of the Digital Twin and present the concept of the Augmented
    Digital Twin (ADT), an extended Digital Twin which is the basis of the Human Digital
    Twin (HDT). The HDT application layer architecture is composed of the following
    layers: • The Data Collection Layer collects data such as Blood Pressure. • These
    data need to be pre-processed and will be gathered to the sink center through
    local area • All data are stored in the Cloud Database, where many mathematical
    digital models, representation, and computing platforms which construct the core
    of the HDT are deployed to provide function interface to the Application Layer.
    • The Application Layer provides healthcare management, disease diagnosis, exercise
    suggestion, diet recommendation. Healthcare DT helps to improve the caregiver
    experience, e.g., helps caregivers capture and find information shared between
    physicians and multiple specialists. A DT can model the patient, then use technologies
    like Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand all the data and cut out
    the noise to summarize what is happening. It saves time and improves the accuracy
    of capturing and presenting information such as specific medications, health conditions,
    and other details that providers need to know in context to make clinical decisions.
    Additionally, DT can help in surgery planning, i.e., improve the planning of surgical
    interventions and evaluate the results afterward. Digital twins help to generate
    the shape of a cuff between the heart and the arteries, helps brain surgeons treat
    aneurysms by using simulations to improve patient safety. It can also improve
    the ability to plan and perform less invasive surgery using catheters to place
    single implants. Hence, individual patient data helps customize simulations that
    run on an integrated DT simulation and therefore the DT simulation results can
    greatly reduce the need for follow-up surgery. 6.4. Smart manufacturing Digital
    twin has been introduced to simply and automate the generation of simulation models
    in smart factories [179], [180], [181], [182]. In the light of the recent advances
    in smart manufacturing, the authors in [183] introduced a framework to capture
    changes in the asset across its life-cycle within a DT from the perspective of
    data architecture. This contributes to research with the ability for synchronization
    between the physical and the digital world to establish closed loops. The developed
    ontology-based approach offers opportunities for model and model-traceability
    to apply model-based systems engineering development approaches for DT solutions.
    The authors in [184] presents a proof of concept cyber–physical production system
    CPPS demonstrator which uses an open-source low-cost microcontroller to enable
    data communication between a V-bending machine and its DT. OPC UA was successfully
    used as a communication protocol, where the microcontroller was established as
    the OPC UA server, while the PC used to run the stress prediction algorithm and
    database was established as the OPC UA Client. Data from the physical process
    was transmitted to the DT, which used data analytics to predict maximum stress
    and strain, giving a deeper insight to the manufacturing process. An information
    dashboard presented the end user with process key performance indicators and DT
    information. AHELEROFF et al. [185] have presented a Digital Twin reference architecture
    and show its application in an industrial case. The authors also introduce Digital
    Twin as a Service (DTaaS) for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with
    considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring,
    remote controlling, and predicting functionalities. The findings indicate that
    there is a significant relationship between Digital Twin capabilities as a service
    and mass individualization. Furthermore, the authors present a literature view
    about Industry 4.0, and describe a reference model and a DT architecture, and
    individualization. And how Digital Twin enables monitoring, controlling, and schedule
    maintenance for wetlands as a representative for a massive number of unique and
    dynamic physical assets. The authors in [187] present a modeling framework for
    self-adaptive manufacturing that supports modeling domain-specific cases, describing
    rules for case similarity and case-based reasoning within a modular Digital Twin.
    Automatically configuring Digital Twins based on explicitly modeled domain expertise
    can improve manufacturing times, reduce wastage, and, ultimately, contribute to
    better sustainable manufacturing. Indeed, integrating CBR (Case-Based Reasoning)
    into DTs to make it possible to adapt to new conditions autonomously. The CBR
    cycle is divided into four phases: (1) retrieve the case most similar to the current
    situation; (2) reuse the solution of the most similar case; (3) revise that solution
    if the case differs too much from the current situation; and (4) retain the revised
    case in the knowledge base. Kafkes and al. [188] present continuing work on a
    real-time artificial intelligence (AI) control system for precisely regulating
    the Gradient Magnet Power Supply (GMPS), an important subsystem of the Fermilab
    Booster accelerator complex, by training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture
    its full dynamics. They implement a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP)19 as a
    policy model. Additionally, they use of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), which
    are LSTMs are able to learn about previous inputs through the accumulation of
    weights in a hidden global state variable. 6.5. Wireless networking The concept
    of DT network (DTN) [61], [191] has recently emerged as a virtual representation
    of the physical network infrastructure that aims at analyzing, diagnosing, simulating
    and controlling the physical network based on data, model and interface, to achieve
    the real-time interactive mapping between physical network and virtual twin network
    [167]. Specifically, the next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g.,
    5G-and-Beyond networks) are expected to simplify the deployment of DT at different
    communication layers in order to fulfill the monitoring and control requirements
    of the future IoT applications and services [24]. In this context, Lu et al. [192]
    have introduce the Digital Twin Wireless Networks (DTWN) by incorporating DTs
    into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to
    the edge plane. Then, they propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework
    running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability
    and security of the system, and enhances data privacy by formulating an optimization
    problem for edge association and exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to
    find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset
    show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared
    to benchmark learning method. Khan and al. [170] argue that in order to enable
    future Internet of Everything (IoE) in the forthcoming 6G network, there is a
    need for novel framework can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the wireless
    network infrastructure and its underlying IoE services. Such a framework should
    be based on DTs, with the support of advanced continuous machine learning and
    optimization techniques, along with edge and cloud computing, network augmentation,
    and privacy and security-related technologies such as blockchain, homomorphic
    encryption, etc. Sun et al. [193] have presented a new vision of Digital Twin
    Edge Networks (DITEN), where DTs of edge servers estimate edge servers’ states
    and DT of the entire MEC system provides training data to minimize the offloading
    latency under the constraints of accumulated consumed service migration cost during
    user mobility. A mobile offloading scheme is proposed based on deep reinforcement
    learning (DRL) in DITEN to minimize the offloading latency under the constraint
    of accumulated consumed service migration cost during user mobility. The formal
    problem of dynamic multi-objective optimization is simplified by using Lyapunov,
    and the simplified problem is solved by deep reinforcement learning. Hexa-X project
    [137], [138] proposed to implement a digital system for the forthcoming 5G and
    6G wireless cellular networks towards supporting future industrial use cases such
    as autonomous and collaborative robots, massive twinning, holographic telepresence.
    Furthermore, Hexa-X proposed to study radio channel characterization and beam
    forming in mm-wave and sub-THz bands. As a part of the future 6G design, Hexa-X
    foresees to develop digital models for air-interface above 100 GHz and the development
    of low-cost, energy-efficient, and high-performance network monitoring, management,
    and orchestration solutions. It envisions seamless unification of the physical,
    digital, and human worlds, by providing fully immersive CPS integration using
    both metaverse and massive DT representations. Besides, the DT approach developed
    in Hexa-X project enable dynamic control of 5G slicing, ensuring that QoS guarantees
    are met for each slice with the respect of the diverse traffic patterns, and ensure
    the resource allocation is achieved for each slice with the respect of SLA agreements.
    It also envisions fair capacity assignment and planning for future 6G infrastructure
    on-the-fly. 6.6. Satellite communication Digital twin has been adopted to build
    satellite network emulator and implement small satellites management system, as
    depicted in Fig. 8, to monitor the health state of wireless links (e.g., delay
    and bandwidth), by retrieving and compiling information, logs and other data collected
    from the satellite segment [194]. For example, Petersen et al. [168], [169] have
    implemented an architecture for a dynamic link network emulator to fuel satellite
    digital in order to increase service availability. Similarly, Zhao et al. [91]
    have implemented an inter-satellite handover scheme to transfer existing users’
    connections from one satellite to another satellite, by reducing frequent disconnection
    and improving the capacity of wireless satellites’ links. The authors implemented
    a genetic algorithm as part of the DT to improve the quality of data delivery,
    reduce the latency and enhance the bandwidth between satellites. Furthermore,
    DT is promising technology to address the requirements of space congestion, as
    it contributes to the reduction of space debris. Specifically, DT helps to develop
    AI-based collision detection and signal interference prediction models to enhance
    collision avoidance and improve tracking methods of satellites, hence helps to
    avoid potential collisions with debris while achieving self-repair, warning against
    cyberattacks, and optimizing the fuel usage. Download : Download high-res image

    industry. 6.7. CyberSecurity As DT becomes more open to different industries stakeholders,
    however, the cybersecurity risks associated with its integration with traditional
    industries are often insufficiently explored. Holmes et al. [195] have surveyed
    different risks related to employing DT into these traditional use cases and studied
    different opportunities to mitigate cyber-security risks. Eckhart et al. [76]
    have proposed a framework to generate virtual environment from specification and
    tested security risks on live systems. The authors developed security modules
    on top of the framework for monitoring security threads and safety rules. Filippo
    et al. [21] have suggested a security testbed to automate offensive tactics using
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) solution, simulated defensive and penetration
    test exercises. Dietz et al. [196] have presented a process-based security framework
    to integrate DT security simulations in the security operations center. They used
    DT to simulate a man-in-the-middle attack and assist enterprise security by simulating
    attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. Furthermore, there
    are significant recent research efforts to unlock the potential of cybersecurity
    in DT environments [154], [197], [198], [199], [200], [201], [202]. These efforts
    focus on the design of safety rules at the planning phase, with the aim to predict
    and manage risks. Nonetheless, there is a need for advanced and standardized approaches
    that align with international regulations (e.g., NIS/GDPR Compliance), enable
    continuous cyber risk assessment, allow zero-day simulation and defense, and offer
    cybersecurity forensics. 6.8. Cultural heritage Europe’s cultural heritage strives
    to the diversity and rich mosaic of cultural and creative expressions, rooted
    in its art, architecture, practices, places, objects, artistic expressions, film,
    values, different types of music, economics, literature, and philosophy. The increasing
    need for shaping Europe’s digital future has fueled the need for the digitalization
    of our cultural heritage, thanks to the recent technologies such as Big Data,
    3D digital acquisition devices, 3D laser scanners, AI, 3D and XR. In the light
    of these evolving technologies and due to the complexity of the cultural heritage
    data and of their intrinsic interrelationships, Niccolucci et al. [203] have introduced
    a Heritage Digital Twin (HDT) to digitalize the Heritage Assets (HA). The authors
    proposed a novel ontology model in the frame of the Europeana platform to improve
    the digital transformation of cultural heritage and enhance the design and organization
    of digital space using DT for cultural heritage that models cultural heritage
    assets and their digital information. In parallel, Darwish et al. [204] have suggested
    an Historical BIM (HBIM) powered by Digital Twins for monitoring the deterioration
    of heritage structures, and blockchain for efficient and effective preventive
    conservation. Historical BIM creates a comprehensive and efficient data management
    system that collects data from different IoT sensors to create a high-fidelity
    physical replica of artworks. Likewise, Massafra et al. [205] have proposed new
    tools for managing the workflow of HBIM of Italian modern buildings built between
    the 1920s and 1960s. Their approach carries out information acquisition about
    the building, measures energy intervention, computes construction costs during
    building’s life cycle in order to predict their thermal demand. 7. Open challenges
    The concept of the digital twin is not new. However, despite the benefits in different
    domains, there are several thriving challenges towards its adoption at scale [206],
    [207]. These challenges should be addressed holistically to realize the significant
    advantages of their deployments. This section delves into the open issues that
    slowed down the widespread adoption of digital twin technology. 7.1. Security
    and vulnerability Cybersecurity is a significant challenge that faces the extensive
    adoption of DT [208]. Cyberthreats involving access to confidential data by unauthorized
    bodies pose a severe risk. In particular, scenarios involving multi-parties, data
    ownership, and intellectual properties should be considered. Different authorization
    roles, data accessibility limitations, and responsibilities should be granted
    to only authorized participating stakeholders. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    should be implemented in the digital twin to restrict network access based on
    a person’s role [209], [210]. Furthermore, security and privacy are the main concerns
    for sharing IoT data among distributed digital twin infrastructures. In particular,
    data in the DT network are fed and backed between the physical object and the
    virtual model, making the virtual model vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. Such
    attacks are critical for scenarios like remote robot surgery, intelligent transportation
    systems, and federated EU airport operations. Additional risks of data leakage
    arising from data aggregation, i.e., in some scenarios such as smart cities, future
    smart fabrics, healthcare, etc., data coming from different involved parties should
    be merged to improve the decision-making process and achieve connected digital
    twins. However, a significant risk is that data aggregators could be storing all
    shared data in one place, which creates a new and the heightened security risk
    for the digital twin. Besides, as the digital twin needs to synchronize the virtual
    replicas with the physical, real-world system or entities in real-time, data or
    a subset of data should be exchanged between both parties to achieve synchronization,
    which inevitably increases the surface attack and augment the risk of data leakage
    [10]. 7.2. Privacy-preserving Digital twins and the metaverse are envisioned to
    advance the future of healthcare and precision medicine [211]. Healthcare data
    contains sensitive and personal information that could be attractive to many parties.
    Therefore, healthcare systems require access control models to prevent cyber-attackers
    from using sensitive data for financial transactions with third-party providers,
    who may perform data analysis to identify individuals [212]. Digital twins for
    healthcare should ensure privacy and data integrity to protect the data from unauthorized
    access attempts from inside the network so that the system grants access to only
    authorized parties [7]. Conventional cryptographic primitives and access control
    models that empower traditional IoT communication have reached their limitations
    and cannot ensure the protection of health data existing in the healthcare industry,
    specifically when attacks could be intentional. 7.3. Ethics Responsibility, ethics,
    decency, and morality are essential pillars to enhance its innovation in digital
    twin [213]. Therefore, Simone et al. [214] discussed the ethics of digital twins
    in smart agriculture and highlighted the need for data sovereignty regarding data
    aggregation and data analytics on framing data. Similarly, in light of the ethical
    concerns in the healthcare domain, Derrick et al. [215] discussed the ethical
    considerations of psychological effects of the digital twin in the healthcare
    domain. Popa et al. [216] anticipated privacy and socio-ethical issues, especially
    when there is a digital twin connection between the patient and the model is established.
    Braun et al. [217] defined conditions that should be met for digital twins to
    take on an ethically justifiable form of representation, not only for improving
    diagnosis and therapy but also for providing future states of health and illness.
    Braun et al. [218] have elaborated a concise reflection on the ethical challenges
    of DT in healthcare and medicine. The authors suggest that patients should have
    control over their simulated and virtual representation and highlight the ambivalence
    in representation between enabling new modes of freedom and endangering through
    the predictive mode of digital twins. Another vital aspect in ensuring ethical
    digital twins is achieving data transparency and avoiding data bias while providing
    seamless data integration and making predictions. For example, historical data
    used to build virtual models in digital twins should not imply discrimination
    between target freedom rights, especially when human behavioral manipulation is
    involved [215]. Besides, even though digital twins create replicated copies of
    the human body, it should not conflict with human dignity, i.e., treating patients
    as a thing or robots is considered highly inappropriate and unethical. Hence,
    digital twins should not be used to amplify inequality, shorten the lives of some
    people for the benefit of others. 7.4. Scalability and complexity With the increasing
    adoption of the digital twin in large-scale projects like building construction,
    healthcare, automotive, aerospace, railcar design, military, and defense, etc.,
    digital twin networks become significantly complex as they need sophisticated
    data acquisition and storage [219] to design and build relevant models for these
    industries. Both the software and hardware components required to build the DT
    systems become more constrained and complex, e.g., they involve advanced techniques
    such as AR/VR and metaverse . Although significant efforts are to build scalable
    DT solutions [220], [221], they tend to implement specific scenarios in controllable
    areas such as labs and small factories. Therefore, we need efficient and cost-effective
    tools and software models that fit the requirements of different DT domains, ensure
    higher scalability and deal with big data analytics and massive network data processing
    to achieve more accurate models and higher performance in large-scale distributed
    DT scenarios. 7.5. Real-time properties A digital twin is envisioned to replicate
    physical entities to their virtual entities and enable synchronization between
    them to achieve real-time replication. To this end, data should be exchanged among
    potentially wireless and wired network infrastructure, potentially, each has its
    own routing and forwarding protocols, such as wireless cellular networks, Wi-Fi,
    optical metropolitan Ethernet, etc., which should be able to provide the right
    data at the right place and time. These networks, however, offer different Quality
    of Service (QoS) settings, which may impact the service level agreement (SLA),
    i.e., model simulation data could encounter higher latency (around 100 ms) and
    lower bandwidth, which will impact the delivery of real-time information and therefore
    influence the real-time synchronization between the real world and the DT system.
    Additionally, the emergence of new IoT services and applications, such as remote
    robot-assisted surgery [222] pose strict real-time QoS requirements on the underlying
    network. However, given the distributed nature of the digital twin systems and
    the variation of the network delay (e.g., queuing and propagation delays), it
    becomes challenging to keep network digital twins in sync or auto-sync between
    the physical network and digital twin network. Reflecting the changes in the physical
    entities to their virtual replicas in real-time can be even more challenging.
    Similarly, Digital Twins require continuous interaction between real-world objects
    and their virtual representation in real-time and reliable two-way communications.
    However, due to the dynamic behavior and the frequent changing in the network
    environment, it becomes challenging to ensure strict reliability, low latency,
    and real-time requirements over the future wireless broadband 5G/6G network. To
    achieve this goal, it is necessary to provide an efficient network architecture
    that aids in developing many scalable, interoperable and predictable IoT applications.
    This network architecture must be flexible enough to be reprogrammed following
    any change in the digital object. Additionally, we need to simplify the design
    of network digital twins as much as possible, describe and specify QoS and real-time
    requirements of different DT applications, and achieve automated resource allocation
    and orchestration to fulfill the requirements of these applications. 7.6. Interoperability
    and standardization There are several research projects to achieve the different
    visions, perhaps diverging designs, developments, and implementations of a digital
    twin. As described in Section 3, multiple parties have been involved in the standardization
    and design of diverse digital twin architectures. Most of them lack consensus
    when implementing DT systems. Hence, digital twins are harmed by fragmentation
    and heterogeneity since each model is developed from scratch, no common methods,
    models, or mechanisms are considered. There are no open and standardized open
    interfaces to meet the requirements of all digital twin stakeholders, which makes
    it difficult and even impossible to ensure interoperability among different DT
    implementations. However, providing common data standards and interoperability
    can ensure the widespread adoption of DT technologies in various domains. Therefore,
    there is a need to develop novel modeling tools to build models for digital twins
    that draw on several industry schemas. There are several research efforts to build
    a generalized library to create an interoperable implementation of the IoT digital
    twin. For example, Picone et al. [74], [101] introduced WLDT (White Label Digital
    Twins), a general-purpose library for developing different modular DT systems
    for IoT. Similarly, several other solutions [48], [55], [56], [102], [116], [223]
    have been explored to provide a framework to enable modular, adaptable, and interoperable
    software agents for sharing data across the different lifecycle phases; however,
    they tend to provide implementations for specific use cases or DT domains. Furthermore,
    despite the recent efforts achieved by Microsoft towards providing a standardized
    definition language for describing models, devices, entities, objects, etc. in
    digital twin [86], helping to implement vertical use cases and complex modeling
    relationships, however, more efforts are required to develop open vendor-neutral
    DTDL to achieve an accurate representation of the physical environment. Such a
    DTDL should ensure the consistency of DT technical implementations and support
    the heterogeneity of devices and vendors that adopt the DT technology. Hence,
    an open and unified digital twin network system and abstract interfaces are required
    to keep all the expected common functionalities and components to enable cross-industry
    implementations of DT systems and ensure compatibility and interoperability. 7.7.
    High-fidelity data modeling difficulties As many industrial sectors are turning
    to digital twins to improve the operational efficiency and enhance the workflow
    and life cycle of their products, digital twin data modeling should not only focus
    on the accuracy of model functions but also should consider flexibility and the
    expendability of the model to compose and extend future requirements to support
    large-scale and multipurpose applications [17], [224]. Furthermore, digital twins
    can contain different representation models, such as statistical, machine learning,
    geometrical and material, mixed-reality, and virtual-augmented reality augmented
    with physics/data-oriented models, which makes it hard to keep data consistent.
    Digitalized data in DT should be updated in real-time to track every change in
    the physical system, i.e., metamodels involving data about the scheme of the system,
    measured data values and data structure at runtime should be consistent. In this
    context, Wilking et al. [225] proposed a SysML approach for improving digital
    twin data modeling by creating DT behavior using SysML diagrams and generating
    usable code to speed up the implementation of DT applications. The authors proposed
    extending the SysML model with a new XMI file to enable universal utilization
    of all SysML diagrams in DT modeling. Nevertheless, the solution proposes some
    extensions to SysML diagrams. Still, more investigation is needed to ensure the
    feasibility of integrating system models into more generalized “SysML4DigitalTwins”
    to lower the obstacles of Digital Twin design. Hence, we need to rethink how many
    diagrams should be considered to describe fully and model DT systems (i.e., similar
    to the improvements made to UML diagrams) towards providing autonomous digital
    twins with a consistent control loop. UML is also expected to support model-driven
    engineering (MDE) for simplifying the connection between DT and the physical world
    [226], [227], as it enables a bidirectional relationship between the UML models
    of the digital twin [228]. There are diverse research directions that attempt
    to provide the data model for digital twin, based on Automation Markup Language
    (AutomationML) [229] to model DT attributes using machine learning methods [230],
    using stacked auto-encoder (SAE) based model [231], by leveraging the open manufacturing
    platform [232], and many other approaches involving hierarchical functional data
    models. Therefore, we need a more generic modeling model, aka meta-data model,
    that covers the digital twin applications. We can rethink abstracted metamodels
    similar to those the W3C provides for web services. Offering an abstracted level
    of models helps DT capture the system’s salient features, improve its performance,
    refine the granularity configuration, and reduce the need for high-demand computational
    resources. 7.8. Data coherence and model revision Data coherence and model revision
    are key challenging issues to ensuring the high fidelity of data in digital twins.
    Indeed, since DT uses a huge volume of data, e.g., historical data, versioning
    and archiving those data, recent approaches [233], [234] suggest integrating blockchain
    InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for data distribution. Such an approach could
    also be used to power MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) algorithms to alternate
    between previous decision-making protocols, compile historical data to forecast
    future possible states of the systems, and thereby adapt MLOps to anticipate future
    decision-making algorithms. Indeed, machine learning models usually degrade in
    production, i.e., concept drift occurs when changes in the relationship between
    input and output data give rise to deterioration in prediction accuracy and provoke
    unforeseen changes in the predicted statistical properties of the digital twin.
    Digital twin require closed-loop data wrangling and cleaning at scale using Automated
    Machine Learning (AutoML), which in turn will help digital twin to support drift
    monitoring to continuously track the ML model’s performance in production and
    adapt both models and decision-making algorithms according AutoML. We can rethink
    of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) [235] as a tool for providing explanations
    for digital twin models. Recent approaches have shown that XAI can be a powerful
    tool for creating trustworthy, intelligent digital twins in healthcare [236],
    in maintenance, repair, and operations [237], as well as for predicting lane changes
    for vehicles [238] and distributed autonomous mobile robots and Human-in-the-loop
    data integration [239]. In the light of those contributions, we argue that explaining
    predictions, recommendations, and other AI output to users is critical for building
    trust in digital twins [240]. We believe user-level explainability can help to
    find and detect potential issues of DT in production, e.g., global explainability,
    can help to spot how small features in a model can contribute to predicting the
    overall model [241]. 7.9. Unclear access to quality data A digital twin is built
    upon data, giving insight into the system’s past, present, and future status,
    as well as model knowledge and algorithms, to make some facts about the DT systems.
    All these data and models should fit the purpose for which they have been collected
    or designed to ensure that DT applications continue to work correctly and update
    and upgrade to meet the needs they are used for. While recent advances in machine
    learning and artificial intelligence, in general, have provided new solutions
    for data filtering and quality insurance and help to evaluate the fitness of DT.
    For example, AI algorithms usually need cleaned and labeled data to predict the
    future states of physical entities and assets. However, AI solutions have limitations
    that can further complicate the business goals, as they have low interpretability
    and explainability and require additional time to learn patterns. Indeed, given
    the variability and heterogeneity of data that feed the digital twin in different
    manufacturing domains, data modeling poses a significant burden in providing consistent
    models to empower the DT system. Hence, data quality is paramount to prediction
    accuracy [242]. 8. Trends and key research directions in digital twins A digital
    twin is a The wireless research landscape is rapidly evolving to address emerging
    Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as extended reality flying vehicles,
    brain–computer interaction, etc. In this new context, DT has to address new requirements
    such as self-sustaining wireless systems, proactive online learning-based systems,
    isolation between twins-based services (microservices architecture), device mobility
    Management and DT forensic. In this section, we highlight diverse DT trends and
    research directions. 8.1. Composable digital twins Digital twins are envisioned
    to assemble complex systems such as turbines, wind farms, power grids, and energy
    businesses, which creates additional complexity beyond the physical models to
    support future capabilities such as data services (i.e., including data integration,
    aggregation, and management), semantic labels, trustworthiness, user interfaces,
    intelligence, etc. Hence, new approaches for composing digital and physical elements
    into larger assemblies and models can simplify the design, control, management,
    and operation of the DT [45]. Therefore, composability is key to scaling DTs,
    delivering high-value business capabilities, and providing reusable, interoperable,
    and composable enterprise business. The Digital Twin Consortium recently released
    the Capabilities Periodic Table (CPT) framework [51] to provide an architecture-
    and technology-agnostic solutions for Composable Digital Twins (CDT). The CDT
    framework should be able to deliver service-based orchestration by developing
    modular packaged business capabilities that can develop and adapt the digital
    application to business needs and support large-scale, complex environments [243].
    Therefore, we should identify composability gaps that should be addressed and
    focus on delivering DT capabilities in a model-based approach. Additionally, we
    should envisage a composable- and capability-driven architecture that facilitates
    the composability of DT models and ensure the interoperability among modules,
    thereby driving innovative business future in the next 10 years. 8.2. Cell-based
    microservice Current DT software implementations like Eclipse Ditto [66] use different
    microservice layers (e.g., policies, connectivity, gateway, things, concierge,
    etc.) using Kubernetes-like (e.g., Helm, Docker, OpenShift, etc.) microservices
    through an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model. While these microservices offer
    a global security approach chained as a single service to mitigate attacks, enable
    modular architecture, and improve network efficiency, they are associated with
    the complexities of the distributed system and a higher chance of failure during
    communication. Cell-Based Microservices [244] are recently envisioned as a promising
    approach to building independently deployable components that can be loaded from
    multiple network locations and repositories at runtime. Unifying and harmonizing
    these components will enable horizontal and vertical scalability and deployment
    independence. Thus, multiple federated IoT application components can run independently
    and be redeployed without restarting IoT applications or interrupting IoT services.
    Therefore, we need to rethink how to develop distributed Cell-Based microservices
    to ensure deployment independence and promise flexibility and autonomy. The sought-after
    goal guarantees modularity and cooperation among distributed federated DT networks.
    8.3. Standardization We discussed in Section 3 diverse standardization efforts
    to implement an architecture for DT. We also highlighted in Section 7.6 the challenging
    interoperability issues that stem from the diversity of DT architectures. Indeed,
    recently, there have been some trends, such as Change2Twin project [245], towards
    providing a common framework that could fit most DT use cases. For example, the
    DT consortium is collaborating with the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) to
    concentrate, combine and standardize a single platform and framework that fits
    most DT systems. We argue that we need to rethink the design of new abstracted
    programming interfaces that provide standard ways to communicate with, and control,
    equipment made by different manufacturers. Some enterprises started implementing
    such an API, e.g., mapped, the data infrastructure platform maker, has recently
    launched a new service built on top of the open-source Brick Schema for describing
    physical, logical and virtual assets, similarly to Qualcomm’s Smart Cities Consortium
    and Zyter, the IoT provider, has recently partnered to develop and standardize
    interfaces to enable DTs for diverse domains such as healthcare and smart cities.
    We believe that we will see, shortly, a wave of consortium partnership agreements
    to find new ways to improve efficiency and build better interoperable and standardized
    DT interfaces. 8.4. Dataverse DT can work with metaverse to enable the future
    Industrie 5.0, including the manufacturing industry (e.g., creating virtual copies
    of entire factories and plants to ensure transparent production processes), automobile
    sector (e.g., creating a virtual model of a physically connected vehicle), healthcare
    (e.g., surgery training), etc. The union of both technologies will lead to the
    creation of the dataverse, which will build the data infrastructure to support
    the next generation of DT use cases. We claim that traditional hierarchical DT
    asset structures will disappear and new graph-based solutions, such as those modeled
    with the DTDL approach [86] will appear to facilitate the integration of DT assets
    and better describe their relationships. We also believe that dataverse will offer
    a unique opportunity to build interoperable and high-fidelity DTs that relate
    all data in the virtual world, entities, and objects, thus unfolding in the future.
    8.5. Security We highlighted in Section 7.1 how security and vulnerability pose
    a significant challenge to the large-scale adoption of DTs by major industry sectors.
    Meanwhile, DT bodies such as the Industry IoT Consortium (IIC) are working to
    offer new models and trustworthiness framework that reinforces the security and
    privacy of DTs. Furthermore, the recent advances in blockchain consensus algorithms
    [22], [192], [246] such as the Proof of Authority (PoA), Proof of Ownership (PoO),
    and the merging of the Ethereum blockchain to support the Proof of Stack (PoS),
    which will drive the advances towards providing more secure and inviolable digital
    infrastructure [234]. We claim that the increased development of edge AI, TinyML,
    and local machine learning models and algorithms and the advances in federated
    machine learning will foster the development of DT security solutions and increase
    the awareness of DT security across the DT lifecycle. We believe that the aforementioned
    distributed intelligence approaches will foster the development of new models
    or prototypes that target competitive intelligence attacks. We argue that future
    DT systems will support fully operational competitive intelligence that allows
    them to preserve their trustworthiness and integrity. 9. Conclusion In this paper,
    we have surveyed a wide range of recent and state-of-the-art projects, software
    implementations, and standardization efforts in the realm of digital twins. This
    effort stemmed from the needs of the research community, where we found that most
    researchers call for current digital architectures that need additional research
    efforts to provide a unified framework that can ensure interoperability between
    different industrial applications, allow diverse domains that can benefit from
    DT and ensure secure data dissemination at scale among potentially distributed
    industrial IoT systems. To address the challenge of integrating heterogeneous
    DT systems, researchers have started to focus on redesigning the current DT architecture
    by breaking the tight integration of its capabilities towards integrating various
    methods, models, and processes to simplify data collection, formatting, and transmission.
    As a result, major research projects focus on designing DT applications to support
    specific use cases and applications. However, the next generation of DT will benefit
    not only from the simplicity of the implementation but also from the benefits
    of composability, distributed and federated intelligence, security by design frameworks,
    network slicing, and common standardization, which will have the potential to
    simplify its integration into various industrial use cases. Unfortunately, we
    did not find any comprehensive study of existing techniques, research projects,
    and tools summarized in a single study. To that end, we provide a taxonomy of
    the key challenges and opportunities in a number of different areas, including
    architectural models, security and vulnerability, ethics and data sovereignty,
    scalability, real-time properties, interoperability with heterogeneous connectivity
    protocols, as well as high-fidelity data modeling. We showed that both academia
    and industry are involved in the development of digital twins; however, most of
    the investigations continue to focus on very specific scenarios involving the
    optimization of that product’s lifecycle. We argue that these studies are important,
    but they should only be done in the context of open, standardized APIs that can
    predict future use cases like the metaverse and holographic mixed reality, cellular-connected
    drones, autonomous supply chains, and massive twinning. Although several commercial
    and open-source implementations of DT software exist, they also pose a set of
    challenges that should be addressed, which will require coordinated attention.
    From the research community’s success and wide acceptance, our goal was to present
    these challenges and present current standardization efforts. By no means have
    we presented an exhaustive list of opportunities. We believe there are additional
    challenges and opportunities. Research exists along a broad spectrum, ranging
    from composable DT solutions to be used in the upcoming 5G network and beyond,
    to high-fidelity formal data modeling, knowledge data mapping, and blockchain-based
    security models to improve the trustworthiness of the DT-based solutions. The
    aim of this paper is to put forth these challenges, leading to many more research
    efforts. CRediT authorship contribution statement Akram Hakiri: Conceptualization,

    learningDeep learningReinforcement learningManipulator 1. Introduction Manipulating
    different objects is a trivial task for humans owing to having unique vision capabilities
    and a highly flexible body structure with 224 degrees of freedom (DoF) and approximately
    630 skeletal muscles [1]. However, robotic manipulation is one of the complex
    problems, and is an active research field. The reason is that replicating the
    vision and actuation capabilities of natural organisms (e.g. humans) is a very
    challenging task by using the respective (possibly simplified) robotic counterparts.
    As complexity of robot structures increases from hard to soft (Section 2), developing
    controllers for them becomes more difficult which is the motivation behind using
    machine learning (ML) methods for robot control development. The robotic literature
    contains multiple surveys to track the rapid progress of ML methods specially
    reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL) in robotic problems. Amarjyoti
    [2] focused on the RL and deep RL (DRL) methods applied to learning robotic manipulation
    without investigating field-specific applications. Moreover, Amarjyoti [2] only
    considered discrete robots and neglected soft ones. Thuruthel et al. [3] and Kim
    et al. [4] covered this shortcoming by investigating control strategies for soft
    manipulators. Given the complexity of robotic manipulation, learning controllers
    from scratch is challenging and sometimes costly. Moreover, adapting to sudden
    changes and performing multi-tasking is not trivial. Imitation learning can be
    used to reproduce expert’s behaviors on the robot and generalize to new environments
    [5]. Demonstrations for imitation learning are either direct or indirect. Training
    data collection in direct demonstration like kinesthetic teaching [6] and tele-operation
    teaching [7] is accomplished on the robot itself. Indirect demonstrations are
    collected in a separate environment without interaction with the robot [8]. Another
    approach to ease the learning process is training in simulated environments and
    transferring the learned skills to real robots. This can be achieved by using
    simulation-to-real methods which have been reviewed extensively [9], [10], [11].
    Robust manipulation requires determining the object’s position with respect to
    the robot end-effector (EE) which is the end of the robotic arm (see Fig. 4).
    This requirement motivated Kleeberger et al. [12] to review ML for object grasping
    methods based on vision. Vision-based robot grasping methods are either analytic
    (also denoted as geometric) or data-driven [12], [13]. In analytic methods, force-closure
    grasp is performed with a multi-fingered robotic hand such that the grasp capability
    has four properties namely dexterity, equilibrium, stability, and certain dynamic
    behavior [14]. A grasp is called force-closure if and only if arbitrary force
    and moment can be exerted on the object using the robot finger tips without breaking
    contact with the object [15]. To perform such a grasp, a constrained optimization
    problem is solved to satisfy a subset or all of these four properties. The second
    category of grasping methods is data-driven. This category is based on ranking
    sampled grasp candidates according to a specific measure. Moreover, the candidate
    generation is usually based on a heuristic grasp experience or one generated using
    a simulated or real robot and grasp skill is learned using ML. The focus of Kleeberger
    et al. [12] is on data-driven methods. Newbury et al. [16] also reviewed the two
    grasping categories with a special focus on DL solutions. While developing state-of-the-art
    ML methods for learning complex problems is worthwhile, trying to use them in
    practice is just as important. That is why instead of focusing on ML methods themselves,
    Fabisch et al. [17] devoted a complete survey to real-world applications of ML
    methods for robot behavior learning. Following a similar approach, Benotsmane
    et al. [18] investigated ML application to the industrial domain whereas [19]
    investigated ML and DL methods for agricultural automation. These methods have
    even been used in space applications [20]. Given the versatility of learning problems
    in manipulation tasks, Kroemer et al. [21] presented a formalization with five
    categories that covers majority of manipulation learning problems for soft and
    discrete robots. The five categories are state space representation learning,
    dynamics model learning, motor skills learning, preconditions learning for already
    learned skills, and hierarchical learning. The preconditions of a skill refer
    to the circumstances under which that skill can be executed. In hierarchical RL
    literature, the preconditions are also known as the initiation set of temporally
    extended actions which are called options [22]. While the surveys listed above
    are useful in their own rights, we believe a new survey covering practical application
    of ML and DL to different domains is still needed. In this paper, we strive to
    review cutting edge ML/DL technologies in medical, industrial, agricultural, search
    and rescue, military, and space applications. Table 1 illustrates the contribution
    of our paper, as compared with existing survey papers. The rest of the paper is
    as follows. Sections 2 Manipulators structure, 3 Manipulator control are devoted
    to robotic manipulator structures and control, respectively. RL basics are reviewed
    in Section 4 and their usage and challenges in robotic manipulation are reviewed

    manipulators consist of multiple links connected together with multiple joints.
    The number and configuration of links and joints depend on the tasks for which
    manipulators are designed for. Different types of joints are shown in Fig. 1 [24].
    Revolute joint (Fig. 1(a)), prismatic joint (Fig. 1(b)), and screw joint (Fig.
    1(e)) provide rotational, translational, and rotational motion around one axis,
    respectively. These three joints have only one DoF. Cylindrical joint (Fig. 1(c))
    has translation and rotational motions providing two DoF. Planar joint (Fig. 1(d))
    provides translation along two axes and rotation around one axis yielding three
    DoF. Spherical joint (Fig. 1(f)) provides rotation motions around three axes,
    producing three DoF. Utilizing different combinations of joints illustrated in
    Fig. 1 leads to different manipulator arms capable of handling various tasks.
    Some typical manipulator arms using different joint types are shown in Fig. 2
    [25]. Cartesian robot (Fig. 2(a)) is only made of prismatic joints providing translational
    motion along three axes. Cylindrical robot (Fig. 2(b)) makes use of a cylindrical
    joint and a prismatic one to provide translation along two axes and rotation around
    one axis. Spherical robot (Fig. 2(c)) is able to cover a half-sphere due to its
    two revolute joints and one prismatic one. SCARA [26] (Fig. 2(d)) stands for Selective
    Compliance Assembly Robot Arm which is equipped with two revolute joints and a
    prismatic one. The operational space of SCARA is similar to a cylinder. Angular
    robot (Fig. 2(e)) utilizes three revolute joints to provide a half-sphere operational
    space. Download : Download high-res image (251KB) Download : Download full-size

    joint with 1 DoF, (c) cylindrical joint with 2 DoF, (d) planar joint with 3 DoF,
    (e) screw joint with 1 DoF, (f) spherical joint with 3 DoF. As shown in Fig. 3
    [3], there is a taxonomy on types of robotic manipulators. At the top of the taxonomy
    resides hard robots which are made by chaining multiple links together through
    joints [3]. Discrete robots fall under hard robots which need a minimum DoF to
    reach every point with arbitrary orientation within their task space. Robotic
    arms that have DoFs more than what is strictly needed to cover their tasks space
    are called redundant manipulators [27]. The end-effector of manipulators with
    redundant joints can be moved to any desired pose using different joint angles
    configurations which is useful in constrained workspaces. The idea is depicted
    in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the robot is able to reach the same pose via three
    different joint configurations, in view of its extra DoF. As a result, if one
    of the configurations is not feasible due to existing obstacles in the robot task
    space, the desired pose (i.e. position and orientation) is reached via one of
    the two remaining joint configurations. Download : Download high-res image (267KB)

    using different joint types: (a) cartesian robot, (b) cylindrical robot, (c) spherical
    robot, (d) SCARA robot, and (e) angular robot. Increasing the DoF to connect a
    large number of short links leads to continuum manipulators which are a subset
    of a broader class of hyper-redundant manipulators [28]. The structure of continuum
    robots bears resemblance to snake’s skeleton (Fig. 3). The high number of short
    links makes continuum robots highly flexible, but their motion is still somewhat
    limited. Moreover, hard robots with precise movements [29], [30] require high-end
    servo motors, which are costly. Additionally, in human–computer interaction scenarios,
    the operational space of a hard robot must be specified very carefully to avoid
    collision of the robot with its user during operation. These issues of the hard
    robots have pushed researchers toward the development of soft robots in which
    links and joints are avoided altogether. Instead of metals and hard plastics,
    soft robots are commonly made of flexible material [31] that are safer for applications
    involving close contact with humans. Soft robots have the potential to insert
    human body in a noninvasive manner for performing operations in hard-to-reach
    areas. Examples of soft robots for medical applications are rehabilitation gloves
    made of water reservoirs and hydraulic pumps for actuation [32] or thumb rehabilitation
    gloves to aid patients in restoring the correct function of their thumbs [33].
    As mentioned by Chen et al. [34], soft robots are low cost, easily manufactured,
    flexible, and compliant with human safety [35], [36], [37], [38]. However, the
    use cases of soft robots are not limited to medical applications [39]. Multiple

    with a redundant DoF is able to set its end-effector to a specific pose via different
    joint configurations. 3. Manipulator control The primary goal of a manipulator
    control module is to have the ability to transfer the manipulator EE to a certain
    pose within the reachable workspace of the manipulator. The reachable workspace
    is the 3D (position) or 6D (3D position and 3D orientation) Cartesian space around
    the manipulator [44]. While the structural properties of manipulators play a major
    role in their abilities to complete certain tasks, developing solid controllers
    for them is just as important. 3.1. Inverse kinematics Manipulators and in general
    any robotic system made of multiple joints (e.g. humanoid robots) are usually
    controlled using inverse kinematics (IK) [45], [46], [47], [48]. The IK module
    computes appropriate values for manipulator joints such that its EE is transferred
    to a desired target pose. After solving the IK problem of a given robot, it is
    possible to move the robot EE to any desired pose within its workspace by setting
    joint angles to the values dictated by the IK solution. However, solving the IK
    problem can be tedious and challenging for complex robots which has encouraged
    researchers to utilize ML for robot control [49], [50]. 3.2. Inverse dynamics
    In addition to computing joint values using IK, it is necessary to compute net
    reaction forces and net moments for each joint of the robot which is accomplished
    using inverse dynamics [51]. Modeling robot dynamics is crucial for energy-efficient
    and robust robot control as well as safe human–robot collaboration. Based on Newton’s
    second law, the dynamic of a freely moving rigid body can be expressed as the
    following second-order differential equation [52], [53]: (1) where vector contains
    the robot joint forces and torques. Given that is the position vector for the
    robot joints, and q̈ are the joints velocity and acceleration vectors. Matrix
    is the inertia matrix related to joint position. Moreover, is the Coriolis [54]
    and centrifugal forces, is gravity, and represents friction. 4. Reinforcement
    learning primer RL is a subfield of ML in which an intelligent agent learns to
    take appropriate actions based on observed states such that a certain utility
    function is maximized. An RL problem is a sequential decision making task represented
    as a Markov decision process (MDP) [55]. Each MDP is a 4-tuple element, i.e.,
    where is the state space, is the action space, is the reward function, and is
    the environment dynamics model. At each time step , the probability of observing
    state given that action is taken at state is determined by the dynamics model
    . An RL agent learns from direct interaction with the environment. In each episode,
    starting from an initial state , the agent takes multiple actions until the problem
    goal is achieved or certain number of steps are passed upon which episode is terminated.
    At each time step , action is selected based on observed state and the agent action
    selection policy with parameter vector . The agent learns to maximize the expected
    sum of discounted rewards: (2) where is the discount factor and expectation is
    computed with respect to a set of all possible trajectories when policy is followed.
    Each trajectory is a sequence of transitions where equals to the reward function
    value . The discount factor enforces the fact that as we get further away from
    the current time step , we care less about the obtained immediate rewards. 4.1.
    Value function RL algorithms are usually based on learning a value function which
    can be a function of states called state-value function or a function of pairs
    of {state, action} called action-value function [55]. The state-value function
    estimates the utility of being in state and action-value function estimates the
    utility of taking action in state . These two functions can be expressed as [56]:
    (3) (4) where is the immediate reward at time step and is the discount factor.
    The expectation is taken over stochastic policy (used for action selection) and
    dynamics model . 4.2. On-policy vs off-policy RL RL methods are either on-policy
    or off-policy [55]. In on-policy methods, the policy used for interaction with
    the environment (action selection) is the same as the one updated according to
    the gathered interactions. Examples of on-policy methods are value iteration [57],
    policy iteration [58], and SARSA [59]. In the case of off-policy methods, the
    policy used for action selection is different from the one that is updated by
    the RL method. Examples of off-policy methods are deep deterministic policy gradient
    (DDPG) [60], deep Q-networks (DQN) [61], and Q-learning [62]. 4.3. Online vs offline
    RL The goal of offline RL is to learn policies in different applications such
    as robotics, education, and healthcare from existing datasets [63]. This way the
    cost of data collection and safety concerns during interaction of RL agents with
    their environments are addressed [64]. However, standard off-policy RL methods
    fail to learn from existing datasets without further interaction with the environment
    [65]. The failure is caused by value function over-estimation due to the difference
    between the distribution of the existing dataset and the learned policy [66].
    4.4. Model-free A subset of RL methods perform training based on the collected
    data during interaction with their environment. These methods do not rely on the
    environment dynamics model ( ) which is why they are called model-free RL (MFRL)
    methods. The motivation behind MFRL methods is that in RL problems, is usually
    not available. A notable family of MFRL methods is based on policy gradient which
    is reviewed in the following subsection. 4.4.1. Policy gradient One of the widely
    used families of RL methods is policy gradient. The first ever policy gradient
    method called REINFORCE was proposed by Williams [67]. The main idea is to optimize
    parameters vector of a given stochastic policy such that the objective function
    in Eq. (2) is maximized. To this end, the current version of the policy is used
    to interact with the environment in order to gather episodes each of which is
    at most steps long. Using the collected episodes, the gradient in Eq. (2) with
    respect to is approximated as [68]: (5) where is the empirical discounted return
    at time step of the th episode computed as: and is a baseline term which only
    depends on and it is used to reduce the policy gradient variance. Despite being
    simple, REINFORCE has achieved good results in several problems. However, this
    method conducts its search in the space of policy parameters. Making small modifications
    in the parameter space can cause significant changes in the policy behavior, leading
    to its destruction [69]. Lowering the learning rate can prevent policy destruction
    but it also slows down the learning process. Alternatively, it is possible to
    conduct search in the policy space, rather than the parameter space. Natural policy
    gradient (NPG) [70] is capable of controlling the amount of change between old
    policy and new policy in successive updates [71]. This is achieved by limiting
    the Kullback–Leibler divergence between and . NPG has been used in the natural
    actor-critic (NAC) method [72], [73]. Inspired by NPG, trust region policy optimization
    (TRPO) [56] has been proposed in which the amount of change between old and new
    policies is forced to be inside a safe region (the trust region). To propose TRPO,
    Schulman et al. expressed the expected cost of following policy as: (6) where
    is the initial state sampled from probability distribution and is the cost function.
    Kakade and Langford [74] showed that the expected cost of policy can be expressed
    as the expected cost of another policy : (7) where and are the expected cost of
    policies and , respectively. Moreover, is called the advantage function and it
    is the difference between action-value and state-value functions (Eqs. (3), (4))
    [56]. Using Eq. (7), Schulman et al. formulated TRPO algorithm as a constrained
    optimization problem to update the policy parameters. Both natural policy gradient
    and TRPO rely on second order derivatives for policy updates. This leads to heavy
    computation complexity in complex problems. To address this issue, proximal policy
    optimization (PPO) algorithm [75] considers the constraint on old and new policy
    as part of the objective function. This way the computation complexity of PPO
    becomes much less than TRPO but the aforementioned constraint is sometimes not
    satisfied which is negligible. PPO has also been extended to Trust Region-based
    PPO with Rollback (TR-PPO-RB) [76] which improves PPO sample efficiency and performance
    by proposing (1) a new clipping function to limit the difference between new and
    old policies and (2) revising the condition for triggering the clipping function.
    4.5. Model-based RL While MFRL methods can be applied to a wide variety of problems,
    they may suffer from low sample efficiency which has led to the emergence of model-based
    RL (MBRL) methods. MBRL methods consist of two phases: interaction with the environment
    and simulation. During the interaction phase, transitions are collected just like
    the MFRL method (Fig. 5.a). The gathered data are used to learn the dynamics model
    (Fig. 5.b). During the simulation phase, the learned dynamics model is used for
    the next state prediction in successive steps without actual interaction with
    the environment (Fig. 5.c). The simulated samples are then used for updating the
    action selection policy (Fig. 5.d). Download : Download high-res image (354KB)

    4.5.1. Dynamics model representation Depending on the problem at hand, the dynamics
    model may be expressed differently. As an example, in discrete environments, a
    tabular representation is suitable. In continuous environments, more sophisticated
    representations such as Gaussian process (GP) [77], Dirichlet process mixture
    model [78], and neural networks [79], [80] can be used. Capturing the inherent
    uncertainty of the environment by the dynamics model is desirable which can be
    achieved by probabilistic models such as GP or ensemble of multiple models e.g.
    multiple neural networks [80]. 4.6. Actor-critic architecture The actor-critic
    architecture is popular in the RL community. Several well-known RL methods such
    as DDPG, asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) [81], proximal policy optimization
    (PPO), phasic policy gradient (PPG) [82], soft actor-critic (SAC) [83] etc. have
    adopted this architecture. As the name implies, this architecture consists of
    actors and critics. The role of the critic is to judge the actions taken by the
    actor ( ) via estimating the long term utility of those actions. The actor’s duty
    is updating the policy parameters according to the received feedback from the
    critic. Training of the critic is accomplished using the transitions collected
    during the interaction of the actor with the environment. Considering the RL objective
    function in Eq. (2), critic can be modeled as either or [56]. 4.7. Inverse RL
    As the name implies, inverse RL (IRL) solves the inverse of problems addressed
    by RL [84]. In the RL setup, each problem is modeled as a MDP with a reward function
    and the objective is to find the optimal policy for reward maximization. On the
    contrary, in IRL, the optimal policy is known and the goal is to learn the reward
    function that has led to the optimal policy. IRL belongs to the family of learning-from-demonstration
    methods [85]. The major advantages of IRL are the replacement of reward engineering
    with expert demonstrations and better generalization [84]. In some cases, reward
    engineering for complex problems is challenging if not impossible. Without an
    appropriate reward function, RL methods fail to learn anything useful. Alternatively,
    IRL can be utilized to estimate the reward function according to a set of expert
    demonstrations. A noticeable example of this approach is learning to control a
    helicopter using IRL and RL. At first, an appropriate reward function was used
    based on complex maneuvers performed by an expert. The learned reward was then
    used to learn a policy to carry out those maneuvers [86]. Reusing learned knowledge
    is always desirable. However, in the RL setup, a policy learned for a specific
    environment and objective cannot be easily transferred to a slightly different
    environment. Even changing the noise level in the states may render the aforementioned
    policy useless. This is not the case for reward functions [87]. An already learned
    reward function for an environment can still be useful in a different version
    of the environment. This stems from the fact that in most cases, the learned reward
    function can be adjusted simply by extending it to unseen states of the new environment.
    5. Control using reinforcement learning In robotic applications, gathering sufficient
    amount of training data for running supervised learning is rarely practical in
    terms of cost and time. To gather training data, a human operator must move the
    robotic arm manually such that the problem goal is fulfilled. In complex problems,
    this manual data collection process takes a considerable amount of time which
    is not desirable. RL methods, on the other hand, do not need supervision. They
    can learn on their own provided that the learning problem is presented as an MDP
    with an appropriate reward function. In the remainder of this section, RL role
    in addressing robot control is investigated. 5.1. Model-free methods Dexterous
    manipulation is one of the most challenging RL tasks involving multiple robotic
    manipulators or fingers that cooperate in object manipulation (e.g. grasping and
    sliding) [88]. Given the high dimensionality of dexterous manipulation tasks,
    a large number of transitions is needed for training RL agents. Therefore, collecting
    sufficient number of training samples on real robots is not feasible. Chen et
    al. [89] proposed the REDQ method with sample efficiency in mind while achieving
    a performance close to the model-based methods (Section 4.5). In that study, the
    ratio of policy updates to collected sample size was set higher than 1 for sample
    efficiency. To keep the update steps beneficial, an ensemble of networks expressing
    Q function was used where the networks were initialized randomly but updated with
    the same target value (Eq. (8)). The computation of target values was performed
    using a randomly drawn subset of Q networks to reduce the variance of action-value
    estimation [89]: (8) where is the number of randomly chosen Q networks and determines
    the importance of the logarithm term against the action-value function. The minimum
    is computed over the soft state-value function of the SAC method. REDQ can be
    used alongside any off-policy MFRL methods like TD3 [90], SAC, and SOP [91]. As
    an alternative method for sample efficiency, researchers conduct training in simulation
    [92], [93], [94]. No matter how complex and accurate, existing simulators still
    cannot capture the full characteristics of real robots leading to the gap between
    simulation and reality. Obviously, an agent trained on simulated data needs further
    parameters tuning before appropriate deployment on a real robot. To this end,
    dynamic randomization [93], [95], [96] can be used to run multiple instances of
    simulations each of which has different parameter values. An example, dynamics
    randomization was utilized to train the 24-DoF Shadow hand [97] for object manipulation
    [98]. To this end, multiple instances of Shadow hand simulation with different
    sets of parameters (e.g. friction coefficients and object’s appearance) were run.
    The simulation was done using the OpenAI Gym benchmark [99], [100] implemented
    using MuJoCo [101]. The collected data were used to train OpenAI Five implementation
    [102] of PPO agent, which was later tested on a real robot setup. Apart from filling
    the gap between simulation and reality, running multiple simulation instances
    in parallel accelerates the data collection process [103]. Given the success of
    DDPG in various RL problems with continuous state and action spaces, it has been
    utilized to learn the control policy for an UR5 manipulator [104]. A reward function
    based on a manipulability index was proposed. The manipulability index reflects
    the robot ability to move in a specific direction and it is computed based on
    mapping robot’s operational space to joint space. The manipulability index has
    been reported to be a better measure of dexterity, as compared with the condition
    number or minimum singular value [105]. However, reward engineering is not always
    easy. As such, in addition to actual interaction with the environment, Vecerik
    et al. [106] utilized human demonstrations to aid DDPG training in learning complex
    manipulation tasks. The demonstrations were conducted using a kinesthetically
    controlled robot. Similarly, inspired by [72], Rajeswaran et al. [107] utilized
    demonstration to improve sample efficiency of natural policy gradient [70], [108],
    [109]. The resulting approach is called data-augmented policy gradient (DAPG)
    in which the policy parameters are initialized by behavior cloning (BC) [110],
    [111] via solving the following maximum-likelihood problem [107]: (9) where is
    the set of demonstration samples. In addition to using BC, DAPG modifies the standard
    policy gradient objective function (Eq. (5)) by adding an extra term for combining
    RL with imitation learning: (10) where is a weighting function that decays as
    the training unfolds. The reason for the additional term in Eq. (10) is that while
    BC is useful, policies initialized by this method are not necessarily successful
    due to distribution shifts between policy’s states and demonstrated ones [112].
    While BC helps with policy initialization, it fails to capture correct sequence
    of behaviors such as reaching, grasping, and moving an object. This requirement
    is enforced by the additional term in Eq. (10). The power of supervised learning
    has also been exploited to tackle high dimensional manipulation tasks. Levine
    et al. [113] proposed a guided policy search method to train the vision and control
    modules of an PR2 robot to carry out complex tasks of cap screwing on a bottle.
    Their method consists of outer and inner loops. In the outer loop, multiple linear
    Gaussian controllers are run on the actual robot to collect trajectory samples
    corresponding to different initial states. Dynamics models are fit to the collected
    trajectories and are used to improve . The inner loop alternates between optimizing
    and optimizing the policy so that it is matched against the trajectory distributions.
    The alternating optimization is implemented using the Bregman alternating direction
    method of multiplier (BADMM) algorithm [114]. The policy is trained to predict
    action sequence for each trajectory using only observation instead of full state
    . The motivation for using is that the policy can operate directly on raw observations
    (i.e. images) at inference time. 5.1.1. Time complexity of reviewed MFRL methods
    The characteristics of the reviewed MFRL methods in Section 5.1 are summarized
    in Table 2. The time complexities are rough estimations assuming that actors (and
    critics) used by these methods are modeled as NNs. In the computational complexity
    column of Table 2, and are the number of neurons in the th layer of actor and
    critic networks, respectively. Moreover, is the number of training samples, is
    the number of the network layer, is the number of episodes, is the number of time
    steps in each episode, and is the number of actor and critic networks. The methods
    listed in Table 2 have an actor-critic architecture. The time complexity of these
    methods is sum of two terms corresponding to actor and critic networks. Training
    an NN requires a forward pass as well as a backward one for backpropagation. The
    time complexity of backpropagation is similar to that of the forward pass which
    justifies the coefficient “2” in each complexity term for actor-critic methods
    listed in Table 2. Each term is the computation cost of matrix multiplication
    for moving forward from layer i to layer i+1 in a network. The superscript or
    for terms specifies that the layer belongs to the actor or critic network, respectively.
    According to the given descriptions, DDPG and PPO have similar time complexities
    which is the sum of computation costs for training their actor and critic networks.
    REDQ has a single actor and critics which is reflected in the critic term of its
    time complexity by coefficient as shown in Table 2. RDPG uses recurrent NNs as
    its actor and critic. The training is done using backpropagation through time
    (BPTT). In its simplest form, an RNN designed for processing episodes of length
    can be unfolded times (each RNN layer is cloned times) to form a larger feed-forward
    NN. The parameters of the unfolded NN can be then updated using standard back
    propagation method. That is why the time complexity of RDPG is similar to DDPG
    with the exception that the coefficient in each of the actor and critic terms
    is corresponding to episodes of length . A3C method exploits actors in parallel
    to collect training samples. Each actor is accompanied by its own version of the
    critic. Each of the actor-critic modules is updated independently and their parameters
    sets are used to update a global actor-critic model. The coefficient in the two
    complexity terms in Table 2 reflects the fact that actor-critic modules are used
    during the training. Table 2. Summary of MFRL methods used in robotic manipulation

    dynamics model can be used for simulated data generation, planning, or value function
    expansion. State-only imitation learning (SOIL) [116] is one of the MBRL methods
    that uses dynamics models for simulated data generation. SOIL collects the state
    sequences observed in the environment. It relies on an inverse dynamics model
    to predict the most likely action sequence that may have led to those state sequences.
    The evaluation of SOIL has been completed in simulation. Valencia et al. [117]
    took a step further and investigated the possibility of using MBRL on real robots.
    They utilized an ensemble of probabilistic networks and mixture of Gaussian distributions
    to generate simulated samples with better quality and capture dynamics model uncertainty.
    Twin-delayed DDPG (TD3) was used as the RL agent. An ensemble of probabilistic
    networks [118] was utilized by the MBPO method [119] to deal with the two sources
    of the dynamics model error. The first source is lack of knowledge about unseen
    regions of the state–action space leading to generalization errors. The second
    source is the changing behavior of the policy, owing to its updates which causes
    distribution shift. MBPO aims to manage these error sources by keeping the simulation
    horizon short and handling uncertainty using probabilistic networks. To this end,
    multiple transitions are randomly drawn from the pool of collected samples and
    expanded for simulated time steps where is the simulation horizon. The simulated
    and real training samples are used to update the policy using the SAC method.
    Different approaches have been taken to implement planning-based MBRL methods.
    Omer et al. [120] proposed MPC-SAC method by fusing SAC and model predictive control
    (MPC) to improve data efficiency of the MPC-MFRL approach [121]. Generative adversarial
    tree search (GATS) [122] used generative adversarial networks (GAN) [123] for
    dynamics model representation and Monte Carlo tree search [124] for planning.
    PILCO [125] was used to learn legged locomotion [126] and control of a low-cost
    manipulator [127]. PILCO is extremely powerful in capturing the uncertainty of
    the environment dynamics due to using GP as its dynamics model. However, GP is
    a non-parametric method with complexity which scales with number of samples .
    To keep the computation complexity bounded, probabilistic ensembles with trajectory
    sampling (PETS) [118] utilized an ensemble of probabilistic neural networks to
    capture epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties simultaneously. During the agent
    interaction with the environment, the state–action space is only partially observed,
    which is the cause of epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty is due to the
    inherent noise in the environment dynamics. PETS and some other MBRL methods [128],
    [129] used the cross entropy method [130] for online planning. However, CEM is
    not scalable to high dimensional tasks of vision-based RL [131]. In these problems,
    the visual states are mapped onto a latent space using DNNs. The reason that CEM
    is not scalable to high dimensional tasks is that it randomly generates actions
    sequences and executes the first action of the sequence with the highest expected
    reward. This is not an efficient strategy [129], [132]. Moreover, CEM solely attempts
    to maximize the extrinsic reward (obtained from the environment) of the sampled
    action sequence. As such, CEM lacks exploration which is crucial to successful
    learning in problems with sparse rewards and hard-to-explore state space. These
    drawbacks of CEM have prevented MBRL methods from reaching asymptotic performance
    of MFRL methods [118]. The exploration issue can be addressed using intrinsic
    rewards based on the prediction error of the next latent space [133], [134], [135].
    While intrinsic motivation based on curiosity has been used in multiple MFRL methods
    [133], [135], [136], [137], it has seen limited application in MBRL [138]. This
    stems from the fact that ground truth for the next observation in the latent space
    is not available during online planning. To address this issue, Plan2Explore [138]
    leveraged the disagreement between an ensemble of dynamics models as an estimate
    for the intrinsic reward. However, training multiple dynamics models is computationally
    intensive. This leads to the emergence of the curiosity CEM [131] approach which
    achieves exploration via curiosity by estimating intrinsic reward offline during
    training. The value function expansion approach of MBRL is usually paired with
    actor-critic methods. The actor parameters are updated such that the utility it
    receives from the critic element is maximized. As an example, the DDPG actor is
    trained by minimizing the following loss function over a batch of transitions
    : where is the vector of policy (actor) updated parameters. The critic parameters
    are updated such that the following mean squared error (MSE) is minimized: where
    is the critic parameters vector. Considering that the true values are unknown,
    the target values for training DDPG critic are estimated as: (11) where and are
    called the target networks that slowly track the changes of and parameters via
    Polyak averaging [60]. Value expansion methods such as Model-based value expansion
    (MVE) [79] and Stochastic ensemble value expansion (STEVE) [80] expand the one-step
    prediction of Eq. (11) to multiple steps in an attempt to make it more accurate
    accelerating the learning process. The expansion is achieved via simulation based
    on the actor and the learned dynamics model. Contrary to MVE that expresses dynamics
    model with a single neural network, STEVE utilizes an ensemble of neural networks
    to capture the uncertainty of the learned dynamics model. Table 3. Summary of

    Time complexity of reviewed MBRL methods Similar to Section 5.1.1, the characteristics
    of reviewed MBRL methods are summarized in Table 3. The common notations between
    Table 2, Table 3 have the same meaning. For further description on these notations
    refer to Section 5.1.1. SOIL method exploits set consisting of state-only demonstrations
    (sequence of appropriate states without actions) to achieve better sample efficiency.
    The cost of training the inverse dynamics model is for training samples. The inference
    cost of the inverse dynamics model to predict actions for the set is where is
    the number of demonstration pairs in set . SOIL uses DAPG method to update its
    policy. The policy update time complexity is sum of two terms i.e. . The first
    term is the cost of forward and backward passes through the policy network which
    is needed to compute the gradients of policy parameters . The second term is quadratic
    in number of policy parameters ( ) and it is needed to avoid the explicit computation
    of inverse of Hessian matrix required by NPG [69]. It is worth noting that DAPG
    relies on NPG for its policy update. The method proposed by Valencia et al. [117]
    relies on probabilistic NNs to capture the environment dynamics and TD3 as its
    RL agent. The cost of training the dynamics model is . During simulation, the
    dynamics model and TD3 actor are used for generating simulated samples. The cost
    of forward passes during simulation is . TD3 method has one actor network and
    two critic ones. Therefore, the cost of training TD3 is . As mentioned before,
    the coefficient reflects the cost of forward and backward passes during networks
    training. The MBPO method uses ensemble of probabilistic NNs as its dynamics model
    representation and SAC as its RL agent. Only one of the networks of the dynamics
    model is randomly selected for conducting a simulation with horizon . Therefore,
    the cost of generating simulation sequences is . The training cost of the dynamics
    model on real samples is . All of the components (actor, critic, state-value function)
    of the SAC agent are trained on simulated samples. The cost of training policy,
    critic, and state-value function are , , and , respectively. MPC-SAC method tries
    to enhance the performance of SAC method by combining MPC with a dynamics model
    expressed as ensemble of NNs. The training cost of the dynamics model on samples
    is for ensemble size of . A reward model is also considered with training cost
    . SAC training cost is for actor, for critic, and for state-value function. The
    MPC is used for better action selection based on simulation. For the current state
    , simulated sequences with horizon are generated using the dynamics model (for
    next state prediction), the SAC actor (for action selection), and the reward model.
    The cost of forward passes of the dynamics model is . Action selection cost is
    . The reward values during simulation are predicted with the cost . Based on the
    predicted rewards, the first actions in simulated sequences are sorted in descending
    order. After sorting, the average of the first actions is computed for execution
    in the environment. The sorting cost is . GATS method uses a GAN as its dynamics
    model, a reward network, and two networks. Therefore, GATS utilizes five NNs for
    its operation. For training samples, the cost of training these networks (forward
    and backward passes) is . Moreover, GATS uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
    perform its planning which has computational cost of where is the number of discrete
    actions of the environment and is the simulation horizon. The number of MCTS iterations
    is denoted as , the number of units in th layer of GAN dynamics model is , and
    is the number of processor cores (for parallel execution). The primary component
    of PILCO method is its powerful GP dynamics model which has time complexity of
    where is the environment state dimension. This time complexity is both for learning
    and inference. For optimizing policy parameter set , BFGS method can be used which
    has a time complexity of . For modeling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties,
    PETS uses an ensemble of probabilistic NNs with training cost . These NNs are
    used for propagating randomly sampled states with simulation horizon . The cost
    of these simulation steps is . The policy distribution is updated using CEM method
    with time complexity linear in the number of sampled states ( ). MVE and STEVE
    methods both use DDPG as their RL agent and perform value expansion up to steps
    using their learned dynamics models. The main difference between the two methods
    is that MVE uses a single NN as its dynamics model whereas STEVE uses an ensemble
    of NNs with size . The difference between time complexity of DDPG and its extensions
    (MVE and STEVE) is the value expansion via simulation which is reflected as coefficient
    in the last two rows of Table 3. In the last row of Table 3, the coefficient in
    the second term of STEVE is due to having critics. 5.3. Hierarchical RL The search
    space of complex robotic tasks is continuous and high dimensional which makes
    achieving effective exploration challenging. Such tasks require long sequences
    of successive transitions (known as rollouts) before the RL agent can reach its
    goal [139]. At the start of learning, the agent policy is not good enough to take
    appropriate actions. As a result, reaching key points in the task state space
    is unlikely, which slows down the learning process. However, Hierarchical RL (HRL)
    methods can exploit highly structured nature of robotics problems [140] to accelerate
    learning. Some HRL methods utilize multiple skills [141], [142] as sub-policies
    and a gating policy to execute appropriate skills based on observed states. Hierarchical
    relative entropy policy search (HiREPS) [140] adopts such an approach and uses
    softmax function as gating policy and dynamic movement primitives (DMP) [143],
    [144], [145] as sub-policies. Owing to the smooth and flexible trajectory generation
    of DMPs, HiREPS can learn real robot manipulation tasks but it has no mechanism
    to enforce nonzero selection probabilities for all of sub-policies. Therefore,
    sometimes only one of the sub-policies is updated. Moreover, HiREPS lacks the
    feature to set hyperparameters for gating and sub-policies independently which
    hinders learning. End et al. tried to address these issues [146]. Another category
    of HRL methods is based on temporal abstraction which breaks long rollouts into
    multiple shorter ones by choosing appropriate intermediate goals. Reaching these
    goals leads to the realization of the original goal. Multi-goal RL methods [147]
    are capable of achieving multiple goals offering better generalization and possibility
    for curriculum learning [148]. Hierarchical actor-critic (HAC) [149], [150] is
    one of the first temporal abstraction methods capable of tackling multi-goal manipulation
    problems. HAC utilizes DDPG for policy learning, universal values function approximators
    (UVFAs) [151] for multi-goal support and hindsight experience replay (HER) [152]
    to handle sparse rewards (Section 5.4.4). UVFA is a generalized value function
    that performs value estimation based on state , action , and goal . As an example,
    in a robotic manipulation task, goal can be the desired pose for the robot EE.
    The main idea of HAC is to use a multi-layer hierarchical policy. A sample hierarchical
    policy with three layers is depicted in Fig. 6. At the start of the rollout, based
    on state and the environment goal , the top layer policy chooses action as the
    goal of the middle layer policy to set goal for the bottom layer policy . After
    action selection for two time steps, returns the control to which selects action
    based on state and goal . Once again interacts with the environment by selecting
    actions and after which the control is returned to to select another goal . This
    trend continues until one rollout is complete. The advantage of temporal abstraction
    methods like HAC is that exploration is performed at all layers of the policy
    simultaneously which accelerates learning and increases the chance of visiting
    key states in complex environments. The drawback of HAC is that the time steps
    assigned to each of the policies at different layers is a fixed value. Referring
    to Fig. 6, the time scale is two, which means at each layer , policy is allowed
    to perform action selection twice in order to reach the goal assigned to it. Setting
    the right time scale has a direct impact on the learning progress of the HAC method.
    This issue has been addressed in HiPPO [153] which treats the time scale as a
    random variable sampled from a specific distribution. The randomization technique
    used by HiPPO leads to more flexible and faster learning. HiPPO leverages a two-layer
    hierarchical extension of PPO to control the behavior of the bottom layer according
    to a latent variable set by the top layer. The value of the latent variable is
    similar to the number of sub-policies in methods like HiREPS. Using the latent
    variable, HiPPO can achieve easy to hard learning. Similar curriculum learning
    has been achieved by options of interest (IOC) method [154], which controls its
    bottom layer according to the option index set by the top policy. Another drawback
    of HAC is the mismatch between transitions stored in the replay buffer of layer
    and the behavior of layer . Considering that the policy layers are updated in
    parallel, the old actions that have been chosen by layer do not necessarily reflect
    the behavior of the updated policy at layer . This mismatch can slow down learning.
    To address this issue, another HRL method called HIRO [155] proposed off-policy
    correction. HIRO considers a two-layer policy and revises the actions chosen by
    the top policy such that the likelihood of the transitions generated by the bottom
    policy is maximized. Considering that curiosity has a hierarchical nature [156],
    HAC has been extended to curious hierarchical actor critic (CHAC) [157] which
    offers a hierarchical curiosity mechanism to handle sparse rewards. HAC was accompanied
    by an additional reward signal encouraging curiosity. In addition to HER, curiosity
    is another method enabling learning from sparse rewards. The main idea is that
    the RL agent receives additional rewards for getting surprised [133], [158] which
    acts as an incentive for exploring unseen states. The surprise element can be
    expressed as the agent’s dynamics model prediction error [159]. Therefore, CHAC
    considers a dynamics model for each policy layer. Model estimates the next state
    given current state and action . For each layer , the intrinsic reward based on
    curiosity at time step is expressed as: Using , the total reward for layer at
    time step is computed as: where is the extrinsic reward (obtained from the environment)
    and is coefficient in range . Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    with three layers and time scale two interacts with the environment: time scale
    is number of time steps th layer can perform action selection before returning
    control to its upper layer for action selection. Yet another extension of HAC
    is called twin delayed HAC (TDHAC) [160]. This method utilizes a two-layer policy
    updated using the TD3 method. Moreover, compared with HAC, the replay buffer size
    of the top layer is reduced according to the time scale variable to avoid performance
    degradation due to an unnecessarily large buffer [161]. The applied modifications
    lead to successful learning of a pick-and-place task involving object interactions,
    which has not been investigated in the original HAC paper. Due to space limit,
    the rest of the HRL methods are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Summary of HRL

    is devoted to time complexity analysis of HRL methods in Table 4. The notations
    used in this table are similar to the ones used for MFRL and MBRL methods in Table
    2, Table 3. AHRM method aims to learn manipulation tasks by decomposing it to
    multiple phases such as 1. approaching an object, 2. performing pre-manipulation,
    and 3. object grasping. During the manipulation, certain objectives such as minimum
    execution time and obstacle avoidance must be satisfied but with different priorities
    depending on the current manipulation phase. The priorities of objectives are
    enforced via sorting a hierarchical reward mechanism with time complexity as shown
    in Table 4. The remaining time complexity terms for AHRM method are due to using
    PPO method (see third row of Table 2) for updating the policy based on the prioritized
    rewards. PG-H-RL utilizes TD3 method for learning grasp operation. However, the
    learning is aided by decomposing the graph operation to three phases: 1. approaching
    object, 2. grasping object, 3. lifting object. For each of the three phases, the
    reward value is defined differently to guide the agent toward completing that
    phase. The grasping quality is measured based on graspable criterion and ellipsoid
    space between the robot gripper fingers. These two criteria involve computing
    determinant of and null space of grasp matrix [188]. The time complexity of determinant
    and null space is of order where is the dimension of . The rest of the terms in
    the time complexity of PG-H-RL method in Table 4 is related to training the actor
    and the two critic networks of TD3 method. Pinsler et al. [166] proposed a two-layer
    HRL method which interacts with the environment according to a global context
    variable . Based on , the upper policy chooses one of the lower policies also
    called sub-policies as well as a local context variable . The appropriate pair
    is selected by applying argmax on the set where is a function for mapping global
    context to the local one . The chosen sub-policy sets the motion parameters based
    on which a trajectory is executed in the environment. Each of the sub-policies
    is trained using REPS [169] method which involves solving a dual problem using
    convex optimization and weighted maximum likelihood. For dual optimization, the
    Lagrange multipliers are determined using L-BFGS-B algorithm. The computation
    cost of L-BFGS-B is where is the number of BFGS updates stored in memory during
    optimization and is the number of Lagrange multipliers. The optimized Lagrange
    multipliers are used to weight training samples based on which weighted maximum
    likelihood (WML) is performed to optimize the sub-policy parameters. Adam optimizer
    can be used to perform WML with computation cost of where is the max number of
    iterations and is the number of sub-policy parameters. Each sub-policy is accompanied
    by its own reward model expressed as a GP. The true reward values are not known
    to train the reward models. That is why, the training targets are predicted by
    another model called outcome reward model which is learned based on human specified
    preferences on set of collected trajectories . The outcome reward model is also
    expressed as a Gaussian process. For each sub-policy, the cost of training each
    of the two reward models is . HRL-DCS method focuses on controlling a dual-arm
    robotic system for assisting astronauts. The method uses a two-layer hierarchical
    policy. Similar to HAC, the upper policy sets sub-goals for the lower policy to
    achieve. Both layers use NNs as their policy. The training of the two networks
    is of order where and refer to the number of units in the th layer of upper and
    lower policies, respectively. Witte et al. [172] proposed a hierarchical approach
    for object manipulation via cooperation between two identical manipulator arms.
    Each of the manipulators has a low level controller for performing object manipulation
    in XY plane. However, the yaw orientation of the object cannot be controlled by
    a single manipulator. Therefore, they must cooperate to perform pick-and-place
    maneuver on the object for any given position and orientation. To this end, a
    DQN agent was trained to assign manipulation tasks to the left or right manipulators
    to carry out the pick-and-place operation. DQN performs action selection based
    on Q-values estimated by its critic network. The cost of training the critic (forward
    and backward passes) with layers, and training samples is . SAC-LSP method is
    based on probabilistic graphical models. The approach forms a hierarchical policy
    with layers. The lowest level policy is and the top policy is . The action space
    of the policy is the latent space for policy below it. By setting the latent variable,
    policy at th layer affects the behavior of the policy at (i-1) layer. A bottom
    up approach is used for training the hierarchical policy. The bottom policy is
    trained. After freezing the trained parameters of the , its upper layer policy
    is trained. This trend is continued all the way up to the top policy . Each layer
    is trained using SAC method which utilizes actor, critic, and value networks.
    Therefore, the cost of training each layer is which is multiplied by . HIDIO is
    a two layer HRL method. The top layer is the scheduler that is invoked every times
    steps for option selection. The selected option is used by the bottom layer (the
    worker) to perform action selection in the environment. Assuming that the number
    of samples collected by the bottom layer is , the number of training samples for
    the scheduler is . Therefore, the time complexity of forward pass and backward
    pass for training the scheduler network is . The cost of forward and backward
    passes for training the worker network is . HIDIO also utilizes a discriminator
    network for estimating dense intrinsic rewards regardless of the sparsity of the
    environment extrinsic reward. Following a similar argument, the training cost
    of the discriminator network is DHRL method combines a two-layer hierarchical
    policy with graph search. The upper policy ( ) sets a subgoal for the lower policy
    . Using function , the current state is mapped to the goal space. The mapped state
    and subgoal are added to a previously initialized graph expressing connections
    between different subgoals. Dijkstra method is used to find the optimal path between
    and . The lower policy then tries to achieve the way-points on the optimal path
    one by one. The edge costs of the graph are estimated using a Q network called
    . Another Q network called is used to train the lower policy. Overall, the training
    cost of , , , and are , , , and , respectively. Moreover, the graph search cost
    is of order . PAHRL method utilizes a two-level HAC agent and graph search to
    achieve manipulation tasks. The cost of training the actor and critic networks
    at each level of the HAC is which is doubled due to having two layers. Basically,
    PAHRL method forms a state transition graph called the state memory graph. The
    graph is constructed based on the observed transitions during interaction with
    the environment. For any input goal , the start state is added to the graph. The
    optimal path between the and is determined using Dijkstra algorithm. The states
    on the optimal path are then used as way-points toward reaching . These way-points
    are tracked by the HAC agent. The cost of the graph search is where is the set
    of nodes (states) and is the set of edges between the nodes. Deep skill graph
    (DSG) combines graph search and option (temporally extended actions) to realize
    HRL. The inner working mechanism of DSG is somewhat complex so the time complexity
    analysis described here is just a rough estimation. DSG method forms a weighted
    directed graph over set of options. Existence of an edge from node to means after
    executing option , it is feasible to execute . DSG switches between graph expansion
    and consolidation phases to form the graph over options. These two phases involve
    Dijkstra graph search, option selection using a policy learned by Semi-MDP Q-learning,
    and H-step simulations based on a learned dynamics model. The time complexity
    of Dijkstra algorithm is where and are the number of edges and nodes of the option
    graph. The cost of training the option policy network is for samples. Similarly,
    the training cost and H-step forward passes of the dynamics model are of order
    . 5.4. RL challenges in robot control Despite the fact that RL does not need labeled
    training data, applying it to complex robot control problems is not straightforward.
    Several challenges must be addressed before RL can be used effectively for robot
    control. 5.4.1. Enforcing robot and user safety In the RL literature, it is common
    practice to make the agent’s actions noisy to avoid greedy exploitation of what
    it has learned, in order to force exploring unseen regions of the search space.
    Some of the exploration methods are adding Gaussian noise or the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck
    process [189] value to the deterministic action or perturbing the parameters of
    the policy via parameter space noise exploration [190]. Despite being effective,
    the aforementioned methods are not safe to execute on real robots since they often
    result in jerky or sudden movement patterns of the robot joints, resulting in
    potential harm to the robot and/or user. Therefore, in robot applications, exploration
    must be effective and safe such as generalized state dependent exploration (gSDE)
    [191] which performs exploration based on the current state of the robot to avoid
    dangerous or jerky motions. In addition to safe exploration, initializing policy
    parameters based on appropriate demonstrations can also enforce safety. Grasping
    is one of the core skills in various robotic tasks. Attention-based deep RL has
    been used to learn safe grasping policies from demonstration using a Next-Best-Region
    attention module [192]. Alternatively, safety can be enforced by projecting policy
    output (i.e. selected action) onto a safe action space [193] using control barrier
    functions (CBFs) [194]. A CBF is a non-negative function defined to enforce a
    specific constraint [195]. Safe exploration is not limited to RL [196]. Any ML
    method must be safe if it is to be deployed in the real world [197], [198], [199].
    For further details, the interested reader is referred to the recent survey on
    safe RL [200]. 5.4.2. Noisy insufficient training data It is always challenging
    and costly to gather training data using real robots. That is why the issue of
    data efficiency has been actively researched in the RL community, leading to MBRL
    approaches (Section 4.5) as well as sophisticated robotic simulators. For human–robot
    collaboration applications, simulations must be accompanied by some sort of human
    interaction. Virtual/augmented reality is one possible approach to address the
    human-in-the-loop requirement [201]. Addressing training data scarcity is only
    part of the solution toward implementing safe RL on real robots. In particular,
    even collected data can be noisy and misleading due to erroneous intentional/unintentional
    safety signals provided by human operators. Adversarial training is useful to
    learn robust policies [202] but it needs further investigation [203]. 5.4.3. Transparent
    behavior To assess safety of RL methods, they must be transparent to the user.
    The term explainable AI (XAI) is often encountered in applied DL literature [204],
    [205] such as medical diagnosis [206], [207], [208], [209], autonomous navigation
    [210], [211], [212], and manufacturing [213], [214], [215], [216]. However, given
    that modern RL methods heavily rely on complex (possibly deep) neural networks,
    XAI has become a concern in RL as well [217]. 5.4.4. Reward function design In
    the RL literature, the reward values are either dense or sparse. A dense reward
    increases as the RL agent approaches its goal. On the other hand, a sparse reward
    is binary; it is always unless the agent achieves its goal which yields a reward
    of zero. The difference between sparse and dense rewards is depicted in Fig. 7.
    Initially, the distance of the robot EE to the goal is , yielding dense reward
    which is inversely proportional to . Considering that the goal has not been reached
    in Fig. 7(a), sparse reward is . In Fig. 7(b), similar argument holds yielding
    sparse reward but dense reward increases owing to reduction of distance between
    the EE and the goal ( ). Finally, in Fig. 7(c), the robot EE reaches the goal,
    receiving sparse reward and higher dense reward ( ). As can be seen, dense rewards
    guide the RL agent toward achieving their goals but are harder to design for complex
    problems. Sparse rewards are easily definable for complex problems but RL agents
    have a tough time learning anything useful from them. This is because the agent
    does not know how to the goal it is. To remedy this issue, HER has been proposed.
    Following promising results of HER, multiple challenging robotic tasks were developed
    in simulation [147] motivating further research on HER for tackling sparse reward
    RL [218], [219], [220], [221]. Download : Download high-res image (322KB) Download

    distance between goal (red point) and robot EE is , (b) EE has gotten closer to
    the goal ( ), (c) EE has reached the goal ( ). 5.4.5. Valid action generation
    RL agents may produce actions that are not attainable by the IK module. Assume
    the action is a 6D pose of the robot EE i.e. position and (roll, pitch, yaw) orientation.
    Considering that these six variables are correlated by the robot structural limitations,
    setting lower and upper bounds for them does not necessarily enforce validity
    of the agent’s actions. Domain knowledge in the form of expert’s demonstrations
    can be used to initialize agent’s policy in way that selected actions are valid.
    As an example, DMP parameters can be adjusted to reflect the expert’s demonstration
    leading to smooth and safe robot trajectories. 6. Deep learning integration with
    manipulators DL can handle high dimensional data with ease which makes it the
    method of choice for addressing different challenges of manipulation problems.
    As an example, DL were utilized to model dynamics of a 6-DoF manipulator [53].
    A multilayer perceptron (MLP) with four hidden layers was used. The network inputs
    were six-dimensional (corresponding to 6-DoF) position vector , velocity vector
    , and acceleration vector q̈. The network output was the corresponding torque
    vector computed as Eq. (1). The rest of this section is devoted to some of the
    major applications of DL in robotic manipulators. 6.1. Complex manipulation One
    of the promising approaches to achieve complex manipulator trajectories is imitation
    learning. Visuomotor imitation via object-centric Learning (VIOLA) [222] is an
    object-centric imitation learning for robotic manipulation. VIOLA utilizes a policy
    based on a transformer [223] which has multiple heads with self-attention. As
    the first step, region proposals corresponding to objects present in the scene
    are extracted using a pre-trained region proposal network (RPN) [224]. Features
    are extracted from the proposed regions and converted to discrete tokens which
    are then fed to a Transformer encoder. The Transformer will focus on regions that
    are relevant to the desired task and action generation is done based on relevant
    regions. VIOLA was evaluated on simulated and real scenarios. RL and DL can also
    be combined to deal with challenges of robotic manipulation. As an example, attention-driven
    robotic manipulation (ARM) [225] was proposed to handle tasks with sparse rewards
    using a handful of demonstrations (few shot setup). ARM has three phases. In the
    first phase, the locations of important pixels of input colored images and point
    clouds are determined by Q-attention agent which is based on DQN. In the second
    phase, SAC method is used as the next-best-pose agent for choosing the manipulator
    pose based on Q-attention agent outputs. Finally, the control agent sets the robot
    joints according to the pose outputted in the second phase. Instead of combining
    RL and DL, RL can be cast to a conditional sequence modeling by proposing an architecture
    called Decision Transformer (DT) [226]. The DT model considers past states, actions,
    and desired returns to generate future actions such that the desired returns are
    obtained. To this end, three separate embedding layers corresponding to states,
    actions, and returns are considered. The states, actions, and returns of the last
    time steps are fed to their respective embedding layers. The resulting output
    is fed to the GPT architecture [227] (causal transformer) and then decoded to
    obtain selected actions. GPT is a modified transformer architecture used as a
    causal self-attention mask for achieving autoregressive generation. The proposed
    approach managed to outperform state-of-the-art MFRL methods on simulated robotic
    tasks such as HalfCheetah and Reacher from OpenAI Gym environments. Divide and
    conquer is always an effective method to tackle challenging problems. The focus
    of SuSIE (SUbgoal Synthesis via Image Editing) [228] method is on robot control
    conditioned on lingual commands. SuSIE takes a two layer approach: a high level
    planner and a low level controller. A diffusion model capable of editing images
    is used as the high level planner. Input to the diffusion model is the environment
    state which is an image including manipulator state and object positions. Based
    on the received input, the diffusion model produces intermediate goals to be achieved
    by the low level controller. The subgoal generation is done based on textual commands
    such as ”put red pencil in the bowl.” InstructPix2Pix architecture was used as
    the diffusion model trained on human and robot demonstrations videos. The low
    level controller was trained using goal-conditioned behavior cloning. Interleaving
    the intermediate goal generation and execution leads to achieving the final goal.
    State-of-the-art results were achieved on CALVIN benchmark (a set of simulated
    manipulation tasks) as well as real world experiments. Building optimal trajectories
    from suboptimal ones is always desirable in RL problems. Ajay et al. [229] investigated
    the possibility of generating optimal trajectories by stitching together sub-optimal
    ones without value estimation (a widely used method in RL). A fixed dataset of
    trajectories labeled with their rewards was considered. A diffusion model [230]
    was trained on the dataset in order to generate optimal trajectories at inference
    time complying with the constraints learned during training. The approach obtained
    promising results on D4RL benchmark [231]. Other than reusing suboptimal trajectories,
    fine-tuning pre-trained policies for manipulator control is also a valid approach.
    Julian et al. [232] focused on adapting a pre-trained object grasping policy based
    on observed images of the environment using QT-Opt method [233] (Q-learning extended
    to continuous action space). The adaptation is done with respect to background
    changes, different illumination conditions, object shape and appearance, and robot
    kinematics. The adaptation only requires 0.2% of the training data needed for
    learning the aforementioned policy from scratch. 6.2. Mimicking expert demonstrations
    In addition to dynamics modeling, DL can also be used to transfer expert knowledge
    to robotic arms. A notable example is the time-contrastive network (TCN) [234],
    [235] which learns manipulation tasks like pouring liquid into a glass from unlabeled
    videos containing human demonstrations. TCN is viewpoint-invariant so it is able
    to observe a specific behavior, e.g. from a third person’s view and mimic it from
    a first person’s view. The reason is that the approach is able to learn similarities/differences
    between images that look different/similar. This is achieved using metric learning
    based on triple loss [236]: (12) where and are the positive and negative samples
    (i.e. video frames) and is the anchor sample. A pair of positive and anchor samples
    show the same point in time from different viewpoints. The negative sample belongs
    to the same video containing the anchor sample but the time of the negative sample
    is different from the anchor sample. The embedding processes of , , and are computed
    using , which is modeled using a DNN. The parameters of are learned such that
    the distance between positive and anchor samples is decreased and the distance
    between negative and anchor samples is increased. In Eq. (12), is the minimum
    margin enforced between pairs of positive and negative examples. 6.3. Tactile
    sensing DL methods rely on visual feedback to sense the object state requiring
    camera(s) calibration [98], [237] or motion capture systems [238]. Moreover, visual
    data cannot provide contact and force feedback which are vital for dexterous manipulation.
    While tactile sensors can be used for object state estimation, this approach is
    not without challenges. CNN has been used to capture tactile signature of human
    hand during grasping [239], [240] but it expects a rectangular input, which does
    not necessarily match the pattern of tactile sensors. Forcing rectangular pattern
    by rearranging the tactile readings violates their spatial relationships. To remedy
    this issue, graph convolutional networks (GCN) [241] were proposed. GCN assumes
    that the number of tactile signals and their connections are fixed during robot
    operation. However, robotic hands can take different poses, causing time-variant
    spatial relationships between its tactile sensors which GCN fails to handle. The
    limitation of GCN is addressed by treating tactile signals as 3D position of activated
    sensors. A set of features at different levels [242] is then computed based on
    these 3D points using a hierarchical perception model called the tactile graph
    neural network(TacGNN) [243] which is based on a graph neural network (GNN) [244].
    TacGNN can handle dynamic number of tactile signals and their connections. Using
    TacGNN for object pose prediction, PPO has been used to learn in-hand manipulation.
    7. Simulation to real transfer As manipulator robots become more sophisticated,
    their control becomes more complex. Learning methods can be used to achieve better
    control modules with fewer hand coded components. RL agents can learn from raw
    interactions with their environments without needing labeled training samples.
    However, during interaction, random actions are often performed to explore the
    problem search space, which is not practical on real robots. The reason is that
    sending random commands to robot joints causes jerky motions. This can damage
    the robot servo motors [245], [246], [247]. Moreover, running RL agents on real
    robots is time consuming, which also requires human supervision due to safety
    reasons. Instead of running the learning process on real robots from scratch,
    it is possible to learn control policy in high precision robotic simulators such
    as Gazebo [248] and MuJoCo and fine-tune the learned policy on real robots [249].
    In other words, the knowledge learned during simulation is exploited using transfer
    learning to accelerate the training on real robots. The advantage of transfer
    learning is that the amount of interaction with real robots is reduced leading
    to more efficient (in terms of time and cost) training. However, it is necessary
    to deal with the gap between the dynamics of the simulator and that of the real
    world [250]. Zhang et al. [251], [252] modified DQN by partitioning its structure
    into perception and control modules. The two modules are connected via a bottleneck
    layer which forces the perception module to learn a low dimensional representation
    of the environment state, whereas the control module is responsible for Q-value
    estimation. The first training phase of the perception module is conducted in
    a supervised manner using simulated data. The second training phase is fine-tuning
    based on a limited number of real samples. The gap between simulation and real
    world can also be addressed using dynamics randomization [93], [238]. In this
    method, the RL agent is exposed to several environments with dynamics models randomly
    sampled from a specific distribution. This way the RL agent has no choice but
    to learn a policy capable of coping with various environments with different dynamics.
    Hopefully, the learned policy is more likely to generalize to dynamics of the
    real world. The dynamics randomization is inspired by well-established field of
    domain adaptation [253], [254], [255] and domain generalization [256]. In another
    attempt to achieve generalization, Shahid et al. [257] trained a PPO agent to
    carry out grasping behaviors using a robot arm. The generalization was achieved
    by proposing a specific dense reward function. However, the experiments were solely
    done in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality of manipulation
    tasks, Rusu et al. [94] used progressive networks [258]. These networks can learn
    multiple independent tasks by leveraging knowledge transfer and avoiding catastrophic
    forgetting [259], [260]. The difference between progressive networks and fine-tuning
    is that some of the previously learned knowledge is discarded during fine-tuning
    which has a destructive effect to some extent. Moreover, fine-tuning assumes that
    the tasks are partially related so only the last layer of the pretrained model
    is usually retrained [261]. Such limiting assumption is not made by the progressive
    networks. Initially, the progressive network has a single column which is a neural
    network with L hidden layers destined to learn a specific task. Each new task
    is represented by a new column added to the architecture. The activation function
    for the th layer of the th column of the network is where is the number of units
    at layer . The parameters set of the th column is denoted as . After learning
    the first task, is frozen, while the second column is added to the model with
    parameters set for learning the second task. The output of depends on activations
    of columns from previous layer . Instead of modifying the parameters of a previously
    trained model, progressive networks express each learned task as a column in their
    architecture. Owing to the lateral connections, progressive networks are free
    to use or ignore knowledge of previous tasks to learn a new task. The lateral
    connections are depicted by “a” in Fig. 8 and they are expressed as an MLP with
    one hidden layer. The activations from the previous layer are multiplied by a
    trainable scalar to adjust the amount each column from the previous layer contributes
    to . The fact that the progressive networks keep all of the previously learned
    models and establish useful connections between them to form a feature hierarchy
    makes them suitable for lifelong learning [262]. Inverse dynamics model has also
    been used for simulation to real transfer [263]. The policy for robot control
    in the source domain (simulation) is assumed to be known. Additionally, it is
    assumed that the source and target (real world) domains have the same number of
    actuated DoFs. An inverse dynamics model is learned to predict action to be executed
    in the target domain. The prediction is conducted such that executing in the target
    domain given the last observations leads to observation . Cascading source policy
    , forward dynamics model and the learned inverse dynamics model yields an appropriate
    policy for the target domain. The simulation to real transfer methods reviewed

    the years, manipulators have undergone constant improvements making their deployment
    in various application fields possible. This section is devoted to some notable
    applications. 8.1. Industrial applications Ever since the industrial revolution,
    establishing an efficient workforce has always been a concern and human labor
    is only part of the solution. In manufacturing pipelines, automating repeated
    tasks such as part inspection and assembly is vital to have cost-effective production.
    DL has proved useful in the aforementioned automation tasks based on vision sensors.
    As an example, defective forged aluminum rims were detected using YOLO [264],
    [265], [266]. Following the footsteps of Dewi et al. [267], the training dataset
    size was increased using synthetic samples generated by GAN and DCGAN [268], [269].
    In some cases, manipulators are equipped with laser scanners for precise measurement
    and inspection in production lines [270]. The inspection process can be made more
    robust and adaptive using RL [271]. Robots are also used for interacting with
    objects such as pick-and-place [272] or fine manipulation [273]. Mitsubishi Movemaster
    RV-M1 was a manipulator accompanied with built-in webcam to carry out pick-and-place
    [274]. The experiments showed that performance of the system was higher by 20%
    if objects were colored [275]. The pick-and-place task is more challenging for
    micro-objects [276]. In high precision manufacturing assembly, fine manipulation
    is a necessity which can be addressed by force-based control strategies. A typical
    example of such strategies have been used to carry out peg-in-hole task [277].
    Manipulator can also be used for automated packaging of products such as shoes
    [278] and foods [279]. Traditionally, manipulators have been fixed in specific
    stages of industrial production pipelines. However, mobile manipulators can change
    their operational environment on demand increasing productivity and decreasing
    the number of required manipulators. CARLoS [280] developed by Robotnik is a mobile
    welding robot operating in shipyards. Manipulators are even mounted on unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Compared to UGVs,
    manipulators operation on UAVs and UUVs are more challenging. This stems from
    the fact that UGVs are ground vehicles with much better stability and easier control
    mechanisms compared to their aerial and underwater counterparts. For example,
    in the case of UAVs, the motion of the UAV-mounted manipulator causes a shift
    in the center-of-gravity (CoG) of the UAV which impacts stability during flight.
    As a possible solution, the UAV battery is actively slid such that its weight
    counter-balances the CoG shift. Stable flight is necessary for construction inspection
    using UAVs equipped with manipulator arms [281]. Underwater vehicle manipulator
    systems (UVMs) are UUVs equipped with manipulators [282]. UVMs can be useful in
    different tasks such as underwater welding, sampling sea organisms, cable burial,
    inspection of underwater facilities (e.g. oil pipeline), and ship maintenance
    [283]. However, effective manipulation requires robust controllers capable of
    withstanding external sources of interference such as sea currents. One approach
    to deal with the challenges of controlling UVMs is their remote operation by human
    pilots. However, humans tend to get exhausted over time so fully autonomous UVMs
    are desirable. AMADEUS project [284] is among the earliest attempts on developing
    underwater vehicles equipped with manipulators. The outcomes of AMADEUS project
    were utilized in UNION [285] and SAUVIM [286] projects. The goal of UNION was
    enhancement of the autonomy level of underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).
    SAUVIM also took a similar step toward development of autonomous manipulation
    in deep ocean missions. TRIDENT [287] is another project toward making ROVs autonomous
    for tasks such as search and recovery, maintenance, object retrieval, etc. TRIDENT
    project aims to reach capabilities such as navigation and mapping using SLAM,
    and free-floating manipulation. One of the main challenges of oil companies is
    maintenance and repair of their undersea pipelines. UVMs can address this challenge
    but they must be able to stay operational for extended periods of time (12–48
    h) in order to perform effective maintenance and inspection. This is the objective
    of the PANDORA project [288] which aims to reduce the number of requests for human
    intervention during autonomous underwater missions. Another approach to reduce
    the cost of offshore maintenance using ROVs is establishing onshore control stations
    from which human pilots control ROVs remotely (over a large distance). To this
    end, satellite communication is used in DexROV [289] project. For further details
    on different types of autonomous mobile robots equipped with manipulator arms,
    the survey by Liu [290] can be consulted. In industrial environments, robots have
    to operate alongside human workers. Therefore, robots must be designed in a way
    that human safety is guaranteed. Different sensors such as LiDAR and cameras [291]
    can be used to sense the surrounding of a robot, in order to avoid collision with
    obstacles including humans. In a manufacturing pipeline, certain fixed processes
    are designed which are repeated over and over again. However, having a flexible
    pipeline to adapt to predicted/unpredicted changes is highly desirable. This requirement
    is addressed by flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) [292]. Common components
    of a typical FMS are computer numerical controlled machines (CNCs), robots, sensors,
    etc. To setup an efficient FMS, assessment and selection of appropriate set of
    robots for collaboration with each other is crucial. Having a framework [293]
    to carry out such assessment can facilitate the FMS setup. For ease of reference,
    the reviewed industrial applications are summarized in Table 6. Table 6. Summary

    No 8.2. Agricultural applications Gardeners and farmers usually prefer to harvest
    their crops using human labor. However, lack of workforce specially in situations
    such as COVID-19 pandemic has forced farmers and gardeners to rely on robots for
    corps harvesting. The primary challenge is not to damage crops e.g. fruits [294],
    [295], [296], [297] during the harvesting process. To address this challenge,
    deformable objects manipulation with autonomous grasp force adjustment is needed.
    Hand-coding a control system with the aforementioned capabilities is usually very
    challenging. Learning a robust controller using MFRL [298], [299] is a viable
    option. Moreover, automated crop harvesting requires mobile manipulators. A common
    solution is to mount the manipulators on mobile robots equipped with autonomous
    navigation technologies [300], [301]. Water conservation is another important
    use case of mobile manipulators. According to the Proceedings of the National
    Academy of Sciences of the USA (PNAS), about 85% of water consumption in the world
    is due to agricultural activities [302]. That is why precision irrigation has
    attracted researchers’ attention in recent years. UC Merced, UC Berkeley and UC
    Davis campuses of University of California have worked on Robot Assisted Precision
    Irrigation Delivery (RAPID) project to reduce water consumption in drip irrigation
    systems. To this end, as shown in Fig. 9, a drone equipped with an infrared sensor
    is used to inspect the soil moisture condition of agricultural fields [303]. Based
    on the gathered data, the drip irrigation emitters are adjusted for each plant.
    The adjustment can be carried out by a human workforce using a hand-held device
    called DATE [304] or by a manipulator arm equipped with two cameras for drip irrigation
    emitter detection [305]. As shown in Fig. 9, the manipulator arm is mounted on
    the Husky A200 unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) operating in ROS. This UGV moves
    throughout the field autonomously and adjusts the drip irrigation emitters for
    each plant. For ease of reference, the reviewed agricultural applications are
    summarized in Table 7. Download : Download high-res image (748KB) Download : Download

    conflicts, many lives have been lost, but autonomous robots can make a change.
    It is time for UGVs to replace military personnel to carry out various hazardous
    tasks. Prowler and Guardium UGVs [310] can perform patrol routines. Other UGVs
    such as PackBot525 [311] and Centaur [312] are capable of bomb disposal, surveillance,
    and reconnaissance. These two UGVs are equipped with robotic arms for effective
    interaction with their task environments. This way unexploded ordnance, mines,
    and chemical bomb can be neutralized without endangering human operators. A schematic
    of Packbot525 is shown in Fig. 10(a). Another example of remotely-operated UGV
    for detection of biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological agents is the
    one developed by Defence R&D Canada-Suffield [313]. This UGV has been further
    equipped with a manipulator arm for opening building and vehicle doors and object
    manipulation. Due to versatility of door handles and knobs, opening doors poses
    extreme challenge for robotic manipulators. To tackle this challenge, a modular
    manipulator has been designed by Honeybee and iRobot for breaching doors [314].
    The designed manipulator can be connected to the robotic arm of PackBot EOD (explosive-ordnance
    disposal) and it can work with different types of door handles. Majority of military
    robots are focused on offense, defense, or potential threat neutralization. However,
    effective warfare is not just about offense and defense. Protecting human assets
    is just as important. This is the motivation for development of a semi-autonomous
    military rescue robot called HURCULES for casualties evacuation [315]. For enforcing
    the wounded person’s safety during transportation, HURCULES utilizes its dual
    arms to balance the person’s weight evenly. For ease of reference, the reviewed
    military applications are summarized in Table 8. Table 8. Summary of manipulators

    Surgeries are usually invasive procedures which cause side effects and discomfort
    for patients. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the degree of invasion during
    surgeries. Da Vinci surgical robot [316] has made minimally invasive operations
    possible. This robot features multiple robotic arms that can be controlled by
    a surgeon via its console. This robot is also accompanied by a third module, the
    vision cart which performs image processing, delivers live feed of the procedure
    to medical staff in the operation room and provides communication across Da Vinci
    system components. The schematic of Da Vinci robot is shown in Fig. 10(b). Children
    suffering from Autism disorder have trouble making social contacts, which leads
    to differed development of their social skills. Research studies show that Autism
    children exhibit highly organized behavior and prefer to interact with robots
    rather than humans. The reason is that robots are really good at repeating organized
    behaviors over and over without getting tired, complaining, or judging the Autistic
    children. The robots designed for Autism treatment have proved to be useful [317],
    [318]. Examples of these robots are Nao humanoid robot [319], Zeno R-50 [320],
    QTrobot [321], and Kaspar [322]. For ease of reference, the reviewed medical applications
    are summarized in Table 9. Download : Download high-res image (400KB) Download

    and rescue Robots can play a vital role in the aftermath of natural disasters
    such as earthquake, tsunami, volcanic activity, etc. Rescue robots can inspect
    hazardous regions such as damaged nuclear sites, flooded power plants, and buildings
    on fire. Extensive research has been conducted on rescue robots [326], [327],
    [328], [329]. The researches in the fields of mobile robots and robotic manipulators
    are usually pursued independently of each other. However, mounting manipulators
    on mobile platforms are crucial to take the capabilities of search and rescue
    robots to the next level. As an example, a mobile robot platform accompanied by
    a snake-like manipulator arm has been proposed [330]. The snake-like manipulator
    can be separated from the mobile platform for independent operation. Such capability
    provides the possibility of covering hard-to-reach areas. Another hybrid search
    and rescue platform consists of a dual arm system mounted on a mobile platform
    [331]. Each arm has 5 DoF and a payload of 40 kg. The search and rescue capabilities
    can be enhanced by using multiple robots each of which is designed for a specific
    task. As an example, a dual robot system has been proposed for search and rescue
    in underground buildings [332]. The first robot was responsible for quick exploration
    of the environment while the second one was for object manipulation using a robotic
    arm. The information exchange between the two robots was done via wireless communication.
    To further boost the progress in this field, several competitions such as the
    DARPA Robotics challenge [333], [334] (2012–2015) and RoboCup [335], [336] (an
    annual competition) have been held. In the DARPA Robotics challenge, tasks such
    as vehicle driving, door opening and going through, tool manipulation and some
    other complex tasks had to be completed by robots autonomously. All these tasks
    demand mobile robots with robust dexterous manipulation capabilities. The DRC-HUBO
    robot [337] developed by team KAIST managed to win the competition in 2015. 8.6.
    Space An extravehicular activity (EVA) is any type of activity that is done in
    the vacuum of space by an astronaut. EVAs are always challenging and risky but
    these activities can be carried out by robotic manipulators to reduce the risk
    and time of space missions. Robonaut 2 (R2) [338], [339] is a dexterous humanoid
    robot developed by NASA and General Motors [340]. Initially, R2 only had the upper-body
    parts but was equipped with a mobility platform in order to maneuver around the
    international space station (ISS). R2 can be used for automatic maintenance and
    cleaning tasks such as handrail cleaning, vacuuming filter, inventory management,
    and data collection inside the ISS. Robot operating system (ROS) [341] tools and
    capabilities have been used extensively to develop R2 controller system. Manipulators
    may also be used for removing debris due to 5000 rockets launched from Earth into
    the orbit successfully. Typical debris include defunct spacecrafts, spent rocket
    upper stages [342], [343] and other fragments. Debris wandering in space is a
    serious threat to functional satellites in orbit. In addition to the applications
    mentioned above for space manipulator, rovers equipped with manipulator arms can
    act as astronaut’s assistants. These rovers can explore hazardous planets and
    gather data during their mission or repair a malfunctioning on-board lander [344].
    Moreover, the required technology for development of these rovers can also fulfill
    the requirements of industry 4.0. Regardless of tasks assigned to space manipulators,
    their structural characteristics may vary slowly over time. To cope with this
    issue, manipulator controllers must be adaptable to uncertainties due to the aforementioned
    structural changes. To this end, one may use a weighted mixture of multiple Kalman
    filters to setup a robust controller [345] or utilize RL to learn an adaptable
    controller [346]. 9. Future works As manipulation tasks get more complex, the
    need for robust and efficient robot controllers based on ML increases. As discussed
    before (Section 5.4.1), the number one requirement for using learning in real
    world problems is robot and user safety enforcement. Safe HRL is already under
    development for robot navigation [347], [348], [349] and learning arcade games
    [350]. However, it still needs further research in robotic manipulation tasks.
    Another future work is related to the rigidity of objects. In dexterous manipulation,
    the objects of interest are usually assumed to be rigid. However, many real-world
    applications require interaction with non-rigid objects [351]. Devising HRL methods
    with the ability to handle non-rigid objects is an important research direction
    for the future. While visual perception is popular for dexterous manipulation,
    tactile-based sensing provides better feedback for tasks such as finger gating,
    grasping, and in-hand manipulation. The reason is that tactile sensors integrated
    in robot hands provide feedback about fingers breaking/establishing contacts with
    objects. Such observations are vital to detect key transitions [352] in the problem
    state space but these observations are not provided by visual sensors. The limitation
    of tactile-based sensing is blind spot in the robot hand in which no tactile sensors
    are present. Getting object status in blind areas is an important future work.
    Relying on time series data, it may be possible to approximate the object status
    based on previously observed data [243]. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) has attracted
    attention in recent years. This stems from the fact that combination of humans’
    creativity and accurate robots has the potential for efficient production and
    personalization capabilities in industrial applications. To establish HRC efficiently,
    robots must be able to perceive and analyze information obtained from their workspace
    in real-time. This holistic scene understanding involves object perception, environment
    parsing, human recognition, and visual reasoning which leads to better collaboration
    between humans and robots. As future work for HRC, better cognition skills for
    robots must be developed. The ability to take appropriate actions for manipulation
    of objects never seen before is crucial. Examples are picking-and-placing unknown
    objects [353] as well as deducing whether a liquid can be poured into an unknown
    container [354]. Visual perception plays major role for perception of the robots’
    workspace. Typical steps of visual parsing of the environment is its recognition
    using vision algorithms and representing scene elements based on mapping techniques
    (e.g. 2D, 3D representation). However, these techniques does not take into account
    hierarchical and hybrid representation of the robot workspace which is needed
    for better modeling of flexible manufacturing lines. Therefore, hierarchical modeling
    of the workspace is worthy of further research [355]. 10. Conclusion We are living
    in an exceptional era of rapid technological advancements in which robotic manipulators
    play a major role in achieving efficient and reliable automation. While traditional
    hand-coded controllers have been around for a long time, the ever-increasing complexity
    of robots demand better controllers that are easier to work with. ML can be used
    to abstract away the complexity of developing hand-coded controllers to some extent.
    This is achieved by exploiting domain knowledge in the form of expert’s demonstration
    and/or using RL for learning controllers via interaction with the robot’s workspace.
    However, developing reliable controllers based on ML still needs further research.
    Robustness against adversarial attacks for DL-based controllers, enforcing human
    safety around the robots, and achieving cost-efficient training are just some
    of the factors that can pursued in future works. In industrial domain, the input
    to DL models are usually sensor readings of various types. As long as sensors
    are functional, the DL models do the objective they are designed to do. Now suppose
    one or more of the sensors malfunction due to wear and tear. From the DL models
    view point, the invalid readings of faulty sensors are like OOD inputs which may
    corrupt the outputs of the DL models in unpredictable ways. This behavior can
    be disastrous in safety critical applications. Therefore, it is vital to develop
    DL models that can detect OOD inputs. In profitable industries, minimizing the
    cost and the production lines down time due to maintenance is very important which
    is achievable via predictive maintenance. AI methods can be used to implement
    predictive maintenance effectively [356]. More generally, McKinsey Global Institute
    has forecasted in its 2018 report [357] that AI has the potential to contribute
    about 13 trillion dollars to the economy worldwide by 2030. In addition to being
    profitable, industries must be sustainable i.e. they must minimize their impact
    on our environment. AI can be utilized to move toward green technologies. One
    of the critical sectors that AI and robotics can be of great help is optimal energy
    consumption. Practical examples are optimal power consumption of Google’s data
    centers using ML [358] and green manufacturing by replacing humans with robots.
    The latter case leads to lower energy consumption [359] and significant reduction
    in carbon emission [360]. Additionally, ML can play major role in big data analysis
    [361] and realtime performance monitoring of large scale systems [362] which is
    vital in the competitive market of Industry 4.0. This survey tried to sum up the
    state-of-the-art ML-based approaches for controlling manipulators. Moreover, real-world
    applications of manipulators in different sectors such as military, healthcare,
    agriculture, space, and industry were reviewed. CRediT authorship contribution

    however, their overuse causes ecological damage. To mitigate the ecological damage
    caused by the overuse of pesticides, this paper explores the application of a
    precise and adaptable technique known as unmanned aerial spraying system (UASS)-based
    variable rate spraying (VRS). Herein, the current state of precision agriculture
    is examined, and the application of UASS in variable rate spraying is discussed.
    Then, the role of advanced sensors, including multispectral and hyperspectral

    the paper explores alternative solutions such as herbicides, encompassing an integrated
    approach that aligns with sustainable farming practices for more effective pest

    rate controlSustainable farming 1. Introduction Rapid agricultural evolution has
    given rise to precision agriculture, meeting the global demand for sustainable
    and efficient food production (Yaqot et al., 2022). The fundamental principle
    of precision agriculture is to optimize resource utilization, enhance plant health,
    and promote environmental sustainability (Rusmayadi et al., 2023). The accurate
    application of agricultural inputs, particularly pesticides, plays a significant
    role in achieving these objectives across vast and diverse sectors (Meshram et
    al., 2021). Traditionally, the manual and uniform distribution of pesticides has
    resulted in excessive chemical usage and adverse environmental impacts. These
    limitations have been mitigated through the adoption of precision farming tools,
    such as GPS-guided equipment and data analytics. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs)
    are prominently utilized for pesticide spraying (Frankelius et al., 2017, Wang
    et al., 2022). Precision agriculture is a comprehensive farming approach that
    efficiently utilizes data, technology, and high-tech equipment to manage agricultural
    resources, including water, land, fertilizers, and pesticides (Karunathilake et
    al., 2023). It enables the precise application of inputs at specific locations,
    ensuring that each part of the field receives the necessary nutrients, as opposed
    to conventional farming methods that treat an entire field uniformly. UASs, along
    with technologies such as satellite imagery, global positioning system (GPS),
    and geographic information system (GIS), are integrated to achieve this precision
    (Tayari et al., 2015). Precision agriculture heavily relies on Variable Rate Spraying
    (VRS) and its significance cannot be overstated. Conventional agricultural techniques
    result in pesticide overuse due to uncontrolled spraying, whereas VRS tailors
    pesticide spraying to meet the precise requirements of different locations within
    a field (Alam et al., 2020). By interpreting the data collected from sensors and
    integrating it with real-time environmental information, UASs adjust spray rates,
    coverage, and application patterns ensuring that pesticides and other inputs reach
    their intended locations with the required quantities. VRS positively impacts
    the environment and economy, reduces wasteful resource usage, enhances crop health,
    and minimizes waste from chemical production (Hussain et al., 2019). UASSs comprise
    a multi-rotor or a fixed-wing drone and are equipped with various components such
    as pesticide tanks, pumps, and nozzles to effectively dispense pesticides or fertilizers.
    They are also equipped with GPS and navigation technology to map the field accurately
    and follow predefined flight paths and maintain the required altitude and velocity.
    The operator can manually control UASSs using a remote control or set up the flight
    plan using software such as precision flight or drone deploy, enabling autonomous
    operations. They have become essential instruments in precision agriculture due
    to their precise spray capabilities (Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019, Mukherjee
    et al., 2019; Yae et al., 2016). Fig. 1, Fig. 2 depict a DJI MG-1P eight-rotor
    electric UASS model (Shan et al., 2022) and an SG 10P eight-rotor UASS model (Hanif

    UASSs automate and enhance crop spraying, eliminating the need for manual labor
    and reducing human exposure to hazardous chemicals. For effective pest and disease
    management, UASSs are also equipped with various sensors and technologies, such
    as high-precision GPS and real-time kinematics (RTK). This enables UASSs to follow
    precise flight paths, ensuring accurate coverage during spraying. RTK provides
    centimeter-level accuracy, crucial for precision spraying (Ekaso et al., 2020,
    Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019). UASSs reduce chemical use and pesticide overspray,
    resulting in cost savings and environmental benefits (Hassler et al., 2019). They
    operate at low altitudes with precise control, minimizing the spray drift caused
    by wind pressure and decreasing the risk of environmental contamination and unintended
    harm to neighboring crops (Chen et al., 2022). UASSs access complex field areas
    that are typically difficult for conventional ground-based equipment to access,
    ensuring even spray coverage across crops while adjusting pesticide flow rates
    for resource optimization and cost reduction (Ayamga et al., 2021, Lian et al.,
    2019). Furthermore, UASSs efficiently and rapidly disperse fertilizers, ensuring
    that crops receive the necessary minerals for healthier growth and increased harvest
    yields (Rahman et al., 2021), which reduce labor costs and fertilization process
    time (Ayamga et al., 2021). UASSs provide diverse agricultural benefits, including
    improved resource management, minimized pesticide usage, enhanced productivity,
    and early detection of crop issues. Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers can
    be precisely sprayed by primarily regulating the flow rate to distribute appropriate
    amounts of inputs, ensuring high-yield, environmentally-conscious agriculture
    (Rahman et al., 2021). Precisely controlling the flow rate is vital for VRS, which
    is the primary objective of this review. VRS focuses on uniform input delivery
    via an intelligent, adaptable approach that considers the specific needs of each
    field region. Such precision allows farmers to enhance the efficiency of their
    inputs, reduce waste, and minimize environmental impact, increase productivity,
    promote environmental sustainability, and improve economic viability (Alam et
    al., 2020). Developing flow rate control techniques can enhance productivity,
    reduce chemical usage, improve crop health, and promote agricultural sustainability
    (Meshram et al., 2021). These technical advancements involve developing new tools
    and laying the foundation for a more prosperous and sustainable agricultural future
    (Frankelius et al., 2017). This review serves as a guide, highlighting the incredible
    advancements in VRS for precise spray requirements in precision agriculture using
    UASSs. The fundamentals of flow rate control mechanisms, data-driven approaches,
    practical applications, and significant challenges in precision agriculture are
    also discussed. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge
    innovations that are reshaping traditional farming methods and highlights the
    potential for new development, encouraging further research and invention. This
    review has been meticulously structured to guide readers through the essential
    components of VRS using UASSs. Each section covers various aspects of UASS technology
    via thorough discussions and examples. Moreover, the innovative impact of precision
    agriculture is illustrated using a knowledge matrix. The review concludes with
    a summary of findings, highlighting the crucial role of precise spray control
    in precision agriculture and outlining future research directions for agricultural
    transformation. 2. Flow rate control methods 2.1. Conventional flow rate control
    systems Precision agriculture has witnessed notable developments, particularly
    related to flow rate control while spraying agricultural inputs. These developments
    are based on the fundamental principles of conventional flow rate control systems.
    These advancements in flow rate control are crucial for enhancing the precision
    and efficiency of input application in agriculture, directly impacting crop health
    and resource conservation. This section discusses conventional techniques, along
    with their operation principles and drawbacks. 2.1.1. Traditional methods for
    flow rate control Conventional flow rate control systems relied on mechanical
    components and manual adjustments. These adjustments included simple mechanical
    systems, valve settings, and fixed nozzles to regulate the flow rate of agricultural
    inputs during spraying. The flow rates, valve positions, and nozzle sizes were
    manually controlled based on predefined values or operators’ experience. Importantly,
    these parameters remained constant irrespective of the varying field conditions.
    2.1.2. Limitations of conventional systems Conventional flow rate control systems
    have several limitations: they are inflexible and cannot adapt to changing environmental
    conditions. Moreover, the efficiency of input application is impacted by wind
    speed, wind direction, and manual control. Excessive doses may be applied to fields
    with high input requirements, leading to resource wastage and environmental harm
    (Abbas et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020, Tewari et al., 2020). Conversely, undertreated
    areas may result in reduced agricultural yields. As conventional systems are manually
    operated, operators must constantly monitor and adjust parameters during spraying.
    This increases the potential for human errors and creates labor-intensive requirements.
    This lack of adaptability leads to inaccurate and inefficient spraying of inputs,
    consequently resulting in excessive or insufficient pesticide usage (Tewari et
    al., 2020). As a result, newer systems have been developed to address these shortcomings.
    The input application rates vary based on the operators’ expertise and experience,
    resulting in inconsistent crop protection and reduced yields. The flow rate management
    process of these methods cannot be integrated with real-time data, such as field
    conditions, crop health information, and meteorological data. Thus, efficient
    flow rate control mechanisms must be developed by leveraging technology, automation,
    and data-driven decision-making to overcome these challenges and revolutionize
    the spraying process (Chen et al., 2017). These developments and their significance
    will be further discussed in the following sections. 2.2. Decision support for
    flow rate in UASSs The integration of UASSs into precision agriculture has enabled
    innovative, flexible, and precise control of flow rates (Chen et al., 2022). Herein,
    the most recent advancements that revolutionize flow rate control and adaptable
    and dynamic methods for precision spraying are discussed. 2.2.1. Innovations and
    technologies improving flow rate control Artificial intelligence (AI) systems
    can process and analyze large datasets in real-time by gathering data from various
    sources, including meteorological conditions, field variability, crop health,
    and past performance, to make data-driven and adaptive decisions. Such systems
    can be used to control the flow rate and quickly adapt to varying conditions such
    as input requirements and wind speed variations (Liu et al., 2021; Sanchez et
    al., 2023). Machine learning (ML) models can learn from existing data and generate
    predictive algorithms that estimate the optimal flow rates based on different
    parameters. This predictive control is particularly valuable in dynamic agricultural
    environments. ML models continuously enhance their predictions by learning from
    the accumulated data, yielding precise and effective flow rate adjustments (Ayoub
    et al., 2022, Yanlie et al., 2016). Alam et al. (2020) used random forest classifier
    to detect and classify weeds. Their classification model was initially trained
    offline using an image dataset before testing in the field. An application device
    equipped with a pulse width modulation (PWM)–based fluid flow controller and a
    vision-based feedback system was used to spray the required input quantity. AI
    enables highly personalized input applications based on the field characteristics
    and environmental parameters, such as crop health and soil conditions (Tewari
    et al., 2020). Liu et al. (2021) developed a ML-based variable-rate sprayer and
    assessed its performance by accurately spraying targeted weeds. They used deep
    learning techniques to categorize weeds in real-time. The variable-rate sprayer,
    designed to control the flow rate, comprises a camera for capturing images, a
    computer for analyzing photos, a microcontroller board for system control, and
    spray nozzles with solenoid valves. The system sends trigger signals based on
    real-time captured images to control the flow rate of the nozzles. Kotkar et al.
    (2021) presented an innovative approach of automated chemical spraying using a
    convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify crop illnesses using object identification,
    image preprocessing, segmentation, extraction, and categorization. 2.2.2. Benefits
    of advanced flow rate control The accuracy and versatility of modern flow rate
    control systems reduce the adverse impacts of agriculture on the environment.
    Minimizing waste and avoiding excessive chemical use contribute to environmentally
    friendlier and sustainable farming practices. Precision farming input application
    ensures that crops receive the exact care they require, preventing over- and under-treatment
    and enhancing crop resilience, health, and yield. Moreover, advanced flow rate
    control techniques have become increasingly automated, reducing manual oversight
    and workload and ensuring optimal farm management (Dou et al., 2018, Yanlie et
    al., 2016). 3. Advanced technologies for flow rate control Flow rates must be
    precisely controlled to enhance crop health, reduce wasteful use of resources,
    and optimize input distribution. Herein, the related cutting-edge technologies
    that ensure precise flow rate control and distribution of inputs in the field
    are discussed. 3.1. Electromechanical flow control Electromechanical systems have
    revolutionized precision agriculture by providing precision and flexibility in
    flow rate control. These systems are built on the fundamental concept of mechanical
    systems by integrating electrical inputs and combine mechanical and electrical
    components to control the agricultural input flow. For instance, electrically
    actuated valves that adjust feed rates for large-scale wheat farming based on
    variations in soil moisture content. Sensors provide real-time data on soil conditions,
    which enables these valves to precisely control the distribution of water and
    nutrients and maximize crop production while preserving resources (Luck et al.,
    2015). Fig. 3(a) refers to the electromechanical-based nozzle, i.e., solenoid-controlled
    nozzle and Fig. 3(b) shows the disassembled view of the nozzle with all the components
    labeled (Grisso et al., 2011). Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download

    nozzle: (a) fasting-acting, solenoid-controlled nozzle and (b) components of the
    solenoid-controlled nozzle. Electrostatic nozzles in precision agriculture have
    enhanced precision in spraying applications. By charging droplets, these nozzles
    increase the adhesion of pesticides to plants, leading to more efficient use of
    chemicals and reduced drift. For instance, they are utilized in vineyards to uniformly
    distribute pesticides on grapevines and reduce chemical drift, thereby yielding
    high-quality wines (Law, 1983, Law, 2001). Fig. 4 schematizes the electrostatic
    nozzle designed and developed by Patel et al. (2017) specifically for orchards,
    which ensures accurate co-axial alignment between the annular ring electrode and
    the nozzle, allowing for uniform spraying. Download : Download high-res image

    electrostatic nozzle. Intelligent flow control valves exemplify the synergy between
    precision agriculture and data-driven decision-making. Integrated with a network
    of sensors, these valves dynamically adjust flow rates in real-time while continuously
    monitoring field conditions. Sensors measure temperature, crop health, and soil
    moisture. Using these data, intelligent valves adjust irrigation rates to ensure
    plants receive appropriate amounts of water at the right time, thereby maximizing
    production and reducing water consumption. These control valves operate systematically
    by collecting information on crop health, weather, and soil moisture. They reduce
    the pressure in irrigation systems when rainfall is anticipated to prevent overwatering,
    whereas they increase the flow to ensure plants receive adequate water during
    a heatwave. The valve adjusts pesticide rates for concentrated application if
    the crop health sensors identify any illnesses. Such real-time automation optimizes
    crop health and resource utilization by making all necessary modifications automatically
    (Hussain et al., 2020, Sharda et al., 2015). Nasir et al. (2021) developed an
    intelligent pressure and flow rate control system for VRS based on proportional
    integral derivative (PID). Fig. 5 schematizes the intelligent flow rate control

    et al. (2011), worked on the modulated spraying-nozzle control system which permits

    control. Fig. 6 shows the intelligent flow control system utilized for the VRS.

    Fig. 6. VRS system with intelligent flow control. Pneumatic systems use air pressure
    to direct fluid flow based on the agricultural field. Such systems are used in
    citrus orchards, where the tree height and canopy density vary considerably. Pneumatic
    systems optimize resource utilization by automatically adapting input application
    rates to accommodate these variations and ensure uniform coverage (Zhu et al.,
    2006). The compressed air flow in these systems is regulated by specially designed
    valves and regulators. The released air changes the system pressure, ultimately
    governing the input flow. Sensors that monitor changes in air pressure, altitude,
    or other pertinent variables are connected to this system. To guarantee a steady
    and accurate input supply, the system adjusts the pressure and airflow as it detects
    deviations, such as different terrains or atmosphere conditions (Al-Gaadi et al.,
    2023). 3.2. Precision nozzles and valves A key element of VRS is the selection
    of suitable nozzles and valves to ensure that the flow rates of inputs are precisely
    adjusted to the specific needs of crops. The effect of these components on enhancing
    the effectiveness of VRS is discussed herein. 3.2.1. Specialized nozzles and valves
    for VRS Specialized nozzles and valves are versatile and meet the evolving modern
    farming demands. These specialized components are used in large citrus farms and
    dynamically adjust input application rates based on the fruit load and tree size.
    For larger, leafy trees receive more quantity of pesticide and nutrients, ensuring
    uniform coverage and optimal fruit quality. In contrast, smaller trees require
    less pesticide quantity, preventing the overuse of resources by the use of specialized
    nozzles and valves (Berenstein et al., 2017; Dou et al., 2018, Garcera et al.,
    2017). The varieties of specialized nozzles are discussed in subsequent sections.
    3.2.2. Dual-Nozzle systems for targeted spraying Dual-nozzle systems are distinctive
    because they have two nozzles with different flow rates, allowing targeted and
    synchronized spraying. The dual-nozzle systems used in apple orchards have specialized
    nozzles with distinct spray patterns and droplet sizes (Lu et al., 2022). There
    are two types of nozzles: one designed for spraying leaves and the other for soil-applied
    pesticides. These nozzles are strategically arranged to ensure that inputs are
    precisely delivered to the tree canopy areas. These systems enhance pesticide
    distribution and reduce overlap in pesticide spraying (Lyle et al., 1986). 3.2.3.
    Variable orifice nozzles for adaptive control Variable orifice nozzles precisely
    adjust the diameter of the nozzle orifice using a manual actuator and control
    the flow rate of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and insecticides. The
    nozzle can mechanically expand or compress the orifice aperture using a screw
    mechanism or a variable-curvature design, allowing it to rapidly adapt to changing
    needs (Fulton et al., 2016). In more advanced applications, variable-orifice nozzles
    are used with electronic controls. These systems change the orifice diameter in
    real-time in response to the data obtained from sensors or remote-control devices.
    Automated responsiveness to changing conditions in the field and greater precision
    in flow rate changes are two benefits of electronic control (Luck et al., 2015).

    nozzle with its components labeled and (b) actual image of the variable orifice
    nozzle. 3.3. Real-Time monitoring and feedback systems Real-time monitoring and
    feedback systems use a wide range of sensors and actuators to adapt to varying
    field conditions, and the construction of sensors varies depending on the desired
    application (Cruvinel et al., 2016). 3.3.1. Sensors and systems providing Real-Time
    feedback Weather Sensors: These electronic devices include thermometers for recording
    temperature information, hygrometers for tracking humidity, and anemometers for
    measuring wind speed. Designed to endure external elements, they can provide precise
    meteorological data (Kumar et al., 2020). The integration of weather sensors is
    crucial for the real-time decision-making of UASSs. Specialized weather sensors
    are strategically incorporated into the system, continuously monitoring key weather
    parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. For
    instance, the system adjusts spray rates in high temperatures to prevent evaporation,
    ensuring precise delivery. If wind speeds surpass safety thresholds, UASSs alter
    their flight path to prevent overspray. Similarly, precipitation detection prompts
    an automatic suspension of spraying, preserving product efficacy and minimizing
    environmental impact (Faiçal et al., 2014). Sensors for measuring soil moisture:
    These devices are often fabricated using robust components and include probes
    that are buried to gauge the moisture content at different depths, designed for
    extended use in fields, they endure harsh conditions (Alwis et al., 2013, Lekshmi
    et al., 2014). By seamlessly integrating soil moisture sensors, UASSs optimize
    variable-rate spraying strategies based on precise soil conditions. These sensors
    continuously measure soil moisture levels throughout the field, and the data are
    transmitted to the onboard AI-driven system to enable VRS. In areas with low soil
    moisture, the AI system may dynamically increase spray rates to enhance crops’
    water retention and nutrient absorption (Duangsuwan et al., 2020). Fig. 8 refers
    various types of soil moisture sensors, typically compact, cost-effective, and
    precise. Certain models are combined with sensors for soil temperature and salinity,
    while others incorporate dataloggers and radio communication systems for easier
    installation and retrieval in the field (Cahn & LF, 2017). Download : Download

    (f) granular matrix sensor and reader. Fig. 9 shows a schematic that illustrates
    the integration of various sensors and feedback mechanisms for the implementation
    of smart farming. Smart sensors enable precise monitoring of environmental factors,
    including temperature, moisture, and humidity. Certain sensors are capable of
    evaluating soil quality by measuring nitrate levels and water content. Detection
    of plant diseases and insect pests is achieved through high-resolution cameras.
    UAV-based surveillance facilitates continuous monitoring of crop growth and farm
    land topology. Automated mass flow sensors are employed to estimate crop production
    accurately (Rajak et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download

    and feedback mechanisms for the implementation of smart farming. 3.3.2. Intelligent
    sensors for flow rate control Intelligent sensors control flow rate control using
    ML algorithms, deep learning models, and microprocessors by analyzing the incoming
    data. Intelligent sensors can facilitate efficient data transfer to control systems
    by installing wireless communication modules (Paul et al., 2022). Operators can
    remotely adjust these sensors to changing circumstances. For instance, intelligent
    sensors with advanced ML techniques are employed in vineyards to identify potential
    signs of illness or increased insect impact. These sensors can be configured remotely
    and have solid wireless connectivity, allowing for quick and effective flow rate
    control (Talaviya et al., 2020). In regions with lower soil moisture indicative
    of potential dryness stress, the system autonomously increases the flow rate for
    targeted irrigation and optimized nutrient delivery. Conversely, in areas with
    higher soil moisture levels that indicate ample hydration, the system adeptly
    lowers the flow rate, avoids over-application, and conserves resources. 3.3.3.
    Wireless communication for data transmission Wireless communication systems are
    designed for long-range connectivity across a diversified agricultural field,
    transferring real-time data from sensors positioned throughout the field to a
    centralized control unit. They also have redundant data routes and communication
    protocols to ensure reliable data transmission even in challenging conditions.
    Data sent across wireless communication technologies are encoded to prevent unauthorized
    access, and a reliable safety feature is included in their design (Feng et al.,
    2019). Fig. 10 shows a wireless communication-based data transmission system designed
    for crop health monitoring in conjunction with remote sensing (Shafi et al., 2019).

    Fig. 10. Wireless communication-based data transmission system. For instance,
    the integration of radio frequency (RF) and satellite-based wireless communication
    ensures seamless data transmission and enhanced precision of variable-rate applications.
    With its diverse frequency bands and reliable short-range capabilities, RF communication
    facilitates direct line-of-sight data exchange between the UASS and the ground
    control station (Proshkin et al., 2021). This proves advantageous in scenarios
    where real-time updates on crop conditions are vital for dynamic decision-making
    during the flight. Simultaneously, satellite-based communication provides a broader
    reach, particularly in remote or expansive agricultural areas where traditional
    communication infrastructure may be lacking. Leveraging satellite links, UASSs
    used for VRS can transmit real-time data to and from the ground control system.
    This global connectivity ensures continuous and uninterrupted communication, allowing
    respective systems to make instantaneous adjustments to the VRS parameters based
    on the latest information received from the field (Islam et al., 2021, Matese
    et al., 2015, Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 3.3.4. Closed-Loop control systems
    for dynamic adjustments Closed-loop control systems integrate hardware and software
    for real-time dynamic adjustments to the flow rate. These systems are equipped
    with highly advanced software that consolidates information from various sources
    and sensors for real-time analysis and decision-making. Hardware components, such
    as controllers and actuators, endure environmental conditions and ensure accurate
    and swift changes to flow rate. Adaptive algorithms are a feature of closed-loop
    control systems, allowing them to adjust to the temporal variation in agricultural
    field conditions. These algorithms are designed to be efficient and adaptable.
    In large-scale potato farming, these systems are used with advanced software,
    such as Agrosense, which uses data from meteorological stations to adjust the
    flow rates (Katamreddy et al., 2019, Kruize et al., 2014). These systems operate
    dynamically owing to the closed-loop structure and continuously refine decisions
    based on the latest data inputs. This results in a responsive and adaptive approach
    to VRS, where the UASS becomes an agile decision-making entity, finely tuning
    its actions to the specific needs of each part of the field. Closed-loop control
    systems incorporate several sensors on the UASS, capturing data on crop health,
    soil conditions, and environmental factors (Hafeez et al., 2023, Hao et al., 2022).
    As the flight traverses the field, the closed-loop system processes these data
    and compares them against predefined parameters (Faiçal et al., 2017). 3.3.5.
    Integration with Unmanned aerial vehicle navigation for precise delivery Unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation systems have sophisticated algorithms and GPS
    technology, enabling precise navigation in specific areas. The design of these
    systems guarantees accurate placement and movement control (Maddikunta et al.,
    2021). The real-time communication between flow rate control systems and UAVs
    forms the foundation of their integration. Strong communication links are incorporated
    into these systems to ensure uninterrupted contact throughout the navigation process.
    Dynamic adjustment algorithms are built into the flow rate control systems and
    UAV navigation systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to flow rates based
    on data and feedback. For instance, in a large-scale soybean farm, this integration
    ensures that UAVs use real-time data and GPS coordinates to dynamically adjust
    the pace at which pesticides are sprayed as they explore different field portions.
    This design optimizes resource utilization and increases crop yield by enabling
    precise distribution to specific locations (Garre and Harish, 2018, Xue et al.,
    2016). 4. Data-Driven approaches for flow rate control 4.1. AI in flow rate control
    Precision agriculture now relies significantly on AI (Bhat et al., 2021), particularly
    for flow rate control. AI technologies improve the distribution of agricultural
    inputs, ensuring they target crops with unprecedented precision and reduce waste.
    ML can regulate the flow rate of pesticides and herbicides based on real-time
    data using trained algorithms for efficient spraying and reduced costs. 4.1.1.
    Application of ML algorithms 4.1.1.1. Supervised learning for flow rate prediction
    Precision agriculture extensively uses supervised learning (Sharma et al., 2021),
    particularly for predicting the ideal pesticide and fertilizer spraying flow rates.
    Crop-specific models are a notable application of this technology, which are finely
    tuned to meet the crop needs (Alam et al., 2020). For instance, a supervised learning
    model is developed for soybean cultivation using historical data and real-time
    insights. This model considers crop development phases, meteorological circumstances,
    insect frequency, and indications of the health of individual plants (Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi
    et al., 2020). Based on the continuous integration of data from weather stations,
    aerial vehicles, and gauges, the model forecasts precise flow rates required for
    accurate pesticide application. Supervised ML involves collecting extensive datasets
    containing crop types, vegetation indices, weather conditions, and historical
    spraying records. These datasets are used to train the machine-learning model
    (Guo et al., 2020). For instance, the model is trained to recognize patterns correlating
    specific vegetation indices with optimal pesticide concentrations. The algorithm
    refines its internal parameters based on the provided dataset during training.
    It learns to identify intricate relations between input features and the desired
    output, which, in the context of VRS, could be the optimal flow rate and spray
    pattern for a given set of field conditions (Patil et al., 2023). 4.1.1.2. Unsupervised
    learning for pattern recognition Unsupervised learning is a data-driven method
    that can provide insights into complicated farming systems for pattern detection
    (Liakos et al., 2018). Focused, precise farming techniques can be implemented
    based on this approach by identifying minute correlations and trends in agricultural
    data, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and minimizing ecological impacts
    (Priya et al., 2020). Unsupervised learning is commonly used for cultivating row
    crops to identify weed trends across farms, particularly for maize and soybeans
    (Louargant et al., 2018). The differences in plant density and colors are analyzed
    using the information collected by sensors and UAVs. By identifying weed clusters
    and their sequences of dispersion, the system can initiate concentrated pesticide
    applications (Gnädinger et al., 2017). Unsupervised ML techniques, particularly
    clustering algorithms such as k-means, are used to segment the agricultural field
    into distinct zones based on similarities in environmental characteristics. The
    algorithm autonomously identify patterns in the data and segments the field without
    any guidance (Badapanda et al., 2022). Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised
    learning operates without predefined output labels. In the context of VRS, the
    algorithm adapts to the variabilities of the field. 4.1.2. Ai-based optimization
    of flow rates 4.1.2.1. Neural network models for adaptive control While predictive
    models are not the sole focus of AI, adaptive control systems can dynamically
    adjust flow rates based on real-time conditions. Disease detection in vineyards
    is revolutionizing owing to neural network models, particularly CNN. Real-time
    information from multispectral cameras installed on UAVs is processed using these
    models, particularly for early disease detection (Tsouros et al., 2019). By analyzing
    the multispectral camera images, symptoms such as powdery mildew on grapevines
    can be detected (Knauer et al., 2017). When a disease is identified, the dynamic
    spray system accurately applies pesticides to the affected regions. This reduces
    the amount of chemicals used and ensures good health of the harvested grapes,
    a crucial factor for producing high-quality wines (Hao et al., 2022). 4.1.2.2.
    Reinforcement learning in precision spraying Reinforcement learning is revolutionizing
    precision spraying, particularly in Weed management, by enabling decision-making
    regarding the use of insecticides and other chemicals using real-time information
    and feedback (Gautron et al., 2022). UASSs that use reinforcement learning algorithms
    are used in cotton plantations to modify herbicide treatment rates based on the
    assessment of weed concentration. This continuous adaptation ensures efficient
    weed control while minimizing the use of pesticides. It represents an innovative,
    method of optimizing flow rates, ensuring pesticides are applied only when necessary
    and reducing their adverse effects on the ecosystem (Gao et al., 2019). 4.2. Integration
    of remote sensing data 4.2.1. Incorporating UAV-Collected data for precision spraying
    decisions Precision spraying decision-making depends on data, such as remote sensing
    data, particularly for flow rate control (Huang et al., 2018). This approach integrates
    advanced technology and data analytics. UAVs are equipped with advanced sensors
    that capture real-time data related to crop health, pest infestations, and soil
    conditions (Jia et al., 2021). This unique data collected during each flight serve
    as the foundation for data-driven decisions that optimize VRS. 4.2.1.1. Multispectral
    data for crop health Multispectral cameras equipped with UAVs gather real-time
    data on the field by capturing spectral bands corresponding to distinct plant
    properties (Deng et al., 2018). Fig. 11 (a) shows a UAV equipped with a multispectral
    camera for crop health monitoring (De Oca et al., 2018), (b) illustrates the integration
    of the multispectral camera, thermal camera, Red, Green and Blue (RGB) camera,
    and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) with the Raspberry Pi, while (c)

    system: (a) UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera for crop health assessment,
    (b) components integrated with Raspberry Pi, and (c) assembly of components forming
    the DAS. The information gathered by these cameras are analyzed for flow rate
    control. AI software such as Agisoft Metashape or Pix4D are used to process multispectral
    data. These software programs have built-in ML algorithms developed based on extensive
    datasets and can identify signatures associated with various factors, including
    crop health, insect frequency, and nutritional deficits (Wang et al., 2021). For
    instance, software such as Agisoft Metashape analyzes multispectral data, while
    a UAV with a multispectral camera hovers over the crops. Depending on these spectral
    characteristics, field areas with increased insect populations or nutritional
    deficits are identified (Velusamy et al., 2021). The AI models of the software
    then adjust the flow rates of connected sprayers based on the previous processed
    image data (Linhui et al., 2019). This data-driven method reduces waste, maximizes
    crop health, and minimizes negative environmental impact. Fig. 12 shows a multispectral
    camera based system for crop health monitoring (a) shows the autonomous UAV used

    4.2.1.2. Hyperspectral imaging for disease detection In VRS, hyperspectral imaging
    is used for early disease detection in crops. Hyperspectral cameras capture data
    in numerous narrow spectral bands, providing highly detailed information about
    the field condition (Moghadam et al., 2017), which are used for disease detection.
    Fig. 13 shows the hyperspectral imaging used for the disease detection, (a) shows
    the visual representation of a fungal plant disease, and (b) illustrates spikelets
    caused by Fusarium head blight, detected using hyperspectral imaging (Mahlein,

    of spikelets caused by Fusarium head blight using hyperspectral imaging. The data
    collected via hyperspectral imaging are processed using advanced AI models and
    specialized software, such as MATLAB and ENVI. The solutions are designed to recognize
    spectral patterns associated with various diseases, enabling early disease detection
    (Li et al., 2022). After the hyperspectral images are captured, the software analyzes
    the data, identifying potential disease patterns in the field. With the help of
    integrated software, the system initiates targeted spraying to the affected areas
    (Khan et al., 2021). This precise approach optimizes disease control and minimizes
    the need for excessive chemical application. 4.2.2. Fusion of sensor data for
    enhanced Decision-Making For VRS, the data obtained from various sensors are integrated
    to understand the field condition and ensuring the precise decision-making and
    application of pesticides and fertilizers (Zanin et al., 2022). 4.2.2.1. Combining
    Light detection and ranging data for terrain mapping Light detection and ranging
    (LiDAR) technology captures precise 3D terrain data (Lin et al., 2021, Lin and
    Habib, 2021). The LiDAR data are processed in real-time using specialized software,
    such as Ag Leader SMS (Feng et al., 2019), which uses AI-driven algorithms to
    create an accurate 3D terrain map of the field. This map is used for calculating
    the variable rate prescription for each section of the field based on elevation
    variations (Potena et al., 2019). Fig. 14(a) shows a UAV-based system mounted
    with LiDAR system for terrain mapping (Banerjee et al., 2019). Fig. 14(b) shows
    the UAV-based mobile mapping system for the collection of the LiDAR data in a
    forest plantation under various leaf cover scenarios (Lin et al., 2021, Lin and
    Habib, 2021). Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size

    data in a forest plantation under various leaf cover scenarios. This integration
    of LiDAR data guarantees that the spraying operation is finely tuned to the field
    topography (Ahmed et al., 2021), leading to minimized resource usage and optimized
    agricultural yields. 4.2.2.2. Integration with UASS navigation for precise delivery
    in VRS UASS navigation systems use AI-driven control software to ensure accurate
    and efficient spraying of pesticides and fertilizers. UASS is equipped with a
    GNSS and can perform highly accurate positioning and path planning. Integrating
    these navigation systems and RTK-GPS, such as Trimble’s RTK systems or DJI’s D-RTK
    GNSS, provides centimeter-level accuracy (Andanaputra et al., 2020). Flight planning
    and control software, such as Pix4D is also used to plan precise flight paths
    and manage respective operations (Hasheminasab et al., 2020). As the system follows
    the defined flight path, the AI-driven control software, often integrated into
    the flight controller or a companion computer, considers the specific variable
    rate prescription for each field section. For instance, the software might use
    a proprietary algorithm developed by the user to precisely activate and deactivate
    the payload such as a sprayer or dispenser. This ensures that the right amount
    of pesticide or fertilizer is delivered to match the field requirements (Agurob
    et al., 2023). 5. Case studies and applications 5.1. Real-World implementations
    of VRS with UASS The combined use of VRS and UASS has garnered significant recognition
    for its effectiveness in various agricultural settings. This section will investigate
    real-world applications of VRS, scrutinizing specific examples and the outcomes
    derived from deploying UASS in precision agriculture. 5.1.1. Examples of successful
    applications Lian et al. (2019) proposed a real-time control method for controlling
    the flow rate of an agricultural UAV spray system. The method used a single-chip
    microcomputer and micro diaphragm pump to precisely control the pump’s flow rate
    in real-time, enabling VRS based on different operating conditions. The system’s
    response speed was evaluated, demonstrating average control response and stability
    times of 0.18 and 0.75 s for pump flow changes. These results indicate that the
    system effectively responds to changes in operating conditions and can quickly
    adjust the pump’s target flow, achieving precise VRS. Thus, VRS systems can be
    implemented in agricultural UAVs. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a real-time control
    system for UAV VRS that uses a mathematical model to correlate flight speed, flight
    height, spray concentration, nozzle voltage, and spray volume, providing a theoretical
    foundation for research on aerial variable spray. Experimental results demonstrate
    its effectiveness in accurately calculating spray volume based on parameter changes
    such as flight speed and height, maintaining a consistent spray concentration
    across farmland. This system effectively addressed uneven spray issues caused
    by fluctuating flight parameters by adjusting the real-time spray concentration
    to meet varying application needs and minimized pesticide waste due to over application
    of pesticides and under application. The system enhances spray accuracy, lays
    the groundwork for precision spraying, and reduces manual intervention, thereby
    improving application efficiency. Fig. 15 shows a VRS system along with conceptual

    Schematic of the hardware control system for the spraying. Wang et al. (2016)
    developed a pulse with modulation (PWM)-based VRS system. Droplet deposition was
    studied using the droplet concentration method while the UAV hovered under controllable
    multi-speed conditions. The system comprises an airborne spraying device, ground
    measurement, and control unit. The airborne spraying device, equipped with the
    STM32F103VC MCU, was remotely controlled by the ground measurement and control
    unit developed by LabWindows/CVI through a wireless data transmission module.
    The micro-electric diaphragm pump was controlled using a square wave of 10 Hz
    and an adjustable duty ratio. Then, the pressure and flow rate of the system were
    adjusted. Experiments were conducted under various distance and wind speed conditions
    to establish the relation between deposition volume, duty ratio, nozzle type,
    and the rotating speed of the centrifugal nozzle. Fig. 16 shows the PWM-based
    VRS system, (a) six rotor UAV used for VRS, (b) shows the spray nozzle with its

    plate), and (c) schematic of the overall system. Wen et al. (2018) developed a
    VRS system to address the varying severity of plant diseases and insect pests
    in different locations. The system used a STMicroelectronics-32 (STM32) chip as
    the control system core and used a sensor to obtain real-time prescription values
    from prescription diagrams. A variable duty cycle pulse square wave was generated
    to adjust the flow rate, and a closed-loop PID control algorithm was employed
    to minimize the settling time of the system. Experimental results demonstrated
    that the system maintained a stable flow rate within 2.16 % of the target value,
    enabling VRS for diverse requirements. Here, the 2.16 % value signifies the system''s
    consistent achievement of a flow rate very close to the intended target, highlighting
    its precision in adapting to diverse requirements. This narrow deviation underscores
    the system’s effectiveness in responding to varying severity of plant diseases
    and insect pests in different locations. Outdoor tests confirmed the effectiveness
    of the system in promptly adjusting the flow rate based on prescription map values,
    maintaining consistent droplet deposition, and achieving uniform deposition density
    within the operation unit. Fig. 17 shows the UASS based VRS system, (a) shows

    and benefits in precision agriculture VRS and UASS have transformed precision
    agriculture. VRS facilitates targeted spraying by leveraging UASS, allowing farmers
    to optimize crop health management practices (Ahmad et al., 2020). This newfound
    precision enhanced farm productivity, thereby improving yields and crop quality
    (Mogili et al., 2018). UASS-based VRS is ecofriendly as it reduces pesticide consumption
    and has targeted application, aligning with global sustainable farming practices.
    UASS-based VRS is a catalyst for enhanced crop yields and a contributor to sustainable
    agriculture (Wen et al., 2019). 5.1.3. Specialty Crops: Optimizing pest control
    Specialty crops, ranging from delicate berries to high-value vegetables, demand
    customized pest management solutions. The uniform application of pesticides, a
    common practice in conventional agriculture, is inadequate for these diverse crops
    due to variations in plant size, spacing, and vulnerability to specific pests
    (Warneke et al., 2021). For precise and targeted pest control, UASS-based VRS
    can be used. UASS seamlessly adapts to the unique challenges of pest control in
    specialty crops. For instance, in vineyards where grapevines demand meticulous
    attention, UASS equipped with sophisticated sensors skillfully navigates intricate
    terrains, enabling the precise delivery of pesticides (Becce et al., 2021). This
    targeted approach not only optimizes the efficacy of pest control measures but
    also minimizes environmental impact by considerably reducing the overall volume
    of pesticides used. The versatility of VRS is exemplified in orchards with diverse
    topography. UAV equipped with high-resolution cameras and cutting-edge imaging
    capabilities can effectively pinpoint areas that require treatment, thereby maximizing
    resource efficiency and minimizing the risk of affecting non-targeted areas (Dubuis
    et al., 2023). This ability to adapt to varying conditions highlights the transformative
    potential of UASS-based VRS in optimizing orchard pest control practices. 5.2.
    Benefits and outcomes in precision agriculture 5.2.1. Increased crop yields and
    quality UASS-based VRS has revolutionized precision agriculture with its ability
    to optimize inputs for maximizing outputs (Delavarpour et al., 2021). Precision
    spraying, tailored to the specific needs of individual plants, mitigates the risks
    associated with pesticide underdosing and overdosing, offering a critical advantage
    in row crops (Pawase et al., 2023). Equipped with advanced sensors, UASS navigates
    the intricate spacing between plants in row crops, ensuring that each plant receives
    the optimal amount of treatment (Shi et al., 2016). Precision agriculture primarily
    focuses on enhancing the quality of agricultural products, and precise application
    of pesticides plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal. In vineyards, for example,
    the UASS equipped with high-resolution cameras precisely traverses the terrain,
    delivering targeted treatments that eliminate pests while minimizing chemical
    residues on grapes. This not only safeguards the quality of the crop but also
    aligns with consumer demand for sustainably produced and residue-free agricultural
    products (Chancia et al., 2021). 5.2.2. Reduced pesticide and resource usage The
    UASS does not rely solely on real-time environmental conditions but leverages
    pre- and post-flight data analytics during decision-making (Hunter et al., 2020).
    This comprehensive approach uses historical data and ML algorithms to optimize
    pesticide application based on a deep understanding of crop health and environmental
    conditions. Thus, UAS-based VRS effectively reduces pesticide usage without compromising
    on effectiveness (Chen et al., 2021). The integration of UASS and VRS in agriculture
    can catalyze holistic resource optimization. This strategic merging of technology
    and farming practices fosters a sustainable future where the responsible use of
    pesticides and resources becomes a cornerstone of modern agriculture (Seelan et
    al., 2003). 5.2.3. Environmental sustainability UASS is a safer, more efficient,
    and more precise alternative to traditional pesticide application methods. Farmers
    can considerably reduce the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals and minimize
    physical damage to crops by applying pesticides using drones (Damalas et al.,
    2011). Additionally, the UASS can effectively spray small, irregularly shaped
    fields that would be challenging or impossible to reach with ground sprayers or
    conventional agricultural aircraft (Wirawan et al., 2022). This technology is
    particularly beneficial for reducing the risk of pesticide contamination, particularly
    among applicators that rely on backpack sprayers (Morales-Rodríguez et al., 2022).
    Traditional pesticide application methods often require multiple tractors to pass
    through fields, increasing fuel consumption and emissions. UAS targets specific
    areas of a field, which considerably reduces the need of using a tractor; thus,
    UAS-based VRS is an ecofriendly alternative and sustainable (Mukherjee et al.,
    2019, Wang et al., 2020). 5.3. Technical considerations Despite its remarkable
    advancements, UASS-based VRS faces several challenges. This section delves into
    the technical, regulatory, and practical challenges encountered during its real-world
    implementation, providing valuable insights from these experiences. 5.3.1. Technical
    challenges faced in Real-World applications Sensor limitations pose a significant
    challenge to the implementation of VRS with UASS. The effectiveness of data collection
    devices is crucial because the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors directly
    impact the precision of VRS (Lee et al., 2010). These challenges can be addressed
    by developing sensors with higher resolutions, improved accuracy, and broader
    spectral bandwidths (Basso et al., 2019). Agricultural landscapes present unique
    navigation challenges, necessitating advanced algorithms for path planning and
    obstacle avoidance to navigate diverse and dynamic environments. The demand for
    precise and adaptable navigation systems has propelled ongoing research to enhance
    the UASS autonomy, ensuring efficient and safe operation in the field (Vazquez-Carmona
    et al., 2022). The inherent variability of agricultural environments poses challenges
    in ensuring consistent and reliable operation for VRS. Factors such as fluctuating
    wind speeds and varying humidity levels can impact the accuracy of pesticide application.
    To address these challenges, environmental dynamics must be understood and adaptive
    systems that can respond to real-time changes in field conditions must be developed
    (Faiçal et al., 2017). 5.3.2. Regulatory compliance and safety considerations
    In the rapidly evolving field of precision agriculture, the UASS can potentially
    revolutionize agricultural practices. However, the integration of these innovations
    into existing regulatory frameworks poses a significant challenge (Rao et al.,
    2016). The dynamic nature of UASS often surpasses the pace of regulatory updates,
    necessitating adaptability and collaboration among industry stakeholders and regulatory
    bodies. Safety considerations are paramount in VRS as they form a crucial aspect
    of regulatory compliance. To ensure technological and personnel safety, aviation
    regulations, airspace restrictions, and effective risk mitigation strategies must
    be thoroughly understood (Ayamga et al., 2021). 5.3.3. Farmer adoption and training
    Technological advancements, cultural norms, and educational initiatives are a
    few factors that determine the adoption of UASS-based VRS. Farmers, the primary
    users of this transformative technology, hold the key to its widespread adoption.
    The initial stages of adoption are often met with hesitation, primarily due to
    unfamiliarity with the technology, concerns about its financial viability, and
    reluctance to deviate from established farming practices (Bai et al., 2022). The
    effectiveness of precision agriculture is influenced by farmers who have their
    own experiences and technological proficiency. By conducting training programs,
    farmers can adopt and benefit from this technology (Daberkow et al., 2003). For
    the long-term adoption of the UASS, farmers should be provided with continuous
    support mechanisms such as regular software updates, readily accessible troubleshooting
    resources, and easily contactable support channels that can instill confidence
    and promote self-sufficiency among farmers. Additionally, collaborative efforts
    between technology providers, agricultural extension services, and local communities
    can play a pivotal role in facilitating the adoption of UASS-based VRS into agricultural
    practices (Klauser et al., 2021). 5.3.4. Integration with crop monitoring and
    phenotyping Empowered by advanced sensors, UAVs have revolutionized crop monitoring,
    enabling high-resolution data acquisition in real-time. These drones are equipped
    with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and provide farmers an unprecedented
    understanding of crop health, growth patterns, and potential stress factors (Lu
    et al., 2020, Tao et al., 2020). Following this comprehensive monitoring, UASS
    seamlessly transitions into VRS based on the prescription map acquired from UAV
    monitoring for precise and adaptable pesticide applications (Chia et al., 2020).
    Phenotyping, a cornerstone of modern agriculture, thoroughly evaluates plant traits
    and characteristics. UAVs play a pivotal role in phenotyping by capturing high-resolution
    imagery and multispectral data (Xie and Yang, 2020, Yang et al., 2017), providing
    farmers with valuable insights into plant health, stress responses, and genetic
    traits. 6. Challenges and future directions 6.1. Current challenges in flow rate
    control While UASS-based VRS holds promise, it encounters specific challenges
    such as sensor accuracy, data integration, and power management, which are crucial
    for its successful implementation in precision agriculture. This section delves
    into the intricate nuances of flow rate control and explores innovations that
    have potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Further research and development
    are imperative to tackle the multifaceted challenges posed by precision agriculture
    demands in flow rate control in flow rate control. 6.1.1. Sensor accuracy and
    reliability For efficient VRS, high accuracy and reliability of sensors must be
    ensured. However, maintaining this precision within dynamic agricultural environments
    is difficult. Sensor drift and environmental influences on the sensor can be mitigated
    by sensor calibration. Advanced sensor materials, characterized by their excellent
    stability and resilience to external factors, are garnering research attention.
    Such materials will enable sensors to consistently and accurately acquire data
    over extended durations (Yadav et al., 2023). Sensors can drift over time, deviating
    from their calibrated state and introducing inconsistencies in data acquisition.
    Although sensor calibration is a fundamental element to ensure sensor accuracy,
    it presents significant challenges (Luo et al., 2023). Maintaining calibration
    efficacy in dynamic agricultural environments, characterized by fluctuating temperature,
    humidity, and other environmental parameters, is a persistent effort (Srbinovska
    et al., 2015). 6.1.2. Integration of multiple sensors The seamless integration
    of diverse sensor modalities into the flow rate control framework is challenging,
    which stems from the inherent heterogeneity of sensors used in precision agriculture.
    To harmoniously combine these sensors for VRS, cutting-edge technological innovations
    and deeper understanding of their intricate dynamics are crucial (Zhuang et al.,
    2023). The practical implementation of sensor fusion in VRS necessitates the seamless
    integration of diverse technologies. From the conventional optics capturing the
    visible spectrum to the advanced multispectral and hyperspectral sensors unveiling
    hidden biophysical properties, each sensor plays a unique and vital role in the
    composition (Anastasiou et al., 2023). LiDAR and radar add further depth and dimension,
    providing crucial data on terrain and vegetation structure (Ahmad et al., 2022).
    However, the real-time synchronization of disparate data streams, robust processing
    capabilities, and the construction of a unified and coherent dataset demand innovative
    solutions and a profound understanding of the strengths and limitations of each
    sensor (Camilli et al., 2007). 6.1.3. Power consumption and UASS payload constraints
    To ensure optimal performance of VRS systems in precision agriculture, the intricate
    power–payload challenge must be addressed. To this end, the energy efficiency
    of sensors and associated technologies must be maximized while ensuring sufficient
    payload capacity for extended UASS flight durations. The operational longevity
    of UASS depends on the energy efficiency (Wang et al., 2019). for which finite-capacity
    batteries must be replaced with energy-efficient technologies. Balancing power
    consumption and payload is important during extended missions, where achieving
    equilibrium between operational demands and available power reserves is paramount
    (Martin et al., 2022). 6.2. Regulatory considerations To successfully integrate
    UASS into precision agriculture, regulatory compliance must be ensured such that
    technological advancements align with the dynamic and evolving regulatory landscape
    governing pesticide spraying operations in agriculture (Giles, 2016). 6.2.1. Compliance
    with pesticide application regulations While revolutionizing crop management practices,
    precision agriculture introduces a complex regulatory consideration, particularly
    for pesticide application. Ensuring adherence to stringent regulations poses a
    significant challenge, demanding a seamless integration of precision spraying
    techniques with meticulous data recording, reporting, and analysis procedures
    (Petty & Chang, 2018). Moreover, robust data-driven tracking and validation systems
    are required to monitor compliance with pesticide application regulations. These
    systems must capture a comprehensive range of data, including pesticide type,
    application rate, target area, and environmental conditions. This data must then
    be meticulously analyzed to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and optimize
    spraying practices (Lewis et al., 1997). 6.2.2. Privacy and data security concerns
    The collection and utilization of vast amounts of agricultural data pose privacy
    and data security concerns (Kumar et al., 2021), therefore, a holistic approach
    to risk mitigation and responsible data handling practices such as robust data
    encryption methods, secure data transmission protocols, and transparent data management
    practices are required (Gupta et al., 2020). Ongoing developments in privacy-preserving
    technologies, such as federated learning and secure data aggregation, aim to strike
    a nuanced balance between data utility and individual privacy in precision agriculture
    (Chhikara et al., 2021). Regulatory frameworks need to evolve alongside these
    technological advancements, incorporating comprehensive guidelines that ensure
    data integrity while promoting the responsible use of agricultural data. Establishing
    clear standards for data anonymization and de-identification further contributes
    to building a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while safeguarding
    sensitive individual information (Dara et al., 2022). 6.3. Future innovations
    and developments Emerging challenges and related solutions must be understood
    to effectively manage flow rate control in UASS-based VRS. The future of precision
    agriculture is primed for transformative advancements driven by innovative solutions
    that will reshape the VRS landscape. Several approaches for flow rate control
    are being developed, paving the way for enhanced efficiency, sustainability, and
    precision in agricultural practices. 6.3.1. Advancements in sensor technology
    Precision agriculture depends on the precision and reliability of sensors. Studies
    are being conducted to expand sensor technology (Bogue, 2017), for enhanced data
    collection and optimized decision-making in UASS-based VRS applications. Nanoscale
    sensors can revolutionize data collection in precision agriculture and are garnering
    attention (Duhan et al., 2017). Microscopic sensors operating at the molecular
    level exhibit high sensitivity and responsiveness, facilitating real-time data
    acquisition with minimal environmental interference (Manjunatha et al., 2016).
    Leveraging their nanoscale and microscopic dimensions, along with their enhanced
    sensitivity, these sensors will enable more precise monitoring of environmental
    conditions and crop health, thereby enhancing the quality of VRS decisions. Furthermore,
    these sensors assist in mitigating challenges associated with sensor drift and
    calibration, allowing more accurate and reliable flow rate control in UASS-based
    VRS applications. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are undergoing transformative
    enhancements, revolutionizing data collection and decision-making in precision
    agriculture (Di Gennaro et al., 2022). The spectral range of these sensors will
    be expanded to comprehensively and intricately understand crop conditions. Advanced
    multispectral sensors can also be used to assess plant physiological parameters
    (Wang et al., 2018) and adjust flow rates based on crop health indicators. This
    approach will enhance the precision and efficacy of VRS and facilitate proactive
    and targeted pest management strategies. It will also optimize resource use and
    minimize environmental impact (Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 6.3.2. Ai-driven
    flow rate optimization AI is being widely used for optimizing flow rate control.
    AI-powered algorithms integrate self-learning and adaptive capabilities into UASSs
    to enable faster decision-making in precision agriculture (Huang et al., 2018).
    ML models are continuously trained using vast datasets containing diverse environmental
    conditions, which empower UASSs to adjust flow rates based on crop requirements
    using prescription maps (Khan et al., 2021). Hyperspectral images offer a wealth
    of data on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in a field. Fig. 18
    refers to the UAV based DAS used by Kuswidiyanto et al. (2023), in their study
    for the detection of downy mildew in kimchi cabbage. Download : Download high-res

    DJI Matrice 300 RTK as the UAV platform, with two cameras – a hyperspectral camera
    (Corning 410 MicroHSI) and another high-resolution RGB camera (Zenmuse P1)-for
    capturing images and (b) images acquired of the respective study field, i.e.,
    kimchi cabbage, using the hyperspectral camera and the high resolution RGB camera.
    Later on, different models are trained based on the augmented dataset obtained
    from the prior study using UAV based DAS. The disease prediction results of the
    studied area can be obtained based on these models. These results can then serve
    as a prescription map for the UASS to optimize the pesticide flow rate according
    to the field’s requirement. Fig. 19 shows the aerial hyperspectral imaging, (a)
    shows the studied area for disease detection, while (b) and (c) refers to the
    prediction results of the respective studied area. In these figures, the green
    areas represent healthy plants, while the red areas indicate disease plants in
    the field (Kuswidiyanto et al., 2023).Hyperspectral images provide information
    on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in an agricultural field. However,
    due to limitations for real time analyzing the field and adjusting the flow rates
    in drone technology, directly applying fertilizer to each pixel is not feasible.
    Thus, image analysis must be performed to segment images into larger, workable
    zones (raster segments) such that the drone efficiently distributes fertilizers
    based on the requirements (Yu et al., 2022). Fig. 20 shows hyperspectral imaging-based
    system in conjunction with prescription details (a) refers to the fertilizer prescription
    chart for the agricultural drones, while (b) shows the experimental setup for
    the agricultural drone with the prescription map used in their study.This adaptability
    allows UASS to respond swiftly and effectively to changing crop health indicators.
    Predictive modeling, fueled by AI, facilitates proactive flow rate adjustments,
    minimizing the reliance on preset parameters and enhancing the overall efficiency
    and effectiveness of pesticide application. Therefore, AI is used to not only
    optimize flow rate control but also catalyze autonomous decision-making capabilities
    during VRS missions (Liu et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (487KB)

    This review reveals innovations that redefine agriculture, from electromechanical
    flow control to cutting-edge nozzles and transformative AI. Each element contributes
    to UASS-based VRS precision and promotes efficiency and sustainability. Real-time
    monitoring, swarm intelligence, and advanced sensor fusion highlight the dynamic
    interplay between technology and agriculture. This exploration showcases the transformative
    landscape of precision agriculture led by pioneering UASS advancements, establishing
    a foundation for tailored and adaptive VRS approaches using data-driven methodologies,
    including the fusion of AI and remote sensing data. UASS-based VRS promotes sustainable
    agriculture besides being technologically advanced. Using this tailored and adaptive
    approach, the limitations of traditional spraying can be addressed. UASS empowers
    farmers by providing unprecedented precision and modulating pesticide application
    based on prescription maps. Moreover, it minimizes environmental impact, optimizes
    resource use, and promotes sustainable and efficient precision agriculture. UASS-based
    VRS entails economic implications, including significant cost savings, enhanced
    profitability, and reduced environmental impact, in alignment with global commitments
    to sustainability. Additionally, this approach empowers farmers to strike a balance
    between productivity and environmental stewardship, thereby cementing its role
    in shaping a sustainable agricultural future. The cost savings and increased profitability
    result from reduced input waste, improved crop yields, and more efficient resource
    management, underscoring the economic viability of UASS-based VRS. The interplay
    between UASS and VRS heralds a new era in precision agriculture, prompting a paradigm
    shift in pest management. Advanced sensor technology facilitates data acquisition,
    empowering farmers to overcome traditional constraints. The evolved UASS, now
    a precision instrument, enables targeted pesticide applications tailored to individual
    crop requirements. This shift in pest management simplifies and enhances farming
    operations, enabling farmers to apply pesticides with greater precision and respond
    promptly to pest outbreaks. Such an approach minimizes waste and maximizes the
    efficacy of pest management, fostering a sustainable and resource-efficient agricultural
    landscape. The implications of UASS-based VRS reach beyond technological innovation,
    signaling a transformative moment where precision, sustainability, economic viability,
    and technological progress converge to redefine modern agriculture.. In this narrative,
    the UASS transcends its role as a mere tool, emerging as a transformative force
    driving agriculture towards unparalleled precision, environmental stewardship,
    and remarkable resilience. CRediT authorship contribution statement Abbas Taseer:

    demand for advanced Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is being driven by the rapid
    expansion of Renewable Energy Systems (RESs) and modern Electric Vehicles (EVs)
    [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Among ESS technologies, Lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs)
    currently dominate due to their impressive volumetric and gravimetric energy density,
    rapid charging capabilities, and extended lifespan [1,6]. However, the health
    of these batteries demands vigilant monitoring, as their performance inevitably
    degrades over time, resulting in diminished retention capacity. This degradation
    rate is influenced by both inherent manufacturing variations and external operational
    conditions. Swift deterioration of battery health leads to shortened lifespans
    and recurring replacement expenses, thereby amplifying the overall lifecycle costs
    of the system. Consequently, researchers are intensively engaged in prognosticating
    battery health degradation to optimize cell design, forecast battery longevity,
    and estimate warranty expenses [7], [8], [9], [10]. Battery State of Health (SOH)
    is a key metric signifying the energy and power storage capabilities, both of
    which undergo degradation with the passage of time. SOH is often characterized
    by a non-linear decline in battery capacity (C) and/or an increase in internal
    resistance (R) compared to their initial values at the Beginning of Life (BOL)
    [11,12]. Accurate assessment of battery SOH holds several advantages, including
    the ability to project expected battery performance, forecast Remaining Useful
    Life (RUL), and determine optimal timing for battery replacement [13,14]. Furthermore,
    predicting SOH degradation trajectories can facilitate preparations for potential
    second-life applications of batteries once their primary use has concluded [8].
    As a result, the integration of SOH assessment features into contemporary embedded
    Battery Management Systems (BMS) software is emerging as a prominent research
    area [11,[14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. Over the past few decades, numerous methodologies
    have surfaced in the literature for forecasting battery SOH and longevity. These
    approaches span a spectrum from simplistic to intricate, encompassing computationally
    intensive techniques [8,14,16,[19], [20], [21], [22]]. Simple models often link
    SOH to straightforward integrated parameters, such as Ampere-hours through Coulomb
    counting [23,24] or Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) [25,26]. While these methods typically
    require fewer measurements and computational resources, their predictive accuracy
    remains constrained. Additionally, certain techniques, like Coulomb counting,
    can be adversely impacted by cumulative errors in continuous counting, particularly
    when battery SOH lacks calibration [20,26,27]. As a consequence, simple models
    prove unsuitable for applications necessitating high predictive precision, such
    as battery state forecasting, in comparison to now-casting applications [27],
    [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. Simple models, like those linking State of Health
    (SOH) to simple measurable parameters such as Ampere-hours through Coulomb counting
    or Open Circuit Voltage (OCV), are commonly adopted due to their apparent ease
    of implementation [23], [24], [25], [26]. Coulomb counting, for example, is widely
    favored in real-world applications due to its rapid computation, cost-effectiveness
    in terms of measurement devices, minimal processing power requirements for algorithms,
    and straightforward integration [16,17,26,33,34]. However, despite their widespread
    use, these simple methods encounter substantial challenges in accurately estimating
    battery State of Charge (SOC) or SOH. Various factors significantly influence
    battery capacity and efficiency, including operating temperature, current direction,
    and sensor accuracy, necessitating corrections for determining the battery''s
    true state [35]. Inaccuracies in sensors can result in SOC/SOH estimation drifts
    due to accumulated errors over time. Calibration of the initial battery SOC presents
    another critical challenge [20,26,27]. Extended use without complete charge or
    discharge cycles leads to error accumulation, rendering precise SOC/SOH estimation
    challenging. The limitations of such simple methods become more pronounced when
    higher predictive precision is required, especially in applications like battery
    state forecasting, compared to now-casting applications [27], [28], [29], [30],
    [31], [32]. These challenges render these simple models less suitable for accurate
    and reliable long-term SOH predictions. To address these limitations, Coulomb
    counting is often supplemented with additional methods such as the OCV method,
    Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM), and various data-driven approaches to enhance
    the accuracy of state estimation [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. On the flip
    side, more sophisticated methods, such as Model-based approaches and data-driven
    approaches, demonstrate greater flexibility in accurately estimating a wide range
    of battery degradation scenarios [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43].
    Model-based approaches frequently rely on physics-based models, such as Equivalent
    Circuit Models (ECMs) commonly employed in embedded BMS [44,45], Electrochemical
    Models (EM) [46], and empirical models [47]. ECMs, characterized by their simplified
    circuit representations, offer computational efficiency and ease of parameterization.
    They strike a balance between accuracy and computational complexity, making them
    more practical for real-time applications and large-scale systems, despite their
    abstraction from the underlying electrochemical processes. In contrast, EMs, while
    more detailed and capable of capturing complex electrochemical phenomena, tend
    to be computationally intensive and require extensive parameterization, making
    them less practical for real-time applications. In general, model-based models
    encapsulate the inherent cell physics and necessitate parameterization through
    various techniques. However, this often proves challenging as it demands a delicate
    balance between complexity and accuracy [7,48]. The fact remains that myriad variables
    influence battery performance, making it intricate to comprehensively encapsulate
    them all within a model [8]. On the contrary, data-driven methods create models
    directly from data without relying on a physical or analytical model [7]. Data-driven
    approaches, particularly machine learning methods (ML), exhibit notable effectiveness
    in battery SOH estimation due to their ability to uncover concealed correlations
    and aging patterns from laboratory or field data collected from batteries [49,50].
    These approaches leverage the power of algorithms like neural networks to extract
    intricate relationships from large datasets, allowing for nuanced understanding
    and prediction of battery behavior without explicitly modeling the underlying
    physical processes [51]. The inherent advantage lies in their adaptability to
    various battery chemistries and operating conditions, enabling improved generalization
    and robustness compared to model-based approaches. However, it''s important to
    note that the efficacy of data-driven approaches can be limited by data availability,
    quality, and the need for extensive training datasets [52]. While neural networks
    excel in handling complex datasets, other machine learning models, like Gaussian
    Process Regression (GPR), decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble
    methods, offer distinct advantages in interpretability, efficiency, and robustness
    in specific contexts [53]. Comparing GPR and neural networks for SOH prediction
    involves considering their respective strengths and application contexts [8].
    GPR, with its ability to provide uncertainty estimates and work effectively with
    limited datasets, might be preferable when dealing with smaller datasets and when
    quantifying prediction uncertainty is critical. On the other hand, neural networks,
    due to their capability to handle large volumes of data and model intricate patterns,
    might be more advantageous in scenarios where substantial amounts of battery behavior
    data are available and computational resources allow for the training of complex
    models. The choice between GPR and neural networks, or any other ML model, for
    SOH prediction depends on multiple factors, including the dataset size, computational
    resources, interpretability of results, and specific requirements of the application.
    Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has gained the most traction in SOH prediction
    (31 %) according to [8]. Nevertheless, the application of GPR Models without “Future
    Load Information” (FLI) remains scarce in the literature (uced time and cost investments
    Table 1) [8,54]. Differing from models incorporating FLI, those without such FLI
    data inputs don''t encompass operational conditions like current (I), State of
    Charge (SOC), and temperature (T) for future battery states. Instead, they predominantly
    rely on inputs such as cycle count, elapsed time, or charge throughput. While
    ML models with information about FLI have demonstrated commendable predictive
    accuracy, feature extraction remains challenging and heavily dependent on domain
    expertise. Additionally, certain features used in these models are inaccessible
    in typical battery management systems, limiting the real-world applicability of
    such models [7]. Hence, the merit of GPR Models devoid of FLI lies in the elimination
    of the need for feature selection or extra parameterization. This advantageous
    aspect results in streamlined model complexity and reduced time and cost investments.

    employing the cycle number ''k'' as input to generate corresponding SOH outputs.
    This study adeptly harnesses various GPR capabilities, resulting in enhanced accuracy
    compared to prior endeavors. However, the utilized dataset, sourced from the NASA
    battery dataset [55], [56], [57], contains numerous instances of reversible capacity
    recoveries. Reversible capacity recovery, also known as the self-recharge or regeneration
    phenomenon, entails a battery exhibiting a sudden and temporary surge in capacity
    before the subsequent cycle [58,59]. This phenomenon is frequently observed in
    cells where the geometric area of the negative electrode surpasses that of the
    positive electrode [60], [61], [62]. Furthermore, when SOH prognostics are based
    on the GPR model without smoothing the dataset containing these recoveries, the
    outcome is marked by inaccuracies in both individual data points and overall variance
    prediction. However, it''s noteworthy that the broader trend of capacity decrease
    over the long term doesn''t seem to be significantly affected by sudden capacity
    recoveries [63]. Consequently, a viable alternative for long-term predictions
    could involve excluding modeling for these recovery events. This approach entails
    omitting corresponding data points prior to model training, aligning with similar
    strategies seen in [7,48,64] for ML techniques other than GPR. This study presents
    a practical predictive framework for modeling the degradation trajectory of Lithium-Ion
    Battery (LIB) health, employing the data-driven GPR method. The selection of GPR
    is motivated by its flexibility, ability to handle complex and nonlinear data
    relationships, and its capability to capture prediction uncertainty without relying
    on future load information. Notably, our research distinguishes itself by using
    the ISEA dataset, which is notably devoid of capacity recoveries before model
    training, setting it apart from prior works (e.g., [54]). We specifically address
    the absence of GPR applications in the context of machine learning-based State
    of Health (SOH) prediction models without Full Load Information (FLI). In addition,
    we extend the analysis to second-life scenarios and conduct a comprehensive comparative
    evaluation with Support Vector Regression (SVR), considering key metrics like
    root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute error
    percentage (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). To enhance the robustness
    of predictions and address the risk of overfitting, the training process incorporates
    both 5-fold cross-validation (5FCV) and 10-fold cross-validation (10FCV). Bayesian
    optimization is employed during training to select optimal parameters, thereby
    improving the predictive performance of both GPR and SVR. Results show the superior
    performance of the GPR model over SVR. Importantly, GPR exhibits precision in
    predicting End of Life (EOL) points, demonstrating its applicability in both first-life
    battery usage and second-life applications. Furthermore, the study highlights
    GPR''s effectiveness in predicting health degradation trajectories and quantifying
    associated uncertainty. This valuable information empowers stakeholders to make
    informed decisions by assessing the reliability of LIB health degradation predictions
    and understanding associated risks. The paper is structured as follows: Section
    2 presents GPR, SVR, and the proposed prediction framework. Section 2 also covers
    hyperparameter Optimization using Bayesian Optimization. Section 3 presents the
    utilized data, statistical data analysis, and prediction results for mid-life
    and late-life predictions. Finally, Section 4 provides conclusions and perspectives.
    Methods This section provides a brief overview of the considered models, GPR and
    SVR, along with the utilization of Bayesian Optimization for model calibration.
    Additionally, it outlines the proposed framework for Lithium-Ion Battery Health
    Prediction. Gaussian process regression GPR is a nonparametric kernel-driven learning
    model that is well known for its ability to handle nonlinear prediction problems
    and provide uncertainty measures on predictions [72,73]. It is particularly useful
    for modeling small-sized data with Gaussian or non-Gaussian distributions. One
    of the key advantages of the GPR model is its capability to provide a confidence
    interval that assesses the reliability of predicted values, making it widely used
    in various applications [74]. In the GPR model, the response variable y is considered
    to be a function f evaluated at input x, expressed as: (1) (2) (3) (4) To conduct
    predictions using the GPR model, a new test input is taken into consideration.
    The estimated mean and variance corresponding to are determined as presented in
    [75,76]: (5) (6) Subsequently, adheres to a conditional distribution with the
    following structure: (7) The predicted output value for a given test input in
    GPR is denoted as . Beyond the predicted output, GPR can furnish a confidence
    interval (CI) to evaluate the reliability of the prediction. This interval can
    be calculated using the variance . For instance, the 95 % confidence interval
    is computed as specified in [75]. (8) Hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian
    optimization Numerous machine learning methods, such as GPR and ensemble models,
    involve multiple hyperparameters, such as kernel types in GPR and associated parameters.
    The optimal values for these hyperparameters significantly influence the overall
    performance of machine learning models. Consequently, various optimization methods,
    including grid search, random search, and Bayesian Optimization (BO), have been
    extensively explored in the literature to identify the most suitable hyperparameter
    configurations [77]. In contrast to more conventional optimization methods such
    as random search and grid search, Bayesian Optimization provides a sophisticated
    and efficient approach to hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models [78].
    Random search involves randomly sampling hyperparameter configurations from predefined
    ranges, while grid search systematically explores a predefined grid of hyperparameter
    values. Although these methods are straightforward, they may be computationally
    expensive and less effective in navigating high-dimensional or complex parameter
    spaces. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a robust global optimization methodology
    rooted in Gaussian processes and Bayesian inference principles [78]. Its primary
    merit lies in its efficacy for systematically exploring the hyperparameter space,
    significantly reducing the computational time required for discerning the optimal
    parameter configuration. This approach leverages probabilistic modeling to make
    informed decisions about where to explore next in the hyperparameter domain, facilitating
    a more efficient and targeted search for optimal configurations [[79], [80]].
    The BO methodology involves the creation of a probabilistic proxy model for the
    cost function, employing outcomes from prior experiments as a training dataset.
    The proxy model, often a Gaussian process, is computationally more efficient and
    guides the selection of points in the hyperparameter space where the true objective
    function should be evaluated for optimal results (Fig. 1). Consider a scenario
    with m hyperparameters P = p1,⋯,Pm, that need adjustment. The overarching goal
    is to ascertain the optimal values of these hyperparameters, minimizing the objective
    function. (9) Download : Download high-res image (182KB) Download : Download full-size

    Support vector regression SVR model is a flexible data-based approach with good
    learning capacity via kernel tricks. The key idea underlying the SVR is to map
    the trained data into a high dimensional feature space and conduct linear regression
    in that space. SVR can handle non-linear and non-separable data using the kernel
    trick, handle datasets with large numbers of features, and is robust to the presence
    of outliers. However, it requires a large amount of computational power and can
    be sensitive to the choice of kernel function and regularization parameter [81,82].
    Moreover, the relevant concept used in designing the SVR model lies in structural
    risk minimization. It is demonstrated that SVR provides satisfactory performance
    with small sized data [83]. Thus, SVR models have been widely exploited to solve
    prediction issues [91], as in the case of solar irradiance [84] and wind power
    [85], and to improve anomaly detection [73]. Various variants of SVR have been
    developed in the literature [86], [87], [88]. Specifically, three distinct SVR
    regression methods have gained prominence: ε-SVR, ν-SVR, and least-squares SVR
    (LS-SVR). ν-SVR controls the trade-off between a smooth decision boundary and
    allowing some data points to violate the margin, providing flexibility in adjusting
    the model''s complexity. It controls the number of support vectors and the margin
    width [88]. LS-SVR focuses on minimizing the sum of squared errors between predicted
    and actual values, making it effective when the emphasis is on reducing squared
    differences [86]. The ε-SVR introduces an epsilon (ε) parameter to define an ε-insensitive
    tube around the predicted values, allowing for a certain tolerance for errors
    within this tube. This choice was made to strike a balance between model flexibility
    and accuracy, with the epsilon parameter providing control over the width of the
    tolerance tube [[89], [90]]. For our investigation, we opted for ε-SVR, leveraging
    its implementation in the Regression Learner tool within MATLAB. This choice was
    made due to its effectiveness in handling regression tasks and its seamless integration
    into the MATLAB environment, providing a practical and accessible solution for
    our study. Given a training dataset ( where is the input and is the corresponding
    output, the ε-SVR optimization problem can be expressed as follows [83]: (10)
    Proposed prediction framework The techniques based on machine learning represent
    an appealing solution to predict health degradation. The general framework of
    the adopted ML framework for health degradation forecasting is given in Fig. 2.
    The framework involves several steps, including data collection from aging experiments
    and pre-processing, model training and validation, and prediction of SOH degradation.
    In this work, the battery SOH degradation is estimated in terms of capacity degradation.
    The SOH can be easily expressed as a percentage by dividing the cell''s actual
    capacity (Ca) by its nominal capacity (Cn). Download : Download high-res image
    (130KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Illustration of the general
    framework of the adopted SOH prediction strategy. The capacity data collected
    from aging experiments is subdivided into two sets: training and testing. The
    training dataset is the biggest subset used to train the ML models; then, the
    trained models are evaluated using the testing data. The k-fold cross-validation
    (CV) technique is used to assess how well models perform by dividing the data
    into train and test sets, and training and testing the model multiple times on
    different subsets of the data [92]. In this approach, the dataset is partitioned
    into k equally sized folds or subsets. The model is trained k times, each time
    using k-1 folds for training and the remaining fold for validation. This process
    is repeated k times, ensuring that each fold serves as the validation set exactly
    once. The model''s performance is then averaged over the k iterations to yield
    a comprehensive evaluation. K-fold cross-validation helps mitigate the impact
    of dataset variability on model performance estimation, providing a more reliable
    assessment of how well the model is expected to generalize to new, unseen data.
    The benefit of using CV is that it increases the estimation accuracy of model
    performance, reduces the risk of overfitting, and can also be used to tune the
    hyperparameters of a model. This technique is particularly beneficial when working
    with small-sized datasets, as it allows for an efficient use of available information
    while avoiding overfitting. In practical applications, cross-validation is a standard
    practice in model construction, with values of k, such as 5 or 10 commonly employed
    [93]. The choice of the number of folds, denoted as k, is contingent upon the
    size of the dataset. For example, in a 10-fold cross-validation scenario, only
    10 % of the training dataset is utilized for validation during each iteration
    of model training. This ensures a systematic rotation of different subsets for
    training and validation, contributing to a more comprehensive assessment of the
    model''s performance. Crucially, it is imperative to guarantee that both the training
    and validation datasets stem from the same distribution. This ensures that the
    variability present in both datasets adequately captures the underlying distribution
    of the entire dataset, promoting a representative evaluation of the model''s generalization
    capabilities. Fig. 3 visually demonstrates how the 5-fold cross-validation procedure
    is conducted. Download : Download high-res image (258KB) Download : Download full-size

    Here, we employed four commonly used metrics to assess the prediction performance:
    root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute error
    percentage (MAPE), and R-Squared or coefficient of determination (R2). (12) (8.a)
    (9.a) (10.a) Results and discussion In this section, we will provide details about
    the datasets used for the state degradation prediction and the results obtained
    from the considered models. Data description The ML models investigated in this
    work are trained and tested using a high-quality battery dataset derived from
    cycling experiments conducted at the ISEA-RWTH laboratories, a partner of the
    Batteries2020 European project consortium [7,48,94]. In alignment with the introduction,
    our work centers on a preprocessed dataset that is void of the influence of the
    recovery phenomenon and thereby enhance prediction accuracy. The phenomenon of
    reversible capacity recovery/regeneration/recuperation phenomenon, also known
    as self-recharge, manifests as a sudden and transient increase in capacity during
    battery aging [58,59]. Such recoveries commonly surface when the geometric area
    of a battery cell''s negative electrode surpasses that of the positive electrode
    [60], [61], [62]. These recoveries typically arise due to electrochemical cell
    relaxation following periods of pause or idleness [95]. Incorporating these recoveries
    into ML-based SOH degradation modeling introduces complications, adversely affecting
    the prediction process and leading to erroneous results in data points and variance
    estimation. Fig. 4, illustrates the comparison between the ISEA dataset and the
    NASA dataset with the latter exhibiting a higher frequency of reversible capacity
    recoveries. Predictions based on these capacity peak points can yield misleading
    outcomes, as demonstrated in ARIMA predictions [63,96] picted by the pink line
    in Fig. 4a). Various strategies have been employed to tackle this challenge, although
    their efficacy varies [63]. Some researchers applied time series decomposition
    techniques to segregate overall degradation trends (low frequencies) from recoveries
    (higher or noisy frequencies) within battery aging datasets resulting in improved
    prediction accuracy, as evident in EMD-ARIMA Prediction [96], shown by the red
    line in Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, given that authors often endeavored to model the
    time series of recoveries based on the cycle count, establishing a direct correlation
    between capacity recoveries and the number of cycles conducted may not be readily
    apparent, necessitating a more profound and comprehensive analysis [63]. Alternative
    methods include regarding these recoveries as periodic phenomena and modeling
    them using periodic kernels [59,97]. However, adopting such a modeling strategy
    is not recommended, given that these recoveries lack consistent periodic behavior
    for the majority of applications. Regenerations arise during battery rest or relaxation
    intervals, which generally do not follow a periodic pattern. Finally, empirical
    exponential models have been employed [98,99] relating rest time to actual capacity
    recovery, but these approaches require experimental validation from a battery
    aging perspective. Download : Download high-res image (827KB) Download : Download

    the knee-points and the variations in the two different EOL cycle numbers [48].
    (b) NASA Dataset- highlighting high number of capacity recoveries in term of normalized
    capacities (SOH) [63]. (c) MIT-Stanford Dataset- highlighting large degradation
    variations due to the differences in external stress factors [7,60,100]. In a
    critical review [63], after discussing various methods, it is concluded that the
    long-term capacity decrease trend remains largely unaffected by sudden capacity
    recoveries. Thus, an alternative approach is to exclude modeling for these recoveries,
    achieved by omitting corresponding data points before model training. This approach
    aligns with references [7,48,64], where ML methods (other than GPR) were employed
    for SOH prediction and forecasting, utilizing datasets devoid of capacity recovery
    points. In comparison with the Stanford dataset from Refs. [60,100], where cells
    underwent testing under diverse stress factors resulting in considerable degradation
    variability, the ISEA dataset was generated using numerous cells subjected to
    the same aging conditions. This setup aims to explore intrinsic cell manufacturing
    variations and minor temperature differences within battery packs during operation,
    as depicted in Fig. 5 [48]. Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download

    scenario, within an ambient temperature of 25 °C. These cells are uniform and
    have been sourced from the same production lot by Panasonic. The average nominal
    capacity Cn is 1.85 Ah. In this context, the first End of Life (EOL80), which
    occurs at 80 % of the nominal capacity, corresponds to a capacity of 1.48 Ah.
    Similarly, the second End of Life (EOL65), signifying 65 % of the nominal capacity,
    equates to a capacity of 1.202 Ah. For comprehensive cell specifications, refer
    to Table 2. Nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) systems represent successful lithium-ion
    combinations, offering a balanced amalgamation of performance, lifespan, safety,
    and cost-effectiveness [11,101]. Compared with other technologies, NMC stands
    out for delivering an optimal compromise across these key factors and due to its
    low self-heating rate, making it the preferred choice for EVs. Cylindrical batteries,
    such as those sized 18,650, 21,700, and 46,800, serve as a classic version for
    electric vehicle use. These cells can be combined in series to augment voltage
    and/or in parallel to amplify energy capacity, thereby forming the necessary modules
    or packs. Noteworthy advantages of cylindrical batteries include extended lifespans,
    cost efficiency in production, high-temperature resilience, and robust modular
    construction. Table 2. Main specifications of the cells undergoing aging test

    undergo charging at a Constant Current (CC) of 4A and Constant Voltage (CV) of
    3.9 V. Subsequently, they are discharged at a CC of 4A until reaching the minimum
    voltage threshold of 3.5 V. These cycles, lasting around 30 min, maintain a state
    of charge (SOC) between 20 % and 80 %, while operating at a consistent ambient
    temperature of 25 °C. Notably, the average cell temperature experiences an approximate
    5 °C elevation during cycling, as illustrated in Fig. 5. As aging progresses,
    the cells exhibit a gradual decrease in State of Health (SOH) characterized by
    a decline in capacity. To determine the cell SOH, regular characterization tests,
    including Aging Reference Parameter Tests (RPT), are conducted at intervals. The
    RPT, as depicted in Fig. 7, involves capacity characterization under diverse current
    rates and Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC). On average, each cell''s

    in the data was analyzed by calculating the empirical autocorrelation function
    (ACF). The ACF is an important tool for measuring the self-similarity of data
    over different delay times [102]. Fig. 10 shows the ACF of the capacity degradation
    data. The results revealed a high level of autocorrelation in the data and the
    absence of any periodicity. It was also observed that the autocorrelation functions
    of the investigated cells were similar. This important insight was considered
    during the modeling process, leading to the adoption of a single averaged model
    for all the curves. By leveraging the similarities in the data distribution, using
    a single model becomes a practical approach that can effectively capture the general
    degradation trend exhibited by the cells. This approach not only simplifies the
    modeling process but also helps to ensure that the averaged model adequately represents
    the degradation behavior of the investigated cells. Download : Download high-res

    as it provides insights into the forthcoming performance of the battery. Accurate
    and reliable prediction of SOH is important for proper battery management, maintenance,
    and replacement. In this context, two experiments were conducted in this work
    to investigate the ability of the two ML models, GPR and SVR, to predict the degradation
    trajectory of the SOH in term of cell capacity degradation. These experiments
    include mid-life prediction and late-life prediction. The two models, GPR and
    SVR, were trained using 5FCV and 10FCV. As discussed before, the SOH degradation
    curves from different cells are similar and share a similar pattern. The models
    were trained only from data of one curve and used to predict the SOH degradation
    trajectory of all the remaining results. The models can be viewed as averaged
    models. This study implemented the methods (i.e., GPR and SVR) using MATLAB R2023a.
    Specifically, the Regression Learner app within MATLAB was utilized for its user-friendly
    interface, providing efficient tools for constructing, training, and optimizing
    regression models. Notably, this application incorporates features for parallel
    computing and facilitates hyperparameter optimization through diverse methods
    such as Bayesian optimization, random search, and grid search. It is essential
    to highlight that various alternative methods were considered, but their outcomes
    did not meet the required standards and were consequently excluded from the scope
    of this study. First, in our context of SOH prediction for lithium-ion batteries,
    we transform the univariate SOH data into a supervised learning framework to facilitate
    the application of the investigated machine learning models. Specifically, the
    univariate time-series data related to SOH will be preprocessed to create pairs
    of input and output data points (Fig. 11). In this supervised learning setup,
    the models (i.e., GPR and SVR) will learn the relationship between input variables
    (historical SOH data points) and the corresponding output variable (future SOH
    data points) based on training data. Subsequently, these trained models can predict
    SOH values from new input data during the testing phase. Of course, this transformation
    involves structuring the data into input-output pairs, where the past observations
    act as input variables, and the subsequent observation serves as the response
    variable (Fig. 11). Download : Download high-res image (164KB) Download : Download

    degradation to resemble input-output data. Mid-life prediction In the first case
    study, the data was divided into first 30 % of data for training, and the remaining
    data for testing. The hyperparameter optimization process for both the GPR and
    SVR models involves systematically exploring a predefined search space to enhance
    their predictive performance. For SVR, the search space includes parameters such
    as box constraint, kernel scale, epsilon, and kernel function (Gaussian, Linear,
    Quadratic, Cubic). After applying the BO algorithm with 50 iterations, the optimized
    hyperparameters for SVR were determined, featuring a Gaussian kernel, kernel scale
    of 0.067585, epsilon of 0.0011748, and no data standardization. In the case of
    GPR, the search space includes sigma, basic function, kernel function (Exponential,
    Matern 5/2, Rational Quadratic, Squared Exponential), kernel scale, and the decision

    5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation for training each model. This approach allows
    for a comprehensive evaluation of the models'' robustness, leveraging the entire
    dataset for both training and validation purposes, thereby mitigating the risk
    of overfitting. Fig. 12(a-b) present the R2 and MAPE values derived from the optimized
    GPR and SVR models during testing, employing 5-fold cross-validation (5FCV) in
    training. Similarly, Fig. 13(a-b) illustrates the outcomes of the optimized GPR
    and SVR models trained using 10-fold cross-validation (10FCV). Interestingly,
    both figures indicate minimal disparities between the results obtained from 5FCV
    and 10FCV, suggesting a consistent performance across different cross-validation
    folds. The observed robustness in the models is noteworthy, as indicated by the
    stability of results across various cross-validation scenarios. Download : Download

    10-FCV for mid-life prediction. Table 4 presents the averaged prediction performance
    metrics for mid-life prediction based on testing data, comparing the performance
    of the trained GPR and SVR models under 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation (5FCV
    and 10FCV). Notably, GPR consistently outperforms SVR across all metrics under
    both cross-validation scenarios. For instance, in the 5FCV, GPR achieves an R2
    of 0.9993 compared to SVR''s 0.9789, indicating superior predictive accuracy.
    The trend continues in the 10FCV, where GPR demonstrates an even higher R2 of
    0.9999, showcasing its exceptional predictive capability. Additionally, GPR exhibits
    significantly lower RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values, signifying better overall predictive
    accuracy and precision. While these results demonstrate that the SVR model is
    also effective in predicting SOH, it is less accurate than the GPR model. These
    results suggest that the GPR model is more effective in predicting SOH than the
    SVR model. Table 4. Averaged prediction performance based on testing data for

    results of the GPR model for SOH using testing data, with the 95 % confidence
    interval displayed. The key observation is that the predicted values closely align
    with the observed values within this confidence interval. Additionally, the GPR
    model performs excellently in predicting the EOL from midlife state, with an error
    of 1.7 cycles at 80 % EOL and of 8.9 cycles at 65 % EOL. This demonstrates the
    GPR model''s capability to provide reliable predictions and its effectiveness
    in assessing the level of uncertainty associated with these predictions. By taking
    into account the uncertainty, users can better understand the reliability and
    potential variability of the predicted SOH values. Hence, the GPR model proves
    highly valuable in delivering accurate predictions while considering the associated
    uncertainty. Download : Download high-res image (129KB) Download : Download full-size

    95 % confidence level. Late-life prediction In the second case study, the first
    60 % of the SOH data from a single cell was used to train the machine learning
    models. The trained models were then utilized to predict the remaining 40 % of
    the data, which is valuable for predicting the late life of the battery. To enhance
    the models'' performance, we employed Bayesian Optimization to identify the optimal
    hyperparameters for both SVR and GPR. Bayesian Optimization played a crucial role
    in fine-tuning these models, ensuring they were well-calibrated and capable of
    making accurate predictions on the unseen data. The results of the hyperparameter
    optimization process for both the GPR and SVR models in the case of late-life
    prediction are summarized in Table 3. For the GPR model, the hyperparameter search
    range included considerations for sigma, basic function (Constant, Zero, Linear),
    kernel function (Exponential, Matern 5/2, Rational Quadratic, Suared Exponential,
    Exponential), kernel scale, and standardize data. The BO algorithm identified
    the optimal hyperparameters as a basic function of Zero, kernel function Matern
    5/2, kernel scale of 0.000026943, sigma of 0.061585, and no data standardization.
    On the other hand, for the SVR model, the hyperparameter search range covered
    the box constraint, kernel scale, epsilon, kernel function (Gaussian, Linear,
    Quadratic, and Cubic), and standardize data. The optimized hyperparameters, determined
    through BO, revealed a quadratic kernel function, a box constraint of 1.6726,
    an epsilon of 0.0037642, and no data standardization. These optimized hyperparameters
    reflect the fine-tuning achieved by the Bayesian Optimization process, resulting
    in configurations that enhance the predictive capabilities of both models for
    late-life prediction scenarios. For the late-life prediction, we also explored
    the impact of both 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation on the training of SVR
    and GPR models. Figs. 15(a-b) and 16(a-b) show the evaluation metrics, including
    R2 and MAPE, obtained from the optimized GPR and SVR models (trained with both
    5FCV and 10FCV) during the testing phase. Figs. 15 and 16 show that the prediction
    performance of GPR remains stable, with minimal disparities between the results
    obtained from 5FCV and 10FCV, suggesting a consistent performance across different
    cross-validation folds. This consistency across different cross-validation folds
    implies the robustness and reliability of the GPR model in late-life prediction
    scenarios. However, in the case of SVR, a marginal decline in performance is observed
    under 10FCV compared to 5FCV, suggesting a subtle sensitivity to the fold variations.
    Despite this slight decrease, SVR continues to demonstrate competitive predictive
    capabilities. These observations provide valuable insights into the model behaviors
    under varying cross-validation settings, contributing to a nuanced understanding
    of their performance in late-life prediction scenarios. Download : Download high-res

    10FCV for late-life prediction. Table 5 provides a comprehensive overview of the
    averaged prediction performance metrics for late-life prediction based on testing
    data, showcasing a comparative analysis between the trained GPR and SVR models
    under both 5FCV and 10FCV settings. GPR emerges as a preeminent performer, consistently
    delivering precision in predictions across diverse performance metrics. Under
    5-fold cross-validation, GPR attains noteworthy values, with a minimal RMSE of
    0.004, indicative of the accuracy in predicting values vis-à-vis actual data.
    The MAE maintains a similarly impressive standing at 0.0028, suggesting negligible
    deviation between predicted and observed values. Moreover, the elevated R2 value
    of 0.9991 attests to the model''s proficiency in elucidating the variance within
    the dataset, denoting a robust and reliable predictive capability. While competitive,
    SVR exhibits marginally lower performance metrics than GPR under 5FCV. This is
    evident in the comparatively higher RMSE of 0.0243, a relatively larger MAE of
    0.0222, and an R2 of 0.9642. Despite these distinctions, SVR remains a credible
    choice for precise predictions. Under 10FCV, GPR further enhances its predictive
    capabilities, achieving remarkable results with an RMSE of 0.0017, MAE of 0.0012,
    and an exceptional R2 of 0.9999. While maintaining competitive performance, SVR
    experiences a subtle decline in predictive accuracy compared to the 5-fold scenario,
    evidenced by an RMSE of 0.0392, MAE of 0.0298, and an R2 of 0.9172. These results
    highlight the consistent superiority of GPR in late-life prediction scenarios.
    The performance of SVR, while commendable, shows a marginal decrease under the
    10-fold setting, emphasizing the nuanced impact of cross-validation on the predictive
    outcomes of machine learning models in the context of late-life battery prediction.

    SOH using testing data and 95 % confidence levels. Narrow confidence levels indicate
    high confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the predicted SOH values. This
    narrow confidence interval suggests a small range for the predicted SOH values,
    reducing uncertainty and providing precise information about the battery''s health
    and future performance. This increased confidence in GPR model predictions is
    valuable for decision-making and effective battery management strategies. In addition,
    the GPR model exhibits improved performance in late-life EOL prediction compared
    to mid-life prediction. It achieves a one-cycle error for EOL80 and 2.15 cycles
    for EOL65. As anticipated, increasing input data improves prediction accuracy.

    Fig. 17. GPR-based late-life prediction of SOH using testing data with a 95 %
    confidence level. In summary, this study affirms the robust predictive capabilities
    of GPR in predicting the SOH of lithium batteries, even within the constraints
    of a relatively small-sized dataset consisting of 1400 data points. The departure
    from the prevalent trend, eschewing the utilization of intricate, deep learning
    models for SOH prediction, highlights the potential for accurate prognostication
    without complex architectures, especially in cases characterized by small-sized
    data. The demonstrated efficacy of shallow machine learning models, exemplified
    by GPR, challenges the notion that complex models necessitate large datasets for
    optimal performance. This study sheds light on the suitability of GPR as a viable
    alternative, highlighting high prediction performance while maintaining a lower
    degree of complexity compared to deep learning counterparts. The implications
    of this finding are significant, suggesting that in scenarios where data availability
    is constrained, opting for simpler models like GPR can offer a pragmatic and effective
    solution. This insight contributes to the ongoing discourse on the trade-off between
    model complexity and data requirements, emphasizing the potential of shallow machine
    learning models in addressing real-world challenges, particularly in domains where
    data scarcity is a prevailing concern. Conclusion This study presents an effective
    application of GPR for predicting Battery SOH trajectories. By addressing the
    gap in existing literature, we specifically investigate the utilization of GPR
    Models without future load information in battery SOH forecasting. The study of
    literature conducted in this paper demonstrates that the overall downward trend
    in capacity degradation over the long term remains largely unaltered by sudden
    capacity recovery phenomena. Furthermore, accounting for these recoveries during
    modeling significantly impacts long-term capacity predictions. In contrast to
    other literature employing GPR, our approach involves utilizing a meticulously
    preprocessed dataset devoid of reversible capacity recoveries before model training.
    This deliberate step is taken to mitigate the influence of such recoveries on
    the accuracy of our forecasting process. This research includes empirical autocorrelation
    that provide comprehensive insights into data autocorrelation This analytical
    step simplifies the modeling process and contributes to ensuring that the resulting
    averaged model effectively captures the degradation behavior of the studied cells.
    In this study, the 5FCV technique is employed to evaluate the performance of models
    on distinct subsets of the data. The use of CV enhances the accuracy of performance
    estimation, mitigates the potential of overfitting, and can serve as a means to
    fine-tune a model''s hyperparameters. Incorporating first and second EOL thresholds
    caters to both primary and secondary battery applications, making our approach
    more versatile. For example, in EVs, this might mean repurposing batteries for
    stationary energy storage (second life) after they''re no longer optimal for driving
    (first life). This paper conducts a comparative analysis with Support Vector Regression
    (SVR) in mid-life and late-life predictions. The GPR model consistently outperforms
    the SVR model in prediction accuracy, as evidenced by higher averaged R2 values
    (0.99 vs. 0.9789 for mid-life predictions, and 0.9991 vs. 0.9642 for late-life
    predictions) and lower averaged MAPE values (0.1916 vs. 1.3028 for mid-life, and
    0.2265 vs. 1.6448 for late-life). Moreover, GPR effectively quantifies uncertainty
    and predicts EOL instances, displaying a remarkable ability to forecast EOL from
    mid-life predictions with errors of 1.7 cycles at 80 % EOL and 8.9 cycles at 65
    % EOL, and achieving an impressive one-cycle error for EOL85 and 2.15 cycles for
    EOL65 in late-life predictions. Our study advances the field by showcasing the
    potential of Machine Learning methods, particularly GPR, in accurately predicting
    the health degradation of LiBs. This work not only contributes to the literature
    but also lays the groundwork for enhancing battery management systems, optimizing
    battery designs, and reducing replacement costs across various applications, from
    electric vehicles to renewable energy storage. There is potential for future research
    to incorporate additional data sources further to improve the accuracy and reliability
    of SOH predictions. Expanding the dataset to include larger and more diverse samples
    of batteries could improve the accuracy and applicability of the model to a wider
    range of battery types and applications. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: This study presents an intelligent Decision Support System (DSS) aimed
    at bridging the theoretical-practical gap in groundwater management. The ongoing
    demand for sophisticated systems capable of interpreting extensive data to inform
    sustainable groundwater decision-making underscores the critical nature of this
    research. To meet this challenge, telemetry data from six randomly selected wells
    were used to establish a comprehensive database of groundwater pumping parameters,
    including flow rate, pressure, and current intensity. Statistical analysis of
    these parameters led to the determination of threshold values for critical factors
    such as water pressure and electrical current. Additionally, a soft sensor was
    developed using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, enabling real-time
    forecasting of key variables. This was achieved by continuously comparing live
    telemetry data to pump design specifications and results from regular field testing.
    The proposed machine learning model ensures robust empirical monitoring of well
    and pump health. Furthermore, expert operational knowledge from water management
    professionals, gathered through a Classical Delphi (CD) technique, was seamlessly
    integrated. This collective expertise culminated in a data-driven framework for
    sustainable groundwater facilities monitoring. In conclusion, this innovative
    DSS not only addresses the theory-application gap but also leverages the power
    of data analytics and expert knowledge to provide high-precision online insights,
    thereby optimizing groundwater management practices.

    forest 1. Introduction Sustainability has emerged as a critical imperative, a
    sentiment echoed by global initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
    which underscore the importance of harmonizing economic growth, community well-being,
    and environmental protection (Wang et al. [1]; Al-Sulaiti et al. [2]). In response
    to the escalating challenges faced by the environment and nature, there is a global
    push for a sustainable way of life, reflecting heightened expectations worldwide
    (Balsalobre-Lorente et al. [3]). Central to fostering urbanization, industrialization,
    and an enhanced quality of life is the pivotal role played by the management of
    water resources and supply (Fathollahi-Fard et al. [4]). Addressing these management
    challenges necessitates the integration of managerial approaches, technology,
    and industry practices (Abbas et al. [5]; Al-Sulaiti et al. [6]). Regrettably,
    historical patterns of imprudent and unsustainable groundwater abstraction, driven
    by escalating water demands, have posed significant threats to both human well-being
    and the natural environment (Mojtahedi et al. [7]; Tian et al. [8]). Consequently,
    there is an urgent need for efficient and intelligent management of water withdrawal
    from these finite groundwater resources, emerging as a top priority for stakeholders
    and water users alike (Fathollahi-Fard et al. [9]). This imperative is rooted
    in the collective desire to achieve sustainable water demand and supply management
    while safeguarding the integrity of our limited water resources (Ingildsen and
    Olsson [10]). The first step of smart water resources management, e.g., groundwater
    systems, is to provide required water withdrawal data, including flow rate, hydraulic
    and electric parameters of wells and pumps (Eggimann et al. [11]). Supervisory
    Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can manage all this favoring a large
    variety of sensors widely used in water systems (Candelieri et al. [12]). The
    SCADA systems gather and analyze real-time data for monitoring the performance
    of the water supply systems, including their equipment such as pumps. The data
    collected needs to properly be analysed and interpreted as meaningful information
    for decision-makers (Ingildsen and Olsson [10]). Various data-driven models and
    tools can conduct data analytics in water systems (Ali et al. [13]). Nowadays,
    machine learning (ML) is one of the popular tools due to its ability to predict
    the future with high levels of precision (Xenochristou et al. [14]). Many researchers
    have employed ML models to successfully forecast water systems'' performance.
    Some examples include Random Forest (RF) (Chen et al. [15]), Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) (Rodriguez-Galiano et al. [16]), artificial neural networks (ANN) (Ostad-Ali-Askari
    et al. [17]; Montazeri et al. [18]), and boosted regression trees (BRT) (Knierim
    et al. [19]; Ransom et al. [20]). The RF model is an ensemble ML method for regression
    and classification that operates by building a huge number of decision trees (Breiman
    [21]) using a random vector independently sampled from the input vector. Bagging
    is a method to produce a training dataset where a randomly selected part of the
    predictor variables is applied to construct each model''s individual tree (Fathollahi-Fard
    et al. [9,22]). The trees are grown to the maximum depth of the new training dataset
    using variables without pruning. This is one of the major merits of the RF regression
    over other tree methods such as the M5 model tree (Quinlan [23]). Moreover, the
    RF is a suitable method for indicating the nonlinear influence of variables and
    can handle complex interactions between variables, and is not influenced by multi-collinearity
    (Breiman [24]). Band et al. [25] showed that the RF models in forecasting nitrate
    concentration in groundwater are more accurate than other ML algorithms such as
    Cubist, SVM, and Bayesian ANN. Singh et al. [26] investigated the potential of
    the M5P model tree, ANN and RF for predicting the effects of impurities such as
    ash and organic manure on soil infiltration rate in various geometries. The performance
    evaluation parameters have proved that the RF approach performs extremely accurately
    compared to the M5 model tree and ANN considered models for this dataset. Ouedraogo
    et al. [27] demonstrated that the prediction correlation of the RF algorithm for
    modeling groundwater nitrate pollution is much better than the multiple linear
    regression (MLR) method. According to the IDC report (Fig. 1), the spent financial
    resources for smart cities will be increased from 2018 to 2023. Also, this fact
    leads to an increase on the costs through smart systems and facilities. Plus,
    as per Fig. 2, the most spent finance is related to the implementation of smart
    infrastructures, and it illustrates that this section of facilities needs enhancement
    from automation and smartening aspects. In addition, Fig. 3 demonstrated that
    environmental smart monitoring through the smart city plan is divided into 16
    % connectivity, 9 % software, 39 % hardware, and 37 % services. Therefore, increasing
    the software systems instead of hardware substructures makes the cost of smart
    city operations optimized. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download

    models, effectively integrated with decision-making frameworks to address intricate
    systems (Abbasi et al., [28]; Abbasi et al. [29]). Classical Delphi (CD) is one
    of the management techniques used for prediction based on the outputs of some
    rounds of questionnaires anonymously answered by a group of experts. The responses
    in each round are aggregated and shared with the experts. They can change their
    responses according to the previous round results. Ultimately, the information
    acknowledged by more than 60 % of the experts is integrated and presented as the
    final outputs. This method is extensively employed when there are controversial
    opinions about a managerial problem (Chouhan et al. [30]). A large volume of water
    demands in warm and dry climates is supplied from groundwater abstraction as the
    main water resources via pumping stations (Drake [31]; Lonergan [32]). Smart management
    of water supply requires the key parameters of pumping facilities are collected
    and analysed. These parameters in pump systems include hydraulic (water flow rate,
    pressure head and etc.), electrical (amperage, voltage and etc.), and mechanical
    (energy functions, electromotor problems, etc.) considerations (Speed [33]). The
    evaluation of pump performance should extend to a comparison with specific standard
    tables designed for real-time equipment health monitoring, as outlined by McGhee
    and Steel [34]. While current control systems in water resource management facilities
    offer valuable management insights for optimal pump system operation (Gandon [35];
    Hoffman [36]; Mezher et al. [37]), these systems often involve physical sensors
    and incur substantial electrical, mechanical, and structural costs, imposing financial
    burdens on water resource management organizations (Hanswal et al. [38]). In addressing
    this challenge, scientists have conducted an analysis of the economic impacts
    of investments in the water sector on public health. Due to the financial strain
    associated with the capital cost and maintenance of physical sensors and other
    facilities in water resource management, the deployment of economic computerized
    telemetry tools becomes a viable option, particularly in industrial sectors such
    as water and wastewater companies (Ma and Wang [39]). In the realm of pumping
    system parameters, the prediction of flow rate, pressure head, and water demand
    using ML techniques has become a common practice. From a comprehensive literature
    review, various methodologies, including ANNs, SVMs, fuzzy logic, hybrid models,
    and RF, have been employed to forecast water demands and demonstrate diverse applications
    (Chen et al. [40]; Pacchin et al. [41]; Peña-Guzmán et al. [42]; Sampathirao et
    al. [43]; Amini et al., [44]; Sun et al. [45]; Afrin and Yodo [46]; Yang et al.
    [47]). To determine this research area''s importance, the library evaluation is
    done based on data mining of Scopus databank through the VOSviewer software. Due
    to creating the databank, smart systems'' application in water management issues
    are extracted from Scopus datacentre. According to Fig. 4-a, it is clear that
    the United States and China had the most publications in the mentioned issues,
    and also, Iran increased its activities in the using smart system in the water
    management research area. Likewise, based on Fig. 4-b, integration of machine
    learning and water management systems is in trend and expanding this investigation
    area attracted both academia and industrial practitioners. Download : Download

    System (GIS), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are utilized. Finally, for discussion
    of the mentioned research''s outcomes, Stream Depletion Factor (SDF) are operated.

    scheduling. In this study, three aspects of water resource management contain
    soil specification, water data analysis, and DSS are programmed. Perea et al.
    [62] evaluated the application of Genetic Algorithm (GA) as controller of groundwater
    resources in daily periods. In the declared research both water and energy are
    entered as variables which are computed by Water User Associations (WUAs). Finally,
    a novel system which is named Model to Optimize Water Extraction (MOPWE) is presented
    as a result of the study. In the other research, Agarwal et al. [63] industrialized
    a method for smart groundwater resource management in the irrigation usages. Last
    but not least, Zippe et al. [64] reviewed different aspects of decision support
    approaches in the groundwater resource management. While examining the body of
    literature in Fig. 7, it becomes evident that all the reviewed studies have focused
    on machine learning techniques for predicting various groundwater and pump specifications.
    In line with these research endeavors, our current study also employs artificial
    intelligence computations to assess our smart DSS. Download : Download high-res

    of groundwater control studies by Trend-flow structure. This study endeavours
    to introduce an innovative data-mining decision-making framework, leveraging real-time
    data collected from pumps in wells and incorporating expert experience. The methodology
    is exemplified through a practical case study in Mashhad, Iran. Initially, the
    study assesses the performance and accuracy of the RF algorithm in forecasting
    critical parameters such as flow rate, current intensity, and water pressure head,
    as well as conducting time series and spatial analyses of energy consumption for
    pumps, i.e., particularly noteworthy in the absence of hard sensors. Subsequently,
    empirical knowledge from experts at the water and wastewater company of Mashhad,
    Iran is systematically gathered and scrutinized to define alarm logics and allowed
    thresholds for operating parameters, contributing to the enhancement of pump performance.
    The culminating output is a user-friendly software tool, serving as a DSS, tailored
    for the monitoring and decision-making processes associated with pump performance
    and operation. To encapsulate the primary research contributions: • Creation of
    an intelligent DSS, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical groundwater
    management research and its practical application. • Establishment of a comprehensive
    database encompassing groundwater pumping parameters through the collection of
    telemetry data from six randomly selected wells, including flow rate, pressure,
    and current intensity. • Conducting statistical analyses to set threshold values
    for critical factors such as water pressure and electrical current, informed by
    the collected telemetry data. • Development of a soft sensor utilizing the RF
    machine learning algorithm for real-time forecasting of key variables through
    continuous comparison with pump design specifications. • Integration of expert
    operational knowledge from water management professionals using the CD technique,
    enriching the DSS with practical insights. • Provision of high-precision online
    insights, optimizing groundwater management practices and underscoring the practical
    application of data analytics and expert knowledge. In the following sections,
    we assess mathematical and statistical models in Section 2, and present the modeling
    results in Section 3 with a particular focus on the concept of knowledge management.
    Section 4 delineates the implementation of the DSS for groundwater facilities
    management and its alignment with Sustainable Development Goals within this study.
    Section 5 highlights the main research limitations, implications, and policy recommendations
    from our results. Ultimately, in Section 6, we provide an evaluation of the key
    findings and offer insights into future research directions. 2. Methodology In
    this section, we delve into the statistical evaluations, data mining, computational
    methods, and the implementation of our intelligent DSS algorithm, both offline
    and online. The development of a smart decision support system for sustainable
    groundwater management in this study involves a nuanced approach, incorporating
    quantitative data analysis, machine learning forecasting, expert knowledge elicitation,
    and integrative modeling to craft an intelligent management framework. The proposed
    methodology employs operational data from sensors and telemetry systems to statistically
    model the normal behaviour and thresholds for parameters like flow rate and pressure,
    establishing a baseline for monitoring well performance. Additionally, machine
    learning predictive modeling contributes to forecasting key variables, even in
    instances where physical sensors may fail, ensuring enhanced monitoring continuity.
    The RF algorithm is particularly adept at handling complex variable interactions
    and large telemetry datasets, commonly encountered in water systems management.
    The CD expert elicitation method systematically synthesizes the knowledge and
    experience of groundwater professionals to develop data-driven actionable insights
    for decision support. Using the advantages of aforementioned methods, this study
    provides a more comprehensive approach using the integration of statistical evaluations,
    predictive models, expert logic, and real-time monitoring capabilities into a
    unified management framework. In a similar vein, Mezher et al. [37] developed
    an expert system for mechanical pump performance management, utilizing a knowledge-based
    approach that captured operational data trends, diagnostics, and recommendations
    from industry advisors. Ransom et al. [20] showcased high-accuracy nitrate concentration
    forecasting using boosted regression tree machine learning models, leveraging
    robust groundwater quality sensor datasets. Gheibi et al. [65] presented a practical
    risk analysis decision framework for water treatment plants, integrating failure
    mode effects analysis, and Shannon entropy-based Petri Net modeling, thereby synthesizing
    computational techniques with human expertise. Fathollahi-Fard et al. [9] developed
    an integrated optimization and learning-based decision support system for the
    efficient operation of water supply and wastewater collection networks, combining
    exact methods, adaptive mechanisms, and expert knowledge. Sun & Wang [45] designed
    an intelligent prediction and control system for landslide evolution state monitoring,
    employing multi-task machine learning models to enhance performance. 2.1. Case
    study The methodology is demonstrated here on a real-world case study of Mashhad
    city in the east of Iran and the main tourist attraction and business centre (Shahsavar
    et al. [66]). The city has a population of over 3 million and an area of 351 km2.
    The data collected from the telemetry systems include about 1,048,000 data records
    related to the hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical properties of 24 wells over
    a two-year period. Mashhad is a crowded city in Iran and its water systems are
    huge with more than 800,000 users. Therefore, for the execution of the smart city
    concept in the mentioned area, the application of Artificial Intelligent (AI)
    is crucial. The location of wells in the case study is illustrated according to
    Fig. 8. According to Fig. 5, it becomes clear that the wells are distributed in
    different zones of Mashhad, Iran with diverse soil mechanics and water resources
    specifications. Also, Fig. 9 expresses the water resources characterization of
    case study. The mentioned scheme is related to water resources management plan
    of Mashhad from 2016 to 2020 and it obtained from the water management company
    of Khorasan province. According to Fig. 9, volume of produced water from wells
    as groundwater resource is considerable in Mashhad, Iran. Likewise, this trend
    is steady in the declared region and therefore, smart sustainable controlling
    of water supply facilities in this resource is crucial more than more. Download

    Statistical analysis and data mining Here, Fig. 10 illustrates the research framework
    of this study comprising four modules: statistical analysis, ML, facility health
    monitoring, and knowledge management (Fertier et al. [67]; Meng et al. [68]).
    In the statistical appraisal, descriptive analysis and histogram scrutinizing
    of water flow rate (Q), pressure (P), Voltage (V1, V2, V3, V12, V13, V23), current
    intensity (I1, I2, I3), and Power (PF) are carried out by SPSS in order to determine
    the allowed thresholds of each parameter (Erfani et al. [69]). Then, the main
    core of the forecasting model for the prediction of flow rate, pressure, and an
    electrical current is programmed using RF algorithm (Gheibi et al. [70]) in Python
    environment. The algorithm with the highest level of precision is selected to
    design the prediction model. Download : Download high-res image (923KB) Download

    were deliberately selected due to their provision of critical operational, hydraulic,
    electrical, and mechanical data pertaining to the wells and pumping systems. As
    previously highlighted, effective groundwater resource management necessitates
    continuous monitoring of key factors such as flow rates, pump energy usage, and
    efficiencies. This comprehensive approach allows for the optimization of performance
    and informed decision-making. The significance of each chosen parameter is noteworthy:
    • Flow rate serves as a direct indicator of water demand and yield. • Pressure
    signals the proper functioning of extraction. • Electrical current and voltage
    characterize energy consumption. • Power quantifies energy efficiency. Through
    a process of statistical analysis and the construction of machine learning models
    using time-series data collected via telemetry systems on the wells, the researcher
    establishes robust thresholds and predicts parameters like flow rate in real-time,
    even in situations where physical sensors may fail. This strategic choice of parameters,
    coupled with the data analytics approach, empowers the decision support system
    to identify underperforming wells/pumps, diagnose issues, and enhance monitoring
    and control capabilities, thereby contributing to sustainable groundwater management.
    Previous researches provide extensive evidence on the relevance of hydraulic and
    electrical metrics like flow, pressure and current for developing optimization
    solutions, predictive models and intelligent decision support approaches for efficient
    groundwater and pump infrastructure management. Water flow rate is widely monitored
    in groundwater management systems as it directly indicates water demand and well
    yield (Speed [33]; Gandon [35]). Pressure sensors provide critical insights into
    proper functioning of extraction (Hoffman [36]; Almeida & Ramos [71]). As pumps
    are major consumers of energy, current, voltage and power offer measurable characterizations
    of energy usage which must be optimized in operations (Ma & Wang [39]; Hanswal
    et al., [38]; Shah et al. [72]). Specific studies validating the importance of
    measuring such hydraulic and electric factors come from Mezher et al. [37] who
    designed an expert system for pump performance management using flow rate, pressure,
    current, voltage trends. Candelieri et al. [12] demonstrated high accuracy short-term
    water demand forecasting by training machine learning models on pump flow rate
    data from meter readings. Eggimann et al. [11] review various hydro-electric smart
    meter data types for analytical approaches in sustainable urban water management.
    Additionally, Coppola et al. [54], developed an artificial neural network model
    that predicted transient groundwater levels by learning from time-series data
    on related pumping rates, water usage as well as climatic variables. Conductivity
    sensors offered Parra et al. [53] valuable insights into managing urban groundwater
    resources. Thomas et al. [73] showed how pump sensor data combined with remote
    sensing and machine learning can support groundwater resilience planning. The
    selection of parameters was meticulously based on the specific needs of the industry
    and the project''s objectives, ensuring a comprehensive and tailored approach
    to groundwater management. The parameters selected for evaluation were carefully
    chosen to align with industry standards and the unique requirements of groundwater
    management. These parameters directly reflect the critical aspects of well and
    pump health, ensuring the relevance of our evaluation to real-world scenarios.
    Each parameter selected holds practical significance in the context of groundwater
    facilities monitoring. For instance, flow rate, pressure, and current intensity
    are fundamental indicators of pump and well performance, directly impacting the
    sustainable extraction and utilization of groundwater resources. The telemetry
    data collected from six randomly selected wells encompassed a range of parameters
    essential for effective monitoring. These parameters were identified as crucial
    by industry experts, ensuring the inclusion of relevant and impactful data points
    in our evaluation. Additionally, the statistical analysis conducted on the telemetry
    data allowed us to establish threshold values for factors such as water pressure
    and electrical current. These thresholds are pivotal in determining the optimal
    functioning of groundwater systems, thereby contributing to the overall efficiency
    and sustainability of water resource management. Moreover, the implementation
    of a RF machine learning algorithm served to forecast key variables in real-time.
    This not only provides a predictive aspect to our evaluation but also enables
    continuous monitoring of variables critical to groundwater management, offering
    a proactive approach to system health. In addition, we integrated expert operational
    knowledge obtained through the CD technique, enriching our evaluation with insights
    from professionals in the water management industry. This ensures that our parameters
    are not only data-driven but also informed by the practical experiences and expertise
    of those actively involved in groundwater facilities management. Finally, the
    selected parameters collectively form a holistic approach to optimizing groundwater
    management. By combining statistical analysis, machine learning, and expert knowledge,
    our approach aims to provide high-precision online insights that contribute to
    the sustainable and efficient utilization of groundwater resources. The conceptual
    model of the forecasting core in the ML module is demonstrated in Fig. 11. Online
    dynamic comparing collected data from the pumps'' telemetry system with design
    catalogues of pumps and periodic field check-ups on the pumps’ performance can
    create a practical framework for health monitoring of pumps and wells as a DSS
    (Yu et al. [74]; Irannezhad et al. [75]). In the last part of this research, a
    conceptual framework for empirical judgment of achieved data is created by applying
    the CD method (Gheibi et al. [76]). The algorithm of the CD method in the present

    to pre-training and testing as well as the comparisons made between the RF data
    mining has appropriate efficiency in forecasting water flow rate, water pressure,
    and current intensity of wells and pumps based on other effective factors as per
    Eq. (1) (Mirabi et al. [77]; Amini et al. [44]). The RF algorithm in this study
    is illustrated in Eq. (1). (1) RF is an ensemble of B trees where is the factor
    aimed to be predicted. The ensemble produces B outputs where , is the prediction
    for each record by bth tree. Outputs of all trees are aggregated to produce one
    final prediction, F(x). In regression, it is the average of the individual tree
    predictions. The RF algorithm randomly selects 70 % of the recorded data for training
    while the remaining 30 % is used to evaluate the algorithm performance. The P,
    V1, V2, V3, I1, I2, I3, and PF have been considered as influencing factors, whereas
    Q has been assigned as the output. The last programmed system is flexible for
    estimation of P, Q, and current intensity (mean of all I1, I2, and I3) as outcomes
    of the prediction system. The model performance for test data is analysed using

    in wells and pumps. The model is developed based on the datasets for six particular
    wells with distinct properties in various parts of the region. A screening process
    has selected these wells to represent the statistical society of the studied 24
    wells of Mashhad, Iran. The acquired data is received from telemetry systems in
    the water and wastewater company of Mashhad. The prediction model''s performance

    statistical evaluations, data mining and ML prediction model, facility health
    monitoring, knowledge management by CD method, DSS in groundwater facilities management,
    and managerial are presented and discussed. 3.1. Statistical evaluations The outcomes
    of descriptive statistical analysis and histogram diagrams are summarized in Fig.
    16, respectively. As per the mentioned Table, mean values of significant parameters
    such as Q, P, I1, I2, and I3 are equal to 0.0171 m3s-1, 346,000 Pa, 2.73e+8 A,
    2.73e+8 A, and 2.73e+8 A, respectively. Moreover, in Table IS, zero and minus
    values reveal that the water facility is in standby condition and does not perform
    effectively in the operation system. The median value of Q measured 0.020 m3s-1
    in each well, is interpreted as moderate water demand in each loop. The median
    of P, I1, I2, and I3 are computed 340,000 Pa, 110.64 A, 111.81 A, and 115.68 A.
    Comparisons made between the mean and median values of effective factors declare
    the existence of several errors (wrong recorded data) in online telemetry system.
    Prediction process will be complicated with these data although the presence of
    faulty records is a common phenomenon in online telemetry industrial control systems
    mainly due to non-calibrated sensors, inefficiency and inappropriate functionality
    of electrical tools and appliances, and telecommunication infrastructures’ inconsistencies.
    Despite these problems, our approach has endeavoured to create an accurate forecast
    model considering these incorrect data. Download : Download high-res image (608KB)

    and Skewness of all electrical factors, (c) descriptive statistical parameters
    of current intensities and PF, and (d) full statistical specifications of Q and
    P. Histogram distribution concentration of effective variables Q, P, V1, V2, V3,
    V12, V13, V23, I1, I2 and I3 are calculated in the ranges of [0.02–0.025], [(0–1)
    e+5 and (5–7) e+5], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [0–200], [0–200] and [0–200],
    respectively. According to the statistical evaluations, thresholds of an alarming
    system for fluctuation of recorded data in the DSS are determined. If the received
    data is recorded beyond the critical range more than three times, The DSS alarms
    the operators with a warning message. It is worth noting that the critical range
    is defined as the allowed threshold for each parameter where 70 % of the recorded
    data is accumulated based on histogram diagrams. Therefore, Q, P, I1, I2 and I3
    parameters thresholds for possible alarms include [0.01–0.02], [1E+5-7E+5], [0–200],
    [0–200] and [0–200]. Also, because of the similar behaviour of current intensity
    values, the average of I1, I2, and I3 is defined as I, which will be appraised
    in an alarm management system. In the DSS, the threshold determination should
    be flexible and adjustable by the principal''s opinion and experience. Therefore,
    the DSS designs a flexible platform to manually define the maximum and minimum
    allowed recorded data of the parameter and the number of repetitions for exceeding
    the allowed thresholds in each controlling factor. Fig. 16 demonstrates statistical
    analysis of measured variables in pump stations as per (a) Voltage statistical
    indicators, (b) Kurtosis and Skewness of all electrical factors, (c) descriptive
    statistical parameters of current intensities and PF, and (d) full statistical
    specifications of Q and P. In the following, the four main studies which are related
    to statistical evaluation of pumping processes data analysis are compared with
    results of the present research according to Fig. 17. Within this framework, our
    current investigation has introduced novel concepts rooted in statistical analysis,
    machine learning, and Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), distinguishing our work from
    the existing body of prominent studies. Download : Download high-res image (422KB)

    3.2. Data mining and ML prediction model This section employs the RF algorithm
    to train the forecast model in Python. Among all computations, the RF algorithm
    has shown an appropriate performance The RF algorithm has been used to train a
    ML model in Python environment that forecasts water flow rate, water pressure,
    and current intensity of the wells and pumps in Mashhad, Iran. The outputs of
    the performance evaluation of this algorithm in the mentioned wells are illustrated
    in Fig. 18. In this regard, the RF algorithm prediction model exhibits the highest
    level of compatibility with the real data compared to the three other algorithms.
    The Mean Squared Error (MSE) approaches zero in all wells, except for the 2nd
    well, as depicted in the figure. This indicates no significant difference between
    the predicted parameters and the actual records by the telemetry system in 6 wells
    which confirms that the forecast model is of high precision. This parameter in
    the 2nd well is remarkably high (3.98) due to the wrong information in the dataset
    related to this well. Download : Download high-res image (154KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 18. Performance evaluation parameters of RF algorithm in
    data mining. According to these outcomes, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is
    also close to zero in most wells, affirming the high validity of the anticipation
    model. However, it is relatively large in well 2, highlighting the existence of
    wrong observed data in its dataset. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is deemed acceptable
    in all six wells, as this parameter does not assign greater weight to larger errors.
    Therefore, there is an insignificant disparity between well two and other wells''
    MAE parameters. The Cross-Predictive Ability (CPA) evaluates the generalizability
    of the model to unseen data. In this regard, this parameter is equal or very close
    to 1 in about 90 % of the wells, which signifies great applicability of the forecast
    model in predicting the effective parameters in future. However, the CPA metric
    in well two has been reported 0.58, indicating large errors in received data from
    this well again. The outcomes of the statistical evaluation of the RF algorithm
    applied in the ML model''s training and testing demonstrate the prediction model''s
    high precision. This confirms that RF is an appropriate algorithm for predicting
    wells and pumps'' parameters, including water flow rate, pressure, and current
    intensity. The reliable performance of the RF algorithm can be due to its nonparametric
    characteristic, i.e., it does necessarily follow a normal distribution. Besides,
    it indicates a more powerful performance against outlier values than other methods,
    as each tree in the RF algorithm is generated from different data subsets (Amini
    et al. [44]). In the following, for verification of RF performance in this study,
    the created ML-based model is evaluated according to data of 10 different wells
    which five of them are related to Shandiz city -which is demonstrated through
    Fig. 19-a, and other ones are connected to Torbat-Hydariyeh city in Fig. 19-b.
    The outcomes of statistical computations are demonstrated in Fig. 19. The outcomes
    show that error values are insignificant publicly and it is acceptable from operational
    aspects. Likewise, it is worth noting that the homogeneity of errors in both Shandiz
    and Torbat-Hydariyeh cities are more than in Mashhad''s case study. Therefore,
    it proves that the mechanical of well No. 2 in the Mashhad''s case study is abnormal,
    and the created model has enough reliability for predicting water demand, pressure,
    or current intensity. Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download : Download

    Schematic plan of data-mining in groundwater subject researches with comparisons
    to the present research. 3.3. Facility health monitoring The main objective of
    the pump''s health monitoring is to integrate the empirical knowledge and experience
    with the design tables, catalogues, and the pump characteristic curves. This comprehensive
    information has been then interpreted to meaningful statements and commands implemented
    in the smart management framework through ML methods. The output algorithm is
    demonstrated in Fig. 21. According to this figure, the pumps Health Monitoring
    commences with the pumps'' simultaneous operational, energy intensity, and efficiency
    monitoring. In operational control, the primary goal is to establish a permanent
    condition in the water flow extracted from the wells. The system inspects the
    water flow rate constantly and any unusual record will be reported to the operator
    to take the proper measure. In case of any unexpected situation, the administrator
    is asked whether pump''s shutdown is necessary or not. A healthy pump will be
    substituted for the current one if the operator decides to turn off the present
    pump. The allowed threshold defined for energy intensity and efficiency are extracted
    from the investigations in the catalogues and characteristic curves of the pumps
    as well as interviews with water management experts and professionals. The standard
    thresholds for energy intensity and efficiency in the pumps of Mashhad are determined
    [0.5–1.5] and [[55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65],
    [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75]] %, respectively. In
    case of recording water flow rate beyond these allowed limits, the operator will
    be warned to examine hydraulic and electrical parameters, water flow rate, and
    dynamic and static water levels in wells and apply the appropriate solution to
    the problem. Download : Download high-res image (459KB) Download : Download full-size

    3.4. Knowledge management by CD method The expertise of the professionals in Mashhad
    Water and Wastewater Company has been gathered, analysed, and integrated using
    CD Method according to Fig. 12. The empirical knowledge of the operators and administrators
    in well and pump facility management departments and declared technical information
    in pumps catalogues and design tables are integrated and presented as computerized
    algorithms to be employed in a smart management framework. This DSS is important
    in industrial fields as it atomizes the wells and pumps monitoring and management
    process. The ultimate results of CD method after three rounds of interviews with
    the experts in the water and wastewater company of Mashhad, analysis and evaluation
    of their responses, and creating a conceptual model extracted from these interviews
    are declared in 2 main algorithms illustrated in Fig. 23, Fig. 24. A pre-interview
    round has also been conducted to provide the general understanding and an overall
    algorithm that explains the pumps'' operation and the possible errors that may
    disrupt their optimum performance. The outputs of this pre-interview are also
    demonstrated in Fig. 22. Download : Download high-res image (557KB) Download :

    full-size image Fig. 24. Electrical Parameters monitoring algorithm base on Classical
    Delphi method. At first, the selected group of experts are pre-interviewed to
    determine the most effective parameters on wells behaviour and pumps performance
    and the acceptable threshold for these parameters. According to the pre-interview
    outputs indicated in Fig. 22 and pumps'' characteristic curves, most wells in
    Mashhad supply 30 L s−1 water flow rate with a pressure head of about 200 m. Therefore,
    a desirable range which is determined for all the wells in Mashhad, Iran based
    on the experts’ opinion has been defined 8–30 L s−1. It is worth mentioning that
    the flow rate has been seldom recorded below 1 or over 45 L s−1, so those records
    are neglected in defining the critical range in this research. The allowed threshold
    for water pressure has also been described between 1 and 5 atm. The voltage in
    most of the pumps has been reported between 380 and 410v, and current intensity
    is determined almost twice as much as the power in these pumps. It has also been
    concluded that significant differences between the three voltages and current
    intensities signify the existence of an error or breakdown in the pump accurate
    operation. Furthermore, it is essential to regulate the heightened current intensity
    in repaired pumps to address potential efficiency drop issues. The allowed threshold
    for this increase is 10 % of the pump''s nominal current intensity. One of the
    most important observed a is the fluctuation in current intensity, which notifies
    the air injection problem of pumps. This should be closely monitored as it can
    cause serious damage to pump, equipment, and well flow. Occasionally, 2 distinct
    parameters can jointly affect the well and pump health and should be considered
    simultaneously. For instance, the normal behaviour of the water flow rate and
    current intensity indicates the pump health, while a constant flow rate with growing
    current intensity implies a major problem in the pump. In addition, an extraordinary
    high-efficiency rate for pump operation should also be suspected as it is generally
    reported 65–80 %, and higher efficiency percentages should be monitored. It is
    worth mentioning that cables and other gadgets and equipment of the pumps are
    not renewed with installing a new pump. This can also make several problems and
    should be considered in the pump error-detection process. According to the viewpoints
    of the experts in the water and wastewater company of Mashhad, it is concluded
    that stability in the main parameters involving water flow rate, water pressure,
    current intensity, voltage, and pumps'' operating hours all together lead to the
    optimum performance of the well and pump facilities. This confirms the pump''s
    health in electrical and mechanical aspects and protects the good health as the
    fluctuation in water flow rate may damage the wells'' walls. In this part of the
    research, the acquired concept and understanding of the pump''s performance, possible
    errors in its operation, and probable reasons for these errors are clarified in
    2 computerized algorithms applicable in ML models. As depicted in Fig. 23, water
    flow rate is the most prominent parameter that indicates the pump''s healthy performance.
    As a result, the first step in monitoring pumps performance is to examine the
    stability of the water flow rate. However, it closely corresponds to electrical
    current intensity and water pressure. Therefore, these parameters should also
    be carefully examined for any further error. The fluctuating current intensity
    with water flow rate signs the air injection problem in the pump whereas growing
    current intensity alarms the necessity for water network pressure control. Constant
    water pressure may declare the existence of a problem in the pump. Otherwise,
    the situation should be reported to the operator for engineering analysis. According
    to Delphi method outcomes for electrical parameters assessments illustrated in
    Fig. 24, current intensity and voltage are two of the main parameters which should
    be inspected concurrently. The machine first examines the unacceptable average
    of current intensity and is reported to the operator for engineering evaluations.
    The increasing average of current intensity may be due to installing a new pump.
    In a new pump, while an increasing average of current intensity with steady flow
    rate may be a sign of an unknown problem in the pump, a fluctuating average of
    current intensity with flow rate is caused by air injection problem in the pump.
    Moreover, the algorithm also scrutinizes the stability of the 3 current intensities
    and voltages. Impermanent current intensities indicate a problem in the pumps,
    whereas unsteady voltages should be notified to the administrators for subsequent
    assessments of technical issues. In addition, the Petri Net method has been employed
    to elaborately model the logic and stages of the whole investigation in different
    processes, analyses, and evaluations. This Petri Net model is presented in Fig.

    Our DSS for the groundwater facilities management The DSS is then designed and
    presented as shown in Fig. 26. Different parts and toolbars of the DSS are demonstrated
    in this figure. The most prominent part of this user-friendly smart management
    framework is the administration dashboard where the officials conduct the efficiency
    control and operation management. This toolbar enables the operator to monitor,
    analyze, control, and report the performance of the whole groundwater management
    system, every single well, and its facilities in each selected period. Moreover,
    as all toolbars and parts are modifiable by the user, this dashboard allows the
    administrators and operators'' empirical knowledge and immediate decisions to
    be executed in this DSS. The user can also observe the parameters on diagrams
    and monitor the system''s performance under adjustable conditions. It also provides
    this opportunity to select more than one parameter in each well or pump and compare
    their behaviour and alterations concurrently. Download : Download high-res image

    environment and options. According to Fig. 26, “EslamAbad 02″ well has been selected
    in the DSS platform during the first four months of 2019. In the controlling toolbar,
    Q and predicted Q (Qp) are opted to be demonstrated in comparison to each other
    in the diagram during this period. It is worth mentioning that other operating
    parameters are also possible to be chosen and compared with each other. The operator
    can modify the limits and thresholds for the selected parameters based on specific
    conditions and individual experience and knowledge in the threshold settings and
    alarm management toolbar. For instance, in Fig. 26, the allowed Q received from
    sensor is determined 14 L s−1. The fluctuation range is adjusted 3, which indicates
    that the recorded Q can vary in the range of [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
    [17]] L.s−1. Otherwise, the operator is notified by a warning message in case
    of any recording of Q out of this allowed threshold more than three times. The
    minimum and maximum Q values illustrated on the diagram are also modifiable in
    this toolbar. For example, the graph in Fig. 27 indicates the recorded Q from
    sensors compared to the predicted Qp for “EslamAbad 02″ well during the first
    four months of 2019. As per the mentioned Fig, the orange box marks the allowed
    range of fluctuations in the recorded Q ([[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
    [17]] L.s−1). While the yellow line indicates the predicted Q, the red line signs
    the received Q from the sensors. As evident in this figure, the yellow line is
    mainly in the allowed range, whereas the red line has experienced enormous variations.
    This can be concluded that the DSS has presented a forecast model with the highest
    possible precision level despite a great deal of inaccurate data recorded by the
    sensors. This DSS not only predicts the Q, P, I, or other well and pump parameters
    and detects the values of these parameters beyond the allowed thresholds but also
    evaluates the optimum operation condition and acceptable performance. This is
    achievable by online and in-situ reporting of effective parameters such as efficiency
    and current intensity and the possibility to determine the threshold for all hydraulic
    and electrical parameters. Download : Download high-res image (539KB) Download

    pressure and current intensity by considering the effects of water flow rate as
    the most important parameter in managing wells and pumps. Fig. 28, Fig. 29 show
    water pressure and current intensity compared to water flow rate, respectively.
    The operator can monitor the health of the pump performance by observing any unexpected
    change in these graphs. As per Fig. 29, the fluctuating current intensity with
    the water flow rate warns against the air injection problem in the pump. The acceptable
    water flow rate in case of fluctuating or increasing water pressure also shows
    a problem in the pump. This managerial DSS easily detects all these problems.

    curve of the pumps is also illustrated in Fig. 32. Based on Fig. 32, different
    fluctuations of Head (H)-Q in various tests and supervisory records are illustrated.
    The mentioned tests outcomes demonstrated that H and Q have a specific relationship
    together, and this association can be useful for controlling the pump health monitoring.
    For example, in this study, Q and H are set equal to 14 and 193 according to manager''s
    opinion and the alarm management are operated as per the declared thresholds.

    H-Q curve in the present study. Fig. 33 illustrates the cost breakdown of our
    study, focusing on both investment and operational expenditures. Notably, 75 %
    of the total costs are earmarked for investments, with the remaining 25 % allocated
    for operational aspects. It''s important to recognize that implementing this smart
    infrastructure for sustainable groundwater management entails substantial expenses.
    In alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the deployment of
    our soft-sensor technology in Mashhad, Iran for groundwater management advances
    the SDG related to Sustainable Cities and Communities (Chouhan et al. [30]). Previous
    studies have also highlighted the potential of smart infrastructures in megacities
    for effective groundwater management (Qureshi et al. [81]). Download : Download

    evaluation of soft-sensor in the present study. Collin and Melloul [82] demonstrated
    that intelligent, sustainable groundwater management practices can fulfill certain
    aspects of the SDGs. Aarnoudse et al. [83] introduced an innovative method for
    smart groundwater resource monitoring in northwest China using smart card machines.
    Their findings indicated increased water management efficiency through the operation
    of semi-soft systems. In contrast, our study employs a fully soft-system approach,
    offering promise for addressing water stress challenges in developing countries
    within the context of the smart city concept. The performance results of the RF
    machine learning model align with previous studies that have demonstrated the
    capabilities of ensemble methods like RF for prediction tasks in water systems
    management. For instance, Band et al. [25] found that RF outperformed SVM, Cubist
    and other techniques in accurately estimating groundwater nitrate levels using
    complex sensor parameters. Similarly, Ouedraogo et al. [27] showed superior groundwater
    pollution forecasting accuracy with Random Forest over basic multiple linear regression.
    The high accuracies and model generalization achieved despite imperfect real-world
    SCADA data highlight the Random Forest algorithm''s effectiveness when dealing
    with unbalanced, noisy dataset characteristics prevalent in industrial water telemetry
    systems. Moreover, the practical integration of data-driven analytics with structured
    expert knowledge for decision support connects with previous efforts where pairing
    computational intelligence and human perspectives has enhanced sustainable water
    stewardship. Furthermore, Raffensperger et al. [84] evaluated a groundwater management
    model based on MODFLOW and GWM computations. However, their system relies on commercial
    platforms and offers limited flexibility compared to the computational capabilities
    demonstrated in our study. Moreover, achieving balance between development needs
    and environmental sustainability during global crises aligns with wider research
    into land, energy and food supply considerations. Simultaneously enhancing pandemic
    preparedness worldwide through health investments also facilitates resilience.
    Furthermore, managing the technological tools and infrastructures that enable
    social functioning allows targeted policies for sustainability, whether via urban
    development (Shah et al. [72]) or the intelligent water systems proposed here.
    Therefore, this study''s integrated data and domain expertise approach to optimize
    groundwater management resonates with the growing imperative across domains for
    systems thinking-based transitions. Embedding interdisciplinary perspectives into
    decision frameworks drives contextual responses, rather than reactive conventions
    alone. The methodological innovation coupled with practical application focus
    hereby propels more holistic governances. Finally, our research has shed light
    on the challenges and opportunities in sustainable groundwater management, particularly
    through the utilization of intelligent systems like the soft sensor discussed
    in this study. While we have underscored the substantial costs associated with
    implementing such systems, it is apparent that they present a promising pathway
    toward achieving SDGs, especially those pertaining to Sustainable Cities and Communities
    (Fathollahi-Fard et al. [85]). Moreover, our study distinguishes itself by incorporating
    advanced computational techniques, KBS, and machine learning to address the complex
    task of groundwater prediction and management (Zhang et al. [86]; Mamoudan et
    al. [87]). In comparison to previous research, our approach showcases greater
    flexibility and potential for enhancing water resource management efficiency.
    In conclusion, this research contributes a ground-breaking decision framework
    that integrates data analytics, prediction, and expertise for effective groundwater
    stewardship. However, delving into under-explored dimensions can further bridge
    the gap between theory and application. Several avenues for knowledge generation,
    marked by larger samples, spatiotemporal dynamics, computational advancements,
    parameter breadth, climate scenarios, and stakeholder preferences, present opportunities
    for extending methodological novelty to practical contributions across diverse
    sustainability contexts. Key aspects representing opportunities for additional
    research in this domain include: • The current study establishes a proof-of-concept
    using data from six wells. Extending this approach to encompass more extensive
    telemetry records from pumps and wells can further validate the generalizability
    of the model. • Assessing model performance when applied across different locations
    and over longer durations can unveil inter-site and seasonal influences on prediction
    robustness. • Comparative insights into technique suitability can be gained by
    comparing emerging methods like deep learning, Bayesian neural networks, etc.,
    against the RF algorithm. • Enriching monitoring capabilities can be achieved
    by supplementing existing operational indicators with additional variables such
    as water chemistry, microbiological factors, and soil moisture. • Evaluating model
    resilience for projections under climate variability can aid in assessing adaptation
    needs. • Enhancing decision support can be achieved by incorporating optimization
    programming to recommend energy efficiency interventions alongside diagnostic
    abilities. • Iteratively refining DSS functionalities to user needs and technology
    comfort levels can be accomplished through surveys with industry practitioners.
    5. Limitations, implications, and policy recommendations In this section, drawing
    from our contributions, methodologies, results, and findings, we delineate and
    elucidate the primary research limitations, implications, and potential policy
    recommendations for industrial practitioners. 5.1. Limitations In an era marked
    by escalating water scarcity and the repercussions of climate change, the adoption
    of smart infrastructure and innovative methodologies becomes imperative. This
    research contributes to the ongoing conversation on sustainable water resource
    management, providing insights that can aid decision-makers and practitioners
    in addressing the global challenges of groundwater sustainability and responsible
    water usage. Therefore, the primary limitations of this study include: • Absence
    of soil mechanics specifications in the groundwater prediction modeling. • Limited
    assessment of the long-term performance of the soft-computing system, particularly
    about its applicability under changing climate conditions and in situations of
    water scarcity. • Omission of evaluations involving high-performance machine learning
    systems, such as deep learning, within the scope of this study. • This paper does
    not explore the application of metaheuristic algorithms for error minimization
    in extended, in-depth analysis. 5.2. Implications The intelligent monitoring system
    developed in this study holds multifaceted implications for optimizing the sustainability
    of groundwater management practices across planning, operations, responsiveness
    and development scopes. The high-accuracy predictive capabilities facilitate informed
    infrastructure planning aligned to growth projections for demand, electricity
    pricing and climate impacts. Smoothed operations via adopting preventative approaches
    towards maintenance prioritization benefit service continuity risks mitigation.
    Quick diagnosis of emerging issues enhances rapid mobilization of targeted interventions
    minimizing disruptions. Structured digitization roadmaps focused on user preparedness
    improves receptiveness when incrementally transitioning traditional programs,
    avoiding change resistance. Open environmental data sharing forms collaborative
    decision-spaces between public and private players to deliberate localized responses
    accounting for distributional disparities. Interdisciplinary skill development
    propagates creative problem-restructuring attitudes beyond siloed engineering
    conventions alone. Responsible and resilient management paradigms manifest by
    enabling such multidimensional techno-socio-economic implications holistically
    across planning insights, operational continuity, rapid responsiveness, receptive
    modernization, collaborative inclusiveness and creative competence. Hence, pathways
    from data to wisdom have the potential to responsibly balance groundwater usage
    sustainability by institutionalizing systemic thinking, transforming raw telemetry
    data into actionable intelligence. 5.3. Policy recommendations Achieving sustainable
    groundwater management necessitates policy efforts across capacities, transparency,
    skills, incremental digitization, preventative mindsets and adaptive outlooks.
    Specifically, governments must fund the development of smart monitoring infrastructures
    that can optimize operations using data analytics and modeling demonstrated here.
    Regulators should promote open data availability through incentives to enable
    collaborative decision-making. Interdisciplinary training exposure will propagate
    responsible and innovative management mentalities. Structured technology integration
    roadmaps focused on user preparedness will ease digitized transitions supporting
    field practices. Standards must also mainstream preventative approaches like maintenance
    prioritization alongside mandating monitoring of projected climate change impacts.
    By enabling such multidimensional policies holistically, the foundations for data-driven,
    resilient and efficient groundwater management can be mainstreamed locally and
    globally. Institutionalizing pathways that translate raw operational data into
    actionable intelligence allows responsibly navigating lingering uncertainties.
    Thereby integrated policy efforts potentiate sustainable stewardship manifesting
    across technological capabilities, transparency norms, multidisciplinary competencies,
    digitization sequences, prevention-first mentalities and climate adaptation outlooks.
    6. Conclusions and future research In summary, the urgent global need for efficient
    water management in the face of escalating water scarcity concerns has led to
    the widespread adoption of smart water management telemetry systems. Despite the
    existing automation of water management and the wealth of data recorded through
    telemetry systems, there is a critical imperative to enhance data analysis for
    informed decision-making. Recognizing this, the development of an intelligent
    DSS has gained prominence for intelligent water resource management. This study
    specifically focuses on the design and implementation of a DSS tailored for managing
    the groundwater resources of Mashhad, Iran. Rigorous statistical and analytical
    methods were applied to a substantial dataset encompassing the effective parameters
    of 24 wells and pumps. The outcomes of these analyses established crucial thresholds
    and limits for influencing parameters. The RF algorithm, identified as the most
    superior among various algorithms, was then employed to create a robust forecast
    model in Python, accurately predicting water flow rate, water pressure, and current
    intensity in Mashhad city''s wells and pumps. Validation of the model''s accuracy,
    assessed through four descriptive statistical indexes, revealed values close to
    zero for MSE, RMSE, and MAE, with CPA approaching one, indicating a high level
    of precision in the soft-sensor. Subsequent steps involved field experiments,
    periodic check-ups, and the integration of empirical knowledge and operator expertise
    using the CD method. Delphi method outcomes were distilled into two algorithms,
    and the SE method was employed for the classification and ranking of information
    on pump performance and errors. The key findings of this study highlight the versatility
    and efficiency of the developed DSS: • Demonstrating effectiveness in predicting
    water parameters even when physical sensors are non-functional, the DSS facilitates
    precise monitoring and error detection in well and pump operations. • The smart
    prediction model eliminates the need for costly physical sensors and flow meters,
    providing accurate forecasts of effective parameters. • The smart management system
    amalgamates scientific knowledge, field test results, and operator expertise to
    function as a cost-effective professional operator. • Applicable in rural areas
    with limited management facilities, the system addresses resource management challenges.
    • The RF algorithm''s precision, especially in managing large datasets, underscores
    its superiority for water management issues. • The developed management system
    is versatile, applicable in diverse water studies such as surface water management,
    dam control, and water demand analysis. In conclusion, a key recommendation for
    future investigations from this study pertains to the utilization of intelligent
    metaheuristic computations for optimizing the performance of water distribution
    networks. Additionally, exploring the feasibility and benefits of an integrated
    solar renewable energy system to power the pumping process represents a compelling
    avenue for further research. Data availability The datasets generated during and/or

    sustainability; sustainable production 1. Introduction 1.1. Background on Soilless
    Vegetable Production Soilless vegetable production, encompassing hydroponic and
    substrate-based systems, has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional soil-based
    agriculture [1,2], particularly in regions with poor soil quality or limited arable
    land. Compared to soil-grown crops, this method can offer higher yields [3,4,5],
    efficient nutrient utilization, extension of harvest periods, and reduced susceptibility
    to soil-borne diseases [6,7,8]. In addition, the pressure of climate change on
    agricultural production is steadily increasing because of the reduction in freshwater
    availability [9,10], forcing producers to incorporate efficient production units
    such as hydroponic systems, which can aid in a context of limited water for agriculture
    [11]. However, a critical analysis reveals several challenges and considerations
    that underpin this growing field. First, if organic materials in soilless systems
    are not appropriately supplied to the crop, it can produce less robust microbial
    ecosystems, potentially affecting plant health and nutrient absorption [7]. Additionally,
    these systems often require a higher initial investment in infrastructure and
    technology, which can be a barrier for small-scale farmers or those in developing
    regions [12]. In addition, the environmental impact of soilless systems is still
    controversial; while they often use water more efficiently, the energy requirements
    for climate control and nutrient delivery can be significant [12,13]. Finally,
    there is a learning curve associated with managing these systems, requiring new
    skill sets that traditional farmers may not possess [14,15]. While soilless vegetable
    production presents exciting opportunities for addressing some of the challenges
    of modern agriculture, it also introduces a new set of complexities and considerations
    that must be critically examined. 1.2. Importance of Next-Generation Technologies
    in Advancing the Field The importance of next-generation technologies in advancing
    the field of soilless vegetable production cannot be overstated. These technologies,
    ranging from AI-driven analytics to precision farming and advanced sensing systems,
    can revolutionize the industry by increasing yields, reducing resource consumption,
    and enhancing overall sustainability [16,17]. Nevertheless, as stated before,
    incorporating new types of technologies comes with several challenges to overcoming
    the constant increase in food demand because of population growth [18,19,20],
    potentially exacerbating existing inequalities within the sector. In addition,
    regulatory concerns, such as data privacy and environmental impact, remain unresolved
    [21,22,23], raising questions about their widespread adoption. Additionally, the
    rush to adopt new technologies may lead to inadequately tested implementations,
    risking failing to deliver promised benefits and introducing unforeseen risks;
    therefore, while next-generation technologies hold promise for soilless vegetable
    production, their adoption needs careful deliberation and balanced judgment to
    address these complex challenges. 1.3. Objective of the Review Article This review
    article aims to comprehensively analyze the state-of-the-art technologies and
    methodologies in soilless vegetable production, focusing on next-generation innovations.
    This includes an in-depth examination of automation and precision farming techniques,
    sensing and tracking technologies, and the integration of artificial intelligence
    and data analysis applied in soilless horticultural crops, i.e., in aquatic systems
    and inert substrates (hydroponics), and cultivation with natural organic substrates
    [24]. The review also aims to identify these technologies’ advantages, limitations,
    and challenges. It offers a balanced perspective that considers their potential
    to improve yield and sustainability and the financial and technical considerations
    that may impact their widespread adoption. Furthermore, this article seeks to
    highlight gaps in current research and suggest directions for future studies,
    thereby serving as both a resource for practitioners in the field and a roadmap
    for researchers. In summary, the objective is to present a nuanced view that acknowledges
    the transformative potential of next-generation technologies in soilless vegetable
    production while critically examining the complexities and challenges of their
    implementation. 1.4. Methodology for Literature Selection and Analysis in Soilless
    Agricultural Technologies In the pursuit of a comprehensive review of the current
    literature on soilless plant production, we meticulously established a set of
    selection criteria to ensure the inclusion of articles that were not only thematically
    relevant but also contributed significantly to the collective understanding of
    soilless agricultural practices, with a particular focus on technological innovation
    and sustainability. Our selection process prioritized articles that offered an
    all-encompassing view of the policies, technological advancements, and practical

    on studies that delved into soilless cultivation methods, emphasizing hydroponics
    and related innovative technologies. Research discussing integrating emerging
    technologies, such as sensors, artificial intelligence, and automation systems,
    was deemed essential to capture the evolving landscape of soilless farming. Sustainability
    and efficiency were at the forefront of our selection criteria. Articles that
    examined the sustainability aspects of soilless systems, including but not limited
    to resource management, energy consumption, and environmental impacts, were considered
    critical for inclusion. Furthermore, we sought out case studies and real-world

    research areas within soilless agriculture. This included articles that provided
    in-depth policy and economic analyses, explored innovative technologies for enhancing
    plant growth in soilless systems, and discussed resource management strategies
    aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in greenhouse systems. Additionally,
    we included works that explored the concept of smart agriculture, such as the
    use of smart greenhouses and the assessment of solar energy, underscoring a growing
    trend toward precision agriculture and the adoption of renewable energy sources.
    We also addressed the challenges and prospects of adopting climate-smart agricultural
    practices, reflecting on the barriers to adoption and the potential for future
    opportunities. Case studies and practical experiences were also integral to our
    selection, providing valuable insights into the real-world implementation of soilless
    systems. Through this rigorous selection methodology, our review encapsulates
    a wide array of topics within soilless agriculture, offering a nuanced and well-rounded
    understanding of the field that spans from high-level policy analysis to detailed
    technological applications. 2. Hydroponic Systems 2.1. Overview of Hydroponic
    Systems Hydroponic systems are a method of growing plants without soil, extracting
    the necessary nutrients for their growth from a nutrient solution [25]. These
    systems have emerged as a cornerstone technology in soilless vegetable production,
    offering a range of benefits from resource efficiency [20,26] to optimized plant
    growth [27]. One of the critical advantages of hydroponic systems is the ability
    to precisely control nutrient levels, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and oxygenation
    [28], thereby optimizing plant growth and resources. Hydroponic systems are more
    water-efficient than traditional soil-based cultivation, making them an attractive
    option for sustainable agriculture. These systems can be categorized into several
    types, including Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and
    Aeroponics, each with unique advantages and applications. NFT, for instance, employs
    a thin film of nutrient solution that flows over the roots, powered by a water
    pump, providing a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen [29,30]. This system
    is particularly effective for leafy greens and herbs, which require less support
    and can thrive in these conditions. On the other hand, DWC submerges the plant
    roots in a nutrient solution, using air stones to oxygenate the water [31]. This
    system is well-suited for plants that require more support and a stable environment,
    such as tomatoes and cucumbers. Aeroponics represents the most technologically
    advanced form of hydroponics, where nutrient solution is misted directly onto
    the roots, maximizing oxygen exposure [27]. This system has shown promise in rapid
    plant growth and resource efficiency but requires more precise control and monitoring
    [27,32]. The main characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of these systems
    are detailed in [30,33]. 2.2. Recent Technological Advancements in Hydroponics
    Recent technological advancements in hydroponics have significantly transformed
    the field, making it more efficient, sustainable, and user-friendly. For instance,
    integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices allows real-time monitoring and control
    of key environmental variables, such as temperature and nutrient levels, facilitating
    data-driven decision-making [34,35]. In addition, introducing specialized LED
    grow lights has optimized plant growth through targeted light spectrums and reduced
    energy consumption [36]. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms
    are now being employed to analyze data and predict plant growth patterns and potential
    diseases, enabling preventive and more effective interventions [37]. Additionally,
    robotics has been introduced to automate tasks from planting to harvesting, reducing
    labor costs and human error [38]. Advanced water recycling systems have further
    increased the water efficiency of hydroponic setups [39,40], and new software
    platforms enable remote monitoring and control [41,42], ideal for large-scale
    operations and multi-site growers, setting the stage for a more efficient and
    sustainable future in soilless vegetable production. The main advanced technologies
    currently applied in hydroponics, along with their advantages and disadvantages,
    are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of recent technological advancements in
    hydroponics, highlighting their main advantages and disadvantages. As seen in
    Table 1, advantages and disadvantages are observed when incorporating technologies
    in the productive soilless system, which must be taken into account before considering
    implementing hydroponic systems. In terms of the advantages, hydroponic systems
    can be equipped with automation and sensor technology, allowing for remote monitoring
    and control [52]. This enables growers to make real-time adjustments to environmental
    conditions, nutrient delivery, and other parameters [53]. In this sense, the main
    advantages of the incorporation of advanced technologies in hydroponics are related
    to higher efficiency and optimization in the use of resources, being able to precisely
    control the delivery of water, nutrients, and light to plants, minimizing waste,
    and optimizing resource utilization [45,54,55]. In addition to this, hydroponics
    typically uses significantly less water compared to traditional soil-based agriculture
    [56], which can be especially advantageous in regions with water scarcity or drought
    conditions. Additionally, the controlled environment in hydroponics allows for
    accelerated plant growth [28], which means quicker crop turnover and increased
    productivity, providing a stable and controlled environment for plants, resulting
    in consistent product quality and reducing the risk of soil-borne diseases and
    pests. Finally, it is also important to consider that the local climate, market
    demand, and regulatory factors play a role in determining the extent to which
    advanced hydroponic technologies are advantageous for a particular agricultural
    operation. In this sense, when these technologies are well-planned and managed,
    they can provide significant benefits in terms of resource efficiency, product
    quality, and increased yield. Regarding the disadvantages of these technologies,
    several of them are mentioned in Table 1; however, the most common disadvantage
    is related to the high initial investment costs, which in hydroponic systems are
    mainly related to costs that include items such as grow lights, pumps, nutrient
    delivery systems, climate control systems, and specialized growing media [57],
    which are items that allow the construction of an advanced technological production
    system. These costs can vary significantly depending on the scale and complexity
    of the hydroponic setup. For instance, for large-scale hydroponic operations,
    the construction or retrofitting of greenhouses or indoor growing spaces can be
    a substantial expense, influenced by factors such as location, size, and design;
    however, studies such as [58] have tested the incorporation of technologies such
    as the use of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) to reduce operating cost
    and emissions, concluding that the final cost of cultivating lettuce under the
    established experimental conditions was similar to the cost of traditionally imported
    lettuce, which would indicate a high potential in terms of the competitiveness
    of hydroponically grown produce. Another disadvantage of incorporating new technologies
    in hydroponic systems is that they require technical knowledge and expertise to
    operate them [47,59]. This includes cleaning, nutrient replenishment, equipment
    checks, and maintenance costs. Finally, hydroponic systems often rely on artificial
    lighting and climate control, which can lead to high energy bills. These disadvantages
    highlight the need to incorporate cost-effective solutions that aid in lowering
    the final production costs, generating a more competitive final product, and fulfilling
    future needs for increased food production. 2.3. Impact of Hydroponic Systems
    on Soilless Vegetable Production The impact of hydroponic systems on soilless
    vegetable production is transformative, offering a host of benefits but presenting
    specific challenges that merit critical scrutiny. On the positive side, hydroponic
    systems are highly resource-efficient, using less water than traditional soil-based
    farming, which makes them ideal for regions facing water scarcity [60]. They also
    allow for a controlled environment where variables like nutrient levels and pH
    can be precisely managed, leading to optimized plant growth and potentially higher
    yields [61]. Additionally, these systems are particularly beneficial in urban
    settings where space is limited, thanks to their efficient use of space [62],
    especially when combined with vertical farming techniques [63]. Additionally,
    the reduced need for pesticides in these controlled environments contributes to
    healthier produce [45]. 2.4. Scalability and Replicability of Soilless Cultures
    In the current context of global warming, along with the increase in urbanization
    and the reduction in arable land, soilless culture systems need to be expanded
    or scaled up to meet the increasing demand or production needs and to maintain
    consistent plant growth and yield while increasing the number of plants or the
    size of the growing area [64]. Several cases have reported successfully incorporating
    technological advances to optimize plant production under soilless culture systems.
    However, a critical analysis reveals that these success stories may only sometimes
    be universally applicable and could sometimes paint an overly optimistic picture
    of the technology, given that some of these studies may have been conducted under
    controlled conditions or with significant financial backing, making it unclear
    how scalable or replicable these successes are for average farmers. In addition
    to this, focusing on success stories may overshadow the challenges and failures,
    which are equally important for understanding the limitations of hydroponic systems;
    therefore, while case studies and success stories offer invaluable insights into
    the capabilities of hydroponic systems, a more nuanced and critical approach is
    needed to understand their broader impact, limitations, and the conditions under
    which they can be successfully implemented. Nevertheless, recent studies where
    different factors involved in soilless production are assessed become relevant
    to generate a big picture regarding the future of this field. In this sense, considering
    that soilless production can be limited by factors such as the availability of
    resources such as water, nutrients, and energy, as well as the cost and complexity
    of the system [64], several studies have reported the incorporation and analysis
    of technological advances in hydroponic systems over different crops and over
    different conditions, to overcome the limitations. Such is the case of [65], who
    carried out a study to assess the effects of different nutrient solutions on the
    growth and weight of two lettuce cultivars grown in a floating hydroponic system,
    indicating that hydroponic production can be a cost-effective and easy option
    for organic vegetable production if the nutrient solution is managed according
    to the needs of the crop. In another case, ref. [66] compared an aquaponic system,
    incorporating three different hydroponic systems to assess their effect on tomato
    yield and morphological and biochemical impact quality, indicating that the choice
    of the system had little effect over those properties; however, the system that
    incorporated drip irrigation presented slightly better results in terms of higher
    oxygen radical absorbance capacity, indicating the possibility of producing fruit
    with a higher health value. A study by [42] analyzed the response of kale to liquid
    inorganic nutrients and different planting media in a DWC hydroponic system, indicating
    a high effect on chlorophyll content and yield when using specific combinations
    of planting media and liquid inorganic nutrients. In another study on kale, ref.
    [67] analyzed the effect of different nutrient solution depths on the growth and
    phytochemicals accumulation in this hydroponic-grown vegetable to assess the issue
    of low dissolved oxygen in a nutrient solution, indicating that there was a positive
    effect on kale growth when nutrient solution depth increased, where a 2-cm deep
    nutrient solution could promote kale growth, and 3-cm could have the potential
    of improving kale quality. 3. Substrate-Based Systems 3.1. Introduction to Substrate-Based
    Systems In the context of soilless vegetable production, substrate-based systems
    offer an alternative to hydroponic methods, providing a unique set of advantages
    and challenges critical to understanding the advancement of the field. Unlike
    hydroponics, which relies solely on nutrient-rich water solutions, substrate-based
    systems use inert media such as coconut coir, perlite, or rock wool to support
    plant roots [64]. These substrates serve as a reservoir for nutrients and water,
    allowing for less intensive management practices than hydroponics. This section
    introduces the fundamental aspects of substrate-based systems, including the types
    of substrates commonly used, their benefits, and the innovations shaping this
    method of soilless cultivation. As next-generation technologies evolve, substrate-based
    systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, incorporating automation, real-time
    monitoring, and data analytics to optimize crop yield and resource utilization.
    Therefore, understanding the intricacies of substrate-based systems is essential
    for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who are invested in the future
    of sustainable and efficient soilless vegetable production. 3.2. Substrate Materials
    and Their Benefits In the rapidly evolving field of soilless vegetable production,
    the correct selection of substrate materials is a critical development that offers
    promising benefits but also presents challenges that require thoughtful analysis.
    On the positive side, newer substrates, such as biochar, are sustainable and provide
    superior nutrient retention capabilities, allowing for more efficient fertilizer
    use and reducing the environmental impact of nutrient leaching [68,69,70,71].
    The advent of composite substrates, which combine different materials to optimize
    physical and chemical properties, adds another layer of versatility, offering
    tailored solutions for specific crop needs. However, these benefits often come
    at a cost—both literally and figuratively. Advanced substrates are generally more
    expensive than traditional options [45], making them less accessible for small-scale
    farmers. In addition, the availability of these new materials can be limited,
    especially in certain regions, which hampers their widespread adoption. Using
    new substrate materials also necessitates a learning curve, requiring adjustments
    in cultivation practices and additional expertise for optimal results. Moreover,
    while many of these substrates are promoted as sustainable options, the environmental
    impact of their production processes, including potential energy-intensive manufacturing
    and transportation emissions, should be considered [72]. An overview of some of
    the substrate materials in soilless agriculture is shown in Table 2. Table 2.
    Overview of Substrate Materials in Soilless Agriculture, Highlighting Their Main
    Advantages and Disadvantages. Considering those above, it is important to highlight
    that, in the field of soilless vegetable production, substrate-based systems have
    evolved to include various materials and technologies, each with its own set of
    advantages and drawbacks that warrant a comprehensive comparative analysis. As
    was discussed, newer substrates such as coconut coir and biochar offer superior
    water and nutrient retention capabilities and environmental benefits such as biodegradability;
    however, these materials can be more expensive and require specialized management
    techniques [45]. Technological advancements have also led to the development of
    systems combining multiple substrate benefits, offering tailored solutions for
    specific crop needs [64]. Furthermore, the choice of substrate can have implications
    for the system’s environmental impact in terms of resource use and potential for
    waste generation. In this sense, while there is no one-size-fits-all solution,
    the choice of substrate and associated technologies in substrate-based systems
    should be guided by various factors, including cost, management complexity, crop-specific
    needs, and environmental impact. 3.3. Innovations in Substrate-Based Cultivation
    Techniques In soilless vegetable production, innovations in substrate-based cultivation
    techniques fundamentally alter the landscape, offering many advantages but presenting
    several challenges that require in-depth analysis. Automated nutrient delivery
    systems, for instance, are a game-changer, given that these systems are designed
    to directly provide precise amounts of nutrients to the substrate, thereby eliminating
    the guesswork and manual labor traditionally associated with fertilization [80].
    The result is improved plant health and the potential for significantly increased
    yields, making this innovation particularly beneficial for commercial-scale operations
    [81]. Real-time monitoring technologies, often facilitated by advanced sensors
    embedded directly into the substrate, are another groundbreaking development.
    These sensors can measure various parameters, such as moisture levels, nutrient
    concentrations, and substrate pH, sending these data to a centralized system [41],
    meaning that growers can make immediate, data-driven adjustments to their cultivation
    practices, optimizing resource utilization. This is a monumental step forward
    in terms of both sustainability and operational efficiency. However, the energy
    requirements for running these automated and monitoring systems should be noted.
    While they may optimize water and nutrient use, they also require a continuous
    power supply, which could increase the operation’s carbon footprint if the energy
    is sourced from non-renewable resources [82,83]. 4. Automation and Precision Farming
    4.1. Role of Automation in Soilless Vegetable Production Automation is increasingly
    becoming a focal point in soilless vegetable production, offering transformative
    benefits but posing challenges that require critical evaluation. Automation technologies,
    such as automated nutrient delivery systems [80], climate control [16], and robotic
    harvesting [84], can revolutionize the industry by increasing efficiency, reducing
    labor costs, and enhancing crop productivity. These systems allow for precise
    control over various environmental factors, from nutrient levels to humidity and
    temperature, enabling optimized growing conditions that lead to higher-quality
    produce. The data-driven nature of these technologies also provides valuable insights
    into crop performance, allowing for timely interventions and more effective resource
    management. The application of automation technologies into soilless vegetable
    production has been observed in studies such as [85], which aimed to identify
    the optimal irrigation level in a microgreen production based on the use of a
    dielectric moisture sensor to generate a low-cost automated irrigation system,
    contributing to the automation of precision irrigation in hydroponically grown
    microgreens. In a similar study carried out by [86], a system for wireless irrigation
    management was developed and tested on soilless basil, concluding that employing
    a wireless sensor network to monitor substrate water conditions in real-time,
    along with detailed insights into how varying water availability impacts plants,
    proves to be a valuable resource for optimizing precision irrigation in soilless
    basil cultivation in greenhouses. A study conducted by [87] on an automated system
    for fertigation control in soilless tomatoes growing in a sand substrate under
    greenhouse conditions concluded that the developed control system could effectively
    adjust fertigation cycle frequency according to plant transpiration, reducing
    unnecessary applications under varying climatic conditions. Based on the above,
    it should be noted that while automation holds great promise for improving efficiency
    and productivity in soilless vegetable production, it also introduces financial
    and technical challenges that need to be carefully considered for responsible
    and long-lasting adoption. 4.2. Application of Precision Farming/Agriculture Techniques
    in Hydroponics In soilless vegetable production, applying precision farming or
    precision agriculture techniques to hydroponics and substrate-based systems is
    an emerging trend with far-reaching implications, given that precision agriculture
    is a tool able to generate an increase in production and quality, reducing the
    use of resources and its environmental impact [88]. These techniques, which leverage
    advanced sensors, data analytics, and automation, promise to optimize every aspect
    of the growing process, from nutrient delivery to environmental control. In hydroponic
    systems, for example, precision farming can lead to more efficient nutrient utilization,
    reducing waste and potentially lowering the environmental impact. Similarly, real-time
    monitoring can help fine-tune irrigation schedules and nutrient levels in substrate-based
    systems, thereby conserving resources and improving yield [89]. Several researchers
    have reported the use of precision farming applied to hydroponics. For instance,
    a study carried out by [47] developed a monitoring and controlling system for
    precision farming based on the IoT concept and fuzzy logic for the monitoring
    of water and nutrient needs of lettuce and bok choi, indicating that this monitoring
    system allowed assessing the needs of the crop in real-time, which translated
    into larger leaves for both crops. In another case, ref. [90] proposed an automatic
    management system on a tropical hydroponic system, focusing on reducing information
    exchange between sensors, obtaining a simpler system in data obtention and analysis,
    and aiding in managing hydroponic crops. In a study carried out by [91] on a greenhouse
    with hydroponic crops, a low-cost sensor based on IoT to develop control processes
    for precision agriculture was developed, resulting in a series of benefits related
    to cost, energy saving, smart development, and most importantly, an increase in
    acceptance by producers. Studying hydroponic saffron cultivation, ref. [46] proposes
    a novel approach to sensor selection, aiming to optimize crop cultivation in an
    artificial environment using technology, specifically IoT and sensors, creating
    an automated and controlled cultivation system. Given the above, it can be noted
    that implementing automation and precision farming techniques in soilless vegetable
    production presents a complex interplay of benefits and challenges that warrant
    a nuanced analysis. On the benefit side, automation and precision farming offer
    unparalleled advantages in terms of operational efficiency, resource optimization,
    and yield improvement. Automated systems can handle exact tasks like nutrient
    delivery and climate control, reducing human error and freeing up labor for other
    jobs. With its data-driven approach, precision farming allows for real-time adjustments
    to various growth parameters, leading to more efficient use of resources, such
    as water and fertilizers. This can increase yield and make the production system
    more sustainable by minimizing waste and environmental impact. However, these
    advantages come with challenges that must be addressed. As mentioned before, the
    initial cost of implementing these advanced technologies and energy consumption
    can be significant, posing a financial barrier for small-scale farmers. This raises
    concerns about the extent of these benefits across the agricultural sector. These
    concerns need to be addressed properly and in a timely manner to fulfill the current
    need for an increase in food production in the context of a reduction in the cultivable
    surface and under the scenario of severe climate change. 4.3. Prospects and Trends
    in Automated Soilless Crop Systems In the field of soilless vegetable production,
    the prospects and trends in automated systems are both promising and fraught with
    complexities that demand critical scrutiny. On the optimistic side, advancements
    in the era of Agriculture 4.0 have been accompanied by technologies such as IoT
    artificial intelligence, data analytics, and big data, among others, which can
    generate tools that, in the end, can address issues such as food safety, data
    analysis, and improved crop management [92]. These technologies will likely make
    soilless systems more efficient, scalable, and even self-adaptive, adjusting to
    environmental variables in real time for optimized crop yields. Integrating IoT
    devices could further streamline operations, allowing for remote monitoring and
    control, which is particularly beneficial for large-scale commercial setups. Sustainability
    is another area where automation could make significant strides, especially with
    the development of energy-efficient systems and closed-loop nutrient recycling
    processes. These technological advancements have transformed traditional farming
    methods into automated systems, introducing a new era of agricultural innovation
    driven by the IoT and fundamentally altering how farming is conducted today [93].
    In this sense, while the future of automated soilless crop systems holds immense
    promise for transforming the industry in terms of efficiency, scalability, and
    sustainability, the adoption of these systems should be done in a way that is
    responsible, considering the social and environmental impacts of the system [15].
    5. Sensing and Monitoring Technologies 5.1. Importance of Sensing and Monitoring
    in Soilless Vegetable Production In the evolving landscape of soilless vegetable
    production, the importance of sensing and monitoring technologies cannot be overstated,
    yet they come with complexities that merit a critical examination. Sensing and
    monitoring technologies, such as soil moisture sensors, nutrient level detectors,
    and environmental sensors, are the backbone of data-driven agriculture [94,95,96].
    They provide real-time insights into various growth parameters, enabling timely
    interventions that significantly improve crop yields and resource efficiency.
    For instance, soil moisture sensors can help optimize irrigation schedules, reducing
    water consumption. In this sense, ref. [93] developed a cost-effective control
    system for the optimization of soilless crop irrigation through a prototype of
    an intelligent gravimetric tray that records the irrigation and drainage volumes
    and drainage pH and electrical conductivity (EC), as well as the temperature,
    EC, and humidity of the substrate. Regarding nutrient content, ref. [97] determined
    the nutrient content of hydroponically cultivated microgreens with a novel immersible
    silicon photonic sensor to determine the optimal harvest time. These technologies
    are particularly crucial in soilless systems, where the margin for error is often
    smaller than in traditional soil-based agriculture. However, implementing these
    advanced sensing and monitoring systems is not without challenges. The initial
    cost of these technologies can be a significant barrier for small-scale farmers,
    and the data collected by these sensors often require sophisticated analysis,
    necessitating a level of resources and expertise that some farmers may not possess
    [98,99]. Ref. [99] found that one of the barriers to the adoption of agricultural
    innovations by farmers is the level of learning investment, initial investment
    cost, and additional labor required when adopting a farm innovation, but also
    found that smallholder farmers continuously adapt to changing circumstances that
    affect their farming businesses. Age, gender, education level, years of farming,
    and involvement in off-farm activities are influencing forces on the adoption
    of new technologies. These factors could limit or boost the adoption of these
    beneficial technologies. 5.2. Advances in Sensor Technologies for Nutrient Management
    and Environmental Control In the domain of soilless vegetable production, advances
    in sensor technologies for nutrient management and environmental control are increasingly
    becoming pivotal, yet they introduce a set of intricate challenges that necessitate
    a thorough critical analysis. Cutting-edge sensors now offer unprecedented accuracy
    in measuring nutrient concentrations, pH levels, and environmental factors such
    as temperature, moisture, and humidity [100]. This level of precision is a game-changer
    for soilless systems, where optimal nutrient and environmental conditions are
    crucial for maximizing yield and quality. For instance, nutrient sensors can automatically
    adjust the composition of nutrient solutions in real-time, ensuring that plants
    receive exactly what they need for optimal growth. Ref. [101] developed an automatic
    system capable of performing water delivery automatically when the water level
    is less than a minimum predefined level and adding the nutrients automatically
    when the nutrient solution concentration is below 800 ppm, using a GP2Y0A21 proximity
    sensor as a water level detector and a TDS sensor as a detector of electrical
    conductivity of the nutrient solution. In this system, a servo motor turns on
    a valve in the nutrient container. To improve macronutrient detection for more
    efficient management of nutrients in crops growing in a closed hydroponic system,
    ref. [102] developed a system based on small, portable ion-selective electrode
    (ISE) sensors, which can directly measure the analyte with a wide range of sensitivity.
    The great benefit of this system is that it would allow the automatic sensing
    of nutrients in greenhouse hydroponics. Environmental sensors can similarly adjust
    climate control systems to maintain ideal growing conditions. These advancements
    significantly reduce the margin for human error and can lead to more sustainable
    practices by minimizing waste of resources such as water and fertilizers. For
    example, a researcher from Indonesia [103] built a simple micro-climate control
    system to control the temperature and humidity in a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse
    by implementing a fuzzy logic controller based on pre-defined thresholds. Similarly,
    ref. [104] presented an effective method that monitors and controls environmental
    parameters using sensors and actuators for tunnel farming and hydroponics, resulting
    in increased crop yield and water savings. A more comprehensive approach was taken
    by Chinese researchers [105], who developed an environment monitoring system for
    hydroponics and aquaculture applications. The system employed multiple sensors,
    including dissolved oxygen and water temperature, outdoor meteorological parameters,
    soil temperature and humidity, indoor temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide
    concentrations, and humidity of hydroponic plant leaves. The data from these sensors
    are then transmitted to the cloud, processed, and displayed to the user through
    a web platform and a mobile application to support hydroponic and aquaculture
    production management. Another benefit of using sensors was proposed by [106]
    to estimate the condition of hydroponic tomato plants in real-time; they developed
    an environmental control system with wireless sensors that supply the appropriate
    amount of hydroponic liquid for the tomatoes based on evapotranspiration, with
    errors of less than 3%. 5.3. Real-Time Monitoring Systems for Optimizing Crop
    Growth and Resource Utilization In the specialized field of soilless vegetable
    production, the advent of real-time monitoring systems for optimizing crop growth
    and resource utilization marks a significant leap forward, but it also brings
    forth a set of multifaceted challenges that require critical evaluation, considering,
    for example, that hydroponics necessitates more monitoring and micromanagement
    than traditional plant cultivation. Real-time monitoring systems, which often
    integrate various types of sensors and data analytics platforms, provide immediate
    feedback on a range of critical parameters such as plant development status, nutrient
    levels, moisture content, and environmental conditions [107]. This immediacy allows
    for dynamic adjustments that significantly improve yield and resource efficiency.
    With the aim to improve and automate the irrigation process of lettuce grown in
    a hydroponic system, ref. [108] proposed a real-time monitoring system that considers
    the use of IoT technology for sensing important factors of the nutrient solution,
    such as pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), temperature, and humidity. An application
    was developed that notifies the user of the abovementioned parameters and initiates
    irrigation automatically through a click on the app. A different approach was
    taken by [109], where the application of computer vision in a smart system for
    real-time monitoring, quality control, and condition assessment of romaine lettuce
    grown in aquaponic was researched. The proposed system uses image-processing techniques,
    image segmentation, deep learning, and regression analysis to estimate the size
    of the crops (growth rate) and then correlate it with their fresh weight, with
    the aim of using it in real scenarios to promote autonomous farms. In nutrient
    film technique (NFT), two key parameters that affect plant growth are pH and EC.
    To maintain these parameters within a set range, ref. [110] implemented a real-time
    fuzzy logic control for an NFT-based hydroponic system using an IoT environment
    composed of a wireless sensor network, data logger, and machine-to-machine actuators
    (pumps). With this system, they were able to stabilize the pH and EC values in
    less than 15 min. Table 3 summarizes different real-time monitoring systems, their
    advantages, and disadvantages in the smart farming agriculture field. The yield
    and success of a crop depend on the parameters measured by these sensors for the
    continuous monitoring of environmental conditions and the automation of various
    aspects of farming operations [111]. The advantage of this approach is that sensors
    are lightweight, suitable to be deployed in harsh conditions, and have improved
    accuracy, removing or reducing the risk of human error inherent to manual data
    capturing and allowing real-time monitoring and remote access when integrated
    into network gateways. These systems can contribute to increased plant growth
    [112,113,114], reduce water consumption [115,116], improve environmental and agricultural
    parameters [117,118,119,120,121], reduce manpower [122], allow remote monitoring
    [123,124,125,126], and function as an early warning system [127]. Additionally,
    IoT devices can allow increased automation of operations. However, real-time monitoring
    requires wireless connectivity because IoT devices are the building blocks of
    wireless sensor networks (WSN), which is not always available in farms or rural
    areas. Another significant limitation to the adoption of these systems is cost,
    which often prevents its adoption by small farmers, who have increasingly smaller
    profit margins, and also by larger farms, as the scalability of systems is not
    fully explored. The high cost is related to the degree of customization required
    for installation, research and development, updates and maintenance, and costs
    associated with data transmission. There are other technical considerations, such
    as the power source. In many cases, there is no access to constant power; therefore,
    systems depend on batteries and solar panels for their operation, so consumption
    and energy conservation becomes an important limitation. Multiple sensors produce
    huge amounts of data that require storage (locally or cloud-based) and computing
    power to be analyzed. This, associated with the lesser technical expertise of
    farmers, becomes a major setback to IoT-based monitoring [128,129]. Table 3. Overview
    of Real-Time Monitoring Systems for Optimizing Crop Growth and Resource Utilization,
    Highlighting Their Advantages and Disadvantages. 5.4. Case Studies Demonstrating
    the Effectiveness of Sensing and Monitoring Technologies In soilless vegetable
    production, real-time monitoring systems and sensor technologies have shown promise
    in optimizing yield and resource utilization, as evidenced by various case studies.
    Countless systems that rely on different monitoring sensors, such as for water
    level, pH, air humidity, air temperature, light intensity, CO2 concentration,
    soil moisture and temperature, and EC, among others, to then apply a smart decision
    workflow to control actuators, pumps, fans, lights, and other equipment with different
    levels of automation have been proposed and developed by several authors [143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155].
    However, while case studies often highlight significant improvements in yield
    and efficiency, they are usually conducted in controlled or well-funded environments,
    casting doubt on their generalizability to smaller operations. Additionally, these
    studies often focus solely on positive outcomes, neglecting to address challenges
    such as technical difficulties, ongoing operational costs, and data security risks.
    In this regard, the adoption of smart sensing and monitoring technologies is accompanied
    by security issues that can compromise farming operations, data integrity, and
    privacy. Small vulnerabilities can become cybersecurity threats, considering that
    smart farms are very interconnected systems and farmers have limited awareness
    of the risks associated with smart agriculture systems [156]; if someone exploits
    those vulnerabilities, it can create the potential to disrupt the economies of
    countries. These attacks can be at the data level (leakage of confidential data,
    insertion of false data, misconfiguration), at the network and equipment level
    (radio frequency jamming or signal disruption, malware injection, denial of service
    (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DdoS), Botnet or central malicious system,
    data transit attacks, autonomous system hijacking, node capture), at the chain
    level of supplies (third party attacks, software update attacks, data fabrication),
    or other types of attacks (unauthorized access, cloud computing attacks) [157,158].
    Another aspect is the energy requirements for these systems; if sourced from non-renewable
    resources, this could negate some of the sustainability benefits. Therefore, while
    real-time monitoring and sensing technologies offer groundbreaking opportunities
    for soilless vegetable production, their cost, technical expertise, data security,
    and sustainability limitations must be critically examined when implementing a
    new farm project for a more comprehensive understanding of their long-term viability
    and adoption. 6. Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics 6.1. Clarifying AI
    Applications in Soilless Agriculture: Beyond Predictive Analytics The advent of
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Analytics has revolutionized many industries,
    with agriculture being no exception. Integrating these technologies into soilless
    crop systems has opened a new frontier for innovation and efficiency. This section
    delves into the multifaceted role of AI in these systems, distinguishing between
    predictive algorithms and machine learning techniques and exploring their unique
    contributions to soilless agriculture. Predictive algorithms have long been employed
    to forecast various aspects of crop management, from nutrient requirements to
    yield estimation. These algorithms, which can be as straightforward as linear
    regression models or as complex as non-linear time-series analyses, serve as the
    backbone for decision-making processes. They are particularly valuable in soilless
    crop systems where precision and control are paramount. Machine learning, a dynamic
    subset of AI, extends beyond predictive capabilities to include classification,
    clustering, and reinforcement learning. In the controlled environments of soilless
    agriculture, machine learning algorithms leverage large datasets to uncover patterns
    and insights imperceptible to the human eye or traditional methods. For instance,
    neural networks may be utilized to predict plant stress levels, while support
    vector machines could classify the health of plants based on spectral data. However,
    it is essential to recognize that not all predictive algorithms in soilless crop
    systems employ machine-learning techniques. Various statistical methods and mathematical
    models rely on predefined rules and equations, offering a different approach to
    prediction. These non-ML predictive algorithms are crucial in scenarios where
    transparency and interpretability are necessary or data may be too scarce or noisy
    for complex machine-learning models. Furthermore, the application of computer
    vision techniques extends into the realms of robotics and cybernetics, which are
    increasingly becoming intertwined with AI in modern agriculture. In soilless farming,
    computer vision is not only used for static image analysis but is also integrated
    into robotic systems for dynamic tasks such as automated harvesting or real-time
    growth monitoring. As we continue exploring AI’s capabilities and applications
    in soilless crop systems, it is imperative to establish a clear understanding
    of the various technologies at play. This section aims to clarify by dissecting
    the roles and responsibilities of different AI applications and setting the stage
    for future innovations that will further enhance the precision and productivity
    of soilless agriculture. 6.2. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Soilless
    Crop Systems Artificial Intelligence (AI), referred to as the simulation of human
    intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that typically require
    human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making,
    and language translation, could revolutionize soilless crop systems by automating
    complex decision-making processes [159], optimizing resource allocation, and even
    predicting future growth patterns. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of sensor
    data to make real-time adjustments to nutrient levels, irrigation schedules, and
    environmental controls, maximizing yield and minimizing resource loss [160,161].
    Table 4 summarizes the main advantages and disadvantages of AI applications over
    soilless systems. Table 4. Overview of the Integration of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) in Soilless Crop Systems, Highlighting Their Advantages, Disadvantages, and
    Key Use-Cases. According to a great number of articles and applications of artificial
    intelligence in agriculture in general and in soilless systems in particular,
    the main benefits of this technology include increased efficiency, improved crop
    quality, reduced labor costs, better decision-making, and more sustainable practices
    [189]. The optimization of crop yields by efficiently managing factors such as
    water, fertilizer, and pest control is one of the main advantages of AI in soilless
    agriculture. This optimization leads to higher returns on investment for farmers.
    AI enables more precise control over irrigation and soil fertilizer application,
    resulting in higher resource use efficiency. For example, ref. [164] evaluated
    the performances of four bio-inspired algorithm-optimized extreme learning machine
    (ELM) models for predicting daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) across China
    and demonstrated that the values predicted by all ELM models agreed well with
    the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith values. This means that farmers can achieve higher
    yields with the same resources or maintain yields by lowering resource use, contributing
    to sustainable agricultural practices. Another benefit of AI is the reduction
    in pests and diseases by enabling early detection and diagnosis through image
    signal processing techniques [190]. This early diagnosis, such as identifying
    powdery mildew, allows for timely intervention and reduces the impact of pests
    and diseases on crops. Energy use is a key factor in modern agriculture, and AI
    can contribute to efficient management between smart greenhouses and soilless
    systems, allowing cost savings and improving sustainability. This involves the
    integration of various technologies, such as bio-inspired algorithms, automation,
    and dynamic pricing based on real-time metrics. Regarding automation, robotic
    systems driven by AI are being utilized for various tasks, including irrigation,
    harvesting, counting, and other mechanical farming processes. This automation
    not only improves efficiency but also reduces the labor intensity of farming operations.
    Additionally, AI-powered robot platforms can perform unsafe tasks such as toxic
    pesticide application and UV-C treatments to impede the spread of powdery mildew
    [191,192,193]. Taking into consideration the above, AI technologies, including
    bio-inspired algorithms and machine learning, enable precision agriculture. This
    precision ensures the accurate and targeted application of resources, minimizing
    waste and maximizing productivity. This leads to enhanced agricultural sustainability.
    By addressing challenges such as resource optimization, pest control, and energy
    efficiency, AI contributes to environmentally friendly and economically viable
    farming practices. AI is no longer just a research topic, as commercially viable
    AI technologies for agriculture are starting to appear [194]. This suggests ongoing
    advancements in the field, providing farmers with access to more sophisticated
    and effective tools for improving their farming practices. However, this promising
    frontier also presents several challenges that require critical consideration.
    One of the main constraints of AI implementation is cost, one reason being the
    expensive sensors (up to USD 1000+) [195], considering that in many instances,
    multiple sensors, cameras (RGB, thermal, multispectral), and other hardware are
    required, and for automation, actuators, fans, heathers, lightning, dehumidifiers,
    and motors are required. As was stated by [196] the cost of installation of AI
    systems on farms was enormous and out of reach for smallholder farmers. In contrast,
    larger farms can take the risk of absorbing this higher cost and are more willing
    to invest [197]. To implement these technologies, technical expertise is needed,
    as it can be complex and require specialized knowledge to implement and maintain,
    requiring greater computational resources. This can be a challenge for growers
    who are not familiar with the technology or who lack technical expertise. That
    is the situation in Europe, where the aging population and shortage of young progressive
    farmers raise concerns about technology adoption [198], considering that it is
    well-known that less educated and older farmers are less inclined to adopt precision
    farming technologies [197]. There are also obstacles to transferring this technology
    to developing countries due to farm size, less connectivity, reduced infrastructure,
    and economic issues, among others. Concerning predictive models, ref. [199] indicated
    that the absence of appropriate historical data poses a significant obstacle to
    the integration of AI systems in agriculture, which is necessary for accurate
    predictions and the training of AI and ML systems. Moreover, studies have suggested
    that the creation of algorithms for assessing greenhouse parameters should be
    calibrated with local conditions and specific requirements [200]. 6.3. AI-Based
    Decision Support Systems (DSS) for Optimizing Cultivation Parameters Using AI-based
    decision support systems (DSS) in soilless crop systems offers a transformative
    approach to optimizing cultivation parameters such as nutrient levels, irrigation
    timing, and environmental conditions. These systems can analyze large datasets,
    identify patterns, and make predictive recommendations, enhancing yield and resource
    efficiency [201,202,203]. AI has played a pivotal role in transforming agriculture
    and protecting it from various threats, such as weather, population growth, labor
    issues, and food security concerns. The numerous applications of AI in agriculture,
    including tasks like irrigation, weeding, and spraying, are often implemented
    through sensors in robots and drones. These technologies help conserve water,
    reduce pesticide and herbicide use, preserve soil fertility, and optimize labor,
    leading to increased agricultural output and improved quality [204]. In this regard,
    ref. [205] presented the development and implementation of a smart agriculture
    IoT system based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The system integrates advanced
    information technologies, including AI and cloud computing, with agricultural
    production to increase food production while reducing the consumption of resources.
    The AI model technique used in the cloud layer is DRL, which makes immediate,
    intelligent decisions, such as determining the water needed for irrigation to
    enhance crop growth. In an innovative way, the research by [206] discusses the
    results of an international competition focused on autonomous greenhouses that
    combined horticultural expertise with AI to improve fresh food production with
    fewer resources. Teams applied various AI algorithms, ranging from supervised
    and unsupervised learning to reinforcement machine learning, to control the greenhouse
    environment remotely. The use of AI demonstrated the potential to outperform traditional
    manual growing methods. To further optimize the operation of AI technologies for
    agriculture, ref. [207] proposed a novel approach using AI-based soft sensors
    combined with remote sensing models utilizing deep learning architectures. The
    study involves preprocessing techniques to clean missing data and remove noise
    from agricultural land images, with subsequent feature representation and classification
    processes demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and
    accuracy in agricultural applications. Building upon these foundations and discussing
    the diversity of AI-based DSS and their specific applications in soilless crop
    systems is crucial. AI-based DSS vary significantly in complexity and function,
    from simple regression models to sophisticated deep learning algorithms capable
    of strategic planning and real-time adaptive management. For example, while some
    DSS may employ traditional statistical methods for short-term forecasting, others
    leverage complex neural networks for comprehensive analysis and long-term planning.
    These systems are tailored to the unique needs of soilless operations, considering
    factors like production scale, crop types, and automation levels. Moreover, integrating
    AI-based DSS in soilless agriculture goes beyond mere data analysis; it encompasses
    the entire decision-making process, from data collection and preprocessing to
    action implementation. This holistic approach ensures that every soilless farming
    operation is optimized for efficiency and sustainability. In conclusion, AI-based
    DSS are indispensable in soilless crop systems, providing a level of analysis
    and foresight that is unparalleled. These systems not only contribute to more
    sustainable and productive farming practices but also represent a significant
    advancement in the field of precision agriculture. Our discussion aims to clearly
    understand the diverse and powerful AI techniques that drive decision-making in
    soilless agriculture, addressing the specific needs and challenges of this innovative
    farming approach [208]. 6.4. Potential Challenges and Ethical Considerations in
    AI-Driven Cultivation However, some related aspects must be considered when analyzing
    this technological advancement. First, the effectiveness of AI-based decision
    support systems depends on the quality and quantity of data they are trained on.
    The potential for algorithmic bias also exists, especially if the data used to
    train these systems do not represent diverse growing conditions and crop types.
    Poorly trained systems can lead to incorrect recommendations, potentially harming
    crop yield and wasting resources [209,210,211]. Second, the technical complexity
    of AI systems often requires specialized expertise to set up, operate, and interpret,
    creating a knowledge barrier for some farmers [212]. Third, the ethical issue
    regarding the use of AI in agricultural production has gained great interest over
    the past few years, which can be related to concerns about issues derived from
    inadequate design and setup of intelligent systems, which could lead to negative
    outcomes in agricultural production, such as violations of farmers’ privacy and
    harm to animal welfare due to the incorporation of robotic technologies, among
    others [213,214,215]. In this sense, the increased reliance on digital technology
    introduces new vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to cyberattacks, including
    data breaches and unauthorized system manipulation, that could compromise the
    data and have severe consequences for individual farmers and the broader food
    supply [216,217,218]. Therefore, while AI-based decision support systems hold
    immense promise for optimizing cultivation parameters in soilless agriculture,
    they also present challenges related to cost, data quality, expertise, and security
    that must be critically evaluated. 7. Environmental Sustainability and Resource
    Management 7.1. Role of Next-Generation Technologies in Enhancing Sustainability
    Next-generation technologies, including AI, real-time monitoring systems, precision
    agriculture, and predictive analytics, as detailed in Table 5, promise to enhance
    sustainability in soilless vegetable production. These technologies can optimize
    resource and energy use, reduce waste, and improve yield, contributing to economic
    and environmental sustainability [219]. For example, new applications of existing
    technologies, such as AI and mathematical models, have been successfully applied
    to predict energy consumption in agricultural applications, facilitating the evaluation
    of each production component and reducing CO2 emissions [220]. Additionally, real-time
    monitoring can facilitate precise irrigation and nutrient delivery, minimizing
    water and fertilizer use, such as in [221], where they developed an irrigation
    control system for soilless culture based on a proportional integral derivative
    (PID) algorithm that allows fully automatic operation with a minimum set of variables,
    calculating the average daily leaching fractions reasonably well, to reduce the
    cost. In [222], a review of IoT implementations for real-time monitoring, control,
    and management in aquaponics (a closed-loop soilless farming method) is presented.
    The importance of monitoring water variables is highlighted, such as water level,
    temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrification, nitrites, electrical
    conductivity, total dissolved solids, salinity, and water hardness, and environmental
    variables, such as light intensity, relative humidity, air temperature, media
    moisture, and CO2. In addition, the study discusses wireless monitoring with the
    integration of sensors and communication technologies and the implementation of
    machine learning techniques. A key point to precise irrigation in this closed
    system is the estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc). In this regard, ref.
    [223] generated artificial neural networks (ANN), utilizing climate data from
    sensors (air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation) and calculated
    inputs (crop coefficient and net radiation) and inputs from time and space (day
    of year, days after planting, and extraterrestrial radiation), to create models
    for ETc estimation for tomato (cv. Duru) plants grown in two substrates (perlite
    and coco fiber) in an unheated plastic greenhouse. When the models generated were
    compared to traditional methodologies, such as FAO Penman–Monteith (PM) and Hargreaves
    (HG) equations, it was found that even with limited data, ANN models predicted
    ETc better than classic equations, requiring only temperature and humidity sensors.
    This is because, in certain climatic conditions, PM and HG equations can overestimate
    or underestimate ETc, as has been evidenced by several authors [224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233].
    Searching for similar results, ref. [234] followed a dynamic Bayesian approach
    to modeling crop coefficient (Kr) and predicting crop ET for greenhouse sweet
    basil grown in a soilless substrate, using input data from sensors measuring temperature,
    global radiation, and crop weight connected to a lightweight IoT client operating
    in real-time. The results showed that the Kr approach predicts crop evapotranspiration
    with much higher accuracy than the Baille-based ET (a simplified version of the
    PM equation proposed by [235] for greenhouses) approach. Table 5. Overview of
    the Role of Next-Generation Technologies in Enhancing Sustainability.            However,
    there are also potential limitations that need to be addressed in the context
    of soilless farming. A recurring problem with these technologies is the high initial
    cost of implementation [257,258]. Additionally, accessibility to these technologies
    in rural areas may pose challenges because communication infrastructure (cellular
    connectivity, internet) is not always available [259]. When these technologies
    are implemented in real operating environments, their integration can be complex
    because interoperability is not well established, mainly because an area is still
    in development with much research being conducted in parallel. Therefore, ensuring
    seamless integration and interoperability among these technologies is crucial
    for their effective functioning [260,261]. The energy consumption of platforms
    where AI, machine learning, and communications technologies operate can be a limitation,
    especially in remote or off-grid farming locations [262]. This can impact the
    sustainability of smart farming systems, particularly when considering renewable
    energy sources. Additionally, renewable energy sources suffer from intermittency.
    For example, solar power generation is affected by factors such as time of day,
    weather conditions, and seasonal changes, so energy storage technologies, such
    as batteries, are a necessity [263]. AI and machine learning models depend heavily
    on data quality; hence, inaccurate or low-quality data can lead to incorrect decisions
    and recommendations in smart farming systems [209,264]. These data-intensive systems
    are susceptible to security breaches and privacy concerns among farmers [265],
    as was discussed previously. Solutions include ensuring diverse and high-quality
    datasets, developing explainable AI models, investing in secure communication
    protocols, addressing intermittency with energy storage, and investing in research
    to make this technology more available. Additionally, there is a need for government
    support, subsidies, and education programs to make these technologies more accessible
    to farmers, promoting widespread adoption in the agricultural sector [266]. 7.2.
    Efficient Water and Nutrient Management Strategies Efficient water and nutrient
    management strategies are pivotal in soilless vegetable production, offering the
    dual benefits of resource conservation and improved crop yield, emphasizing the
    environmental benefits of using inorganic substrate (rock wool and volcanic tuff)
    and the reuse of nutrient solution (closed systems) to avoid water and nutrient
    losses [267]. Additionally, advanced sensing technologies, including smart irrigation
    systems and the utilization of surface reflectance data obtained from crop canopies,
    offer promising avenues for enhancing the efficiency of soilless farming systems.
    Utilizing cloud-connected wireless sensor networks to monitor real-time substrate
    water status in basil [87] was able to automate irrigation and allowed assessment
    of the physiological responses of plants to different water availability levels
    in the growing substrate. For efficient crop management, detecting early signs
    of water deficit stress is crucial. In this sense, non-contact techniques for
    detecting changes in spectral reflectance have been used successfully for monitoring
    the water status of crops, as in tomatoes, where [239] found that crop reflectance
    increased with increasing water deficit or in [268], where spectral reflectance
    indices (SRI) allowed estimating the midday stem water potential in grapevines
    with great success. This demonstrates that smart irrigation systems are valuable
    instruments for precision irrigation management in soilless crop cultivation within
    greenhouses. When coupled with precise data regarding the impact of different
    water availability levels on plant growth, these systems offer a powerful solution
    for optimizing crop irrigation. These precision agricultural techniques rely on
    real-time assessments of crop water demands rather than adhering to rigid watering
    schedules. As a result, they hold significant potential for optimizing water and
    nutrient utilization within soilless farming setups [267]. Technologies such as
    drip irrigation systems and nutrient film techniques can significantly reduce
    water usage, while real-time monitoring and AI-driven decision support systems
    can optimize nutrient delivery [267,269,270,271,272]. Traditional EC and pH sensors
    provide insufficient information about ion imbalances in hydroponic solutions,
    which can lead to nutrient wastage or reduced yields. Therefore, the use of on-site
    ion monitoring systems based on ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) that can automatically
    calibrate sensors and measure the concentrations of individual ions (NO3−, K+,
    and Ca2+) in hydroponic solutions [271] allows farmers to effectively oversee
    nutrient management in reused solutions by promptly identifying any imbalances
    that may arise in the nutrient ratios has been proposed. However, these advancements
    are not without challenges. The initial cost of implementing these technologies
    can be prohibitive for small-scale farmers, raising concerns about their access
    [273,274]. Moreover, the effectiveness of these strategies is highly dependent
    on accurate data and specialized expertise for system calibration and maintenance,
    which could be barriers for some growers. There is also the risk of over-reliance
    on technology, potentially reducing manual monitoring and adjustments vigilance.
    Other considerations also come into play, particularly regarding data privacy
    and ownership, as many of these systems require cloud-based data storage and third-party
    analytics platforms [275]. Additionally, while these strategies aim to be sustainable,
    the energy requirements for operating advanced water and nutrient management systems
    could offset some environmental benefits if the energy is sourced from non-renewable
    resources [276,277]. 7.3. Energy-Saving Techniques in Soilless Vegetable Production
    Energy-saving techniques, such as solar panels, energy-efficient lighting, and
    automated climate control systems, are increasingly integrated into soilless vegetable
    production to reduce operational costs and environmental impact. These technologies
    can significantly lower energy consumption and increase performance, thereby contributing
    to the sustainability of soilless farming practices [278,279,280,281,282]. The
    majority of current greenhouses utilize conventional materials on the facade and
    traditional technologies for heating, cooling, ventilation, air-conditioning,
    lighting, energy generation, and storage; therefore, by simply changing the design
    and materials of the greenhouse with novel energy-efficient, low-cost, and eco-friendly
    solutions, such as semi-transparent PV modules, vertical ground heat exchangers,
    solar assisted heat pump systems, windcatchers, vacuum tube windows, blue and
    red LEDs for lighting, among others, farmers can minimize their cost of cultivation
    and, thus, maximize their profits, with payback periods from 4 to 8 years [280].
    However, adopting these energy-saving techniques is fraught with challenges that
    warrant critical analysis. Cost: the initial investment required for these technologies
    can be substantial, making it difficult for small-scale or financially constrained
    farmers to adopt them. Applicability: the effectiveness of these energy-saving
    techniques often depends on geographic and climatic factors; for example, solar
    panels may be less effective in regions with limited sunlight [283]. Reconversion:
    the transition to energy-efficient systems may require a reconfiguration of existing
    setups, which could be both labor-intensive and technically challenging. Specialized
    knowledge: while these techniques aim to reduce energy consumption, they often
    require a certain level of technical expertise for installation and maintenance
    [284,285], potentially creating a barrier for less tech-savvy farmers. Lastly,
    sustainability: the push for energy efficiency should be balanced with other sustainability
    considerations, such as water use and waste management, which are equally critical
    in soilless vegetable production [286,287]. 7.4. Life Cycle Assessment and Eco-Friendly
    Practices Life cycle assessment (LCA) and eco-friendly practices are becoming
    increasingly important in soilless vegetable production to evaluate the environmental
    impact of various cultivation methods and technologies. LCA provides a comprehensive
    environmental footprint analysis, from resource extraction to waste management,
    offering valuable insights into areas for improvement [288,289,290,291,292,293].
    Eco-friendly practices, such as using organic substrates and renewable energy
    sources, aim to minimize this footprint. For example, ref. [289], reviewing substrates
    for use in urban farming, found that perlite has the highest environmental impact
    because it is a material obtained from open-pit mines, which necessitates substantial
    energy consumption and a lengthy transportation process. Moreover, horticultural
    and fruit crops are typically regarded as highly intensive and frequently require
    numerous inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides, and various other materials,
    and the benefit of one cropping system over another cannot always be established,
    as was described by [292] in strawberry cultivated in a traditional mulched soil
    tunnel versus a soilless tunnel system, concluding that, in general terms, the
    tunnel exploits more land and crop inputs (excluding pesticides), while the soilless,
    more technology and building materials, thus, making it difficult to establish
    which system is more environmentally sustainable. As stated, these analyses can
    be challenging, especially for smallholder farmers. Conducting a thorough LCA
    can be resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise and access to extensive
    data, which may be prohibitive or nonexistent. Eco-friendly practices often involve
    an upfront investment, raising concerns about cost and access to sustainable technologies.
    While these practices aim to be environmentally sustainable, their effectiveness
    can vary depending on local conditions such as climate and soil quality, which
    may limit their applicability on a broader scale. The transition to eco-friendly
    practices may necessitate significant changes to existing systems and operations,
    which could be costly and disruptive. 8. Future Directions and Challenges 8.1.
    Promising Areas for Further Research and Development In the context of soilless
    vegetable production, promising areas for further research and development include
    the integration of AI and machine learning for predictive analytics, developing
    more efficient and affordable sensing technologies, and exploring alternative
    sustainable substrates [65]. These areas hold significant potential for advancing
    the field by improving yield, reducing resource consumption, and enhancing sustainability
    [294,295,296,297]. However, several challenges and considerations accompany these
    promising avenues. First, focusing on high-tech solutions like AI could divert
    attention and resources from low-tech but effective traditional practices, potentially
    widening the gap between large-scale and small-scale farmers [298]. Soilless farming,
    particularly in the context of traditional crops like rice, soybean, and wheat,
    has seen limited exploration when integrating new technologies, e.g., artificial
    intelligence. Surprisingly, there is a lack of research dedicated to harnessing
    the potential of AI in these basic crop cultivation methods. Many existing systems
    remain in the prototype stage, and their practical application in real-world agricultural
    settings remains largely conceptual, especially within the confines of greenhouse
    environments [219]. Second, while the push for more sustainable substrates is
    commendable, the long-term impacts of these materials on plant health and yield
    are not yet fully understood and warrant further investigation [65]. Third, the
    drive for innovation must be balanced with cost considerations and accessibility
    to ensure that advancements benefit a broad range of producers, including those
    with limited resources [299,300]. Fourth, as research delves into increasingly
    specialized areas, there is a risk of creating solutions that are so tailored
    that they cannot be easily adapted for broader applications. Finally, all new
    technologies and practices must be evaluated for their immediate benefits and
    long-term sustainability, including their environmental, social, and economic
    impacts [301]. 8.2. Regulatory and Policy Considerations for Next-Generation Technologies
    In the context of the rapid advancement of next-generation technologies in soilless
    vegetable production, “data and intellectual property of farmers” takes on a multifaceted
    dimension that intersects with privacy, security, and economic interests [302].
    As we integrate sophisticated AI and real-time monitoring systems into agricultural
    practices, these systems invariably collect and process vast data points [303,304].
    These data, ranging from crop health metrics to environmental conditions within
    soilless systems, constitute an asset central to operational success and innovation
    in modern farming. Farmers’ intellectual property extends beyond the traditional
    understanding of crop varieties or farming techniques. It now includes the unique
    datasets and proprietary algorithms developed to interpret these data, optimize
    production, and manage resources efficiently. The data collected through these
    advanced systems can reveal insights into the micro-level responses of crops to
    various stimuli, which, when analyzed, contribute to the macro-level strategies
    for improving yield and sustainability. However, the aggregation and analysis
    of such data also raise significant concerns regarding ownership and control.
    Who has the right to access, analyze, and benefit from these data? How can farmers
    protect their data from being exploited by larger entities that can process and
    utilize this information at a scale far beyond the individual farmer’s capability?
    These questions underscore the need for robust regulatory frameworks that recognize
    the value of these data and the intellectual property they generate [302]. Regulatory
    guidelines must be crafted to ensure that farmers retain control over their data
    and their intellectual contributions to soilless agriculture. This involves establishing
    clear data governance policies that address consent, access rights, and the distribution
    of benefits derived from data use. Moreover, these guidelines must safeguard against
    unauthorized use of data, prevent data breaches, and ensure that farmers’ data
    are not used in ways that could harm their competitive position or violate their
    privacy [303,304]. As we consider integrating new materials, energy sources, and
    potentially genetically modified crops into soilless farming systems, the scope
    of intellectual property also expands. It now encompasses the innovative use of
    alternative substrates, the development of crops specifically tailored to soilless
    conditions, and the creation of new technologies for energy efficiency [305,306].
    Each area brings with it the need for updated safety and environmental impact
    assessments and the potential for new patents and trademarks. Standardization
    efforts are critical to ensure that these new technologies can be seamlessly integrated
    with existing systems, but they must be balanced to protect farmers’ intellectual
    property rights [307]. Without such protections, there is a risk that the benefits
    of innovation will accrue only to those with the resources to exploit them, potentially
    widening the gap between large-scale operations and smaller, resource-constrained
    farmers. Furthermore, access to technology is a pressing concern [303]. Policies
    must be designed to ensure that all farmers, regardless of scale, can benefit
    from technological advancements. This includes considering the potential impacts
    of technology adoption, such as job displacement due to automation [308]. Policy
    frameworks must protect data and intellectual property and address the socioeconomic
    impacts of technology adoption, ensuring that the transition to more advanced
    systems is just and inclusive. 8.3. Potential Limitations and Hurdles to Widespread
    Adoption Several limitations temper the potential for widespread adoption of next-generation
    technologies in soilless vegetable production (Table 6). First and foremost is
    the cost issue; the initial investment for implementing advanced technologies
    such as AI-driven monitoring systems, precision farming techniques, new materials,
    and alternative substrates can be prohibitively expensive for small-scale farmers.
    This financial barrier risks creating a technological divide in the industry,
    where only well-funded operations can afford to adopt these innovations [309].
    Second, there is the challenge of technical complexity; the operation and maintenance
    of advanced systems often require specialized skills and training, which could
    be a significant hurdle for less tech-savvy farmers [310]. Third, the effectiveness
    of these technologies can be influenced by various external factors such as climate,
    geographic location, and market demand, limiting their applicability in certain
    contexts [311]. Fourth, regulatory considerations, including data privacy and
    potential job displacement [303,312], could slow down the rate of adoption. Fifth,
    if not sourced sustainably, the energy requirements for some of these technologies
    could offset the environmental benefits they aim to provide [313,314]. Lastly,
    there is the issue of social acceptance; farmers and consumers may be hesitant
    to embrace these technologies due to concerns about safety or data security considerations
    [315]. Table 6. Overview of Potential Limitations and Hurdles to Widespread Adoption
    of Soilless Agriculture, Highlighting Their Impact, Possible Solutions, and Areas
    Affected. To address the limitations and hurdles to the widespread adoption of
    soilless agriculture, several strategic approaches and solutions can be considered,
    such as providing farmers with the necessary knowledge and training to adopt soilless
    agriculture techniques effectively through education [333,334]. Providing financial
    incentives such as grants, subsidies, and tax breaks for farmers and businesses
    to adopt soilless agriculture can help offset initial setup costs and encourage
    investment in this method, especially for smallholder farmers [335,336]. Developing
    supportive policies and regulations that recognize and promote soilless agriculture
    can create an enabling environment for its adoption [337]. This includes zoning
    regulations, water usage policies, and agricultural subsidies designed to support
    soilless farming. The introduction of automation in farming systems can optimize
    power consumption. By introducing automated systems and technologies, farmers
    can reduce energy consumption while maintaining or even increasing yield efficiency
    [338]. The aforementioned, together with the integration of alternative power,
    such as renewable energy sources, allows for the reduction of energy consumption
    and environmental impact. Research has shown that soilless cultivation optimally
    utilizes water, fertilizer, and land resources, achieving efficiencies of 90%,
    70%, and 75%, respectively. Soilless agriculture uses water more efficiently than
    traditional soil-based farming, as the water and nutrient solutions are recirculated,
    reducing overall water consumption. By eliminating soil disturbance, it alleviates
    land pressure and degradation while facilitating year-round crop intensification.
    This method complements traditional soil-based farming, diminishes the adverse
    effects of agrochemicals on the environment, addresses climate change, and enhances
    productivity in arid regions [5]. Educating farmers, agricultural communities,
    and the general public about these benefits and techniques of soilless agriculture
    is crucial for its social acceptance [339]. This can be achieved through workshops,
    seminars, and educational campaigns. Highlighting the advantages, such as higher
    yields, efficient water usage, and reduced environmental impact, can help increase
    awareness and understanding. 9. Conclusions and Final Remarks This research paper
    provides a thorough and balanced investigation into the role of next-generation
    technologies in soilless vegetable production, emphasizing both their revolutionary
    capabilities and the multifaceted challenges that limit their widespread adoption.
    It addresses the financial barriers that could create a technological divide,
    favoring well-funded operations over small-scale farmers. The paper also critically
    examines the technical complexities that necessitate specialized skills, thereby
    widening the existing knowledge gap among farmers. While the paper is strong in
    discussing potential impacts, such as data privacy and job displacement, it could
    benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the regulatory frameworks and international
    trade regulations that may need to be revised to accommodate these innovations.
    Ongoing work in this field should prioritize the development of cost-effective
    technologies and educational programs to make these advancements more accessible.
    Future research should also focus on the long-term environmental sustainability
    of these technologies, as well as a more granular understanding of their implications.
    By addressing these critical areas, this research can contribute to a more holistic
    understanding of the challenges and opportunities, facilitating the implementation
    of next-generation technologies in soilless vegetable production. Author Contributions

    Safety and Security Chapter © 2019 1 Introduction According to a United Nations
    report, 1 the world population is expected to rise by 9.8 billion by 2050 and
    11.2 billion by 2100. As the world’s population rises, the need for agricultural
    goods will explode over the next few decades. To meet people’s needs, agricultural
    production must be massively increased. We need a strategic approach to improving
    crop production, efficient crop supply chain management, and product quality management
    to limit the adverse impact on people''s health and the environment. The main
    goals of the agriculture sector are: Quality of production and quantity. Resource
    utilization and agricultural process efficiency. Secured supply chain management.
    Optimal cultivation cost. Reduction of wastage. Time efficiency. Environment friendly.
    To achieve these goals, the agricultural sector is adapting year by year. Trending
    technologies being used in the agriculture sector include Robotics, Blockchain,
    Big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) [1, 2].
    The revolution of Agriculture is given in Sect. 1.1. 1.1 Agriculture Revolution
    The first agricultural revolution, also known as Agriculture 1.0, began before
    the nineteenth century [3]. Farmers relied solely on manual labour and indigenous
    tools such as a hoe, sickle, and pitchfork for cultivation. The agricultural sector’s
    production of goods was deficient in that era. Agriculture 2.0 [3] started to
    increase productivity in the middle of the nineteenth century. Fertilizers, pesticides,
    chemicals, and mechanized agriculture machines, including tractors, were used
    in this revolution of agriculture. Agriculture 3.0 uses electrical harvesting
    machinery, information and communication technologies, embedded systems and software
    [3, 4]. Software, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Big data, Robotics, and Blockchain technology
    are all contributing to the growth of Agriculture 4.0 [3, 5]. 1.2 IoT, IIoT and
    AIoT Figure 1 shows the relationship between IoT (Internet of Things) [6], IIoT
    (Industrial Internet of Things) [6], and AIoT (Agriculture Internet of Things)
    [7]. Although IIoT and AIoT are related, there are also subtle distinctions between
    these two sectors. Firstly, the agricultural process and product entirely depend
    on the climate and environment. On the other hand, the manufacturing process and
    product partially depend on the environment and climate. Second, agricultural
    products are directly consumed by the human body so that it may have a bad impact
    on human health. So, agricultural products require utmost care about massive production
    and quality assurance. Third, agricultural development continues to lag behind
    manufacturing. Technology adoption in agriculture is slower than in manufacturing
    as shown in Fig. 2. From production to consumption, IoT devices play an essential
    role in IIoT and AIoT. However, there is very little development in agriculture
    specific IoT devices. The complex and heterogeneous nature of AIoT systems has
    resulted in many issues that must be resolved. These difficulties are about the
    following: The AIoT system''s security, privacy, and resulting data on the processing
    nodes and the communication channel. Techniques for efficient data management
    include efficient data storage and analytics. Interoperability of heterogeneous
    AIoT resource constrained devices. Scalability of the AIoT system. Reliability
    and availability of the AIoT system. Fig. 1 Relation among IoT, IIoT and Agriculture

    Full size image In this paper, we are focusing on the layer wise architecture
    of AIoT. The direction of this paper is from the generalized view of IoT and IIoT
    security to the specialized view of the agriculture industry, which covers technologies
    in the agriculture sector, areas that need to be focused on for research for further
    enhancements, and the current progress on agriculture. 2 Layer Wise Architecture
    of AIoT The layer-wise architecture of the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT),
    which is depicted in Fig. 3, is discussed in this section. The first dimension
    shows various hardware, software, and technologies used in different layers of
    AIoT. The second dimension describes the various attacks associated with each
    layer. Fig. 3 Layer wise architecture of AIoT and possible attacks Full size image
    2.1 Perception Layer 2.1.1 Perception Layer Components AIoT encompasses a large
    number of heterogeneous devices. These devices can send the data they have collected
    to the upper layer. The perception layer''s two elementary types of devices are:
    Sensors: Sensors are tiny devices that sense their surroundings [8]. AIoT mainly
    incorporates soil water content sensors, sensors for soil moisture content, soil
    electrical conductivity sensors, Ph sensors, weed seeker sensors, temperature
    sensors, and wind speed sensors [9]. Computation: The computationally capable
    AIoT devices are referred to as the brain of the AIoT network [10]. Numerous pieces
    of hardware, or processing units with CPU and GPU, have been developed to run
    IoT applications, including the Raspberry Pi family, Arduino family, Intel Galileo,
    Latte Panda, Nvidia Jetson nano and Beagle Bone. Similarly, various modest software
    platforms are developed to use this hardware and get AIoT functionalities. 2.1.2
    Perception Layer Security Issues This section discusses the various possible Attacks
    in the perception layer. Table 1 depicts the traditional attack prevention/detection
    techniques. Node capturing/cloning attack: Attackers passively obtain the information
    about the node, physically deploy a malicious node and actively perform the desired
    operations through that node [11,12,13]. Interference: Attackers can disrupt transmission
    between two nodes by encroaching on the sender and receiver’s transmission range
    [14]. It causes transmission delays and wastage of bandwidth. False data injection:
    Attackers can inject inaccurate information into the AIoT system to trap it in
    some undesirable tasks [15]. Booting attack: All the security features are not
    enabled during the booting of the system. Attackers can take the leverage of this
    moment and perform various attacks. So, we need to add some security features
    in the system to defend from this attack [16]. Sleep deprivation attack: The attacker
    involves the system in unnecessary processing or loop so that the node''s power
    is exhausted which causes the shutdown of the system [17]. Side channel attack:
    Instead of directly attacking the encryption/decryption key in side channel attack,
    the attacker observes the physical phenomena and then tries to find the key. An
    attacker can derive the key by observing the energy an AIoT device consumes [18].
    Malicious code injection: The attacker injects some malicious software/ code into
    the system and takes control of the system [19]. Table 1 Perception layer attacks
    traditional solution Full size table 2.2 Network Layer 2.2.1 Network Layer Communication
    Technologies Communication technologies are evolving day by day to achieve high
    data rates, high energy efficiency, low latency and broad frequency bands [25].
    The various communication technologies associated with AIoT can be categorized
    in several ways. Figure 4 depicts one of the categorizations. Cellular network:
    Cellular network is moving from 5 to 6G. The legacy generation of cellular networks
    are 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G. A brief discussion of the cellular networks is given below:
    Legacy networks: The 1st generation of wireless mobile communication systems used
    analog rather than digital technology. The other generations, such as 2G, 3G,
    and 4G, use digital communication technology. Latency, security and intelligence
    are significant drawbacks of these legacy cellular networks [26]. 5G: 5G (New
    Radio) technologies are 100 times faster than their predecessor technology, 4G.
    It is mainly designed for intelligent and secure communication over the network
    which is suitable for IoT, IIoT and AIoT technologies. From an IoT standpoint,
    some use cases of 5G include robotics, augmented reality, virtual reality, process
    control, augmented guided vehicles, and factory automation [27]. Long range networks:
    LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Networks) technologies often have minimal power requirements
    and are affordable [28]. Depending on the technology, they typically give communication
    ranges of 1 to 5 km in urban areas and up to 10 to 40 km in rural areas. LPWANs
    are appropriate for AIoT. Some operate in permitted bands, while others do so
    without a license. Among many emerging LPWAN technologies, LoRaWAN and SigFox
    are popular. SigFox: The SigFox technology aims to offer IoT connectivity across
    the ISM band at a low cost and power. SigFox can provide a high link budget for
    indoor coverage and cover huge outdoor areas using its ultra-narrowband signals,
    which are as low as 100 Hz [29]. LoRaWAN: In 2015, LoRa Alliance standardized
    it. According to the specifications, a typical LoRaWAN network involves the following
    elements such as end devices (EDs), also known as nodes, gateways (GWs), network
    servers (NSs), join servers (JSs), and application servers (ASs) [30]. Short range
    networks: In the IoT agriculture environment, short-range communication technologies
    can be used to create LAN/PAN. Bluetooth, WiFi, and Zigbee are wireless technologies
    that are short-range, have a low data rate, and are energy efficient. Fig. 4 Communication
    technologies for AIoT Full size image 2.2.2 Network Layer Security Issues This
    section focuses on the various possible attacks in the network layer. Traditional
    attack prevention/detection techniques are shown in Table 2. DDoS/ DoS attack:
    A denial-of-service (DoS) attack aims to disrupt some of the services of intended
    users [31]. DoS attacks can be carried out in the different layers of AIoT and
    employ many different kinds of methods. Attackers may also replace a malicious
    node with a legitimate node, depriving legitimate users from services. Multiple
    systems in distributed networks target AIoT systems in distributed denial of service
    attacks [32,33,34]. Phishing site: A phishing attack is carried through sending
    malicious or fake mail or site or both to the targeted user to get their credentials
    [35,36,37]. Access control attack: An unauthorized person can gain access to the
    network without permission and violate its integrity and confidentiality of data
    [38, 39]. Sinkhole attack: In a sinkhole attack, attackers accumulate large amounts
    of traffic in the given area that harms the actual data in the network [40]. Routing
    attack: In this attack, attackers derange the data packet in the AIoT network
    [41, 42]. Data transit attack: Intruders can intercept data while it is being
    transmitted over a network, jeopardizing data integrity and confidentiality [43].
    Table 2 Network layer attacks traditional solution Full size table 2.3 Middleware
    Layer 2.3.1 Middleware Layer Technologies Cloud computing: Cloud computing may
    give users customizable and shared resources [47]. Cloud computing offers various
    services based on data centres, including infrastructure services, platform services,
    storage services, and software services [48, 49]. Although leveraging the services
    of distant cloud servers improves the processing capability of AIoT devices, it
    generates severe latency and mobility issues. Edge computing: Edge computing and
    the cloud are complementary technologies but must be combined to enable design
    alternatives that fulfill operational and business objectives from the edge to
    the cloud. Edge computing is frequently used for content distribution and caching,
    while the cloud is used for computationally intensive jobs such as machine learning
    and digital twins [50, 51]. Fog computing: “Fog computing” or “Fog networking”
    is a network architecture in which a large number of end-user clients or near-user
    edge devices collaborate to perform tasks such as data storage and transmission
    that would otherwise be handled by central cloud servers [52, 53]. 2.3.2 Middleware
    Layer Security Issues This section concentrates on the various middleware layer
    attacks. Table 3 depicts traditional attack prevention/detection methods in the
    middleware layer. SQL injection: The attacker fires the desired malicious SQL
    query into the AIoT system and retrieves the pertinent data from the system [54].
    Man-in-the-Middle attack: MitM attack is carried out by listening to the traffic,
    intercepting it and altering the communication between two parties in a network
    [55]. Cloud malware attack: The main motive of this attack is to change/ reverse
    the services or block the entire services, such as changing/ reversing the data
    or blocking access to parts of them [56, 57]. Signature wrapping: An attacker
    contradicts the signature algorithm and can perform malicious operations to compromise
    data integrity [58]. Flooding attack: An attacker can launch this attack on the
    internet by flooding unsolicited data packets, disrupting the services of legitimate
    users [59]. Table 3 Middleware layer attacks traditional solution Full size table
    2.4 Application Layer 2.4.1 Application Layer Security Issues This section reveals
    various application layer attacks. Table 4 shows traditional attack detection
    and prevention methods. Data thefts: It becomes extremely inconvenient if someone
    receives unauthorized access to the data, and as a result, system secrecy suffers
    [65]. Malicious code injection: To accomplish their purpose, the attacker acquires
    access to the system and physically injects malicious code [66]. Sniffing attack:
    To force an attack on the system, the attacker installs a sniffer application,
    which allows the attacker to gather network information [67]. Reprogram attack:
    An attacker can remotely hijack the system [68] and put it in an infinite loop
    to exhaust its resources [69]. Service interruption attack: This is a type of
    denial-of-service attack. The attacker may shut down the server, switch the request
    to another server, or change the path of data packets in this attack [70]. Table
    4 Application layer attacks traditional solution Full size table 3 Blockchain
    Technology and AIoT 3.1 Basics of Blockchain Technology Fundamentally, Blockchain
    is a connected chain-like linear data structure that begins with a \"genesis block\"
    block and continues with each new block added to the chain. Every block may incorporate
    several transactions that are linked together by the hashtag of the previous block.
    A Merkle tree summarizes all transactions inside a block by generating a digital
    fingerprint of the entire collection of transactions, facilitating the user to
    determine whether the transactions are reflected in a block. Merkle trees originate
    by hashing transaction pairs repeatedly until only one hash remains, known as
    the root hash or Merkle tree root [73]. The block and block header structures
    are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Once a record has been loaded into the
    Blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. All other miner nodes participate
    in the validation process and attempt to find the nonce. Blockchain ensures few
    properties that are listed below: Decentralization: Decentralization [74] in Blockchain
    overcomes the problem of bottleneck and single point of failure. Improved Traceability:
    The timestamp field in the header makes Blockchain traceable [75]. Transparency:
    Each participant in the network has an equal right to access the Blockchain [75].
    Immutability: Transactions that are hashed and cryptographically protected before
    being inserted into a block. A sequential chain is formed by hash mechanisms connecting
    blocks. The preceding block''s metadata hash value always appears in one field
    of the upcoming block''s header, making the chain highly immutable [76]. Reduced
    Cost: Blockchain eliminates the need for third parties or middlemen. Public Blockchain
    infrastructure deployment expenditures can lower overall business costs [77].
    Fig. 5 Structure of block in Blockchain Full size image Fig. 6 Structure of block
    header Full size image 3.2 Blockchain Trilemma Blockchain trilemma contains security,
    scalability, and decentralization, as shown in Fig. 7. We can compare the Blockchain
    trilemma with the cryptographic security triad. The cryptographic security triad
    includes data confidentiality, integrity and availability. However, Blockchain
    does not ensure data confidentiality as Blockchain is designed for transparency.
    Fig. 7 Blockchain trilemma Full size image 3.3 Types of Blockchain There are three
    types of Blockchains:—public, private and consortium. The consensus process in
    the public Blockchain is generally incentivized. A single organization owns private
    Blockchains, while a consortium is a variant of private where more than two organizations
    participate according to business requirements. Table 5 distinguishes the above
    three categories of Blockchain. Table 5 Comparison of Blockchain networks Full
    size table 3.4 Smart Contract Smart contracts are programs that impose and execute
    the terms and conditions of a specific agreement or contract [78]. 3.5 Integration
    of Blockchain Technology with AIoT Blockchain alone can solve several security
    issues of AIoT that are listed below. 3.5.1 Data Integrity Once a record is successfully
    incorporated into the Blockchain, it cannot be amended. Every node in the network
    employs its private key to sign a transaction before sending it to other nodes
    for verification. The winner node that finds the nonce first is the validator
    and earns the reward [79]. 3.5.2 Data Privacy Blockchain on its own does not provide
    data privacy as it is not made for privacy. Transparency is a feature of Blockchain,
    which means that every node in the network has equal authority to read the Blockchain.
    We can achieve data privacy through some hashing mechanism of data [80]. Similarly,
    private and consortium Blockchains are also used for data privacy [81]. 3.5.3
    Trusted Accountability Each process can be uniquely identified and followed back
    to its origination. The data will be utilized for further investigation if suspicious
    activity is found in an entity [82]. 3.5.4 Fault Tolerance As a result of the
    Blockchain''s decentralized nature, the breakdown of a single node does not jeopardize
    the integrity of the whole network because all devices contain identical copies
    of all records. 3.5.5 Trusted Data Origin In Blockchain, a digital signature-based
    scheme is used to sign a transaction by a node [83]. The transaction is signed
    using the private key and verified using the public key. The transaction will
    be included as a block to the Blockchain if most miners concur that the signature
    is legitimate. 3.5.6 Removing Third-Party Risks No central authority or third
    parties are involved in a peer-to-peer decentralized system [84]. They agreed
    upon a single decision based on the consensus mechanisms. 3.5.7 Access Control
    The Blockchain smart contract can be used to define access control mechanisms
    for decentralized applications [85, 86]. 3.5.8 AIoT Network Information Sharing
    Basic storage costs will increase in parallel with the size of the AIoT network
    and information sharing. As a result, data sets are kept in remote origins, with
    a centralized server just storing references to these origins. Furthermore, Blockchain
    preserves the information set’s RIM (Reference Integrity Matrix). RIM’s integrity
    was ensured due to the immutability feature of Blockchains and RIM’s accessibility
    with all AIoT network devices in the Blockchain. When a certain information set
    is obtained from a source, the integrity of the information set can be validated
    by comparing it to the RIM stored on the Blockchain [87]. 3.6 Blockchain Based
    Solutions for Layer Wise Attacks Table 6 shows the Blockchain-based solution for
    various attacks in IIoT, which can be used for AIoT-based systems. Table 6 Blockchain
    based solutions Full size table 4 Recent Research in the Agriculture Industry
    This section addresses recent research in the significant agricultural domains
    that affect crop production and product quality. 4.1 Robotics in Agriculture In
    this era of smart agriculture, academic and industrial researchers are engaged
    in the development of harvesting robots [104,105,106,107,108], land preparation
    robots (ploughing, harrowing to break the soil clods into smaller mass, field
    labelling) [109,110,111,112], seeding [113, 114], sowing [115,116,117], weeding
    [118, 119], crop growth identification robots [120, 121], crop pose recognition
    and direction grasping [122] and pesticide application-based robots [123]. In
    this economic world, we need a cost-effective mechanism for the harvesting process
    as harvesting using manual work and is time consuming and tedious [124]. Additionally,
    many cultivation processes are seasonal and do not require manual labour all the
    time, which may cost a lot. Hiring the required number of trained manual workers
    during some cultivation processes is also cumbersome as most people are moving
    towards urbanization [125, 126]. Robots are a better substitute for doing that
    work in a cost effective and timely manner [127]. We need an efficient robot that
    can detect the maturity of the crop [120] and navigation [128] of the robot either
    with visual image-based system [107, 129,130,131,132,133,134] or GNNS based system
    [135, 136] and crop direction grasping [122]. In terms of accuracy and versatility,
    these robots have certain restrictions. As the behaviour of crops varies, so far,
    most researchers are engaged in developing the robot for the particular task for
    a particular crop. However, the current smart agriculture scenario needs multiple
    works from a single robot efficiently and in a cost-effective manner comparable
    to manual work. Similar to Industry 5.0 [137], 5th generation of agriculture requires
    a robot to collaborate with humans. The next generation industry, including agriculture,
    aims to take advantage of human being’s cognitive and reasoning power along with
    robots for tedious and repetitive work. 4.2 Crop Yield Prediction Crop yield prediction
    [138,139,140,141] is another area in agriculture that needs to be addressed for
    better decision making for farmers. Crop yield prediction also plays an important
    role in agriculture product supply chain management as it is required for future
    cost estimation based on market needs [142]. Crop yield is dependent on natural
    and non-natural phenomena [143]. Natural phenomena include environmental factors
    (i.e., region, climate, soil quality, water availability, disaster), climate change
    (i.e., temperature, wind direction, pressure, humidity) and crop behaviour. ML
    (Machine learning) and DL (Deep learning) based approaches are mostly used for
    crop yield prediction. Many deep learning techniques, such as CNN-LSTM [144] and
    Multispectral Crop Yield Prediction Using 3D-CNN, Attention Convolutional LSTM
    Approaches [145] and DeepYield (combination of ConvLSTM and 3DCNN) [146] have
    been utilized to access agricultural products so far. The author of [147] investigated
    wheat yield prediction utilizing ML-based algorithms such as decision trees, linear
    regression, ensemble learning, support vector machines and Gaussian process regression.
    However, a high level of forecast accuracy is required to migrate from Agriculture
    4.0 to Agriculture 5.0. 4.3 Weather Forecasting The agriculture sector heavily
    depends on climate change [148, 149]. Yields of agriculture may vary from region
    to region due to environmental diversity. Ground-based stations, satellite observations,
    and prediction models are being invented to monitor, predict, and estimate changes
    in weather and climatic conditions [150]. Authors of [151, 152] have recently
    employed various long-short-term memory (LSTM) models and modifications. The greenhouse
    revolution came in agriculture to protect the crop from climate effects to some
    extent [153]. However, there are several open research issues with the greenhouse
    approach, such as how to limit greenhouse gas emissions [154], techniques for
    management and control [155, 156] and how to reduce the energy required for greenhouse
    [156]. 4.4 Agriculture Irrigation Irrigation [157] is another non-avoidable process
    of cultivation. To move towards 5th generation of agriculture, we require an irrigation
    system that can measure soil moisture content and automatically irrigate the agriculture
    field according to the need [158]. Again, irrigation heavily depends on the region,
    crop type and climate in the upcoming days. Both excessive irrigation and less
    irrigation are not considerable, so we need a threshold for irrigation based on
    the particular crop and climate condition. Less irrigation causes less yield of
    crops; on the other hand, excessive irrigation causes water relocation, reduction
    in oxygen diffusion, and hypoxia. Soil water irrigation scheduling [159] can reduce
    the required water. Sensor installation is more difficult in coarse-textured soils
    than fine-textured soils, as they need sensors installed in zones with a greater
    concentration of roots. Previous investigations used time-stable representative
    positions (TSRPs) to establish sensor placement [160, 161]. Another question that
    needs to be addressed is determining the exact irrigation threshold according
    to the crop need [162]. Several works have already been reported in this direction.
    AMRS (Average Moisture Representative Surface) is proposed for drip irrigation
    to determine the soil profile’s average soil moisture of the wetted volume [163,
    164]. The surface irrigation system is developed by [165]. Authors of [166] have
    proposed a fuzzy control system for smart irrigation systems. Deep neural networks
    [167], Machine learning [168, 169], Sensor-based [170], and remote sensing [171]
    based irrigation systems are also in trend. 4.5 Water and Soil Conservation Water
    and soil conservation [172] is also an essential aspect of Agriculture 5.0. Humans''
    use of fresh water, even for agriculture, is very limited [173]. The author of
    [174] presented the DRAINMOD-DWR model for recycling drainage water. However,
    merely recycling solutions is insufficient; we also need a suitable strategy for
    the uses of water that takes into account agricultural needs. Several irrigation
    techniques have already been developed as a remedy for this problem. Soil conservation
    is another important issue in the next generation of agriculture as it incorporates
    soil erosion [175], soil pollution [176] and soil fertility [177]. The authors
    of [174] have recently analyzed the efficiency of soil and water conservation
    using a stochastic frontier function model. 4.6 Crop Leaf Disease Detection System
    Crop leaf disease detection systems are used to estimate crop quality and quantity
    [178]. Crop disease is a significant problem in the cultivation process because
    areas of infection can spread rapidly. There is a need to devise an efficient
    algorithm that can detect crop disease in an early stage so that the remedies
    can be applied earlier [179]. We found that most works are based on deep learning
    [179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186] and machine learning [187, 188]. 4.7 Agriculture
    Waste Management, Biofuels and Renewable Energy Agri-waste consists primarily
    of cellulose, lignocellulosic material, hemicelluloses, pectin, and lignin. The
    most traditional way farmers adopt to get rid of agricultural waste is to bury
    and burn the waste. Both methods harm soil quality, the environment, and human
    health [189, 190]. So, in this era of smart agriculture, we should have a rigid
    way to protect the environment and people’s health from Agri-waste. Agri-waste
    can be turned into energy, which can be used in manufacturing and agriculture.
    More study is needed to develop a circular system for managing agricultural waste,
    allowing waste conversion into biofuel and its subsequent use in the agricultural
    or manufacturing sectors [191, 192]. The training of farmers to solve the issue
    is another option, but the question of how to deal with farmers’ attitudes and
    how to dispel their traditional beliefs remains unanswered. Recently, criteria
    based Green Waste Management (GWN) was proposed in [191]. 4.8 Farmer Decision
    Making Improving farmer decision-making over which crop to plant, where to sell,
    what chemicals to use, and how much of each to use relies on factors such as crop
    type, existing environment, and the dynamically changing climate and is one of
    the most challenging issues facing Agriculture 5.0. It directly impacts the cost
    and yield of the crop [193]. Cultivation of the same crop on the same land for
    an extended period, as well as the use of excessive chemicals during cultivation
    [194, 195], may result in land infertility, which is undesirable. Again, in the
    Indian agricultural system, farmers are not well educated to make decisions about
    selling their crops in the market, including where to sell and at what price.
    To optimize farmers’ decision-making, we need an automated decision-making system
    that can assist farmers. 4.9 Agriculture Surveillance System Agriculture monitoring
    [196] is crucial from planting to harvesting to consumption. Therefore, it is
    very crucial to implement a reliable AIoT system to collect information from the
    farm, the processing facility, and the people working in the supply chain. We
    need a time-bound surveillance system for agriculture-specific products that can
    monitor the supply chain from farm to end consumer in real time to ensure food
    integrity from farm to fork. Next-generation agriculture calls for more advanced
    agriculture-specific sensors, transmission technology, compression and decompression
    technology [197], and detection systems due to the massive amounts of data that
    must be transferred by monitoring and surveillance systems in text, voice, and
    video. Again, the efficiency and resource limitations of AIoT devices are critical
    factors in any monitoring system. 5 Observations and Future Research Directions
    In agriculture, AIoT is very crucial for data collection. These data can take
    any form, such as weather data (i.e., Temperature, Humidity, Moisture, Air Pressure,
    Wind direction, Wind speed, Rainfall), yield prediction data, or surveillance
    data (image, video, or audio). These data will act as the fuel for analytics and
    future prediction. So, in the future, we require more advanced sensor technology
    to gather more precise data. Unfortunately, we still lack precise sensors for
    collecting agriculture-specific data. We require more advanced harvesting robots
    with accurate path planning and controller algorithms based on text data (Such
    as GPS data) or visual data. Detection of mature crops by harvesting robots is
    still a challenge. However, few works have been reported in these directions for
    specific crops with some moderate results. A summary of open research issues are
    outlined below: Agriculture specific sensor development. Automated harvesting
    robots with precise path planning. Detection of mature crops by the automated
    robot. Collaborative decision making of farmers and robots (Automated machines).
    Balance on the ecosystem. Strategies for maximizing the yield with limited resources
    without harming the resources. For example, excessive use of pesticides and chemicals
    on the land can yield better but may cause land infertility. Cultivating the same
    crop in the same land for a long period is another issue. Another issue that requires
    consideration is the management of agricultural waste. 6 Conclusion The growing
    demand for agriculture production due to the increasing population requires the
    security of AIoT data. In this era, Blockchain is a new trending technology that
    by itself solves many security issues of IIoT and AIoT. The immutability and decentralization
    features confirm the two most important security principles of the CIA triad:
    integrity and availability. We can protect the AIoT and IIoT networks from most
    attacks that may occur in the perception layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    and application layer by utilizing Blockchain''s decentralization, immutability,
    and transparency features that ensure data integrity, as well as non-breakable
    session key (SK). Although there is a traditional solution to solve all the attacks
    on different layers in the AIoT network, they do not ensure all the attack prevention
    by itself. On the other hand, Blockchain, by its features, solves many security
    vulnerabilities of AIoT systems. Remaining security issues not covered by Blockchain
    security features can also be prevented using small modifications in Blockchain
    technology, such as random immutable session key different sessions. Using a single
    technology to prevent all attacks also reduces system implementation costs and
    algorithm complexity (multiple algorithms for different attacks in traditional
    systems). In the CIA triad, Blockchain does not ensure data confidentiality because
    Blockchain is not made for that; instead, it ensures transparency. However, data
    confidentiality can be achieved through multiple levels of non-collision, one-way
    hashing techniques. Access control can also be restricted through the Blockchain
    smart contract that can never be altered by the attacker. A private Blockchain
    is another approach for limiting users, which automatically precludes most security
    attacks. Although Blockchain can solve many security attacks, some attacks, such
    as phishing attacks, are still not solved by the Blockchain. A few downsides of
    Blockchain are efficient consensus mechanisms for heterogeneous AIoT environments
    and reduced mining time. However, the mining time of Blockchain is taken as the
    advantage to prevent replay attacks in many literatures. In simple terms, Blockchain
    is a single technology with numerous features that can be used to secure AIoT
    infrastructure. Data Availability There is no such dataset used and generated
    in this research. Notes More detail is available at: https://www.un.org/en/desa/world-population-projected-reach-98-billion-2050-and-112-billion-2100

    1. Introduction The operation of modern industrial processes is greatly dependent
    on advanced control systems, the performance of which is critical for achieving
    process operating safety, production efficiency, product quality consistency,
    as well as environmental sustainability (Daoutidis et al., 2018, Christofides
    et al., 2013, Scattolini, 2009, Daoutidis et al., 2016). As an important component,
    state estimation plays a critical role in an advanced process control system for
    an industrial process. Specifically, state estimators need to be developed and
    implemented for industrial processes to provide real-time estimates of the full-state
    of the processes as needed for process monitoring and intervention (Duan and Kravaris,
    2020, Rawlings and Ji, 2012, Han et al., 2020b, Wu et al., 2020, Zhao et al.,
    2019). Typically, modern industrial processes exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics,
    which may be characterized by nonlinear first-principles models. If such first-principles
    models are accessible, state estimation can be conducted based on the nonlinear
    models directly (Rao et al., 2003, Yin et al., 2019, Ling and Kravaris, 2019,
    Yin et al., 2018). However, this type of methods is not without any limitations
    from an application viewpoint, and the reasons are mainly threefold. First, developing
    nonlinear state estimators is typically a more challenging task as compared to
    the cases when linear models are leveraged. Second, the operation of industrial
    processes is usually subject to various constraints on the process states (for
    example, the concentrations of reactants/products are always non-negative), and
    optimization-based estimation algorithms like moving horizon estimation are favorable
    for handling such constraints (Rawlings and Ji, 2012, Rao et al., 2003, Tang and
    Daoutidis, 2021). In such cases, the utilization of a nonlinear process model
    for state estimation can lead to a much heavier computational load as compared
    to the linear counterpart. More importantly, a first-principles nonlinear model
    may be unavailable (Wu et al., 2023, Çıtmacı et al., 2023). Also, even if the
    first-principles model structure is known, accurate model parameters may be absent
    in many cases (Tulsyan et al., 2013, Kravaris et al., 2013). This will also limit
    the development of a good state estimation system based on a first-principles
    nonlinear model. Fortunately, the above limitations may be bypassed by identifying
    a data-driven linear model which is able to accurately characterize the evolution
    of the dynamics of a nonlinear process (Kadali et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2021,
    Madsen et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2021), and then designing a linear estimation
    system based on the identified linear model instead. In the present study, we
    address a state estimation problem for nonlinear processes within an alternative
    framework on the basis of the Koopman operator. Koopman identification aims to
    establish a linear representation of nonlinear processes in a higher-dimensional
    space that can be utilized to predict the future evolution of the process state.
    Specifically, this type of approaches typically resorts to a nonlinear coordinate
    transformation from the original space into a higher-dimensional space, and leverages
    historical process data to establish a so-called Koopman operator that governs
    the temporal evolution of the lifted state vector in the new space using a linear
    model structure instead of a nonlinear one (Koopman, 1931, Mezić and Banaszuk,
    2004, Bruder et al., 2021). This way, the Koopman operator allows for designing
    linear decision-making agents for nonlinear processes by leveraging linear control
    methodologies, even in the absence of first-principles knowledge (Korda and Mezić,
    2018, Narasingam and Kwon, 2019, Kaiser and Brunton, 2021). Due to the favorable
    characteristics of this data-driven approach, Koopman identification has been
    a driver of the development of computationally efficient advanced control schemes
    for nonlinear industrial processes/systems. In the context of control, in Narasingam
    and Kwon (2019), a Lyapunov-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme was established
    for chemical processes by leveraging Koopman identification, and it has been demonstrated
    to be less computationally expensive as compared to conventional nonlinear MPC.
    In Bruder et al. (2021), an MPC algorithm was proposed based on a Koopman linear
    model for soft robots. In Korda and Mezić (2018), a class of Koopman linear predictors
    was introduced as the basis of linear MPC design for nonlinear dynamical systems.
    Offset-free Koopman MPC approaches were proposed to explicitly address the model
    mismatch arising from utilizing Koopman modeling (Son et al., 2022b, Son et al.,
    2021). More results on Koopman-based control can be found in Narasingam and Kwon,
    2020a, Proctor et al., 2018, Brunton et al., 2016, Peitz et al., 2020, Narasingam
    and Kwon, 2020b, Son et al., 2022a. While Koopman identification also has great
    potential to facilitate the design and implementation of state estimation schemes
    for nonlinear processes, less importance has been attached to Koopman-based estimation
    as compared to the control counterpart. For instance, a Koopman-driven Kalman
    filter was developed for nonlinear power systems in Netto and Mili (2018), yet
    this algorithm does not suffice when constraints are present. In Surana (2016),
    within the Koopman operator framework, a Luenberger-type state observer design
    was proposed for nonlinear systems, and the corresponding observability condition
    was formulated. In Surana et al. (2017), a Koopman-driven constrained estimation
    approach was proposed for nonlinear systems that can be precisely transformed
    into a bilinear form. It is worth mentioning that the approaches in Surana, 2016,
    Surana et al., 2017 did not take into account the circumstances when the exact
    Koopman operator is infinite-dimensional or is very challenging to be found, which
    significantly limits the application of such algorithms to industrial processes
    for real-time estimation. Based on the above observations, in the present work,
    we address a constrained state estimation problem for general nonlinear processes
    within the Koopman operator framework. Specifically, we consider nonlinear processes
    of which the operation can be subject to various constraints on, for example,
    process states and disturbances. The concept of Koopman identification is employed
    to establish a data-driven linear state-space model to describe the dynamic behavior
    of the considered nonlinear process. A model identification procedure tailored
    for state estimation is proposed by leveraging the extended dynamic mode decomposition
    (EDMD) (Williams et al., 2015). To account for possible constraints on process
    states and noise, a moving horizon estimation (MHE) algorithm is proposed based
    on the identified Koopman model. Owing to the use of the linear Koopman model,
    non-convex programming is avoided despite the presence of nonlinear process dynamics,
    and efficient evaluation of the optimization-based estimator is achieved. Two
    case studies are presented: (1) a simulation example based on a four-reactor chemical
    process; and (2) an experiment on a water-tank process consisting of four interconnected
    water tanks. By applying the proposed method, in each of the two case studies,
    accurate predictions of the process states are obtained using the corresponding
    identified Koopman operator, and the linear MHE estimator developed based on the
    Koopman operator provides good estimates of the actual states. Through the two
    case studies, we also illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in comparison
    to the existing conventional approaches. The contributions of this work include:
    • We propose a Koopman-based data-driven modeling method for general nonlinear
    processes for the state estimation purpose, which can provide infinite-step-ahead
    state predictions. This feature is a key enabler for data-driven linear state
    estimation of nonlinear processes — this problem has received less attention in
    the literature in comparison to the control counterpart. • We develop a linear
    moving horizon estimation scheme to efficiently handle constrained nonlinear state
    estimation problems for general nonlinear processes without requiring mechanistic
    models. This method is based on the identified Koopman model and are capable of
    handling hard constraints on process states and noise. • We present two case studies,
    including an experimental study on a water-tank process consisting of four interconnected
    water tanks, to illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework in comparison
    to the existing conventional approaches. The simulation and experimental results
    demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method. 2. Preliminaries

    the Euclidean norm of vector . is the square of the weighted norm of vector ,
    that is, . For an arbitrary matrix , denotes the th column of . . represents the
    Moore–Penrose inverse of matrix . is an identity matrix. denotes a null matrix
    of appropriate dimensions. 2.2. Process model and problem formulation Let us consider
    discrete-time nonlinear processes whose dynamics can be characterized by the state-space
    model as follows: (1a) (1b) where is the state vector of the process; is the vector
    of output measurements; is the vector of the known inputs (including manipulated
    inputs and known process disturbances); is a vector-valued nonlinear function
    that characterizes the dynamics of ; is a vector-valued nonlinear function for
    the output measurements. and are two compact sets. The objective of this paper
    is to propose a computationally efficient state estimation approach in the linear
    context to provide real-time estimate of the time evolution of for the nonlinear
    process in (1). The first step is to establish a linear model to mimic the dynamical
    behavior of the states of process (1) in the following non-autonomous form: (2a)
    (2b) (2c) where ( ) is the vector of lifted states of the linear model; , , ,
    and are system matrices that need to be established. Based on an identified linear
    model in the form of (2), a constrained state estimation algorithm will be proposed
    to efficiently estimate the actual states of the original nonlinear process (1).
    3. Construction of Koopman-based linear model In this section, the Koopman-based
    identification method is leveraged to construct a linear model in the form of
    (2) for state estimation of the nonlinear process in (1). 3.1. Representation
    of autonomous nonlinear process using Koopman operator First, consider an autonomous
    nonlinear dynamical process described by: (3) where is the vector of the process
    state, and is a vector field characterizing the dependence of the future state
    evolution on the current process states. The process model in (3) can be lifted
    to a new function space which typically has infinite dimensions. This function
    space, denoted by , contains a set of continuous scalar-valued functions. Each
    element involved in space is called an observable. In the lifted space , the time
    evolution of each of the observables is governed by a Koopman operator for each
    sampling instant as described by the following form: (4) Specifically, at sampling
    instant , Eq. (4) leads to (Arbabi et al., 2018): (5) By definition, and , the
    following equality holds: Therefore, the Koopman operator is linear although the
    treated process has nonlinear dynamics (i.e., the vector-valued function in (3)
    is nonlinear). This way, the Koopman operator can be utilized to establish a linear
    representation of the time evolution of a nonlinear process in another space of
    up to infinite dimensions (Budišić et al., 2012). 3.2. Koopman operator for non-autonomous
    processes For a non-autonomous processes, the Koopman operator can be viewed as
    the Koopman operator of an autonomous dynamical process evolving in an extended
    state-space, which is constituted by the Cartesian product of the space of the
    original process states and the space of the known inputs. Accordingly, an augmented
    vector that contains both the original process states and the known inputs is
    created to account for the state vector of the extended space as follows: (6)
    of which the dynamics can be described as: (7) ≔ ≔ where is an operator conducting
    left shifting, that is, . Consequently, for a non-autonomous processes in the
    form of (1a), the Koopman operator , where represents an infinite-dimensional
    function space associated with the augmented state vector , is defined such that:
    (8) where each element of is an observable belonging to a certain subspace of
    . 3.3. Approximation of the Koopman operator for the considered process By using
    the Koopman operator, the original nonlinear dynamic model for a process can be
    mapped into a linear state-space. However, the direct use of a Koopman operator
    leads to a critical issue that the dimensions of the new space are up to infinite.
    Therefore, an approximation of the Koopman operator in a finite-dimensional space
    is needed for developing a linear state estimation scheme. In the existing literature,
    there are several data-driven algorithms which are focused on approximating the
    Koopman operator, including the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Schmid, 2010), the
    Galerkin approach (Froyland et al., 2014), the Generalized Laplace Analysis approach
    (Mauroy et al., 2013), and the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) (Williams
    et al., 2015). EDMD, as a non-trivial extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition,
    has been used to achieve better approximations when a process exhibits strong
    nonlinearity and/or limited data are available. Another advantage of EDMD is that
    it can be used to appropriately handle not only autonomous processes, but also
    non-autonomous processes described by (1). Therefore, EDMD is utilized in this
    work to establish a finite-dimensional Koopman operator as an approximation of
    the infinite-dimensional counterpart. To achieve this objective, first, a finite-dimensional
    subspace of is defined. The subspace is constructed in such a way that it is generated
    by linearly independent basis functions , where ranges from 1 to . Through a nonlinear
    mapping characterized by the basis functions , , the original process state variables
    are lifted to a higher-dimensional space . Then, ( ) observables are determined
    for the nonlinear process in (1) based on the basis functions. Specifically, each
    observable , , can be represented by a linear combination of the basis functions
    , , as follows: where each is a scalar coefficient. Consequently, a linear model
    that can be used to analyze the evolution of the observables is established as
    follows (Korda and Mezić, 2018, Narasingam and Kwon, 2020a): (9) where (where
    ) is a vector of the observables, with being the th element of , . is a finite-dimensional
    approximation of the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator in (8). In this work,
    the nonlinear process in (1) is taken into account, and the EDMD algorithm for
    the control setting is leveraged to establish an approximation of the Koopman
    operator. This algorithm can address the case scenario when a collection of process
    data samples , , which satisfies the nonlinear mapping for , is available, and
    it takes advantage of the process data to calculate , which provides the most
    accurate approximation in the sense of -norm through solving the least-squares
    problem below: (10) where represents the total number of the available samples.
    In this work, the vector of observables is established as follows: (11) where
    is the vector of basis functions, and can be interpreted as a block matrix below:
    (12) For convenience, let be the same as the first elements of the vector of observables
    , i.e., ≔ . The goal is to establish a model in the form of (2) that can be used
    to forecast the future behavior of but not , that is, we focus on the dynamics
    of the state variables and treat the control input (either open-loop control or
    closed-loop control) as an exogenous known input. Therefore, the operator in (7),
    which governs the evolution of the control input, is not needed for data-driven
    Koopman modeling and state estimation, and it is only necessary to identify and
    in (12), while the last elements of in (10) and the two bottom blocks in (12)
    can be neglected. Consequently, (10) is re-formulated as: (13) The output measurement
    matrix in (2b) and the projection matrix in (2c) can be obtained by solving the
    minimization problems below: (14) It is noted that the minimization problems in
    (13), (14) are linear least-squares problems so that the solutions can be found
    readily. The key steps involved in the EDMD-based implementation procedure for
    state estimation are presented as follows: Procedure 1 EDMD-based Koopman identification
    procedure for state estimation 1. Collect ( ) discrete samples for the process
    states and known inputs; 2. Scale each element , , of the state vector following
    where is the steady-state point of , ≔ , and ≔ . Scale the known input vector
    , and output measurements in a similar manner (each scaled input and scaled output
    measurement for time instant are denoted by and , respectively). 3. Create snapshots
    , , , and following , , , and , respectively. 4. Choose a set of nonlinear basis
    functions . 5. Compute and as: . 6. Compute as: . By employing the scaling step
    (i.e., Step 2 of the above procedure), the samples are scaled, such that the scaled
    states have similar magnitudes. This way, almost equal significance is attached
    to each of the process states, which is independent of the potentially different
    magnitudes of the original process states. The known inputs and the output measurements
    are scaled in the same manner before the snapshot matrices are created. For Step
    3 of the above procedure, the basis functions are chosen in a way such that they
    have explicit dependence on the process states . In addition, the first basis
    functions are defined as , where . This way, matrix can be determined directly
    as . In addition, for many nonlinear processes, the measurement equations in (1b)
    are of a linear form . In such cases, matrix can be obtained readily following
    , instead of resorting to Step 6 of the above procedure. Remark 1 The snapshot
    matrices satisfy the relationship for ( ). For snapshot matrices , and created
    in Step 3 of the above procedure, it is assumed that the samples are collected
    consecutively at every sampling instant and are organized in a temporal sequence.
    Note that the EDMD algorithm can also cope with the circumstances when there are
    missing data, or the samples are collected from different operating trajectories,
    as long as the snapshot matrices are established in a way such that the relationship
    is satisfied. In certain applications, state variables might be sampled at varying
    frequencies. In such scenarios, data downsampling can be employed to ensure a
    consistent sampling rate of the variables before creating the snapshot matrices
    for Koopman identification. Remark 2 Considering the fact that the magnitudes
    of the states of an industrial process can be significantly different, all the
    process states are scaled before Koopman identification and state estimation are
    conducted. Following Step 3 of Procedure 1, scaled values are used to account
    for the elements in the snapshot matrices. To streamline the presentation, with
    a slight abuse of notation, we refer to Eq. (2) as Koopman modeling is conducted
    based on the scaled variables following Procedure 1. Accordingly, the Koopman
    model established following Procedure 1 in the form of (2) is used to predict
    the scaled process state where . More precisely speaking, Eq. (2c) is with the
    form of when Procedure 1 is adopted, and the matrix takes the form of . When identification
    is completed and real-time state estimates are obtained, they should be unscaled
    to recover the real state information of the process (1). Remark 3 The choice
    of the basis functions can affect the EDMD-based Koopman modeling performance
    significantly. Specifically, as has been discussed in Section 3 of Williams et
    al. (2015), the model accuracy and the convergence of EDMD-based Koopman identification
    significantly depends on the choice of the basis functions. When applying the
    proposed method to nonlinear processes of larger scales, one challenge arises
    in how to appropriately choose a large number of observable functions to account
    for the nonlinear mapping from the original nonlinear state-space to a higher-dimensional
    linear state-space. To explore the use of more suitable basis function combinations,
    it can be favorable to automate the selection of appropriate basis functions,
    instead of conducting manual selection based on trial and error. One promising
    way to automate the selection of the basis functions could be to construct a “rich”
    library of all possible basis functions, and select the most suitable basis functions
    from the candidates in the rich library through solving optimization or using
    recursive methods (e.g., Kalman filter) (Wang et al., 2022). Machine learning
    also has the potential to be exploited to determine optimal non-parametric basis
    functions, see, e.g., Lusch et al., 2018, Han et al., 2020a. This line of research
    that aims to incorporate automated basis function selection into Koopman-based
    constrained estimation is reserved for our future work. 4. Linear moving horizon
    state estimator In this section, the linear model in (2) is used to design a linear
    state estimator for nonlinear process (1) based on moving horizon estimation (Rawlings
    and Ji, 2012, Rao et al., 2001, Alessandri et al., 2003). First, by incorporating
    the process disturbances and measurement noise, a stochastic form of (2) is presented
    as follows: (15a) (15b) (15c) where is unknown system disturbance and satisfies
    ; represents unknown measurement noise. and are two compact sets, which can be
    defined (moderately conservatively) by taking into account the constraints on
    the disturbances and noise of the original nonlinear process. Then, a linear moving
    horizon state estimator is formulated based on the algorithm in Rao et al. (2001)
    as follows: (16a) (16b) (16c) (16d) where is an estimate of the lifted states
    ( ) obtained at time instant ; and are estimates of and obtained at time instant
    ; is an integer denoting the length of the estimation horizon for the estimator;
    and are positive-definite weighting matrices; accounts for the arrival cost; represents
    the vector of the first elements of . In Eq. (16), (16a) is the objective function
    for which the decision variables are a sequence of estimates of the lifted states
    within the current estimation window of size ; (16b), (16c) are linear model constraints;
    (16d) imposes hard constraints on the estimates of the lifted states of the linear
    model as well as on the system disturbances and measurement noise. Since the first
    basis functions are made the same as the original process states (i.e., , ), as
    shown in (16d), constraints are only imposed on the first lifted states of the
    linear system (15) as , which are accounted for by the states of the nonlinear
    process (1). This way, the original linear constraints on the original process
    states are preserved in the higher dimensional state space without the need to
    translate the linear constraints into nonlinear ones. At each sampling instant
    , the optimization problem (16) is solved, and the estimator provides , which
    is a sequence of optimal estimates of the observables within the current estimation
    horizon. The last element of this sequence is utilized as the optimal estimate
    of the observables at time instant and is denoted by , that is . The first elements
    of are used as the optimal estimate of the process state at sampling instant .
    In the cost function in Eq. (16a), is an approximation of the arrival cost characterizing
    the effect of all the historical sensor measurements on the state estimate. Following
    the MHE algorithm in Rao et al. (2001), the approximation of the arrival cost
    is defined as where , and is computed using the covariance update equation for
    the discrete-time Kalman filter, which is as follows: where for . The Koopman-based
    linear moving horizon estimation scheme in (16) is developed for general nonlinear
    systems. Specifically, based on the higher-dimensional linear Koopman model in
    (15), a linear moving horizon estimator is developed for estimating the states
    of the original nonlinear process. Therefore, while the proposed estimation scheme
    is a linear moving horizon estimation design, which is inspired by the formulation
    in Rao et al. (2001), the proposed method addresses a constrained nonlinear state
    estimation problem, which is a key difference from Rao et al. (2001). Owing to
    the use of linear moving horizon estimation, the proposed approach can provide
    significantly improved computational efficiency as compared to conventional constrained
    nonlinear moving horizon estimation. Remark 4 For convex sets , and , the proposed
    method is able to formulate a convex quadratic program instead of designing a
    nonlinear MHE estimator, such that non-convex optimization problems which may
    be encountered in the nonlinear context are bypassed. In this way, the proposed
    method allows for much reduced computational complexity as compared to the conventional
    solutions that aim to develop nonlinear MHE estimators based on a nonlinear first-principles
    model. Remark 5 Incorporating Lyapunov constraints into Koopman-based control
    frameworks is a promising method to guarantee closed-loop stability of control
    systems (Son et al., 2021). Given the fact that moving horizon estimation can
    be viewed as the dual of model predictive control, incorporating Lyapunov constraints
    or other non-trivial constraints (e.g., including an auxiliary observer in a similar
    manner of Liu, 2013, Yin and Liu, 2017) into Koopman-based moving horizon estimation
    holds the promise for bolstering the stability of the estimation error dynamics
    and enhancing the robustness of the estimation system. 5. Case studies In this
    section, the proposed Koopman-based moving horizon estimation method is applied
    to develop data-driven linear state estimation systems for two nonlinear processes,
    including a simulated four-reactor chemical process and a quadruple water-tank
    system. 5.1. Application to a four-reactor chemical process In this subsection,
    the proposed method is applied to a chemical process through simulations. This
    process comprises four continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) which are interconnected
    through energy and mass/material flows (Rashedi et al., 2018). A schematic diagram
    of this chemical process is presented in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res

    of the four-CSTR process. In the four reactors, three irreversible reactions take
    place in parallel. denotes the reactant, denotes the desired product, and and
    are two byproducts. A feed stream that contains pure enters each of the four reactors.
    Each of the first reactor and the third reactor has only one outlet stream to
    its neighboring reactor: the outlet stream of the first reactor is fed into the
    second reactor; the outlet stream of the third reactor is fed into the fourth
    reactor for further reactions. Each of the second reactor and the fourth reactor
    has two outlet streams. For the second reactor, a portion of the outlet flow is
    fed back into the first reactor, and the remainder enters the third reactor. In
    terms of the fourth reactor, a portion of its outlet is recycled to the first
    reactor for further reaction, while the remaining portion is the effluent of the
    process. Each reactor is equipped with a jacket that is used to remove or provide
    heat. Based on mass and energy balances, a nonlinear dynamic process model consisting
    of eight ordinary differential equations is established as follows: (17) The states
    are the concentrations of the reactant in the four reactors (denoted by , ) and
    the temperatures in the four reactors (denoted by , ). The variables and parameters
    involved in (17) are defined in Table 1, and the values of the model parameters
    are shown in Table 2. The temperatures in the four reactors can be measured online,
    while the concentrations of in the four reactors need to be estimated, which is
    essential for real-time monitoring and regulation of the process operation. The
    data samples that are used for identifying the Koopman-based model are generated
    through simulations of the process model (17). The sampling period is 1 min. To
    generate the state trajectory for identification, the initial condition of the
    simulation is set to be . The manipulated inputs are the heating inputs applied
    to the four reactors (i.e., , ). Open-loop time-varying input signals are generated
    by adding Gaussian distributed random signals to the steady-state level , , ,
    . Then, the heating inputs applied to the four vessels are made bounded such that
    the following constraints are satisfied: , , , . Unknown process disturbances
    and measurement noise following Gaussian distribution are generated, and then
    are made bounded before being injected to the first-principles process model to
    generate data samples. The samples within the first 400-hour operating period
    are used for identifying the Koopman linear model. All the training samples are
    used to create the snapshot matrices. Consequently, snapshot matrices , of dimensions
    , of dimensions , and of dimensions are obtained. Note that the snapshot matrices
    are constituted by scaled states and scaled manipulated inputs, which are obtained
    following Step 2 of the implementation procedure. While there is no systematic
    guideline that can be followed to select the basis functions, radial basis functions
    are recommended as a starting point according to some existing literature (Korda
    and Mezić, 2018, Narasingam and Kwon, 2019). However, through extensive simulations,
    commonly used radial basis functions do not suffice for handling this chemical
    process. Inspired by the selected basis functions in Narasingam and Kwon (2019),
    it is found through comparisons that basis functions that comprise the original
    states, quadratic functions of the original states, and exponential functions
    of the original states are good candidates for this chemical process. Specifically,
    the basis functions are chosen for the chemical process as follows: where is scaled
    state of the th state of the process, . Then, a Koopman-based linear model that
    contains 24 lifted states is obtained based on the procedure in Section 3.3, and
    a linear moving horizon state estimator is developed based on the identified model
    following the design in (16). Table 1. Variables and parameters of the four-CSTR

    results of the Koopman linear model identified for the four-reactor chemical process.
    To assess the accuracy of the identified Koopman model and to illustrate the performance
    of the state estimator, additional samples within an operating period of 40 h
    are generated. Different random input profiles that are generated in a similar
    fashion are used for training and testing of the Koopman-based model. The trajectories
    of the actual process states, and the predictions obtained using the Koopman model
    within the validation time period are shown in Fig. 2. The actual process states
    are shown in blue solid lines, and the state predictions provided by the identified
    Koopman model are shown in red dashed lines. The predictions capture the trend
    of the trajectories of the actual states accurately. In addition, the prediction
    performance of this Koopman-based model is compared with a linearized process
    model obtained via Taylor series expansion at the corresponding steady-state point.
    In particular, to evaluate and compare the accuracies of the models, we resort
    the root mean square error (RMSE) of each model, which is computed following where
    is the vector of the recovered state provided by each model, and is the actual
    state at time instant . The average RMSE value (i.e., where is the total number
    of samples for model validation) for the Koopman-based linear model is 0.6307,
    while the average RMSE of the linearized model is 1.2735, which is 101.92% larger
    than that of the Koopman-based model. It is noted that an attempt has been made
    to establish a Koopman model by using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) (Schmid,
    2010, Proctor et al., 2016). However, the prediction error of the DMD-based Koopman
    model is significantly less accurate than the EDMD-based Koopman model, which
    can undermine the estimation performance of the resulting Koopman-based estimation
    scheme. This also demonstrates the advantage of the EDMD-based method when handling
    this benchmark chemical process, as compared to the DMD-based method. Next, we
    present the state estimation results for this process based on the Koopman linear
    model. An MHE-based estimator is developed following Eq. (16). The length of the
    estimation horizon is . While the original process states (which represent the
    temperatures and molar concentrations) have significantly different magnitudes,
    the states of the Koopman linear model have the same magnitude since the samples
    have been scaled. In particular, since holds for during the entire process operation,
    the scaled states that need to be estimated are within the interval . The initial
    guess for the original process states are assigned . The initial guess is also
    scaled following (as an analog of Step 2 of Procedure 1) before it is supplied
    to the MHE-based estimator. The weighting matrices for the estimator are and .
    The diagonal elements of the weighting matrices and are made identical because
    the system states have been scaled to the same magnitude. The estimation results
    are presented in Fig. 3, which shows that accurate estimates of the eight states
    are obtained. The overall discrepancy between the estimates and the actual process
    states is even smaller than the discrepancy between the open-loop state predictions
    based on the Koopman model and the actual states. This is reasonable since the
    estimator leverages additional feedback information in terms of real-time sensor
    measurements. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. The actual states and the corresponding estimates of the molar concentrations
    of material in the four CSTRs provided by the MHE-based estimator based on the
    Koopman model. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, we compare
    the proposed estimation design with a nonlinear MHE estimator developed based
    on the first-principles process model in (17) and another linear MHE estimator
    developed based on the linearized model of (17) obtained at through Taylor series
    expansion. In the nonlinear MHE, the variables are also scaled, and and are used
    as the weighting matrices. The average estimation error norm and the average computation
    time for one-time estimator execution for each of the three designs, computed
    over 100 simulation runs, are presented in Table 3. The simulations are conducted
    on a Windows laptop with an Intel i7-12700 processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080
    graphics card, and 32 GB of memory. The corresponding simulation results have
    been used to calculate the computation time in Table 3. As compared to the nonlinear
    MHE estimator, the proposed method saves approximately 51.78% of the computation
    time, and it provides almost equivalently accurate estimates of the process states.
    It is worth mentioning that from a theoretical point of view, the MHE estimator
    based on the nonlinear first-principles model can give more accurate estimates
    as compared to the proposed method providing that the nonlinear optimization problems
    for the MHE estimator are successfully solved at each sampling instant, since
    the nonlinear MHE estimator is designed in the absence of any model-mismatch.
    At the same time, the reason that the proposed method provides slightly better
    results may be because of the non-convexity of the optimization problem associated
    with the nonlinear MHE estimator. It is also worth pointing out that from a practical
    viewpoint, it is challenging to obtain a first-principles model with accurate
    parameters in the form of (17) for a chemical process, and the inaccuracy of the
    model parameters can result in a significant increase in the estimation error
    of the nonlinear MHE. Table 3. The estimation accuracy and the computation time

    9.1125 s MHE based on nonlinear model 0.2401 18.8983 s MHE based on linearized
    model 0.3113 0.5894 s The proposed method indeed requires longer computation time
    than the estimator based on the linearized model, which is mainly due to the higher
    dimension of the Koopman linear model which includes additional observables in
    addition to the original process states. However, this further reduction in the
    computation time due to the use of a linearized model is at the expense of the
    estimation accuracy. Specifically, the average estimation error norm of the proposed
    method is 22.33% smaller than that of the linear MHE based on the linearized model
    based on the 100 simulation runs, which confirms that the proposed method is able
    to provide much more accurate state estimates in comparison to the MHE based on
    a linearized model. This is mainly because the Koopman linear model established
    using the proposed method is more accurate than the linearized model, especially
    when the process is not operated around the steady-state point. 5.2. Application
    to a quadruple water-tank process In this subsection, we apply the proposed method
    to a quadruple water-tank process to estimate the water levels in the four water
    tanks, and experimental results are obtained to further illustrate the applicability
    of the proposed framework. Fig. 4 presents a schematic of the process. This process
    consists of four cylindrical water tanks, two pumps and a water reservoir. The
    water supplied by each of the pumps enters the process through two flows — the
    left pump provides a water flow to Tank 1 and a water flow to Tank 4, while the
    right pump provides a water flow to Tank 2 and a water flow to Tank 3. The water
    leaves each of the top tanks (i.e., Tank 3 and Tank 4) and enters its corresponding
    bottom tank (i.e., Tank 1/Tank 2) through pipes. Water in the two bottom tanks
    is discharged into a water reservoir below them. The voltages applied to the pumps
    account for the manipulated inputs of this process. By regulating the voltages
    applied to the pumps, the two pumps are able to provide water to the tanks at
    desired volumetric flow rates. Differential pressure (DP) cells are deployed to
    measure the water heights in the four tanks. Specifically, each DP cell provides
    an online measurement of the water height in the corresponding tank every 1 s
    This process has nonlinear dynamics, and a first-principles-based nonlinear model
    was established where the nonlinear process dynamics are described primarily by
    the Bernoulli equation. However, it is not desirable to use this first-principles
    nonlinear process model to design a state estimator, and the reasons are mainly
    twofold: (1) the first-principles model was built based on an assumption that
    the outlet flows of the tanks do not experience any frictional losses, which is
    not satisfied in practice such that the model cannot be sufficiently accurate;
    (2) the use of a nonlinear model in designing an moving horizon state estimator
    leads to much more expensive computation as compared to a linear MHE-based estimation
    scheme, such that online implementation may not be ensured considering the comparatively
    fast dynamics of this process, if the sampling rate is sufficiently fast for a
    control application. Download : Download high-res image (565KB) Download : Download

    system. For illustrating purposes, in the state estimation experiments, the sensor
    readings of the water heights of two bottom tanks are treated as measured outputs,
    and the goal is to estimate the water heights in all the four water tanks based
    on the two measured outputs. First, data is collected as needed for identifying
    a Koopman-based linear model and for demonstrating the proposed data-driven state
    estimation method. The process is operated around a steady-state point , where
    represents the steady-state water height in Tank , . This steady-state point corresponds
    to steady-state inputs , where and represent the steady-state voltages for the
    left and the right pumps. In terms of the actual voltages applied to the pumps,
    random binary sequences that take values of either 14.5 V or 11.5 V are generated
    as the inputs. The trajectories of the two inputs within the first 100 min are
    presented in Fig. 5. We consider an operation period of 10,000 s A new sample
    is collected every 1 s, which is the same as the sampling period of the DP cells.
    By applying the chosen manipulated inputs to the process, 10,000 samples are collected.
    The first 6000 samples are used for Koopman-based identification, and the remaining
    samples are used to validate the identified model as well as to illustrate the
    performance of the proposed estimation method. For all the samples, the steady-state
    values are subtracted from the original values, that is, ≔ where is the measured
    water height of Tank , , and ≔ where and are the actual voltages currently applied
    to the left and the right pumps, respectively. Then, the processed data are used
    for model identification. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download

    of the proposed method is conducted. For this multi-tank process, the basis functions
    selected for the previous chemical process example are borrowed, that is, the
    original states, quadratic functions and exponential functions constitute the
    dictionary of the basis functions, such that: The cross-validation results for
    the identified Koopman linear model are shown in Fig. 6. To evaluate the accuracy
    of the Koopman-based model, a conventional system identification method in Zhu
    (1998) and the commonly used subspace identification approach (Ljung, 1999) are
    also applied to build another two linear state-space models for performance comparisons.
    First, based on the method in Zhu (1998), four autoregressive with exogenous input
    (ARX) models are identified by using the first 6000 samples that are used for
    the Koopman identification, and the ARX models are integrated to form a linear
    state-space model in the following form: (18) where The trajectories of the predictions
    of the water heights in the tanks based on the model in (18) are also presented
    in Fig. 6. From the trajectories of the actual states and the predicted states
    given by the two models, the Koopman-based linear model provides much more accurate
    predictions of the water heights in all the four tanks. Download : Download high-res

    Comparison of prediction errors of three data-driven linear models established
    for the quadruple water-tank process. Next, subspace identification (Ljung, 1999)
    is conducted to establish another linear model of four states for the quadruple
    water-tank process, which is also of the form of (18) but has different system
    matrices and . The system matrices obtained based on Ljung (1999) are omitted
    from this section for brevity. To compare the accuracies of the three models (including
    the Koopman-based model, the model based on ARX identification of orders and ,
    and the model based on subspace identification), the root mean square error for
    each model is calculated based on its open-loop predictions. The trajectories
    of the RMSE for the three data-driven linear models that are obtained based on
    the cross-validation dataset are presented in Fig. 7. The average values of the
    trajectories of for the three models are presented in Table 4. The results indicate
    that the Koopman-based identification of the proposed method is able to reduce
    the prediction error by 52.90% and 66.58% for the quadruple water-tank process,
    in comparison to subspace identification and the conventional identification method
    in Zhu (1998), respectively. Then, a linear MHE-based estimator is designed using
    the Koopman linear model following the design in Section 4. The Koopman linear
    model has 12 lifted states due to the chosen basis functions. Explicit constraints
    are imposed on the first to the fourth lifted state, that is, the estimates of
    these four states, which represent the water heights in the four tanks need to
    be made non-negative. The estimation horizon length is selected as . The weighting
    matrices for Koopman-based MHE are chosen as and based on trial and error. The
    MHE-based estimator is applied within the operating time period considered for
    cross-validation of the Koopman model. The initial guess adopted by the estimator
    is chosen as . The sensor readings of the water heights of Tanks 1 and 2 are input
    in the state estimator. The estimates of the water heights for the four tanks
    are presented in Fig. 8. The experimental results confirm that the MHE-based estimator
    developed based on the Koopman linear model are able to generate satisfying estimates
    of the water heights for all the four tanks. The average computation time for
    one-time execution of the proposed Koopman MHE is 0.6519 s. The estimation accuracy
    of the proposed method is further compared to another MHE-based estimator designed
    based on the ARX model. The same moving horizon estimation algorithm is utilized.
    The average values of the estimation error norms for the two estimators based
    on the Koopman model and the ARX model are and , respectively. This implies that
    the proposed method is able to provide more accurate state estimates as compared
    to the case when the conventional modeling is conducted for state estimation design.

    A constrained state estimation problem for general nonlinear processes was addressed
    by developing a data-driven MHE scheme. A Koopman identification procedure taking
    advantage of the EDMD algorithm was proposed to identify a Koopman linear model
    to describe the dynamics of a nonlinear process. A linear MHE estimator that can
    handle constraints on state and disturbances was developed based on the identified
    Koopman model. The proposed method formulates a convex optimization problem for
    the purpose of constrained state estimation despite the nonlinearity of the process
    dynamics, which facilitates online implementation of optimization-based estimation
    for nonlinear processes. In addition, the proposed method is purely data-driven
    in the sense that it does not require any first-principles knowledge when developing
    estimation schemes, which broadens the applicability of the proposed approach
    as compared to the model-based counterparts. Computer simulations on a chemical
    process example and an experiment based on a quadruple water-tank system were
    conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.
    The superiority of the proposed approach was also illustrated via extensive comparisons.

    to a future sustainable bio-based economy is expected to evolve progressively
    in the coming decades (Marquardt et al., 2010). Fossil fuels dominate the world''s
    primary energy supply, meeting 80 % of current global demands, which is projected
    to rise by 40 % in 2035 (IEA, 2013). Although unconventional oil and gas production
    shows that absolute fossil fuel depletion is unlikely to restrain demand, the
    substantially increased resource intensity of production from such new fossil
    fuel reserves come with a significant resource scarcity caveat (Green Alliance,
    2013) e.g. IEA-projected 85 % increase in water demand for energy production by
    2035 (IEA, 2013). The accelerating resource depletion is accompanied by concerns
    about increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) levels, where fossil fuel is a key contributor
    to anthropogenic GHGs (IPCC, 2014). At the Paris climate conference (COP21) in
    December 2015, 195 countries adopted the legally binding global climate agreement,
    which sets out the action plans to limit the global warming to well below 2°C.
    An innovative bio-based economy underpinned by biorenewable technologies offers
    significant opportunities to decarbonise economic growth, develop optimal resource
    use and support global adaptation efforts. The term biorenewable refers to the
    bio-products derived from renewable biological resources or waste including food,
    bioenergy, biofuel, biochemical, biomaterial etc. A wide range of biorenewable
    products can be manufactured through various technology routes (Fig. 2) and contribute
    to the bio-economy. The current bioeconomy across Europe is estimated to worth
    around €2 trillion (Science and Technology Committee, 2014); whereas in the UK,
    the whole bioeconomy including all activities for sustainable conversion of biomass
    into bio-products, in total injected £220 billion added gross values and supported
    5.2 million jobs in 2014 (Bauen et al., 2016). Its growth is expected to increase
    to £440 billion by 2030 in the UK (E. a. I. S. Department for Business, 2018).
    However, as pointed out by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, human use of and impacts
    on the biosphere are now exceeding the multiple environmental limits 3and planetary
    boundaries. The planetary boundaries is a concept proposed by Rockström et al.
    (2009) to define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the Earth
    system and are associated with the planet''s biophysical subsystems or processes.
    Such environmental limits have been avoided in the past by adopting technology
    innovation and problem shifting, e.g. industrial revolution and green revolution
    (Steffen et al., 2015). But current operation beyond multiple planetary boundaries
    does not allow for any further easy shifts (Green Alliance, 2013) Thus, the burgeoning
    bioeconomy transformation and biorenewable sector sustainability cannot be achieved
    by partial system solutions but calls for whole systems approaches considering
    the biorenewable system complexity. As advanced bioeconomy components, biorenewables
    systems can be broadly divided into five sub-system fragments - i.e. environment
    and natural capitals (e.g. land, water), resource production and ecosystem, biorenewable
    refining/manufacturing, distribution and network, waste treatment. These are often
    regarded and investigated as isolated sub-system fragments. In fact, they are
    interdependent and interlinked. Take one of the economically favourable biorenewable
    sectors (Fig. 2) - agro-food - as an example to elaborate the resource-biorenewable-waste
    interdependency. Agro-foods highly depend on natural capital resources i.e. land
    and water. Currently, agriculture sectors account for 37 % of global lands and
    70 % of the water consumption (FAO, 2011). By 2050, the agricultural water withdrawn
    of 3000 km3/yr and potential 2.8 billion ha rain-fed land use and expansion of
    0.33 billion ha irrigated land are expected to take place in water-scarce regions
    and developing countries (FAO, 2011). This brings severe land/water-competition
    issues with other biorenewable sectors and municipal and industrial needs in response
    to rapid urbanisation trends and economic growth. Moreover, rising waste generation
    from current agro-food sectors brings additional stress, which is equivalent to
    waste of 8.5 % of annual water withdrawn and 28 % of agricultural lands globally
    (FAO, 2016). Thus, the agro-food production is not only dependent on and constrained
    by resource (land/water) availability but also interlinks with built environment
    (e.g. infrastructure for waste treatment). Multiple biorenewable sectors also
    interact at system levels e.g. their competition on the same productive lands
    and water resources. Such complexity requires in-depth understanding of resource
    flows and processes across biorenewable sub-systems and novel system solutions
    to achieve resource-circularity and address their interlinkage with natural and
    build environments. Fundamentally, resource, biorenewable and waste form a nexus.
    Sitting at Natural Sciences and Engineering interface, this nexus represents a
    highly cross-disciplinary research frontier. Integrating empirical and computational
    advances, design of advanced biorenewable solutions from a whole systems perspective,
    offers a promising path to catalyse resource-biorenewable-waste nexus sustainability.
    However, no publically available study has been found to reflect the biorenewable
    system complexity and recent advances and prospects of computational methods for
    biorenewable systems research. Here we present a critical review of biorenewable
    systems, bridging fundamental and applied research perspectives at Science-Engineering
    interface with a particular focus on biorenewable systems complexity and modelling
    research. This review article reflects state-of-the-art of biorenewable empirical
    research ranging from biological renewable resources underpinned by photosynthesis
    and biogeochemical cycles to biorenewable manufacturing through diverse technologies;
    building upon the fundamental understanding of the empirical advances, this review
    highlights the biorenewable system complexity and addresses the interlinkage and
    interdependency of sub-systems. Further, our study reviews the modelling advances
    to tackle such system complexity across highly interdisciplinary topics and identifies
    the open research challenges and gaps in the fields. This review study is concluded
    with future research directions on biorenewable systems modelling. The structure

    structure of the review. 2. Biorenewable systems Biomass includes all complex
    biogenic organic and inorganic products generated by natural or technosphere and
    consists of (1) natural constituents originated from terrestrial or aquatic vegetation
    via photosynthesis or generated via animal and human food digestion; (2) technosphere
    products/by-products derived from processing the natural constituents above (Balat
    and Ayar, 2005; Vassilev et al., 2010). In this review, biomass mainly refers
    to biological renewable resources (e.g. higher plant species and microbial cluster)
    and waste Unlike other renewable sources, e.g. tidal energy or intermittent sources
    of solar and wind energy, biomass provides flexible options to overcome the supply
    instability and un-predictability by deriving thermal and electrical energy on
    demands, and offering potential for transport fuel or bio-chemical generation.
    Biomass is nature''s successful solar conversion and energy storage system via
    photosynthesis to derive atmospheric CO2-sourced carbohydrates and lignin (Industry
    and Parliament Trust, 2015). This coupled with carbon-containing and nutrient-rich
    organic waste in solid (e.g. biodegradable fraction municipal solid waste (BFMSW),
    liquid (e.g. sewage sludge) or gas (e.g. CO2) phases represent great potential
    resources. Such a wide range of biomass organic molecules can be converted into
    a plethora of bio-products in the biorefineries. Biorefineries are regarded as
    the cornerstone of the bioeconomy (Fig. 2), where various thermochemical, biochemical,
    and chemical routes including non-catalytic or catalytic technologies can be deployed
    and integrated (Vanholme et al., 2013). Catalysis in particular, which has contributed
    to 90 % of manufacturing in the petrochemical industry, will underpin future biorefinery
    technologies in a post-petroleum era, synthesising chemical intermediates and
    advanced materials from non-petroleum feedstock (Industry and Parliament Trust,
    2015). Download : Download high-res image (681KB) Download : Download full-size

    of a range of potential biomass and waste resources, their underpinned photosynthesis,
    carbon cycles and various conversion pathways for biorenewables production, where
    the interdisciplinary research nature of biorenewable systems will be highlighted
    from a system perspective. 2.1. Photosynthesis and biomass carbon cycles Carbon
    as the building block of life circulates between living organisms and environments
    via various biochemical cycles, which refer to the carbon cycles (Venkata Mohan
    et al., 2016). Amongst a range of natural and anthropogenic CO2 sinks, bio-sequestration
    methods particularly photosynthesis and the synthesis of bio-based products offer
    sustainable routes for atmospheric CO2 assimilation. Research over past decades
    has advanced the understanding of photosynthesis from the initial photophysics
    of light absorption and excitation energy transfer to gas exchange in particular
    in higher plant species. 2.1.1. C3 C4 and CAM photosynthesis pathways Photosynthesis
    is a redox reaction driven by light energy, in which CO2 and H2O are converted
    into metabolites and O2, where dark and light two stage reactions are involved.
    Three photosynthetic pathways can be differentiated, where Calvin-Benson-Bassham
    (CBB) Cycle is the predominant pathway used by the vast majority of autotrophic
    organisms (Bar-Even et al., 2010). It is also referred to as C3 cycle due to three-carbon
    compound phosphoglycerate formed. Other two photosynthesis pathways rising from
    the evolutionary adaptation are Hatch-Slack cycle (also referred to as C4 cycle
    due to the four carbon compound oxaloacetic acid formed) (Slack and Hatch, 1967)
    and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis. C3 species represent approximately
    85 % of higher plant species, C4 and CAM species account for 5 % and 10 % respectively
    (Yamori et al., 2014). Their photosynthetic reactions and biochemical regulation
    differ. CBB cycle (Fig. 3) (C3 cycle) is the largest flux of organic carbon in
    the biosphere and assimilates about 100 billion tons of carbon a year, which is
    equivalent to 15 % of global atmospheric carbon (Raines, 2011). CBB cycle takes
    place inside the chloroplast in mesophyll cell and its carbon fixation mechanism
    has been detailed in (Raines, 2011). C3 plants such as rice, wheat, potato use
    CBB cycle initiated by the enzyme RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase),
    which catalyses the carboxylation of the CO2-acceptor ribulose-1,5-bisPhosphate
    (RUBP) for fixing CO2 20. RuBP, a 6-carbon is metabolised into two molecules of
    3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) which are then metabolised into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
    (G3P), requiring ATP and NADPH synthesised from the light reactions of photosynthesis
    (Raines, 2003; Raines, 2022). G3P is a triose phosphate that serves many metabolic
    purposes such as synthesis of lipids, starch and amino acids (Johnson and Alric,
    2013; Ma et al., 2022). The final phase of the C3 cycle involves the regeneration
    of RuBP from a series of reactions requiring at least nine other enzymes. It is
    the regeneration of RuBP, requiring ATP that closes the cycle. Fig. 3 presenting
    starch and sucrose synthesis is given as an example with detailed synthesis pathways
    interpreted in Supplementary Information SI-1. However, the CBB cycle is limited
    by the low catalysis rate of RuBisCO in carboxylation and the RuBisCO-induced
    competing oxygenation reaction (Portis and Parry, 2007), which is sensitive to
    environmental variables (e.g. high temperature and drought) and leads to losses
    of 25–30 % C fixed (Raines, 2011). In comparison with C4 and CAM species, C3 species
    particularly fast growing C3 plants demonstrated strong response to atmospheric
    CO2 concentration with the enhanced yields under the elevated CO2 concentration
    (Poorter and Navas, 2003). Download : Download high-res image (602KB) Download

    carbon fixation to starch synthesis. The first stage of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham
    cycle (referred here as the Calvin cycle) involves the fixation of CO2 by RuBisCO
    and assimilation into the triose phosphate, 3PG, within the chloroplast. The second
    stage of the Calvin cycle is reduction of 3PG into G3P. G3P can stay within the
    Calvin cycle, or leave the chloroplast and join the gluconeogenesis pathway for
    metabolism into starch synthesis. The dashed line represents multiple metabolic
    steps. The third stage of the Calvin cycle involves the regeneration of RuBP which
    then closes the cycle2324 .Rectangles represent metabolites and the only enzyme
    highlighted for simplicity, is RuBisCO, located within the Calvin cycle. Abbreviations:

    complex nature evolutionary traits to suppress oxygenation (Sage, 2004) and is
    a series of biochemical activities partitioned between mesophyll and bundle sheath
    cells that are anatomically and biochemically distinct (Wang et al., 2012). The
    initial carbon fixation is the carboxylation reaction catalysed by phosphoenolpyruvate
    carboxylase (PEPC) for oxaloacetic acids (OAA) formation from CO2. OAA is further
    metabolised into malate, which diffuses into bundle sheath cell and decarboxylated
    to release CO2 27. The CO2 level within the bundle sheath layer can build up to
    over 10 times higher than the intercellular space thereby supressing the oxygenase
    activity of RuBisCO and the subsequent energy-wasteful oxygenation and resulting
    in increased photosynthetic yields (Wang et al., 2012). Benefiting from such metabolic
    mechanism (elaborated in (Sage et al., 2012)), C4 plants such as maize, sorghum,
    and sugarcane, miscanthus and a range of C4 grass (Osborne et al., 2014) demonstrate
    superior photosynthesis efficiency (approximately 50 % higher) and nitrogen and
    water use efficiency (WUE) (Majeran et al., 2010). Despite only occurring in less
    than 5 % of the global 250,000 plant species, C4 pathway contributes to 23 % of
    terrestrial gross primary productivity (Sage et al., 2012). Interestingly, a large
    percentage of grass species use C4 photosynthesis pathways. As shown in a comprehensive
    grass database covering 99.6 % of the 11 087 grass species, 42 % of those species
    use the C4 photosynthetic pathway with remaining 57 % using C3 pathway (Osborne
    et al., 2014). CAM as a photosynthetic adaptation mode, features temporal separation
    of C3 and C4 components and nocturnal CO2 uptake with optimised WUE, which is
    six-fold and three-fold higher than C3 and C4 species respectively (Borland et
    al., 2009; Escamilla-Treviño, 2012). Thus CAM plants e.g. Agave, Opuntia, and
    pineapple (Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.) have potential to grow in arid, degraded
    and marginal lands for food and bioenergy purpose (Yang et al., 2015a; Mason et
    al., 2015). The research on CAM metabolism can be traced back to 1960s-1970s;
    the biochemistry regulation as detailed in (Borland et al., 2009) may be defined
    as four phases (Osmond, 1978). In phase 1, CAM employs the PEPC enzyme for nocturnal
    CO2 uptake, where the HCO3– resulted from carbonic anhydrase action on CO2 is
    catalysed by PEPC to generate oxaloacetate. This is followed by the malate formation
    from oxaloacetate (catalysed by malate dehydrogenase) and its transportation into
    the vacuole for accumulation as malic acid. RuBisCO activation is considered to
    commence at the start of photoperiod, which lead to a short time window when CO2
    can be fixed by both PEPC and RuBisCO (phase 2). Malate decarboxylation for CO2
    regeneration in the intercellular spaces has been regarded as Phase 3, which is
    catalysed by different enzymes, depending on CAM species (Holtum et al., 2005).
    In phase 3, the regenerated and concentrated CO2 is re-fixed by RuBisCO behind
    closed stomata. A transition to Phase 4 is accompanied by the re-opening stomata
    for CO2 uptake by RuBisCO at Dusk. The duration of each phase in CAM cycle vary
    with species and their response to environment (Winter et al., 2008). 2.1.2. Photosystems
    and photosynthesis light reactions As described in Section 2.1.1 photosynthetic
    functions involve harvesting light to produce ATP and NADPH which are essential
    cofactors in downstream metabolism. Photosynthesis occurs within the thylakoid
    membranes inside the chloroplast. As proposed by Hill and Bendall (1960), the
    light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis involves a photolysis reaction, powered
    by light energy that splits a water molecule into molecular oxygen, an electron,
    and an hydrogen ion. The electrons are passed through a series of carrier proteins
    located within thylakoid membrane and through a series of oxidation/reduction
    reactions, results in the production of NADPH. The passing of electrons along
    the electron transport chain is coupled to the translocation of hydrogen ions
    across the thylakoid membrane which generates a proton gradient. The proton gradient
    produces a proton motive force that drives the production of ATP as a result of
    proton movement across the thylakoid membrane through the ATP synthase enzyme
    (Wilson et al., 2021). ATP and NADPH are then used to fuel the dark reactions
    of photosynthesis, which serve the purpose of fixing CO2 into metabolism. The
    coordinated activity of two distinct photosystems, Photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem
    II (PSII) are involved in the light capture by oxygenic organisms. PSII or water-plastoquinone
    oxidoreductase, can be regarded as the first protein complex in the light reactions
    of photosynthesis. Its core complex is composed of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and β-carotene
    bound to several polypeptides and surrounded by an antenna complex. Electrons
    producing from photolysis are funnelled into PSII and passed to the next electron
    acceptor, cytochrome b6f complex (Cyt b6f). The Cyt b6f functions to mediate the
    transfer of electrons towards the core reaction centre of the second photosystem,
    PSI via either Plastocyanin (PC) or a cytochrome c6 in Chlamydomonas (Juergens
    et al., 2015). The reaction centre core of PSI consists of a pair of Chl a molecules
    (Hankamer et al., 2001). Two main mechanisms of electron flows between two photosystems
    can be differentiated i.e. linear and cyclic electron flows (LEF and CEF) (Fig.
    4). During LEF, electrons are transferred from water to NADP via three major transmembrane
    complexes: PSII, Cyt b6f and PSI; whereas CEF mode only involves PSI and Cyt b6f
    (Joliot and Johnson, 2011) and functions in generating ATP and providing a pH
    gradient to induce non-photochemical quenching (Johnson, 2011a). In addition to
    LEF and CEF, there are several additional electron flows identified i.e. Mehler
    reaction (Mehler, 1951), Plastid Terminal Oxidase (PTOX) (Johnson, 2011a). Download

    schematic model of the light reactions of photosynthesis (A) during linear electron
    flow (B) sustaining a cyclic electron flow. In linear electron flow, electrons
    from the photolysis of H2O are passed along an electron transport chain resulting
    in the production of ATP and NADPH from the oxidation of water. In a cyclic electron
    flow electrons are injected back into the electron transport chain and mediated
    by ferredoxin via the PGR5 pathway (blue dashed line) or NDH pathway (red dashed
    line). As such, NADP-reductase is no longer the recipient of electrons, resulting
    in the regulation of NADPH synthesis Abbreviations: Cyt b6f: Cytochrome b6f complex,

    Plastoquinone. The detailed description on PSI and PSII functions in the light
    reaction of photosynthesis and roles of different electron transport pathways
    are provided in Supplementary Information SI-1. 2.1.3. The interaction between
    carbon metabolism and light reactions of photosynthesis Since the first investigation
    of the relationship between metabolism and photosynthesis carried out in the 1950’s
    (Bassham et al., 1950), a variety of mechanisms have since been described in the
    literature attempting to provide a further understanding of how carbon metabolism
    can regulate photosynthesis. These involve alternative electron flows (Johnson,
    2011b), inter-organelle metabolite transport (Johnson and Alric, 2013), and acclimation
    responses to changes in the environment (Johnson and Alric, 2012). The interaction
    mechanisms are elaborated from three aspects in the Supplementary Information
    SI-1 – increasing ATP production regulated by CEF, the modulated chloroplastic
    NADPH by malate shunt, cytosolic and chloroplast ATP regulated by triose-phosphate.
    2.1.4. Photosynthetic microbial cluster and implications on photosynthetic machineries
    In addition to the C3, C4 and CAM higher plant species, the phototrophic microbial
    cluster also play significant roles in biological CO2 sequestration. Microbial
    phototrophs include microalgae, oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophic prokaryotes,
    with the later encompassing taxonomically diverse groups of Bacteria and Archaea
    (Venkata Mohan et al., 2016; Kim and Gadd, 2008; Overmann and Garcia-Pichel, 2013).
    The diversity and some characteristics of the photosynthetic microbial cluster
    are shown in Table 1. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are the only microorganisms
    able to perform a plant-like oxygenic photosynthesis, assimilating CO2, producing
    organic carbon, and using two photosystems (PSI and PSII) which function in series
    connected via an electron transfer chain. Anoxygenic phototrophs perform photosynthesis
    without production of molecular oxygen and they do not use water as electron donor.
    Instead, they use a wide variety of inorganic and reduced organic carbon compounds
    as photosynthetic electron donors. In addition, anoxygenic phototrophs show variable
    protein and pigment compositions in their photosynthetic apparatuses. Although
    anoxygenic phototrophs thrive in all environments, their contribution to global
    primary production is small compared to the significance of oxygenic photolithotrophy.
    It has been concluded that aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophs do not contribute
    significantly to photosynthetically driven energy fluxes in eutrophic and mesotrophic
    temperate and subtropical aquatic environments (Goericke, 2002), even though their
    contribution to the marine carbon cycle may be significantly higher in the oligotrophic
    open sea (Kolber et al., 2001). However, this type of phototrophy seems to be
    more significant on the phyllosphere of terrestrial plants (Loyola et al., 2001).
    In aquatic environments, almost all net primary productivity is contributed by
    oxygenic photolitotrophs, with only 0.5 – 1  % attributable to anoxygenic photolithotrophs
    and chemolithotrophs (Raven, 2009). Furthermore, the contribution of cyanobacteria
    to oceanic primary productivity may be greater than it was thought previously.
    Taxa such as Acaryochloris marina, a Chl d-producing prokaryote which is widely
    distributed in coastal areas, and Chl f-producing cyanobacteria (e.g. Halomicronema
    hongdechloris) can use far-red light for growth (Gan and Bryant, 2015), and the
    contribution of far-red light photosynthesis to the primary productivity in marine
    environments has not been estimated (Miyashita, 2015). In photosynthetic organisms
    there are three major chemical groups of light-harvesting pigments, chlorophylls,
    carotenoids and phycobilins, which perform light absorption at different spectral
    regions. In addition, carotenoids protect chlorophyll against photo-oxidative
    damage in both plant and bacterial photosynthesis (Dall''Osto et al., 2014). Mirkovic
    et al. (2017) gave a comprehensive overview on the performances of the different
    light-harvesting machineries present in photosynthetic organisms thriving in diverse
    environments. Table 1. Characteristics of major groups of phototrophic prokaryotes.

    Some Cyanobacteria conduct anoxygenic photosynthesis with sulfide as an electron
    donor. 4 Prochlorococcus possesses divinyl-Chl a and divinyl-Chl b 5 BChl, bacteriochlorophyll;
    Chl, chlorophyll. The chemical structure and absorption spectra of photosynthetic
    pigments are available in 58. Chl d is its major pigment. Although the research
    in microbial photosynthesis and the comparison with higher plant-like photosynthesis
    can be traced back to 1930s (Stanier, 1961), there have been very few literature
    discussing the significance of the photosynthetic microbial cluster in the biological
    sequestration of CO2. However, the potential of microbial cluster in photosynthesis,
    CO2 sequestration and bioeconomy has started gaining research attention in the
    past few years. A comprehensive review has been conducted by Venkata Mohan et
    al. (2016) on microbial CO2 capture, which has led to a proposed biorefinery model
    catalysed by microorganisms. To date, six CO2 fixation pathways have been identified,
    which function under aerobic conditions (the CBB cycle, the 3-hydroxyproprionate
    pathway and the 3-hydroxypropionate-4-hydroxybutyrate cycle) and under anaerobic
    or microaerophilic conditions (the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, the reductive
    acetyl-CoA pathway, and the dicarboxylate-4-hydroxybutyrate cycle) (Saini et al.,
    2011). In plant, algae and oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria the Calvin–Benson–Bassham
    (CBB) cycle is the predominant CO2 fixation pathway, but this pathway is also
    used by a variety of anoxygenic phototrophs and non-photosynthetic microorganisms
    (Venkata Mohan et al., 2016). Within the Domain Bacteria, the CBB pathway has
    been demonstrated to operate in representatives of green-sulfur bacteria, cyanobacteria,
    alpha-, beta- and gamma-proteobacteria and Actinobacteria (Saini et al., 2011).
    In Actinobacteria capable of autotrophic growth (e.g. some strains of Pseudonocardia)
    the CBB cycle is the only CO2 fixation pathway that has been reported (Grostern
    and Alvarez-Cohen, 2013). Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton are the most
    important inorganic carbon fixers in the oligotrophic ocean and together contribute
    up to 50 % of the net primary productivity in the ocean, playing a key role in
    biogeochemical cycling (Flombaum et al., 2013). Here the biogeochemical cycling
    defined as the pathways, by which chemical substances and elements move through
    the biotic and abiotic compartments of Earth. These microphototrophs have evolved
    sophisticated and highly efficient systems called CO2-concentrating mechanisms
    (CCMs) to actively capture inorganic carbon (Ci) from the nearby environment and
    increase the CO2 concentration near RuBisCO by up to 1000-fold (Wang et al., 2015),
    thus counteracting the low solubility and diffusivity of dissolved Ci and the
    intrinsic limitations of RuBisCO (slow enzyme kinetics, poor discrimination between
    CO2 and O2 as substrates, and loss of photosynthetic efficiency due to photorespiration)
    (Ghosh and Kiran, 2017; Long et al., 2016). Microalgal and cyanobacterial CCMs
    include Ci transporters and subcellular microcompartments that contain RuBisCO
    and carbonic anhydrases (carboxysomes in Cyanobacteria, pyrenoids in algae). In
    Cyanobacteria, the CCM is composed by three active bicarbonate transporters: the
    medium-affinity Na+-dependent HCO3− transporter (BicA), a high affinity HCO3−
    transporter (BCT1 complex) and a high affinity, Na+-dependent HCO3− transporter
    (SbtA). Furthermore, there are two thylakoid-bound, active transporters of CO2
    (NDH-I3 and NDH-I4) and at least three ion exchangers (Long et al., 2016; Beardall
    and Raven, 2016). The Ci pumps concentrate HCO3− in the cytoplasm and the carbonic
    anhydrase dehydrates the cytosolic bicarbonate pool to CO2. The CO2 generated
    within the carboxysome is fixed into organic carbon by RuBisCO in the CBB cycle.
    Recent advances in biotechnology and synthetic biology have assembled a toolbox
    for genetic engineering of cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae and offer tailored
    chloroplast transformation tools for the redesign of some photosynthesis aspects
    in crop species. Via manipulating carbon-fixation pathways and redesigning the
    C3/C4 photosynthesis, gains in terrestrial crop productivity can be achieved (Ort
    et al., 2015). The integration of a complete and functional cyanobacterial and
    microalgal biophysical CCMs and the engineering of particular CCM components into
    C3 plants to improve the efficiency of photosynthetic CO2 uptake have been discussed
    (Price et al., 2013), although much research is still needed on the characterization
    of CCM genes, components and regulatory processes, as well as testing transgenic
    lines under realistic growth conditions (Long et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2016).
    As oxygenic phototrophs, cyanobacteria offer an attractive experimental platform
    for improving CO2 fixation in higher plants, because of their fast growth rates,
    their facile genetics, their evolutionary relationship to plant plastids and availability
    of genome sequences (Hagemann and Hess, 2018). Besides, the CCMs of cyanobacterial
    model organisms have been extensively studied (Price, 2011; Kupriyanova et al.,
    2013). Recent progress in engineering CO2-fixation pathway in C3 plants includes,
    for example, the introduction of cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters into
    plant chloroplasts, reconstruction of cyanobacterial carboxysomes and associated
    transporters in Escherichia coli and the generation of transgenic tobacco plants
    containing cyanobacterial RuBisCO (Bonacci et al., 2012; Rae et al., 2017; Lin
    et al., 2014). However, the introduction of eukaryotic microalgal biophysical
    CCMs to vascular plants may have a better potential because they share many photosynthetic
    and molecular characteristics, and their closer evolutionary relationship (Wang
    et al., 2015). 2.2. Biorenewable feedstock: terrestrial vs. aquatic biomass, wastes
    Biomass can be categorised based on their origins as terrestrial and aquatic biomass,
    as well as waste resources. Although the bio-product beneficial effects have been
    recognised (Creutzig et al., 2015), there is no consensus on the estimated future
    biomass supply-demand balance. As discussed in Section 2.1, the terrestrial or
    aquatic phototrophs invest a fraction of photosynthetic CO2 uptake by the ecosystem
    (termed as gross primary productivity (GPP)) on the biomass production. But their
    carbon use efficiency (CUE) and fixation as biomass resource vary with environmental,
    spatial and temporal factors (e.g. nutrient availability, climate zone) (Verlinden
    et al., 2013), with CUE ranging between 0.3 and 0.61 (Table 2). If using net primary
    production (NPP, quantified as the net amount of carbon assimilated in a given
    period by vegetation) (Krausmann et al., 2013) as an indicator of the ecosystem
    carbon fixation and biomass supply, the current terrestrial NPP adds approximately
    1.2 × 1011 ton dry vegetative biomass annually (50 % C assumed), storing 2200
    EJ energy in plant material (Guo et al., 2015a; Rafique et al., 2016), where non-agricultural
    terrestrial NPP contributes to nearly 75 % (4.5 × 1010 ton carbon fixation) (Cleveland
    et al., 2013). Table 2. Biomass resource comparison. Empty Cell Terrestrial Aquatic

    as ratio of growth to carbon assimilation for microbial cluster (Sinsabaugh et
    al., 2013) and ratio of NPP to GPP for higher plant (Yang et al., 2017b). Considering
    the themodynamic constraint, CUE upper limit for microbial system is 0.6. 2 Calorific
    value of organic fraction MSW is derived from International Solid Waste Association
    (2013). Based on their key chemical composition, biomass can be largely grouped
    as sugar and starch, lignocellulose, other carbohydrate, oil, lipid and protein
    (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory
    (NREL), 2004). Driven by a range of factors, including biomass species and parts,
    photosynthetic pathways, climate and soil variables and agricultural management
    (e.g. agrochemical inputs and field operations), the chemical composition vary
    significantly between different biomass groups (Vassilev et al., 2010). As demonstrated
    in Fig. 5, on the dry-weight ash-free basis (DAF), the carbon contents in higher
    plant species (C3 and C4 plants) fall into the range of 44.7–50.5 % whereas the
    microbial cluster showed higher C contents (above 50 %). The waste sectors represent
    another C-rich resource where the C contents vary from 43.6 % to 52.5 % (DAF basis).In
    general, microbial cluster is the most N nutrient rich source (around 10 %), followed
    by organic-N or ammonium-N containing waste resources (food waste, sludge, and
    manure with 4–7 % N contents). Higher plant species show very low N contents,
    ranging from 0.4 % to1.5 % (DAF basis). Therefore, the resource C:N ratios ranked
    from low to high are microbial cluster < waste < higher plant species (C3/C4 plants).
    Such elemental analyses along with other physiochemical properties and chemical
    composition can provide biomass performance indicators and design basis for biorenewable
    systems as they influence the conversion technology performance at process levels
    and the associated supply chain and network design at system-levels. Particularly
    for biological routes (e.g. anaerobic digestion), carbon and nitrogen are important
    substrates and nutrients for the microbial syntheses, which play important roles
    in the bio-conversion processes. Download : Download high-res image (774KB) Download

    2017), switch grass (Gaurav et al., 2017) manure (Chen. et al., 2003), food waste
    (WRAP, 2010). 2.2.1. Terrestrial biomass Terrestrial biomass refers to a range
    of food and non-food resources grown on terrestrial lands including arable, grass,
    forestry lands or abandoned lands. Amongst biomass resources, this is the most
    widely investigated biomass category. Despite of the focus on bioenergy, previous
    studies indicated the uncertainties in the global terrestrial biomass estimates,
    varying from around 30 EJ to over 1500 EJ per year (Smeets et al., 2007; Searle
    and Malins, 2015). Searle and Malins (2015) reviewed the key bioenergy modelling
    articles and based on the land constraints, theoretical resource potential, spatially-explicit
    biomass production costs and governance, revised the annual biomass estimates
    for energy as 60–120 EJ by 2050 and suggested that bio-based ambition is difficult
    to achieve sustainably. Alternative to business as usual scenarios, previous research
    explored the effects of agricultural intensification and optimised management
    on future terrestrial supply-demands (Mueller et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2013).
    Mauser et al. (2015) projected that the agricultural intensification and optimised
    land allocation will lead to nearly 40 % increase in the global biomass production
    potential, being sufficient to satisfy 2050 demands without cropland expansion.
    Tilman et al. (2011) and Mueller et al. (2012) highlighted the importance of sustainable
    intensification and optimal nutrient and water management in meeting the agricultural
    food demands with minimal environmental impacts. Galán et al. (2023) found terrestrial
    biomass cultivation compared favourably with direct air capture as a cost-effective
    method of extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Campbell et al. (2008)
    noted the potential of abandoned land for cultivating bioenergy crops. In addition
    to management strategies above, redesign of photosynthesis along with breeding
    approaches has been also proposed as terrestrial biomass solutions to bridge supply-demand
    gaps (Ort et al., 2015), considering the limited natural genetic variation in
    the enzymes and processes of plant photosynthesis. The bio-products derived from
    terrestrial food crops are regarded as first-generation (so called 1 G) biorenewables
    whereas those from terrestrial non-food lignocellulosic biomass can be classified
    as second-generation (2 G) biorenewables. Generally, a range of undesirable traits
    of terrestrial plants particularly 1 G crops constrain the sustainability of the
    terrestrial-dependent biorenewable sectors. Terrestrial crops suffer from inefficient
    CBB cycles of CO2-fixation, small fractions of edible biomass, and a high vulnerability
    to biotic and abiotic stress (e.g. pests and pathogens, flood and drought). Terrestrial
    biomass not only are stressed by increasing demands but also face the land-water
    resource scarcity and environmental and social constraints due to their intensive
    land and water inputs. Take 1 G bio-products as an example. Currently, agriculture
    sectors account for 37 % of global lands and 70 % of the water withdrawn for human
    use (FAO, 2011). As estimated by Mekonnen et al. (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2014),
    the global average water footprint for food crops range between 224–4363m3/ton
    where cereal crops were shown as main water consumers. By 2050, the agricultural
    water withdrawn of 3000 km3/yr and potential 2.8 billion ha rain-fed land use
    and expansion of 0.33 billion ha irrigated land are expected to take place in
    water-scarce regions and developing countries (FAO, 2011). This brings severe
    resource-competition issues with municipal and industrial needs in response to
    rapid urbanisation trends and economic growth. Terrestrial biomass are dominated
    by sugar crops (e.g. sugarcane, sugar beet), lignocellulosic feedstock (e.g. wheat
    straw, willow, miscanthus) and oil crops (e.g. rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, Jatropha)
    to derive monosaccharide (e.g. glucose, sucrose), polysaccharide (e.g. starch,
    cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin, protein, lipid, fatty acids and minerals.
    Amongst terrestrial biomass, lignocellulosic is the predominant biorenewable resource
    (Isikgor and Becer, 2015; Zhou et al., 2011) including agricultural residuals,
    forestry, lignocellulosic energy crops, grass etc., where cellulose is estimated
    as the most abundant organic compound on earth (Binder and Raines, 2010). The
    main structural compound groups comprising the lignocellulosic plant cell wall
    are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. In addition, there are other non-structural
    components within the plant cell wall, such as extractives, protein, ash, and
    pectin, varying greatly with species, tissue, plant maturity, harvest times, and
    storage. Fig. 5C reveals diverse lignocellulosic biomass composition, where the
    cellulose and hemicellulose contents range between 18–73 % (dry basis). C3 and
    C4 higher species sit at the upper range of the cellulose and hemicellulose composition
    (37.1–54.1 % and 22.8–31.2 % respectively), which demonstrate their great potentials
    for polysaccharide bioconversion. However, the technology design to convert lignocellulosic
    biomass to value-added biochemical remain a big challenge due to natural recalcitrance,
    chemical composition and structure complexity as well as the different re-activities
    of the 2 G compound groups (Zhou et al., 2011). As demonstrated in Table 3, three
    compound groups differ significantly. Cellulose is formed by the D-glucose subunits
    which are arranged in a crystalline structure of microfibrils, thus relatively
    resistant to thermal decomposition; whereas hemicellulose consist of different
    sugar monomers organised in random amorphous structure, thereby is the least thermally
    stable component. Due to the complex and interconnected linkages between p-hydroxyphenyl,
    syringyl and guaiacyl units in the three-dimensional polyphenolic polymer (Mohan
    et al., 2006; de Gonzalo et al., 2016), lignin shows high thermal stability with
    decomposition occurring across a wide temperature range (Jahirul et al., 2012).
    The bio-decomposition process highly depends on the compound complexity. Different
    from cellulose, which decompose catalysed by enzyme cellulase, hemicellulose complexity
    requires a set of enzymes to achieve decomposition (Lopez-Mondejar et al., 2016).
    Lignin is rather inert to degradation due to its aromatic nature and highly cross-linked
    polymer network (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2013). In the nature carbon cycle, white-rot
    fungi and ligninolytic bacteria deploy different types of enzymes degrading lignin
    (see Table 3). The state-of-the-art progress in ligniolytic bacteria and fungi
    enzyme systems, their delignification activities as well as potential applications
    in biotechnology have been well studied and summarised by the comprehensive reviews
    conducted by Pollegioni et al. (2015) and de Gonzalo et al. (2016). The reactivity
    of three compound groups in the presence of chemical reagents and non-thermal
    triggers have been widely investigated. Advances in reactivity and mechanisms
    underlying lignin depolymerisation and catalytic valorisation as well as the relationship
    between lignin structure and catalyst performance have been well presented in
    recent comprehensive reviews by Ma et al. (2015) and Rinaldi et al. (2016). For
    the polysaccharide components, in addition to the decomposition catalysed by different
    chemical reagents via biochemical and thermochemical routes (Zhou et al., 2011),
    emerging research on the depolymerisation activated by non-thermal sources (e.g.
    mechanical force, electric or magnetic field, waves, light, in situ heat) have
    been also highlighted (Jerome et al., 2016). The differed reactivity of three
    structural components are important parameters for designing biorefinery based
    on the processability of the 2 G biomass. Table 3. Lignocellulosic biomass reactivity.

    the biomass composition complexity. Overall, terrestrial biomass offer promising
    resources underpinning bioeconomy development and can be processed via diverse
    technologies and converted to value-added products. However, as summarised in
    Table 2, the sustainable exploition and development of terrestrial biomass still
    remain a challenge, where the resource-efficiency and other environmental sustainability
    are important design criteria for process and supply chain planning. This will
    be discussed in following sections. 2.2.2. Aquatic biomass Aquatic phototrophs,
    such as microalgae, macroalgae and seagrass, offer alternative resources to the
    terrestrial biomass. As summarised in Table 2, aquatic biomass demonstrates a
    range of favourable traits thus is in general considered as more environmentally
    sustainable but less economically feasible feedstock for biorenewable conversion
    compared with resources on lands (Florentinus et al., 2014). Based on the economic
    viability comparison, future potential aquatic biomass resources are estimated
    as 515 EJ/yr globally (Fig. 6), where four types of algae cultivation systems
    have been projected as the main contributors. Under elevated CO2 concentration
    in future, aquatic macroautotrops i.e. macroalgae and seagrass are predicted to
    respond strongly with increased photosynthetic and carbon use efficiency, which
    are similar to the estimated trends for C3 higher plant species (Koch et al.,
    2013). Download : Download high-res image (320KB) Download : Download full-size

    The term algae was used to refer to eukaryotic organisms either unicellular (microalgae)
    or multicellular (macroalgae). But this term often is expanded to include eukaryotic
    organisms and cyanobacteria and have been regarded as third or fourth-generation
    (3 G or 4 G) feedstock, gaining increasing research attentions recently. Algae
    are very diverse with over 40,000 species already identified (Gaurav et al., 2017;
    Suganya et al., 2016). In general, algae contains lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates
    that can be converted and upgraded to a variety of bio-products (e.g. hydrogen,
    bio-methane, biodiesel, jet fuel, bioethanol), varying with the types and strains.
    An overview of the key algal taxonomic groups and their properties have been presented
    by Suganya et al. (2016); the strain-specific algal composition comparison demonstrates
    that the macro algae contains higher carbohydrates (16–56 % dry basis) but much
    lower protein (5–21 %) than microalgae (47–63 % protein and 4–32 % carbohydrates
    on dry basis). As highlighted in Billion-ton report (Department of Energy et al.,
    2016), driven by the difference in growth medium, water and resource demands,
    storage nutrient and water recycling, algae and terrestrial feedstock present
    different supply and geographical trends. Generally, algae use non-portable water,
    showing much lower solid concentration and higher (around 90 %) nutrient and water
    recycling potential than terrestrial biomass; however, higher harvesting frequency
    and shorter storage duration can be expected for algae biomass. Currently, more
    than 90 % of microalgae production globally are being used for nutritional products.
    The estimate of total microalgae biomass production is 15,000 tons/year, of which
    about two-thirds is Spirulina, one-fourth is Chlorella, and the rest is Duniella
    and Haematococcus (Benemann, 2013). Algae cultivation is dominated by open pond
    system (>95 % of current microalgae biomass) whereas the scaling-up of photo bioreactor
    (a more productive and controllable cultivation systems) is constrained by the
    high operational and capital costs (Benemann, 2013). Microalgal strains have gathered
    special attention as promising aquatic resources for sustainable biorenewable
    production, particularly when compared to terrestrial plants (Brennan and Owende,
    2010; Singh and Olsen, 2011; Singh and Cu, 2010; Rehmanji et al., 2021). The main
    advantages include high resource-utilisation efficiency, ability to compete against
    wild strains in open ponds, tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions
    and seasonal variations, rapid growth and production cycles and high photosynthetic
    efficiency leading to high CO2 sequestration capacity (Singh et al., 2022). The
    overall solar energy conversion from resource to biofuel demonstrates that the
    solar energy return efficiency of microalgae is over 10 times higher than terrestrial
    crops (Dismukes et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2016). Such features could lead algal
    biorenewable production to be environmentally beneficial e.g. GHG mitigation potential
    and bioremediation potential. Microalgal cultures can tolerate and capture substantially
    higher level of flue gas CO2 emitted from industrial sources with a wide range
    of concentration from ambient (0.036 %v/v) to extremely high (100 % v/v) thus
    are considered as promising candidate carbon fixation technologies to mitigate
    CO2 (Singh and Olsen, 2011; Bhola et al., 2014; Benemann, 1997). Several studies
    have concluded that macroalgae as feedstock for CO2 fixation and biofuel production
    could deliver overall energy benefits, depending on conversion technology choices
    (Maghzian et al., 2022; Miranda et al., 2022; Aresta et al., 2005). Besides, the
    microalgal bioremediation of wastewater have been also examined. Previous research
    indicated that it could not only deliver environmental savings by avoiding artificial
    fertiliser inputs but also lead to reduced water demand (Farooq et al., 2015;
    Yang et al., 2011; Mu et al., 2014; Stiles et al., 2018). Higher energy yields
    per unit land (about 30 times more oil) than terrestrial feedstock plus the avoidance
    of competition of productive land with food bring algae bioproduct systems with
    potential sustainability benefits (Singh and Olsen, 2011; Clarens et al., 2010).
    As demonstrated by Campbell et al. (2011) and Clarens et al. (2010), algae perform
    better than terrestrial crops on GHGs, land use and eutrophication for biofuel
    production. Owing to the differed characteristics from terrestrial biomass, aquatic
    phototrophs offer promising resources for a wide range of conversion technologies
    particularly thermochemical and biochemical wet-route systems, which are energy-efficient
    for high moisture-content biomass. Besides, aquatic biomass offers desirable traits
    such as short storage duration and harvesting cycles, which are important design
    criteria for bioconversion process and network scheduling, logistics, value chain
    and system planning. 2.2.3. Waste biomass Country-specific waste profiles vary
    but an increasing waste generation trend could be expected in response to expanding
    population and rapid urbanisation globally. Considerable amount of carbon-containing
    and nutrient-rich waste resources in solid (e.g. food waste), liquid (e.g. sewage
    sludge) and gas phases (e.g. carbon-containing greenhouse gases (BIS, 2015, DEFRA,
    2012)) are generated annually and could be converted via various routes to bioenergy
    or value-added bio-products. In the EU, the 900 million tonnes of waste paper,
    food and forestry and agricultural residues generated annually is predicated to
    result in sufficient cellulosic waste biomass for 16 % of EU transport fuel by
    2030 (Wasted: European''s Untapped Resource, 2014). In the UK, wastewater is estimated
    as 16 billion litre per day, which together with annual production of over 100
    million tonnes of carbon-containing solid biowaste (e.g. BFMSW), above 14 million
    tonnes of forestry and agricultural residues and large amount of other waste provide
    significant opportunities (BIS, 2015). A scenario-based study has estimated the
    global theoretical potential of agricultural and forestry residuals (i.e. the
    maximum available residue from crop harvest and round wood logging operation)
    as 140–170 EJ/year by 2100 (Daioglou et al., 2016); if accounting for resource-competing
    sectors (e.g. livestock, traditional fuel use in developing regions), the 2100
    available residue would come to 50EJ/year. Globally, one-third of food produced
    is lost or wasted every year, which is responsible for over 7 % of the GHG emissions
    and the waste of 250 km (Green Alliance, 2013) water (8.5 % annual withdrawn),
    and 1.4 billion ha lands (28 % of agricultural lands) (FAO, 2016). This contributed
    to the global MSW generation. Out of 0.12–4.3 kg per day per capita global MSW,
    59 %-68 % is organic fraction (e.g. food waste, paper waste and green waste),
    varying with the regions (Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata, 2012). It is estimated to rise
    to 6.1 million ton/day by 2025 with over 65 % as organic fraction (Hoornweg and
    Bhada-Tata, 2012). A shift in the global MSW generation portfolio has been projected
    by World Bank, where the low-middle income countries (LMIC) are expected to contribute
    to 70 % by 2025. Similar in wastewater treatment (WWT) sector, rapid increase
    in water consumption and discharge (1.7 times more rapidly than population growth)
    (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2017) and rising LMIC
    contribution have been observed. FAO AQUASTAT database showed that out of the
    currently global freshwater withdrawal (3928 km3/yr), 56 % (2212 km3) is released
    either as industrial WW, municipal WW or agricultural drainage, of which only
    20 % is treated via WWT (United Nations World Water Assessment Programme, 2017;
    Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2017). Due to the low
    development level of national WWT infrastructure (8–38 % WWT in LMIC in contrast
    to 70 % WWT in high-income countries (United Nations World Water Assessment Programme,
    2017)), LMIC represents future WW resource potential. As highlighted in Table
    2, due to waste sector complexity, chemical compositions vary with the waste type
    and show higher environmental, temporal and spatial variability in comparison
    with terrestrial and aquatic phototrophs. Cite compositional variation in livestock
    manure and food waste as examples. The former is highly influenced by the livestock
    species, diet patterns (e.g. forage and fodder feeding (Guo et al., 2016)), age
    groups, soil and climate (Santos Dalólio et al., 2017); whereas the latter is
    dependent on the regional human behaviours, seasonal variation in the diets and
    waste degradation (WRAP, 2010; Adeogba et al., 2019a, Adeogba et al., 2019b).
    Sewage and livestock manure can be categorised as nutrient-rich waste while the
    high carbohydrate-containing waste category include starch-rich (e.g. food waste),
    lignocellulosic groups (e.g. agro and forest waste) and heterogeneous carbon-containing
    groups (e.g. wastewater). Compared with higher plant species (Fig. 5), wastes
    in general represent wider variation in C:N ratio (7.9–398) and polysaccharide
    contents (cellulose and hemicellulose total contents ranging within 18–68.6).
    Under the paradigm shift from waste treatment to resource recovery via thermochemical
    or biochemical routes, environmental sustainability and resource-recovery efficiency
    are important key design criteria for system and process planning. 2.3. Biorenewable
    thermochemical conversion routes Main technologies of advanced thermal chemical
    conversion of biomass include pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal liquefaction.
    Pyrolysis of biomass normally takes place at around 500 °C in the absence of oxygen,
    to decompose biomass materials into char residue, liquid products and non-condensable
    gases (Muzyka et al., 2023). Char and liquid oils are the main targeted products
    for the pyrolysis of biomass. Gasification of biomass happens at higher temperature
    (∼900 °C) in the presence of oxidant e.g. CO2, H2O or air, to produce synthetic
    gas (syngas) mainly including H2 and CO (Felix et al., 2022). Other gases such
    as CO2, CH4 and inert N2 (if air is used for gasification) are present in the
    syngas. Another main method of thermal chemical processing of biomass is hydrothermal
    liquefaction (HTL) (Ni et al., 2022), which normally occurs at up to 400 °C and
    50 MPa, to convert biomass into mainly liquid products. HTL can use wet biomass
    without excess drying, which is very energy intensive. Therefore, microalgae are
    normally processed using hydrothermal liquefaction technology. The three main
    thermal chemical conversion technologies for biomass processing are summarized
    in Table 4, covering advantages, disadvantages, process conditions and products.
    Table 4. Overview of biomass pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal liquefaction.

    microalgae, macroalgae and seagrass. -Sewage sludge For the deployment of the
    advanced thermal chemical of biomass, many factors need to be considered, such
    as the type of feedstock (Du et al., 2023), reactor design (Zulkornain et al.,
    2021), process control, catalyst addition, product quality and market requirement,
    in addition to the impacts on environment and society. Unlike coal, physical and
    chemical properties such as elemental compositions vary significantly between
    different biomass feedstock, which substantially affect the feedstock quality
    and processability. The change of moisture content, and the presence of ash/inorganic
    matters in biomass also make the operation of biomass conversion very challenging
    (Ge et al., 2022). The technical aspects of torrefaction pre-treatment, pyrolysis,
    gasification and HTL are addressed in Supplementary Information SI-2 where lignocellulosic
    biomass (Isikgor and Becer, 2015; Kumar et al., 2017b) is discussed in details.
    Typical properties of various lignocellulosic biomass feedstock are summarized
    in Table 3. Notably, the biomass component interaction (e.g. lignin acting as
    catalysts to promote secondary reactions for syngas production (Giudicianni et
    al., 2014)), biomass screening based on chemical composition (e.g. cellulose)
    play significant roles in the design of thermal chemical processing. In Supplementary
    Information SI-2, the processes of individual component of lignocellulose using
    pyrolysis, gasification and HTL are discussed, which are followed by the interactions
    between the three biomass components; SI-2 covers the underlying mechanisms of
    biomass conversion, key parameters affecting technology performance and proximate
    and ultimate analyses. These offer fundamental knowledge underpinning process
    design and systems modelling to optimise the technology configuration. 2.4. Biorenewable
    chemical and biochemical conversion routes Main technologies for advanced chemical
    and biochemical routes include acid, alkali and bio-catalytic conversion. As the
    example given in Fig. 7, many potential chemical and biochemical pathways can
    be integrated to transform different resources into value-added products. This
    section main discusses conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. Cellulose-first
    biorefining represents the most widespread technologies to convert structural
    carbohyrates of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels and bio-chemicals (e.g.
    fermentable sugars). Such cellulose biorefining strategy separates lignin polymers
    from the plant tissues via lignocellulosic delignification and uses lignin as
    a waste product or low-value energy fuel. Alternatively, lignin first biorefining
    has also been proposed (Qiu et al., 2019; Renders et al., 2017), where different
    types of lignin can be processed to generate useful products. Notably, the lignin
    composition, structural complexity and reactivity not only vary with lignocellulosic
    plant species and genotypes but mainly depend on upstream processing technologies
    and sectors (e.g. kraft lignin from paper industry, organosolv lignin from bioethanol
    refinery, soda lignin from industry process) (Kohnke et al., 2019). Download :

    and conversion pathways for biorenewable production. This section mainly focuses
    on cellulose first biorefining, where the fractionation pre-treatment can be grouped
    as chemical (e.g. alkali, acid, ionic liquid) pretreatment, thermal (e.g. steam),
    biological and physiochemical methods (e.g. mechanochemical). Extensive research
    have been published on pretreatment technologies; detailed technology comparison
    can be found in comprehensive reviews e.g. publications by Aditiya et al. (2016a),
    Kumar et al. (2017b), Zabed et al. (2016b) and Sivagurunathan et al. (2017b).
    As summarised in Table 5, overall, chemical routes render effective fractionation,
    however bring design challenges e.g. solvent recycling, reactor anti-corrosion.
    Physio-chemical or chemical routes may lead to cost-effective solvent-free but
    energy-intensive solutions. Despite the advantages of low-energy demand and effective
    lignin depolymerisation, biological routes might be challenged by low reaction
    rate and inhibitor generation issues. Table 5. Technology overview for biochemical

    costs (Anitha et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015)
    At conversion stage, enzymatic and acid hydrolysis are the mostly adopted technologies
    to derive fermentable monosaccharides from long chain of carbohydrate. This stage
    is critical since the quality of hydrolysate affects the subsequent treatment
    e.g. fermentation processes. In contrast to acid catalyst, enzyme is effective
    at a moderate condition hence leads to less capital investment; however, the production
    cost of enzyme has been acknowledged as barrier to enzymatic hydrolysis commercialisation
    (Aditiya et al., 2016b). Lignocellulosic hydrolysis catalysed by acids and enzymes
    have been covered in previous reviews (Zhou et al., 2011; Aditiya et al., 2016b;
    Modenbach and Nokes, 2013). Cellulase and xylanase are the mostly adopted enzymes
    to degrade cellulose and xylan (main compound forming hemicellulose) respectively;
    their mechanisms are discussed by Aditiya et al. (2016a). Notably, enzymes play
    significant roles in industrial biotechnologies for biorenewable production. In
    addition to the common sugars abundantly occurring in nature (d-glucose, d-fructose,
    d-galactose, d-mannose, d-ribose, d-xylose, and l-arabinose), other rare monosaccharides
    and sugar alcohols (e.g. xylitol, mannitol, erythritol as sugar substitutes) can
    also be produced at enzyme-catalytic reaction (e.g. oxidization reduction, epimerization)
    (Zhang et al., 2017). Such enzymatic production of value-added biorenwables have
    caused increasing research attentions (Zhang et al., 2017; Nevoigt, 2008). Fermentation
    underpinned by enzyme actions to convert biomass to value-added products is of
    particular interests for biorefinery manufacturing. The 14 top chemical list recommended
    by US Department of Energy (DOE) (Bozell and Petersen, 2010) has positioned the
    fermentation as the fundamental component of biorefinery. In addition to alcohol
    commodities (e.g. bioethanol, sorbitol, xylitol), DOE highlighted a range of chemicals
    converted from carbohydrates through advanced fermentation processes - heterocyclic
    compounds (e.g. furfural, HMF), organic acids (e.g. lactic acid, succinic acid,
    HPA, levulinic acid), isoprene, glycerol and fermentation derivatives (e.g. 1,3-propanediol).
    The emerging role of fermentation in carbohydrate biorefinery is reconfirmed by
    the UKBiochem10 report (Network, 2018), where 6 organic acids and 4 other building
    blocks are of commercial values. In addition, fermentation underpins the future
    food industries notably the new protein sources. Mycoprotein (Wiebe, 2002; Garcia-Garcia
    et al., 2017), which has been developed through 3000 strain screening and commercialised
    since 1985, represents a successful case of continuous fermentation technology
    for food manufacturing (meat protein substitute) (Trinci, 1992). In addition,
    other bacteria, yeast fungi and algae strains for single cell protein (SCP) production
    have emerged since 1950s (Strong et al., 2015). A review by Bogdahn (2015) provides
    a comprehensive view of SCP producing strains, which is followed by a review on
    SCP landscape and patents published by Ritala et al. (2017a) and a recent review
    on scale-up SCP biotechnologies (Banks et al., 2022). Interestingly, extensive
    research (Anitha et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2015; Gallezot, 2012; Hosseini and
    Wahid, 2016; Antoniou et al., 2019; Takaya et al., 2016; Tommaso et al., 2015)
    has been also performed on fermentation integration with thermochemical routes
    to form value-added bioproducts e.g. syngas fermentation (Wainaina et al., 2018).
    2.5. Biorenewable system complexity Analysing from whole system perspectives,
    a considerable number of bioproduct value chains are involved in biorenewable
    systems. Value chains are composed of a full set of functional value-adding activities,
    incorporating biological renewable or waste resources, refinery processes and
    technologies (Sections 2.3 and 2.4) that produce and distribute biorenewable commodities.
    Underpinned by biorenewable value chains, bioeconomy featuring biogenic carbon
    cycling, is circular by nature in contrast to the linear fossil-based economy.
    At upstream stages in biorenewable value chains, phototrophs and the related terrestrial
    and aquatic ecosystems represent potential carbon sinks for CO2 capture and storage
    (as reflected by CUE in Table 2). At downstream stages, the carbon sequestered
    into the biomass is either fixed or cycled back to natural or built environments
    after conversion and use of bio-renewable products. In the case of bio-waste derived
    biorenewables, an infinite closed-loop carbon circular system could be theoretically
    formed. Thus resource-circular biorenrewable manufacturing underpinned by a sustainable
    nexus of resource-biorenewable-waste, if fully realised, will signal the bio-sectors
    transformation. Despite the science and engineering advances, tackling the complexity
    in the biorenrewable systems provides significant challenges. Below the biorenewable
    derived from terrestrial biomass is given as an example to highlight the challenges-
    • Analysing biorenewable system complexity, the plant-environment interaction
    is driven by photosynthesis and biogeochemical cycles (defined as the pathways,
    by which chemical substances and elements move through the biosphere and physical
    environment of the Earth); whereas agriculture and refinery manufacturing are
    interconnected. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, biorenewable are interdependent on
    natural capital (land, water, air) and built environmental resources (e.g. energy
    generation) due to its origin from biological renewable resources. Thus, different
    biorenewable sectors e.g. food and biochemical compete on the same natural capital
    and built resources, leading to demand stress. • Biorenewable systems are not
    only regulated by environmental variability but also constrained by planetary
    boundaries (e.g. climate change, global freshwater use and land use boundaries
    (Rockström et al., 2009)). As addressed in Section 2.1, the interaction between
    living organisms including plant species and agro-ecosystem functions are underpinned
    by photosynthesis, which is driven by light energy to convert CO2 and H2O into
    metabolites and O2. C3 (e.g. wheat, willow, poplar), C4 plants (e.g. maize, sugarcane,
    miscanthus) have been the research focus as food and lignocellulosic resources.
    Their photosynthetic reactions and biochemical regulation differ significantly.
    Not only regulated by plant internal physiological traits and metabolism pathways,
    their photosynthetic efficiencies and N update are also influenced by a range
    of external environmental drivers (e.g. soil, atmospheric CO2 levels (Portis and
    Parry, 2007), water stress and temperature (Yamori et al., 2014)) at spatial scales.
    At upstream stages, plant biomass production and chemical composition vary significantly
    with plant species and also show spatial-temporal variation and uncertainties,
    which affect downstream bioproduct manufacturing. Further, the biorenewable systems
    are constrained by land and water resource availability under ongoing environmental
    change as well as other planetary boundaries (e.g. stratospheric ozone depletion;
    ocean acidification (Rockström et al., 2009)). Thereby, it is important to address
    interdependency of natural resources, biorenewable and environment while analysing
    biorenwable systems. • Biorenewable systems consist of subsystems across temporal/spatial
    scales including natural capital resources (e.g. land, water and air), agro-ecosystems,
    refinery manufacturing, waste and pollutant fate and treatment, transport and
    network. Subsystems in particular those across different biorenewable value chains
    often are regarded as disconnected. Take lignocellulosic conversion as an example.
    A considerable amount of empirical research has been published on conversion technologies
    for lignocellulosic monosaccharides. Such empirical advances represent fragmented
    subsystems, which are discounted from the value chains of food and feed production
    (e.g. microbial protein). However, these sub-systems are interlinked by underlying
    carbon, nitrogen (C/N) cycles and resource circulation including biogeochemical
    cycles, water cycles, resource conversion and waste recovery. To unlock the subsystem
    fragments and enhance resource efficiency across renewable value chains, advanced
    whole system modelling offers an approach to push the research frontier on biorenewable
    systems design. • Across the biorenewable value chains, different decision criteria
    and spaces are concerned. Fig. 2 highlights considerable numbers of potential
    pathways (value chains) interconnecting biomass, conversion technologies and final
    biorenewable vectors. Across biorenewable value chains, multi-groups of interactive
    stakeholders are involved in the decision-making. Fig. 8 generalises a sector-independent
    stakeholder map - feedstock and resource providers, existing bioproduct manufacturers,
    new biorenewable developers and operators, distribution centres, end-users, governmental
    agencies, policy makers and regulators and finance systems, thereby leading to
    diverse decision spaces. To achieve the new biorenewable technology deployment,
    it is essential to consider the entire value chains but also the interaction of
    different stakeholder groups with conflicting decision criteria. Download : Download

    for innovative biorenewable systems under circular bio-economy. • Biorenewable
    system development under Fourth Industrial Revolution (so called Industry 4.0)
    vision (National Academy of Science and Engineering, 2013) represents an opportunity
    for bio-sectors transformation. Creation of intelligent biorenewable sectors and
    overcoming data barriers would not have been possible prior to Industry 4.0 (National
    Academy of Science and Engineering, 2013). Industry 4.0 envisages agriculture
    and manufacturing, where resources, bio-products and machines are all connected
    via the internet to achieve smart collection and analyses of real-time data and
    coordinated processes. Under this vision, emerging digital technologies and data
    advances (e.g. smart machinery, remote sensing) provide tremendous opportunities
    for biorenewable systems - enabling coordinated agriculture and manufacturing
    systems and bringing real-time data and information to precision decisions. Such
    advances also demand responsive decision-making, which requires a significantly
    reduced decision time with a trade-off with solution optimality. Overall, terrestrial,
    aquatic biomass and waste resources can be converted into value-added biorenewables,
    which can be regarded as highly complex systems of flows and processes that are
    subject to nonlinearity, sensitivity and uncertainty. Biorenewables involve a
    range of conflicting and interacting issues such as sub-system interdependency,
    plant-soil-climate interaction, resource-competition, trade-offs between sustainability
    criteria, the interaction of bio-renewables with the evolving energy, water and
    waste sectors. It is essential to apply a whole systems approach and resilient
    and sustainable thinking (Stockholm Resilience Centre, 2014) to biorenewable design
    in order to increase the overall capacity for tackling environmental stresses
    or socio-economic changes over the coming decades. Not only are sustainable resource
    management strategies for safeguarding agro-ecosystems necessary, but also biorefinery
    design needs to consider sustainability and resilience criteria in a spatial-temporal
    transition context. To advance understanding of biorenewables and inform robust
    solutions, a unifying modelling approach to account for varied nonlinearity and
    sensitivity of different computational methods is necessary. Despite the clear
    importance, development and applications of advanced modelling tools to transform
    isolated subsystems to a performance-maximised biorenewable cluster with interconnected
    smart machinery and real-time data analyses remains unexplored. Digital technologies
    and data advances have the potential to bring improved responsiveness and flexibility,
    enhanced collaboration across supply chains for identifying and analysing resources
    and bio-products, and impact new biorenewable cluster creation. Beyond the state-of-the-art,
    an emerging research frontier is to bring data advances into responsive yet precision
    decision-making for the multi-scale decision spaces across biorenewable systems.
    Modelling research advances will be discussed in the Section 3. 3. Multi-scale
    biorenewable systems modelling The biosector transformation calls for leading-edge
    research on multi-scale system modelling, which tackles the biorenewable complexity
    across scales and enables the optimal design of resource-circular manufacturing
    systems by capturing the interdependencies across resource-biorenewable-waste
    nexus. Through comprehensive review of state-of-the-art computational methods,
    this section highlights the modelling gaps and future research frontiers to address
    biorenewable complexity. Specifically, this section reviews metabolic and biogeochemical
    models, quantitative sustainable evaluation, spatial data analyses, process design
    and simulation and mathematical optimisation. 3.1. Metabolic and biogeochemical
    modelling A multi-scale design by integrating modelling approaches with scientific
    innovation could not only lead to carbon closed-loop systems to fix CO2 but also
    open up bioclusters to express our sustainable bioeconomy aspirations. This section
    provides an overview of multi-scale modelling approaches applied to the biomass
    systems. 3.1.1. Implementing System Biology to understand global metabolism Systems
    Biology is branch of science that looks at the global properties of a biological
    system being studied. Our knowledge of the foundations of living organisms, in
    terms of the components of cells, tissues, and organs has been expanded due to
    advances in high-throughput experimentation. Entire genomes of several organisms
    have now been sequenced and the gene expression profiles have been comprehensively
    generated (Fang et al., 2020). Mass spectrometry-based protein surveys have quantified
    the global proteome (Vidova and Spacil, 2017) and the metabolome on cellular and
    organismal levels (Beale et al., 2018). Advances in molecular and cell biology
    have provided information on how proteins are organised to orchestrate the functions
    of subcellular systems while physiology has shed further light on the complex
    functions of cells, tissues, and organ systems. This enormous amount of information
    at different scales of organisation can be used to obtain a new perspective that
    starts from genes and proteins, moves through subcellular interactions and pathways,
    and ends in the physiology of cells, tissues, and organ systems that determines
    the phenotype (Bruggeman and Westerhoff, 2007). Systems Biology, therefore, offers
    an opportunity to study how the phenotype of an organism is generated from the
    genotype that is responding to its environment. This combination of omics data
    and advances in computational analytical methods allows for a greater understanding
    of the data (Bruggeman and Westerhoff, 2007). For the application of biotechnology,
    metabolism is the process in which photosynthetic organisms assimilate external
    substrates, such as CO2 or acetate, into biomass rich in high value metabolites
    and understanding how metabolism can be directed to produce high quantities of
    high value compounds is key to a successful bioeconomy. A knowledge of metabolism
    is therefore invaluable in engineering microalgal strains optimised for efficient
    carbon uptake, assimilation and metabolism into high value bioproducts (da Silva
    Lima and Segato, 2022). Computational models that describe metabolism can predict
    metabolism, whose results can be used to make novel model-driven hypothesis on
    how metabolism can be engineered to benefit the bioeconomy. 3.1.1.1. Metabolic
    modelling Modelling metabolism can be undertaken using a variety of approaches,
    including kinetic, logic and stoichiometry-based methods (Machado et al., 2011).
    Classical kinetic modelling approaches describe the rate of change in the concentration
    of a metabolite based on the kinetic properties of individual enzymes, using the
    corresponding experimentally derived parameters (e.g., rate constant, maximum
    reaction velocity and dissociation constants) (Resat et al., 2009). Small metabolic
    networks (typically fewer than 50 reactions) can be modelled using kinetics (Baghalian
    et al., 2014). The ability to model particular metabolic pathways such as the
    TCA cycle has given a greater understanding of how metabolic steps are regulated
    by enzymes that have the tightest control of the metabolic system (Smallbone et
    al., 2013). The TCA cycle has also been modelled using differential equations,
    giving further information about alternative TCA cycles that could theoretically
    exist (Sweetlove et al., 2010). An example of a kinetic model of photosynthesis
    is e-photosynthesis, representing C3 photosynthesis as performed by wheat, rice
    and soybean crops (Zhu et al., 2013). This model consists of 50 differential rate
    equations that account for light absorption, hydrolysis, LEF accounted for NAPDH
    and ATP synthesis, along with CEF. Carbon fixation and assimilation up to sucrose
    synthesis was also represented in the model. The model was successful in accurately
    predicting qualitative and quantitative experimental data. Increases of photon
    flux led to the prediction of increased oxygen evolution, luminal pH and increased
    chlorophyll fluorescence, in line with experimental evidence (Sargent, 1940; Steinberg-Yfrach
    et al., 1998; Osborne et al., 1997) Kinetic modelling is, however, limited to
    the current biochemical and experimental knowledge regarding the reactions being
    modelled. All reaction parameters, such as enzyme concentrations and their kinetic
    properties have to be accurately estimated in experimental conditions that mimic
    that of the cell to give meaningful results. Importantly, metabolic control analysis
    has taught us that control of a system is an inherent property of the global system,
    since metabolic control can be distributed among various metabolic steps (Westerhoff
    et al., 2009). Therefore, the greater the number of metabolic interactions, the
    greater the dispersal of metabolic regulation. By choosing to model selected pathways
    we are choosing to ignore any regulatory steps. 3.1.1.2. Simulating genome scale
    models using flux balance analysis Metabolism is derived from the enzymes encoded
    by the genome; therefore, a complete knowledge of the genome would give a complete
    knowledge of metabolism for a given organism A GEnome scale Model (GEM) represents
    all known metabolic reactions in an organism and is reconstructed primarily from
    genomic information and the literature. Computational tools have been developed
    to analyse the system properties of GEMs. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is one such
    example that employs liner programming to optimise a defined biological objective
    (e.g., to maximise growth, or ATP production). In doing so, all input substrate
    fluxes and internal metabolic fluxes are directed to the objective reaction and
    in doing so, steady-state fluxes through all the reactions within the model are
    quantified. These quantified fluxes are thus deterministic upon available substrates
    and serve as metabolic predictions (Orth et al., 2010). Knowledge of metabolite
    stoichiometry, metabolite and enzyme localisation, and biomass constituents are
    sufficient to generate predictions of metabolism, but integration of omic data
    that quantify the contributions made of each reaction within the GEM will give
    enhanced and reliable predictions of global metabolism (Santos et al., 2011).
    By calculating steady-state metabolic fluxes through the GEM under specific conditions,
    i.e, mixotrophic algal growth on acetate versus phototrophic algal growth, the
    metabolic contributions of independent pathways can be observed and analysed with
    respect to the specified condition. The underlying assumptions behind FBA is that
    metabolic pathways operate at steady state, and that biological systems have evolved
    to be as efficient as possible. The advantage behind this approach is that other
    kinetic parameters associated with the reactions can be ignored (Yizhak et al.,
    2010). GEMs have proven useful for assessing the essentiality of metabolic steps
    (Henry et al., 2006), improving metabolic engineering strategies by simulating
    gene knockouts (Kennedy et al., 2009; Matsuda et al., 2011), and for elucidating
    metabolism giving rise to observed physiological traits (Dal''Molin et al., 2011).
    As represented in Fig. 9, the first step of FBA is to mathematically represent
    a metabolic network in the form of a stoichiometric matrix (S), composed of rows
    of metabolites and columns of reactions. For each reaction within the matrix,
    metabolites that are consumed in that particular reaction are given a negative
    stoichiometric coefficient, whilst metabolic products are represented by a positive
    coefficient. The next step involves defining an objective function (Z) that is
    biologically relevant to the problem being studied. For predicting growth, for
    example, maximisation of biomass might be the best objective function, since biomass
    reactions contain all nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, etc., that are required
    for cell division. Another example of an objective function could be the optimal
    production of a target metabolite of interest or the minimisation of an expensive
    nutrient. The reaction that is deemed suitable as the objective reaction can either
    be maximised or minimised on the assumption that selective processes during evolution
    guide any systems towards an optimal state. Download : Download high-res image

    analysis to model metabolism. (a) Metabolic genes from annotated genomes of interest
    and metabolic knowledge lead to global metabolic reactions. (b) Integration of
    all the metabolic reactions through shared metabolites results in the construction
    of a global metabolic network for the system of interest. (c) The metabolic network
    is converted into a stoichiometric matrix (S matrix), where columns represent
    reactions and rows represent metabolites and each entry represents the reaction
    coefficient of a particular metabolite in a reaction. Metabolites consumed by
    a reaction are given a negative coefficient, whereas positive coefficients are
    given to metabolites that are produced. (d) With the S matrix and the objective
    function of the model set as a system of linear equations, one can solve for the
    flux distributions throughout S. The phenotypic solution space (shaded blue rectangle)
    is where all possible solutions of flux distribution reside, and each axis represents
    the metabolic flux of a reaction in S. (e) Applying additional constraints will
    reduce the allowable solution space. (f) One or multiple optimal solutions can
    be found in the allowable solution space that optimises the objective function
    of the model (as represented by the pink dot) (Orth et al., 2010). A further critical
    step involved with FBA is the application of constraints upon the matrix. Constraints
    are represented as upper and lower bounds for all reactions, which determine maximum
    and minimum allowable fluxes of reactions. For the constrained matrix (S), the
    overall reaction flux vector (v) in matrix S at steady state equals zero (S.v = 0)
    ensuring a global mass balance through the matrix. It is for this reason why FBA
    is a constraint-based modelling approach. The final step involves optimising the
    objective function using linear programming, which satisfies the steady state
    assumption. Metabolic networks are branched, and this branching allows for the
    possibility to generate several metabolic solutions that all satisfy the objective
    under the same constraints, because metabolic fluxes can be rerouted and/or distributed
    through each branching point. The flux solutions are limited by the constraints
    imposed on the system, resulting in the allowable flux entering a theoretical
    phenotypic solution space. The greater the applied constraints, the tighter the
    available solution space will become with less. (Varma and Palsson, 1994). Analysis
    of the pathways carrying the greatest flux gives an indication of the metabolic
    pathways most likely to have been used in order to achieve a given objective.
    3.1.1.3. Flux variability analysis In theory, the phenotypic solution space, (shaded
    blue in Fig. 9) is not limited to single solution and so contains all possible
    flux combinations that the cell can use to sustain its objective function under
    the imposed constraints. FBA identifies one optimal solution in the presence of
    co-existing alternative optimal solutions. By using the principles that drive
    FBA whilst constraining the objective function at a given value, it is possible
    to calculate the range of possible minimal and maximal fluxes for each reaction
    in the network that give rise to the same optimal objective using a method called
    Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) (Gudmundsson and Thiele, 2010). As a result all
    alternative reactions that could carry a flux can be sought, giving rise to alternative
    pathways that still conform to the phenotypic phase plane. A number of computational
    tools have been produced to analyse the fluxes resulting from a GEM using FBA.
    Becker et al. (2007) developed a Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis
    (COBRA) toolbox, a software package running from within the MATrix LABoratory
    (MATLAB) environment, and is also freely available for the Python and R environments
    (Ebrahim et al., 2013; Conway, 2023). COBRA, and COBRApy allows for the quantitative
    prediction of both steady-state and dynamic optimal growth behaviour cellular
    flux and remains the most widely used method to model metabolism to date (Becker
    et al., 2007; Jenior et al., 2023). 3.1.1.4. Metabolic model advance of microbial
    cluster GEMs have been constructed for many organisms including eukaryotic bacteria
    (Durot et al., 2009), cyanobacteria (Vu et al., 2012), yeast and photosynthetic
    organisms such as plants (de Oliveira Dal''Molin et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2011)
    and microalgae (Dal''Molin et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2011; Boyle and Morgan,
    2009a). Out of the various models of microalgae, it is the model organism Chlamydomonas
    Reinhardtii that has been most widely studied using metabolic modelling. The first
    metabolic model of C. reinhardtii consisted of 484 reactions and 454 metabolites
    compartmentalised between the chloroplast, mitochondrion and cytosol (Boyle and
    Morgan, 2009b). The model was simulated to mimic phototrophic and mixotrophic
    growth at varying light levels using FBA. Phototrophic growth simulations predicted
    carbon fixation into the CBB cycle, and LEF of electrons through the photosynthetic
    reactions were predicted to produce NADPH. Mixotrophic simulations at periods
    of low light suggested an inhibition of carbon fixation into the CBB cycle because
    RuBisCO was inactive. At higher light levels, carbon fixation into the CBB was
    resumed by RuBisCO activity, and acetate was predicted to be assimilated into
    the glyoxylate cycle. Higher light levels also resulted in increased flux through
    LEF, producing more NAPDH than needed for biomass synthesis which then allowed
    for the fixation of carbon into the CBB. Despite qualitative and quantitative
    insights into carbon metabolism and light, the model did not contain CEF. In addition,
    the model contains an under representation of known reactions and metabolites
    as compared to other FBA models. AlgaGEM, a genome-scale metabolic network model
    of C. reinhardtii represents a more complete GEM, accounting for 1725 reactions
    involving 1862 metabolites (Dal''Molin et al., 2011). This model included the
    glyoxylate cycle within a microbody, in addition to cytoplasm, mitochondrion,
    chloroplast and nucleus compartments. AlgaGEM was constructed of the back of AraGEM,
    a GEM of Arabidopsis thaliana (de Oliveira Dal''Molin et al., 2010), and so 85
    % of reactions were identical between the two models. AlgaGEM was designed to
    investigate maximum hydrogen production in C. reinhardtii and was modelled under
    phototrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic simulations. Predictions from heterotrophic
    growth on acetate suggested acetate was assimilated into both the glyoxylate and
    TCA cycles. In this study, the CEF was associated with hydrogen production because
    mixotrophic growth predicted the activation of CEF, and resulted in a decrease
    of hydrogen production. The authors concluded that hydrogen itself is able to
    accept excess electrons when CEF is inhibited, providing a regulatory role of
    the reaction. This study has shown how predictive modelling can be used to address
    how physiological manipulations can give rise to emergent traits. However, the
    role of acetate and its effects on photosynthesis were not addressed. iRC1080
    is a more recent and dedicated metabolic model of C.reinhardtii that was developed
    to investigate light-driven metabolism (Chang et al., 2011). This model accounts
    for 2190 reactions encoded by 1080 genes, 1068 metabolites and 10 compartments
    which included a glyoxysome. This model contained more than 32 % of estimated
    genes with known metabolic functions, which remains a significant increase over
    previous reconstructions. Another key feature of this model is centrality of the
    chloroplast, accounting for over 30 % of reactions in the model and displaying
    the importance of the chloroplast in carbon metabolism. Furthermore, the model
    was able to qualitatively predict correct oxygen evolution and growth rate with
    varying light sources and photon flux, thus displaying a greater coverage of the
    photosynthetic reactions. The iRC1080 model was then used to predict the flux
    of carbon metabolism and photosynthesis for mixotrophic and phototrophic conditions.
    The functioning of a CEF was predicted to be play an essential physiological role
    to assimilate acetate and to support a high biomass growth (Chapman et al., 2017).
    The results also suggested that acetate inhibits RuBisCO, which was recently confirmed
    (Saint-Sorny et al., 2022). Such modelling advances can help to inform the system
    design of various microalgal species as phototrophic microbial feedstock for enhanced
    biometabolite production. Overall, omics-enabled metabolic modelling can advance
    the understanding of the phototrophic microbial cluster in biological CO2 sequestration
    and carbon cycling in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Thereby, metabolic
    models not only can inform the large-scale biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem
    food webs but also can be integrated with first-principle modelling to explore
    the CO2 conceptual refinery proposed by Venkata Mohan et al. (2016). By manipulating
    and designing versatile microbial consortia for carbon sequestration, CO2 will
    be transformed from a GHG to a commodity, which can be metabolised to platform
    chemicals under circular bioeconomy. Driven by CO2-underpinned resource-circular
    aspiration, the integrative modelling at the interface of Systems Biology and
    Process Systems Engineering to combine metabolic modelling with chemical process
    design and optimisation represents a future research frontier. 3.1.2. Biomass
    production modelling 3.1.2.5. Models for terrestrial higher plant biomass production
    Photosynthesis is critical to the production of biomass, which underpins the complex
    interactions between organisms and ultimately, ecosystem functions. For higher
    plant species, photosynthesis is not only regulated by plant internal physiological
    traits and metabolism pathways, but is also affected by a range of biotic and
    abiotic environmental drivers such as climate, weather extremes, soil type and
    nutrient availability. The plant traits and environmental impacts are captured
    in bioenergy biomass crop production models such as MiscanFor for Miscanthus and
    C4 energy grasses (Hastings et al., 2009a), Forestgrowth–SRC for various species
    of woody trees used for short rotation coppicing (SRC) (Tallis et al., 2013) or
    the ESC-CARBINE model for short rotation forestry (Hastings et al., 2014a; Hastings
    et al., 2014b), which is a combination of the CARBINE model (Edwards and Christie,
    1981) and the ESC model (Pyatt et al., 2001). Environmental changes such as elevated
    atmospheric CO2 levels, changing climate, and the increased intensity and frequency
    of extreme weather events could cause a widespread shift in photosynthetic patterns
    and regulators e.g. electron transport and RuBisCO capacity (Sage and Kubien,
    2007), where the response of different plant species may vary. With the rise in
    atmospheric CO2 levels and associated global warming, RuBisCO capacity is expected
    to have a smaller role in limiting C3 photosynthesis (Portis and Parry, 2007)
    and species and genotypes with heat stability traits will be favoured for electron
    transport capacity (Sage and Kubien, 2007). Previous studies on the temperature
    response of photosynthesis suggested that C3 plants generally showed a greater
    propensity for temperature acclimation, C4 plants tend to be more adaptive to
    warm environments, whereas CAM species acclimate photosynthetic activities to
    temperature differently over day and night (Yamori et al., 2014). Photosynthetic
    efficiency dynamically adapts to a variety of internal physiological and external
    environmental factors, meaning that photosynthesis is heterogeneously distributed
    over leaves or organs over time. Such spatio-temporal variation has been reflected
    in previous modelling approaches, where regulatory properties, photosynthetic
    reactions and carbon assimilation potentials were simulated. Farquhar et al. (1980)
    proposed a C3 leaf photosynthesis mode, capturing the enzyme kinetics and electron
    transport and photosynthetic responses to multiple and interactive environmental
    variables. This model was further adapted by Collatz et al. (1992) to formulate
    a leaf biochemical-intercellular transport model for C4 plants, where photosynthesis
    was expressed as a function of temperature, intercellular CO2 partial pressure
    and incident solar radiation. In previous research on C3 and C4 pathways, gross
    photosynthesis and carbon assimilation have been estimated not only via correlations
    with crop physiological factors e.g. leaf area, assimilate allocation (Spitters,
    1986), plant respiration (Penning de Vries et al., 1989), nitrogen uptake (Zhang
    et al., 2002), but also via links with environmental drivers e.g. atmospheric
    CO2 concentration (Goudriaan, 1986), light interception (Penning de Vries et al.,
    1989) water and nutrient availability and stress, soil and ambient temperature
    (Zhang et al., 2002; Robertson et al., 2015; Hastings et al., 2009b). Compared
    with C3 and C4 plants, CAM plants have received less systematic study. The net
    CO2 uptake was often estimated based on the empirical environmental productivity
    index (Nobel, 2003; Garcia-Moya et al., 2011). A first order differential model
    proposed by Nungesser et al. (1984) formulated time-dependent concentration of
    metabolites as a function of atmospheric CO2 concentration and light, which was
    further modified to include other factors, i.e. light intensity and temperature
    effects (Nungesser et al., 1984; Blasius et al., 1997). This model was further
    adapted by Owen and Griffiths (2013) which led to a system dynamic model integrating
    biological constants (e.g. enzyme kinetics) and capturing four distinct CAM cycle
    phases. Modelling efforts have been also made to correlate water availability
    to C assimilation (Comins and Farquhar, 1982) and coupling CAM photosynthesis
    with wider environmental parameters. Recent work by Bartlett et al. (2014) proposed
    a dynamic model incorporating a CAM leaf photosynthesis model adapted from a C3
    model (Nungesser et al., 1984), circadian C-flux dynamical model, stomatal conductance
    equation and soil-plant-atmosphere. Such photosynthesis models e.g. C3 model by
    Farquhar et al. (1980) have been widely used to model leaf biochemistry to canopy
    and ecosystem exchange in response to environmental change (von Caemmerer and
    Farquhar, 1981; Long, 1991) and constant/periodical environmental conditions (Hartzell
    et al., 2015). Particularly, C3 and C4 photosynthesis models have been incorporated
    into site-scale crop-growth or large-scale vegetation models (Yin and Struik,
    2009) e.g. GECROS (Yin and Laar, 2005), Agro-IBIS (Foley et al., 1996), WIMOVAC
    (Humphries and Long, 1995). In the crop models, subtracting the plant respiration
    (Penning de Vries et al., 1989) from gross photosynthesis, the derived net C assimilation
    can be partitioned between leaf, stem, grain, shoot and root (Zhang et al., 2002)
    to project biomass growth. In fact, crop growth are closely related to wider environmental
    processes e.g. soil biogeochemical processes and hydraulic dynamics, and such
    complexity can be captured by terrestrial biogeochemical models linking crop physiological

    al., 2017, Peltoniemi et al., 2007) that evaluate the carbon and nitrogen cycles
    and water flows that control the flows of nutrients in soil. These range from
    models that consider the decomposition of organic carbon in soils like the RothC
    (Coleman et al., 1997; Jenkinson and Coleman, 2008)and the cohort models developed
    by Bosatta and Ågren (1996), Bosatta and Berendse (1984), Bosatta and Ågren (1995),
    Bosatta and Ågren (1994), Bosatta and Ågren (1985), Bosatta and Ågren (1999),
    Bosatta and Agren (1991) and models that just consider the nitrogen cycle of nitrification/denitrification
    and plant uptake like Sundial (Bradbury et al., 1993) and hydrology models like
    SWAT (Devia et al., 2015) to models that include all processes like DayCent (Parton
    et al., 1998), ECOSSE (Smith et al., 2010a, Smith et al., 2010b) and DNDC (Li
    et al., 1992; Li, 2000; Li et al., 2006; Li et al., 1994). To take one model in
    more detail to understand how it evolved, DNDC is one of the most widely-used
    process-oriented biogeochemistry models and has been validated worldwide (Wang
    et al., 1997; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2002; Brown et al.,
    2002; Cai et al., 2003; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2004; Grant et al., 2004; Babu
    et al., 2006; Beheydt et al., 2007; Abdalla et al., 2009). The DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition)
    model was first proposed by Li et al. (1992); over two-decade development, numerous
    changes have been implemented to DNDC model to bridge functional gaps and be adapted
    to region- or user-group specific versions UK-DNDC (Brown et al., 2002), DNDC-Europe
    (Guo et al., 2015b) forest-DNDC, manure-DNDC (Li et al., 2012). A schematic family
    tree has been reviewed and presented by Gilhespy et al. (2014). DNDC embed biogeochemical
    processes (e.g., plant growth, organic matter decomposition, fermentation, ammonia
    volatilization, nitrification, denitrification) to compute transport and transformations
    in plant-soil ecosystems. Specifically, DNDC has two components – (1) soil climate,
    crop growth, and decomposition sub-models, converts primary drivers (e.g., climate,
    soil properties, vegetation, and anthropogenic activity) to soil environmental
    factors (e.g., temperature, moisture, pH, redox potential, and substrate concentration
    gradients); (2) nitrification, denitrification, and fermentation sub-models, simulates
    C and N transformations mediated by the soil microbes (Guo et al., 2015b). DNDC
    has been linked with economic model to simulate C N fluxes under the regional
    context of environmental and economic indicators (Leip et al., 2008). Despite
    its original development for agricultural land and crop modelling (annual or perennial
    food crops), the plant growth sub-model was modified to enable DNDC to simulate
    the perennial plants (e.g. poplar) with woody stem or roots (Guo et al., 2015b).
    By linking with chemical engineering process design and life cycle assessment,
    DNDC has been applied to simulate biomass growth and carbon/nitrogen cycling in
    agro-ecosystems and their implications on bioproduct system sustainability (Guo
    et al., 2015b; Guo et al., 2012). By adopting an integrated modelling approach,
    the performance of different species and genotypes in response to the future environmental
    changes can be projected and desirable traits can be highlighted that will pre-adapt
    species to future changes e.g. warmer, CO2-enriched environments. Such modelling
    research can provide scientific evidences to inform empirical efforts (e.g. breeding
    and genetic engineering) to improve the performance-limiting traits and set the
    performance targets. The biogeochemical processes and involved C/N cycles are
    visualised in Fig. 10. The biogeochemical process based models have been used
    to understand the nitrogen and carbon cycles that are observed in field experiments
    using eddy covariance flux and chamber measurements to understand the interaction
    of these processes with climate and the soil environment for different land uses
    from arable (Wattenbach et al., 2019), grassland (Soussana et al., 2014; Klumpp
    et al., 2011), forest and peatlands (Abdalla et al., 2014). In addition using
    carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements to identify the pathways for N16 labelled
    nitrogen amendment to soil and their partition into plants and N and N2O emissions.
    Similarly the fate of organic carbon additions to the soil have been modelled
    by tracking the radioisotopes of carbon C13 and also naturally occurring C12 and
    C14 isotopes, which occur in different proportions in C3 and C4 plants. Download

    cycles. Coupling the biosphere modelling with atmospheric circulation models have
    attracted great research attention. Soil processes and plant growth cannot be
    considered in isolation so that there are several trials of coupling plant and
    soil processes models (called bottom up models) with atmospheric circulation models
    (top down models) to look at the feedback and interaction of the emissions of
    the biosphere and albedo it creates with the atmospheric processes such as JULES
    (Best et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2011) . This represents the subject of ongoing
    research and future directions. 3.1.2.6. Models for aquatic biomass production
    Research on terrestrial agriculture is more advanced than aquatic biomass farming
    in general. Compared with terrestrial modelling advances, aquatic model development
    and validation face the challenges in measurements (e.g. primary production),
    remote-sensing and scaling-up as well as the limitations led by decoupled modelling
    approaches. Systems approaches have played an important role in aquatic phototroph
    metabolism and ecosystems research e.g. the mathematical models developed based
    on first-principles for predicting the growth of open-pond microalgae in response
    to weather variability (Malek et al., 2016), computational fluid dynamic-based
    optimisation for algae growth simulation under photo bioreactors (Smith et al.,
    2013a). However, previous modelling efforts have mainly focused on monoculture
    metabolism at lab scale (e.g. photo bioreactor) rather than reflection of complexity
    in reality. The current dominant algal cultivation methods i.e. open pond system
    are highly susceptible to contamination where the dynamics of bacteria communities
    and their interaction with algal cultures are involved. To solve such complexity
    including the resource-competition, metabolism and related biogeochemistry trajectories
    of aquatic microbial ecosystems, a generalised optimisation model has been proposed
    based on the thermodynamic, kinetic and stoichiometric theories (Payn et al.,
    2014). The models via parameterisations of aquatic ecosystem function primary
    production, nutrient recycling as a function of biotic/abiotic environmental parameters
    have been developed to determine the energy and nutrient and carbon mass flux
    (Ridgwell et al., 2007). Such a biogeochemical circulation approach was further
    incorporated into ecosystem models and combined with traits-based modelling which
    account for the bottom-up controls of phytoplankton community structure and composition
    as a consequence of ecological taxa selection (Follows and Dutkiewicz, 2011).
    Environmental Modelling Suite (EMS) presented by Australia''s Commonwealth Science
    Industry and Research Organisation (CSIRO) is a good example, which formulates
    the traits and biogeography of aquatic macroautotrophs (macroalgae and seagrass)
    in response to bottom-up controls (light, nutrient, temperature) and project their
    biomass potentials and carbon cycles (Baird et al., 2017). The EMS-CSIRO model
    considers two absorbance-distinct photopigments Chl a and photosynthetic xanthophyll
    but with simplified physiological process (Baird et al., 2017). As pointed out
    by Schartau et al. (2017), and Doney (1999), most of these published models are
    unrealistically simplified, meanwhile challenged by spatial/temporal-dependence
    parameterisation and cross-validation issues, due to the limited observation data
    for scaling-up from laboratory to mesocosm experiments. Particularly, the underlying
    photosynthesis dynamics are often simplified by using ‘black box’ representations
    of organism eco-physiology e.g. parameterisation of a small number of traits for
    nutrient and light acquisition (Mock et al., 2016), photosynthetic efficiency
    normalised to pigment Chl a concentrations and aggregated species into model functional
    groups (Schartau et al., 2017). Moreover, models based on the empirical description
    of organism traits are considered to present great uncertainties in the projection
    power and process-based understanding of the future responses to new environmental
    conditions (e.g. climate change) beyond historical envelope (Mock et al., 2016).
    Overall, the decoupling of phototroph metabolism traits from hydrodynamics, biochemical
    and sediment models in aquatic environments remains a research gap. The next generation
    models proposed by Mock et al. (2016) and Welti et al. (2017) could represent
    a research direction i.e. to adopt the process-based approaches across biochemistry,
    evolutionary ecology and integrate the interconnected omics data and environmental
    variables in food web ecosystem metabolism and aquatic biogeochemical modelling.
    3.2. Ecosystem services and sustainability evaluation 3.2.1. Ecosystem services
    Landscapes generate a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) that provide benefits
    to human society (Mace et al., 2012; MillenniumEcosystemAssessment, 2005). These
    services fall into four categories including - provisioning services such as biodiversity,
    food, materials and energy; regulating and supporting services such as climate
    and water regulation and waste recycling; and cultural services such as recreational
    value and symbolic meaning (Guo et al., 2016). While the need of incorporating
    ES into decision-making at international, national and local levels is increasingly
    recognised (Daily and Matson, 2008; Gómez-Baggethun and Ruiz-Pérez, 2011), and
    ecosystem accounting is increasing employed in research, policy and decision-making
    (Lange et al., 2022), the value of ES is often overlooked in natural capital resource
    planning (Bateman et al., 2013), which underpins the development of the biorenewable
    sector. In the coming decades, changes in natural capital resources e.g. land
    use transitions could be expected to rise from the bio-renewable industry, which
    may occur against a backdrop of ongoing global degradation of ecosystem services
    as highlighted by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MillenniumEcosystemAssessment,
    2005). Given the importance of ES for human-wellbeing, their socio-economic values
    and whole-system relevance, ES provides a useful framework to examine biorenewable
    systems (e.g. bioenergy (Gasparatos et al., 2011)) and the associated environmental,
    social and economic implications of deployment strategies. A range of ES evaluation
    frameworks have been proposed with no widely accepted approach (Immerzeel et al.,
    2014) but they could be broadly classified as quantitative and semi-quantitative/qualitative
    approaches e.g. the matrix semi-quantitative approach proposed by Holland et al.
    (2015), quantitative approaches with indices of bird population trends for bioenergy
    and biofuel evaluation (Rivas Casado et al., 2014; Munoz et al., 2014). The ES
    research on biorenewable systems have focused on the biodiversity and climate
    regulation induced by bioenergy and biofuels with other ES categories and bio-sectors
    less addressed. In general, the ES footprints change are not only driven by the
    biorenewable technology penetration but also vary with the spatial distribution
    and development status of natural capital resources (e.g. initial land cover),
    regional climate and time horizon (Immerzeel et al., 2014). As concluded by Fargione
    et al. (2008), land use conversion from natural vegetation (e.g. rainforests)
    to 1 G food-crop could generate bio-sector carbon debt in contrast to sustained
    GHG mitigation benefits offered by the waste-based bioeconomic systems developed
    on abandoned or degraded lands. In general, more positive effects of perennial
    2 G biomass on species and habitat diversity, and climate regulation have been
    observed (Bellamy et al., 2009; Dauber et al., 2010; Baum et al., 2012; Felten
    et al., 2013) though the biodiversity implications could vary with the micro-management
    strategies in the fields (Guillem et al., 2015). A comprehensive review carried
    out by Immerzeel et al. (2014) highlighted the drivers and trends of biodiversity
    as a consequence of bioenergy crop production, where land use change was identified
    as the most important driving forces, producing direct and indirect effects on
    native habitat change. As demonstrated in Fig. 14, different taxonomic groups
    (plants, invertebrates and vertebrates) have been proposed as biodiversity impact
    measures to indicate the species composition, richness, evenness and abundance
    in response to the ecosystem change (e.g. land use change) (de Baan et al., 2013a;
    Gonthier et al., 2014), where birds and beetles are the most studied taxonomic
    group (Immerzeel et al., 2014; Gasparatos et al., 2017; Sauerbrei et al., 2017;
    Werling et al., 2014; Emmerson et al., 2016; Bourke et al., 2014) with plant species
    biodiversity under-addressed. However, a recent global analysis shows that the
    ongoing extinction of plant species has been a missing biodiversity hotspot and
    deserves more efforts to achieve effective conservation planning (Humphreys et
    al., 2019). In addition to biodiversity and climate regulation, other water, soil–based
    regulating ES as well as supporting, cultural ES have been investigated such as
    water regulatory (Shifflett et al., 2016; Orwin et al., 2015; Styles et al., 2016),
    carbon and nutrient cycling (Orwin et al., 2015; Creamer et al., 2016; Schrama
    et al., 2016), pollination (Werling et al., 2014) and recreation (Stens et al.,
    2016; Hansen and Malmaeus, 2016). Some regional or national level ES evaluation
    tools have been developed e.g. the EU BioScore ES model (Biodiversity impact assessment
    using species sensitivity Scores) developed for policy impact assessment (PBL,
    2023), the UK national ecosystem assessment (UNEP World Conservation Monitoring
    Centre, 2014) and Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
    (IPBES – http://www.ipbes.net). Such ES evaluation frameworks offer powerful tools,
    which are ready to be linked with other modelling platforms to map out the ecosystem
    services change in response to biorenewable sector development. In previous research,
    ES trade-off has been included in landscape decision (Goldstein et al., 2012).
    Several mitigation strategies for realising a green economy while delivering multiple
    ecosystem services were concluded from previous research, which demonstrated the
    mitigation potential of both supply and demand sides. Supply-side strategies include
    multi-functional landscape planning (Shifflett et al., 2016), screening of resource-efficient
    and low-carbon biomass and technology, logistics and network design on degraded
    lands, closed-loop systems (e.g. pyrolysis biochar for enhancement of soil carbon
    sequestration); whereas the demand-side mitigation could be achieved via closed-loop
    economy (e.g. waste reduction) and shift in human behaviour and societal perception
    (Gasparatos et al., 2017; Blanco-Canqui, 2016; Smith et al., 2013b). These supply-demand
    mitigation strategies offer promising strategic planning options, which could
    be explored in depth via softlinking ES evaluation tools with system optimisation
    approaches. 3.2.2. Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) LCSA refers to
    the evaluation of all environmental, social and economic impacts in decision-making
    processes towards more sustainable products throughout their life cycles (UNEP/SETAC
    Life Cycle Initiative, 2011). Initiated from LCA, the life cycle thinking approach
    has been extended since 2002 to form a LCSA methodology framework, which consists
    of three pillars (Fig. 14) - environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle
    costing (LCC) and social-LCA (SLCA) (UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, 2011).
    As a systematic and rigorous evaluation framework, LCSA provides integrative and
    holistic perspectives for multi-criteria decision on a given product system. As
    generalised in Eq. (1), LCSA accounts for all input-output flows occurring at
    each life cycle stage throughout the ‘cradle-to-grave’. Formalised by the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO, 2006a), E-LCA quantifies the environmental
    footprints associated with all stages of a product, service or process. LCC and
    SLCA examine the holistic economic aspects and social consequences respectively,
    evaluating the improvement opportunities of various product systems and processes
    including biorenewables. (1) Where the variable denotes the total sustainability
    impacts of a given process (per functional unit) expressed as key performance
    indicator kpi (e.g. global warming potential and cost). determined by the characterisation
    impact factors for input resource r or emitted compound c d the input or output
    flows life cycle stage s. 3.2.2.7. LCSA methodology and overview Under the guiding
    principles (life cycle perspective, transparency and completeness) (ISO, 2006a),
    LCSA consists of four interactive phases (goal and scope definition, inventory
    analyses, impact assessment and interpretation) (UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative,
    2011), capturing every life stage from raw material acquisition to final disposal.
    The first LCSA phase scopes the fundamental modelling elements including the system
    boundaries and the functional unit, and defines the principles and methodologies
    to be applied. At the inventory stage, data are collected on a unit process basis
    within the system boundary and assessed against data-quality requirements. Inventories
    are associated with the impact categories at the assessment stage, which comprises
    the mandatory element of characterization and possibly other optional ones (normalization,
    weighting). Inventory outputs are converted to category indictors using defined
    characterization factors, which can be further linked to category endpoints defined
    as ‘attribute or aspect of natural environment, human health or resources identifying
    an environmental issue’ in the case of E-LCA (ISO, 2000); the aggregated indicator
    results provide characterized profiles of the studied products, which can be normalized
    to give information on relative magnitude of each indicator result. Life cycle
    impact assessment (LCIA) outcomes are presented in the interpretation phase in
    accordance with the study goal and scope to reach conclusions and recommendations.
    Generally, two types of LCA have been distinguished: attributional LCA (ALCA)
    and consequential LCA (CLCA) approaches. The former is a descriptive hybrid approach,
    based on process and input-output, focusing on the environmentally relevant flows
    to and from a life cycle and its subsystems; the latter is change-oriented, aiming
    to understand how environmentally relevant flows change in response to possible
    decisions (Finnveden et al., 2009). Such emerging concepts could be further extended
    to LCSA, to represent the retrospective (attributional) and prospective (consequential)
    sustainability aspects. Although SLCA and CLCA have gained increasing attention
    in last decade, research on the LCSA methodology and applications still remain
    as a challenge due to the trans-disciplinary nature of LCSA and lack of robustly
    applicable methods for certain impact categories (Guinee et al., 2011; Keller
    et al., 2015). A thorough literature review suggests that very few published research
    articles focuses on the holistic LCSA of biorenewable systems (Keller et al.,
    2015; Stamford and Azapagic, 2014; Arodudu et al., 2017a; Halog and Manik, 2011;
    Jin et al., 2017a; Nzila et al., 2012; Hingsamer and Jungmeier, 2014; Parajuli
    et al., 2015) but environmental aspects have been widely investigated. Amongst
    the large number of published LCAs on biorenewables, gasification (syngas for
    biomethanol or electrification), pyrolysis (biocrude oil), anaerobic digestion
    (biogas for electricity) and fermentation (bioethanol as transport fuels) have
    been the main research focus (see summary in Fig. 13). High-value bioproducts
    via biochemical routes (e.g. biohydrogen, biobutanol, succinic acid, single cell
    protein, see Figs. 12 and 13) and the biorenewables derived from microbial clusters
    (e.g. microalgae) remain a critical research gap due to the lack of comprehensive
    data (Lam and Lee, 2012). 3.2.2.8. Biorenewable systems scope LCSA is a relative
    approach with all the inputs-outputs and the environmental profiles generated
    being related to the functional unit; thus the functional unit forms the basis
    for LCSA evaluation particularly the comparison between counterparts. In biorenewable
    system, the functional unit could be defined as one-dimension (e.g. per energy
    or mass unit) or specified to reflect multi-dimensions (e.g. spatial and temporal,
    or other boundary dimensions). The former is a generally adopted approach in previous
    LCAs or LCSAs (Parajuli et al., 2015; Saraiva, 2017). Such one-dimensional physical
    measure-based unit generally reflects well the linear fossil economy nature. However
    it is not applicable to the multiple bio-product systems particularly those under
    circular bioeconomy, which concerns the natural capital resource flows, evolving
    multidimensional functions and closed-loop complexity. The attributional static
    approach has been widely adopted in previous LCSAs on biorenewables. Few published
    studies expanded system boundaries accounting for implications of marginal variations
    (e.g. small-scale change of economic sector in response to demand change) (Schmidt
    and Weidema, 2007; Reinhard and Zah, 2009; Hamelin et al., 2012; Styles et al.,
    2015a, 2015b) and effects of large-scale non-marginal variations (i.e. multi-market
    considering global equilibrium of all economic sectors) (Dandres et al., 2011;
    Rajagopal, 2017; Dandres et al., 2012; Vazquez-Rowe et al., 2014). The latter
    expands consequential boundary further to account for the interactions and competition
    of multi-markets, multi-regions and capture wider socio-economic mechanisms; thus
    it represents an integrative tool placing regional decision-makers under a wider
    context and addressing the critical biorenewable-food competition issues effectively.
    This can be achieved by combining economic equilibrium model with CLCA (Vazquez-Rowe
    et al., 2014; Earles and Halog, 2011). Further exploratory research focused on
    consequential LCSA robustness and representativeness of operational equilibrium
    model (technology choices); Kätelhön et al. (2016) introduced a stochastic optimisation
    model in a CLCA approach, which captures multi-market dynamics meanwhile calibrating
    the result robustness. Analysing attributional LCSA, the system boundary defined
    in studies can be broadly categorised as cradle-to-grave, cradle-to-gate (e.g.
    well-to-tank) and cradle-to-use (e.g. well-to-wheel). Most of the LCAs on bioenergy
    and biofuels scoped the system boundaries as cradle-to-use whereas the studies
    on biomaterial and biochemicals reflect their cradle-to-grave life cycles. These
    modelling choices matter, as the modelling approach often plays an important role
    in determining the environmental impact of a product (Brandão et al., 2021). However,
    as pointed out by Muench and Guenther (2013), bioenergy systems involve three
    paths (biomass, conversion, distribution), thus a one-dimensional boundary definition
    overlooking certain path (e.g. electricity transition) is considered as insufficient
    for bioenergy evaluation. Similarly, a range of other biorenewables also involve
    multiple dimensions and even closed-loop issues e.g. waste-based biorenewable
    systems. As analysed in the previous section, carbon cycles underpin the biorenewable
    development. Therefore, a multi-dimensional boundary considering temporal and
    spatial scales and reflect the biorenewable system complexity and carbon circular
    nature from both attributional and consequential perspectives should be further
    explored. 3.2.2.9. Biorenewable carbon cycles and allocation approach A range
    of carbon sinks and emitters are involved in biorenewable carbon cycles (presented
    in Fig. 15), which can be summarised as below- • The biorenewable resource production
    stage acts as a carbon sink sequestering biogenic carbon from the atmosphere into
    biomass and subsequent biorenewable products and accumulating soil carbon due
    to plant leaf litter and/or fine root biodegradation in soil. • Carbon capture
    and storage (CCS) or utilisation processes involved in a biorefinery could potentially
    lead to biogenic carbon input flows e.g. the CCS capturing CO2 emitted from fermentation
    of lignocellulosic feedstock. • Biological or mechanical waste treatment options
    including anaerobic digestion or recycling for biopolymer disposal can also generate
    carbon sink effects by recovering biogenic carbon as biogas or petrochemical material
    substitution. • The carbon sink effects of landfill depend on the temporal boundary
    (mid-term vs. infinite). Carbon emissions evolved at the resource production stage
    are mainly attributable to the agricultural field operations (fuel combustion
    and agricultural machinery inputs), agrochemical inputs and carbon released agricultural
    lands due to microbial soil respiration. • Other carbon emitters including biorefining
    processes and disposal treatment also cause carbon release due to either chemical/biochemical/thermochemical
    reactions or operational inputs (including energy, chemical, and infrastructure
    inputs). Handling such complex circular carbon systems remains as one of the controversial
    issues in LCAs (Guinée et al., 2009) and can be a sensitive factor for LCSA allocation.
    For multiple-product systems, three allocation approaches are applicable to partition
    the material/energy flows and their associated sustainability impacts between
    the co-products i.e. allocation by physical relation (e.g. mass, volume etc.),
    allocation by economic values or system boundary expansion (Luo et al., 2009;
    ISO, 2006b). In consequential studies, allocation by mass or economic values can
    be avoided by applying system boundary expansion (Finnveden et al., 2009; Weidema,
    2000). Although there is no universal consensus on the allocation methods in attributional
    LCSA/LCAs, the avoidance of allocation through system expansion (followed by physical-based
    allocation) has been indicated as the preferred approach for LCA in ISO LCA guidelines
    (ISO, 2006; ISO, 1998) and PAS 2050 (BSI 2011). Literature reviews show that carbon
    neutral assumptions have been generally adopted for biomass and biorenewable system
    studies (Muench and Guenther, 2013; Shemfe et al., 2016; Helin et al., 2013; Cherubini
    et al., 2011a;Johnson, 2009). However, assuming climate neutrality does not reflect
    the details of the biorenewable carbon cycles. Research efforts have been made
    to develop methods to assess biomass CO2 climate impacts (Cherubini et al., 2011b).
    A stoichiometric carbon counting approach has been suggested to determine the
    effects of carbon sinks and emitters along the biorenewable upstream and downstream
    systems (Guo et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013). Fig. 16 shows the carbon removal
    potential associated with different sources of biomass. For reference, global
    anthropogenic CO2 emissions, excluding land-use changes, were 36.1 GT in 2022
    (Liu et al., 2023). Figures refer to total available mass of carbon; many carbon
    removal technologies, such as biochar, have significant carbon losses (Woolf et
    al., 2010). Note some lignocellulosic waste is already used in ways that lead
    to some of the carbon being stored, such as biochar for soil improvement. Data
    from (Piercy et al., 2023) (Supplementary Information), (Arzeno-Soltero et al.,
    2023). Calculations detailed in Supplementary Information SI-8. 3.2.2.10. LCSA
    criteria and impact assessment In LCSA, the impact assessment methodologies can
    be categorised as midpoint (‘problem-oriented’) and endpoint-oriented (‘damage
    approach’) approaches (PRéConsultants, 2004). The former is chosen along with
    environmental/economic/social mechanisms between the inventory results and damage-oriented
    endpoints (ISO, 2000) and the latter is defined at the level of protection areas
    (Finnveden et al., 2009). These two approaches are differentiated by the way in
    which the sustainable relevance of category indicators is taken into account (Bare
    et al., 2000). Unlike the midpoint approach with multiple environmental indicator
    results, at the end-point level the sustainable relevance of category indicators
    provides normalised single scores for decision-makers. But end-point results may
    be misinterpreted by overlooking the fact that single scores are subjective to
    the normalisation reference systems. Such a methodological choice can be a sensitivity
    parameter, which could be examined via data quality analysis (Guo et al., 2014).
    In the previous LCSAs of biorenewables, global warming potential, energy efficiency,
    eutrophication and acidification, water and land use are widely investigated environmental
    indicators with other impact categories often overlooked (Singh and Olsen, 2011;
    Patel et al., 2016; Muench and Guenther, 2013; Arodudu et al., 2017b; Shonnard
    et al., 2015; Medeiros et al., 2015; Cherubini and Strømman, 2011; Gelfand et
    al., 2013; Venteris et al., 2013; Pfister et al., 2016). The key socio-economic
    indicators concerned in the published studies include the costs for CO2 mitigation,
    capital inputs and operations, and the overall profit analyses (Muench and Guenther,
    2013), food and energy security, social-wellbeing (e.g. energy/facility accessibility,
    employment, poverty, work environment), social equality (e.g. human rights, corruption,
    education accessibility, community engagement) (Efroymson et al., 2017; Mukherjee
    and Sovacool, 2014; Lim and Biswas, 2015; Valente et al., 2011; Robledo-Abad et
    al., 2017; Cambero and Sowlati, 2014; Čuček et al., 2012a). In comparison to LCA
    and LCC where quantitative characterisation models (e.g. CML, TRACI, Eco-Indicator,
    Recipe) are available and widely applicable, SLCA studies mostly were based on
    interviews and observations (van Eijck et al., 2014) without consensus on the
    impact assessment methodology. As pointed out by Robledo-Abad et al. (2017), the
    advancement of LCSA knowledge vary with regions with better understanding on economic
    and environmental categories in developed regions in contrast to the emerging
    economy, where more LCSA attention has been paid to socio-economic aspects. To
    determine whether biorenewables deliver progress in achieving sustainability goals,
    holistic and reproducible LCSA are needed to avoid inadvertent ‘problem shifting’
    thus further research efforts are required on SLCA methodology development. Climate,
    temporal and spatial variability in LCSA have been recognised as a research gap
    and as being critical for economic and environmental planning, regional evaluation
    of technology viability for biorenewables especially from spatially distributed
    resources (e.g. agriculture residue) (Shonnard et al., 2015; Reap et al., 2008;
    Eranki and Dale, 2011). Particularly, spatial LCA models with region-representative
    data and characterisation indicators have been highlighted in UNEP-SETAC guidelines
    as a conceptual framework for LCA and ES. This is especially the case for the
    assessments for land use decision-support at global or regional scales with spatial
    diversity (Koellner et al., 2013). However, in comparison with the large number
    of LCSA studies adopting country/region/industrial average data inventory (e.g.
    NREL US LCI databases (NREL, 2004), Plastics Europe (Boustead, 2005)), limited
    spatial or dynamic LCSA studies have been published on biorenewable systems so
    far with focus on the biodiversity, energy and GHG footprints in response to land
    use change or distributed resource use (Arodudu et al., 2017b; Gelfand et al.,
    2013; Venteris et al., 2013; Roostaei and Zhang, 2017a). Humpenoder et al. (Humpenöder
    et al., 2013) published a GIS based LandSHIFT model soft-linked with LCA to estimate
    spatially-explicit GHGs of LUC due to 1 G biofuels in the EU considering the soil
    and climate variation. Gasol et al. (2011) studied the cradle-to-gate GHGs of
    electrical and thermal power derived from hardwood (poplar) at spatial scales
    accounting for climate variability. Roostaei and Zhang (2017b) proposed a HRSE-LCA
    framework integrating Geographic Information System (GIS)-based resource assessment
    and algal growth model with LCA to analyse the production potential, energy and
    GHG profiles of pyrolysis and HTL bio-fuels processed from wastewater-cultivated
    algae at USA national scale. In addition to the region-representative data, the
    regionalisation of characterization models and indicators are desirable for science-evidenced
    decision-making. Spatially-explicit LCA characterisation factors and indicators
    in water and land use, acidification and eutrophication have been studied (Roy
    et al., 2014; de Baan et al., 2013b; Verones et al., 2013; Azevedo et al., 2013)
    but are not yet included in the assessment literature (Steinmann et al., 2016).
    Uncertainties at the methodological level remain a research challenge (Hiloidhari
    et al., 2017). Overall, GIS-based LCSA approaches can be an effective tool for
    spatial-temporal sustainability assessment but need great research efforts at
    both the methodology and data levels. Regardless of spatial variability, economic
    and technological impacts were more generally regarded as positive in previous
    research whereas the negative scores on most social and environmental aspects
    (except for GHG accounting for fossil substitution effects) were often reported
    for bioenergy and other value-added biorenewable systems (Robledo-Abad et al.,
    2017). For terrestrial resource-based biorenewables, the agriculture cultivation
    and biorefinery processing stages have been identified as hotspots, contributing
    significantly to the overall impacts (Parajuli et al., 2015). For aquatic biomass
    or waste based biorenewables, conversion technologies dominate the overall impacts
    with the cultivation stage potentially bringing environmental savings (e.g. nutrient
    recovery and CO2 sequestration) (Patel et al., 2016). Due to such environmental
    savings, 3 G biofuels have been indicated as superior systems over 1 G and 2 G
    on GHG balance and land use but 1 G and 2 G biofuels were evidenced as more efficient
    in terms of energy utilisation (energy ratio and energy return on investment as
    indicators) based on the previous research observations (Carneiro et al., 2017).
    Moreover, the uncertainties in 3 G biofuel scaling-up and its economic viability
    hinder the commercial progress (Carneiro et al., 2017). Such trends could also
    represent the general comparison between 3 G biorenewables and 1 G/2 G counterparts,
    with the exception of the high-value compounds potentially extracted from 3 G
    resources (e.g. pigments, polyunsaturated fatty acids, anti-oxidants), which are
    still not well understood in terms of their sustainability performances (Carneiro
    et al., 2017). The comparison between centralised and decentralised systems vary
    with the regional feedstock characteristics and synergies amongst technologies
    (Eranki et al., 2011; Iglesias et al., 2012). Studies carried out on lignocellulosic
    biofuel production systems concluded that decoupling the pretreatment from fermentation
    to densify the biomass locally via decentralised processing depots reduces the
    collection radius for bulky biomass and creates a local closed-loop system (Eranki
    et al., 2011). Thus depots could deliver better GHG and energy profiles than the
    centralised processing systems (Eranki and Dale, 2011; Eranki et al., 2011; Egbendewe-Mondzozo
    et al., 2013) but represent more economically viable solutions for perennial crops
    than for annual crops (Eranki and Dale, 2011; Kim and Dale, 2015). Different conclusions
    were reached from waste recovery studies. Driven by conversion efficiency, centralised
    CHP systems outperformed the decentralised combustion technology in terms of sustainability
    for processing sugarcane residues or biogas (Ali Mandegari et al., 2017; Patterson
    et al., 2011); whereas decentralised anaerobic digestion (AD) system were reported
    as a more environmentally favourable choice than centralised system for OFMSW
    and sludge treatment (Righi et al., 2013). The LCSA hotspot (also called contributional)
    analyses and comparison not only can inform decision-makers to set performance
    targets and identify improvement opportunities but also provide ‘plug-and-play’
    input-output modules for system-level decision-making tool underpinned by life-cycle
    thinking. 3.2.2.11. LCA and planetary boundary The planetary boundaries (PB) framework
    defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the biophysical processes
    that regulate the stability of the earth system (Ferretto et al., 2022). Specifically,
    planetary boundaries were proposed for nine earth system processes - climate change,
    change in biosphere integrity (biodiversity), stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean
    acidification, biogeochemical P and N flows, land systems change, freshwater use,
    aerosol loading and introduction of novel entities (chemical pollution) (Rockström
    et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015). While many studies focus on carbon footprint
    as a measure of environmental impact, Tulus et al. (2021) found that for many
    chemical goods, carbon footprint correlates poorly with sustainability as assessed
    by the planetary boundary framework. Recent efforts have been placed on the methodology
    development to integrate LCA into the PB framework. These include the exploratory
    research to link LCIA characterisation models and impact categories with PB control
    variables (Ryberg et al., 2018), and the introduction of the concept of absolute
    sustainability, an approach to LCA that aims to incorporate the planet''s carrying
    capacity into LCA-based PBs indicators (Ioannou et al., 2023; Sala et al., 2020).
    The PB framework has been applied in previous research to address future sustainable
    food supply within four boundaries i.e. climate change, land-system change, freshwater
    use and biogeochemical N/P flows (Parodi et al., 2018; Springmann et al., 2018).
    Notably, despite two-level hierarchy of boundaries has been proposed (Rockström
    et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015), where climate change and biosphere integrity
    are recognised as core PB, the proposed boundaries are interdependent. In addition,
    the PB framework recognises an integrative approach coupling boundaries and highlights
    the importance of dynamics at Earth subsystem level on the functioning of whole
    Earth system. Although PB framework is not designed to be downscaled (Steffen
    et al., 2015), LCA research community explored the methods to disaggregate PB
    to sectoral and national levels by introducing allocation approach based on global
    demographic trends; further life cycle inventories was linked with planetary boundaries
    to investigate sustainable design of national energy systems (Algunaibet et al.,
    2019). Research was also published to integrate process design and LCA to quantify
    the contribution of biopolymer production (Durkin et al., 2019) to mitigate climate
    change within PB boundary. Since the LCA approach formalised in 1990s, numerous
    efforts have been placed to develop quantitative methods to characterise the environmental
    impacts and to build database representing the industrial/sectoral technologies
    and processes. Undoubtedly, LCA database and methodological advances offer powerful
    tools to support decision-making on sustainable development and design of biorenewables
    (França et al., 2021). However, LCA framework only enables data analyse and evaluation
    functions but does not inform design problems within an Earth-system safe operating
    space, which consists of interactive environmental boundaries across regional
    and global scales. Methodology underpinned by LCA and PB framework offers a quantitative
    approach to develop fundamental understanding of the sustainability implications
    of biorenewable systems on the functioning of the Earth system. This represents
    a future research direction. 3.2.2.12. Deterministic vs. stochastic LCSA and dynamic
    LCSA The majority of the LCSA studies reviewed above can be defined as deterministic
    LCSA, which does not take into account the data quality, stochastic and dynamic
    aspects of the systems under investigation. In contrast, the LCSA developed in
    a statistical framework can be classified as stochastic LCA (Wei et al., 2016).
    LCA data quality analyses include sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Sensitivity
    analysis has been carried out in previous research to test system boundaries (Guo
    et al., 2014; Lijo et al., 2014), temporal effects (Pinsonnault et al., 2014;
    Guo and Murphy, 2012a; Finnveden, 1999), allocation approach (Piastrellini et
    al., 2017; Chen et al., 2016), parameter values (Valente et al., 2011; Barlow
    et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2022) and characterisation methods (Guo et al., 2014;
    Guo, 2012). Different sensitivity analyses techniques were proposed, amongst which
    scenario analysis is a widely applied method (Björklund, 2002). The method involves
    calculating different scenarios, to analyse the influence of input parameters
    on either impact assessment indicator results or ranking; two types of possible
    analyses can be distinguished 1) contribution to variance to determine the implications
    of uncertain parameters to the output variance; 2) screening to identify the significant
    parameters (Baustert and Benetto, 2017). Another data quality analysis component
    - uncertainty analysis - is not commonly performed in the LCSA of biorenewables,
    (Rajagopalan et al., 2017) although research efforts have been made on the classification,
    definition, and sources of uncertainties as well as methodological aspects for
    expressing uncertainty (Wei et al., 2016; Guo and Murphy, 2012a). At the inventory
    level, the uncertainties are introduced into LCSA systems due to the cumulative
    effects of input uncertainty and inventory uncertainty sourced from data gaps,
    which can be evaluated via data quality indicators (temporal, geographical, or
    technological coverage, data reliability or completeness). A methodology framework
    combining statistical methods and pedigree matrix has been proposed to quantify
    the uncertainty in inventory and LCIA indicator results (Guo and Murphy, 2012a).
    Under the framework, maximum likelihood estimation and goodness of fit were proposed
    for analysing the operational data with multiple measurements or simulated computational
    inventory containing variability parameters. Pedigree matrix originally developed
    Weidema and Wesnæs (Weidema and Wesnæs, 1996) and widely applied to the LCA database
    e.g. Eco-invent has been adopted to transform the data quality indicators to probability
    distributions (‘default’ lognormal distribution); whereas probabilistic Monte
    Carlo simulation was suggested to estimate the uncertainties of LCSA outcomes
    resulted from the statistical variability or temporal, geographical or technological
    gaps in the inventory (Guo, 2012). Monte Carlo simulation combined with fuzzy
    datasets and pedigree matrix have been well demonstrated to quantify the uncertainties
    of biorenewable systems e.g. 2 G and 3 G biofuel (Rajagopalan et al., 2017; Tan
    et al., 2002; Sills et al., 2013; Pfister and Scherer, 2015). To overcome the
    limitation of Monte Carlo approach, that is the high computational time required
    due to searching the uncertainty space for all stochastic variables, other methods
    such as reliability approaches (Wei et al., 2016; Wang and Chen, 2016), Latin
    Hypercube Sampling, and quasi Monte Carlo (Groen et al., 2014) have been proposed
    in stochastic LCA studies to approximate the LCSA decision confidence. A similar
    approach uses Sobol indices to identify the most sensitive parameters, which can
    then be used to simplify the uncertainty estimation (Jolivet et al., 2021). However,
    such approaches have not been yet applied to biorenewable studies. As highlighted
    in previous research (Guo and Murphy, 2012b), sensitivity analyses combined with
    uncertainty analyses can lead to an increase in confidence in the findings which
    suggest that LCSAs lacking explicit interpretation of the degree of uncertainty
    and/or sensitivities should not be used as robust evidence for decision or comparative
    assertions. Thereby, it is recommended to incorporate data quality evaluation
    into the future LCSAs of biorenewables and bridge the knowledge gaps. Either deterministic
    or stochastic LCSAs reviewed above mainly focus on developed or steady-state products
    or systems; for emerging and evolving systems with complex and dynamic nature
    and great uncertainties due to incomplete inventory, several different modelling
    approaches including scenario-based, trend analysis and agent-based models (ABM)
    have been proposed for dynamic LCSA. Miller et al. (2013) presented a dynamic
    framework coupling ABM and ALCA, where the probabilistic behaviour of decision-makers
    e.g. technology developers were captured using a Bayesian statistical approach
    and a range of what if scenarios were investigated. Further exploration focused
    on the convergence of LCA with a complex economic model and agent-based simulation
    to capture the dynamic system driven by human behaviours (Halog and Manik, 2011).
    Baustert and Benetto (2017) reviewed the ABM and CLCA coupled models and addressed
    the uncertainty sources and system variability issues as well as methodologies
    in stochastic modelling. In addition, a Wright''s law learning curve reflecting
    the relationship between technology costs and cumulative production has been incorporated
    into the dynamic LCSA framework to capture the ‘learning-by-doing’ effects on
    technology operation, economic and environmental performances and entire supply
    chains (Bergesen and Suh, 2016; Gavankar et al., 2015; Caduff et al., 2014; Hayward
    et al., 2015). However, only very few biorenewables studies have adopted such
    dynamic LCSA approaches (Caduff et al., 2014; Bichraoui-Draper et al., 2015a),
    which remain a critical research challenge. 3.3. Data model in geographic information
    systems The use of geographic information system is recognized as an efficient
    approach to analyse complex spatial phenomena and has been used to model various
    applications at multi-levels spanning from biomass resources (e.g. waste resources
    potential) to conversion technologies (e.g. waste treatment). Despite of the capability
    of spatial data acquisition, storage, processing and analysis, GIS alone does
    not allow for incorporating the decision maker''s preferences and heuristics into
    the problem-solving process. Thus a range of GIS-aided methodologies e.g. multi-criteria
    decision analysis, fuzzy multi-criteria decision making and mixed integer programming
    models have been developed and applied to spatial decision support in the waste
    sectors (Khan and Samadder, 2014; Kallel et al., 2016; Soltani et al., 2015) (particularly
    in MSW collection and monitoring (Melare et al., 2017)), as well as the spatially-explicit
    evaluation, monitoring and planning of terrestrial and aquatic biomass (Roostaei
    and Zhang, 2017b; Hiloidhari et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2015; Pham and Brabyn,
    2017). Since the 1990s, when a spatial LCA tool was proposed by Bengtsson et al.
    (1998), GIS coupled with LCA has been used to represent the specially-explicit
    LCA sub-system layers (technical, environmental and social) and applied to sustainable
    planning and analyses of biosectors, particularly those associated with uneven
    resource distribution (e.g. agro-residue derived bioenergy (Hiloidhari et al.,
    2017)) or bounded by the geographically differentiated factors (e.g. infrastructure
    (Nguyen et al., 2014), climate (O''Keeffe et al., 2017)). The development of a
    leading platform Open-LCA reflects the GIS-aided LCA research advances in recent
    years. Open-LCA is an open-source Java application running on Eclipse Rich Client
    Platform. It enables LCA collaborative server and embeds GIS-aided LCA models.
    OpenLCA is the first and only LCA platform to enable database/model development
    in a distributed and paralleled collaboration manner across users, servers/repositories.
    In comparison with other widely adapted LCA software (e.g. Simapro and GaBi),
    very few studies have explored GIS-aided LCA using Open-LCA platform (Tabatabaie
    et al., 2018). Besides, GIS-aided LCA models have been presented for linear or
    non-linear ecosystem services assessment, especially provisioning, regulating
    ES impacts (e.g. biodiversity, erosion regulation) in response to the change in
    the natural capital resource patterns (e.g. water, land) (de Baan et al., 2013a;
    Geyer et al., 2010; Bayart et al., 2010; Saad et al., 2013). Considering the biorenewable
    system features (e.g. uneven distribution, linked with geographically varied ecological
    drivers), GIS coupled with remote sensing undoubtedly offers an effective way
    to acquire, process and analyse spatial data. One of the promising research directions
    lies in the GIS-aided model integration, covering the multi-geographical level
    decision-making (farm level combined with regional network) and linking the spatially-explicit
    ecosystems with biorenewable technosphere. 3.4. Process simulation and techno-economic
    evaluation As highlighted in Fig. 11, Fig. 12, process design and simulation studies
    are dominated by thermochemical routes (torrefaction, pyrolysis, gasification
    and hydrothermal liquefaction), fermentation (bioethanol, succinic acid, lactic
    acid) and anaerobic digestion. A significant modelling gap has been identified
    in high-value biorenewable conversion processes (especially new food/feed sourced
    from microbial fermentation). Via a review of state-of-the-art modelling approaches,
    the sections discuss the research opportunities in process simulation. Grey links

    3.4.1. Kinetics vs. thermodynamic equilibrium models Models for simulating biorenewable
    conversion technologies can be largely divided into two groups: kinetic and thermodynamic
    equilibrium models. The former is used to predict the progress and the product
    compositions along the reactions; whereas the latter also denoted as zero dimensional,
    can be used to project the theoretical efficiency and achievable yields of desired
    end-reaction products based on the assumption that reacting systems reach steady
    state with minimised Gibbs Free Energy (maximised entropy) (Ahmad et al., 2016;
    Ahmed et al., 2015; Arora et al., 2017). Despite the simplified formulation and
    wide applicability, the latter is not capable of describing the instantaneous
    product distribution along with the geometric dimension, thus cannot be used for
    reactor analysis or design (Ahmad et al., 2016; Ahmed et al., 2015). Equilibrium
    modelling consists of two approaches– 1) stoichiometric models which require well-defined
    reaction mechanisms, chemical reactions and species involved; 2) non-stoichiometric
    models, which are effective to identify the chemical compositions when the reaction
    paths are not yet known (Acharya et al., 2010). Both kinetic and equilibrium models
    have been embedded in commercial process simulators such as AspenTech modules
    (Aspen Plus or Hysys), where the physical relationships, thermodynamic equilibrium
    and rate equations have been built in to enable the process flowsheeting, plant-wide
    process behaviour projection. 3.4.2. Process simulation Process simulation is
    a model-based representation of chemical, physical, biological, and other technical
    processes and unit operations in software. It is used for the design, development,
    analysis, and optimisation of biorenewable processes such as biomass plants, biomass
    thermochemical conversion processes, power station and biomass biological conversion
    processes. The advantages of process simulation are to (a) reduce plant design
    time by allowing designers to quickly test various plant configurations (b) improve
    current processes by answering ‘what if’ questions, determining optimal process
    conditions within given constraints and assisting in locating the constraining
    parts of a process. The ultimate objectives of using process simulation are to
    realise faster troubleshooting, online performance monitoring and real-time optimisation.
    A variety of modelling platforms e.g. Aspen Plus, Aspen Hysys, SuperPro Designer,
    Modelica, GPS-X (for Anaerobic digestion) provide a resource where researchers
    and engineers can model, simulate, design, optimise their processes; conversely,
    the outcomes (e.g. technical reports and publications) can enrich the platforms
    about biorenewable systems by sharing information of specific case studies, identifying
    the model limitations, and extending the model applicability. The first challenge
    for researchers using modelling platforms is to identify the available physical
    and chemical properties in the database which include pure component and phase
    equilibrium data for conventional chemicals, solids and polymers. Subsequently,
    the additional data about thermodynamics and dynamics need to be added by researchers
    as biomass feedstocks and their intermediate and end products have a complex composition
    with sophisticated reaction path. For example, tar formation in biomass pyrolysis
    and gasification is complex. Mellin et al. (2015) presented a comprehensive chemistry
    scheme (134 species and 4169 reactions) to describe tar formation using CHEMKIN.
    El Wajeh et al. (2023) developed a mechanistic model with rigorous thermodynamics
    for biodiesel production. The second challenge for researchers using modelling
    platforms is to integrate solids, batch and custom processing unit modelling.
    For example, fluidised beds of biomass gasification are used as a technical process,
    which has the ability to promote high levels of contact between gases and solids
    (e.g. biomass, sand and catalyst). However, there is a lack of a library model
    to simulate fluidised bed unit operation in widely used commercial platform (e.g.
    Aspen Plus). It is possible for users to input their own models, using FORTRAN
    codes nested within the Aspen Plus input file, to simulate operation of a fluidised
    bed (Nikoo and Mahinpey, 2008). 3.4.3. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for
    unit operation CFD is a powerful tool which uses numerical analysis and data structures
    to model and analyse biomass conversion processes that involve complex multiphase
    fluid flows with mass, momentum and heat transfers. To simulate unit operation,
    CFD is the most-powerful numerical tool available, empowering researchers to achieve
    economic and environmental targets as they optimise reactor and product''s performances.
    Widely used commercial software of CFD includes well-validated physical modelling
    capabilities to deliver fast, accurate results across the widest range of CFD
    and multiphysics applications. CFD modelling has been successfully implemented
    on various biorenewable systems e.g. pyrolysis (Zhong et al., 2023; Luo et al.,
    2023), gasification (Zhang et al., 2023; von Berg et al., 2023), combustion (Lian
    and Zhong, 2023; Zhang et al., 2022), liquefaction (Ustolin et al., 2022), anaerobic
    digestion (Bastiani et al., 2023; Dabiri et al., 2023), fermentation (Teke et
    al., 2023). CFD can be used to model reactors across a wide array of physical
    scales, from milli-scale to full industrial scale (Bastiani et al., 2023; Begall
    et al., 2023). The advantages of CFD modelling are to (a) reduce time and costs
    for new design of reactor; (b) analyse biorenewable problems when experiments
    are relatively difficult and dangerous (e.g. high temperature and pressure); (c)
    offer the capacity of studying biorenewable systems under extreme conditions over
    practical limitations. The disadvantages of CFD modelling are: (a) it is usually
    necessary to simplify mathematically the phenomenon (e.g. chemistry or turbulence)
    to facilitate calculus; thus the result accuracy depends on mathematical simplification;
    (b) there are several incomplete models to describe the turbulence, and multiphase
    phenomena. CFD model for liquid and gas phase in biorenewable problems are relatively
    robust. The promising future directions of CFD modelling on biorenewable problems
    are - to improve modelling accuracy of multiphase phenomenon, particularly for
    particulate flows. There are two main methodologies, Eulerian and Lagrangian,
    to model particulate flows in biorenewable problems. The Eulerian model of particulate
    flow is a way of looking at particle motion that focuses on specific locations
    in the space, through which the particle flows as time passes. The Lagrangian
    model of particulate flow is to investigate particle motion, where the observer
    follows an individual particle parcel as it moves through space and time. Xiong
    et al. (2017) pointed out the improvement of particulate flow modelling. The Eulerian
    method requires in-depth development on the effects of sub-grid structures such
    as particle clustering, size distribution, and temporal changes of particle size
    and shape. The Lagrangian method necessitates accurate but computationally efficient
    sub-models to consider the influence of intraparticle transport phenomena. Additionally,
    the high computational cost of CFD modelling is another conundrum when simulating
    large industrial scale systems, especially when the Lagrangian method is applied.
    Recently, advancements in supercomputing and parallel computing, and their wide
    connections to the field of research and development, mean that digital twins
    of large-scale unit operations using a CFD framework are becoming a prospect with
    enormous promise. 3.4.4. Multi-scale process simulation Often, it is challenging
    to determine the correct scale to capture a phenomenon of interest as multiple
    phenomena interact at different scales. Multiscale modelling attempts to address
    this problem. Its importance as a tool in sustainable development was noted by
    Pistikopoulos et al. (2021). Multiscale process simulation and design of biorenewable
    systems are becoming more attractive, and the main challenge is to determine the
    models to run and how they iterate/interact. The fast and robust coupling approaches
    (manual or automated) are essential to advance the development of multiscale process
    simulation. Abdelouahed et al. (2012) proposed an approach to couple Aspen Plus
    and Fortan modules to include detailed chemical mechanisms in process simulators
    without thermodynamic equilibrium assumptions. Using CFD in conjunction with Aspen
    Plus has been suggested as an alternative approach i.e. CFD-generated residence
    time distribution curves were formulated as compartment model under Aspen Plus
    environment to derive process flowsheet configuration and mass/energy balances
    (Arora et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2016). 3.5. Process synthesis and planning
    Process-synthesis and planning is a broad area in process system engineering (PSE),
    covering a wide range of design problems related to manufacturing from an enterprise-centric
    perspective. The key decision variables concerned in the biorenewable conversion
    systems can be summarised as follows: • The decision on manufacturing process
    units and interconnection, unit operation configuration (e.g. temperature), input/output
    flows and composition; • Strategic decisions e.g. investment in new facilities,
    plug-and-play solutions to existing facilities, closure of facilities, process
    repurposing or substituting; • The location and logistics decisions, e.g. location
    of new facility, supply sourcing; • Tactical planning on production, inventory
    and material flows; • Operational decisions e.g. scheduling, batch vs. continuous
    processing. This section will focus on two levels – single-site and multi-site
    optimisation. 3.5.1. Conversion process synthesis At single-site biomass conversion
    level, PSE has been playing significant roles in advancing the computer-aided
    process and reaction network design. Process synthesis determines the flowsheet
    and equipment for given feed and product streams. It is a highly complex problem,
    with a search space that can be very large (Martin et al., 2022). Commonly applied
    techniques for synthesizing process flowsheet include knowledge-based systems/artificial
    intelligence, thermodynamic methods (e.g. pinch analysis, energy analysis), meta-heuristics,
    hierarchical design and superstructure-based optimisation (Grossmann and Guillén-Gosálbez,
    2010; Ouelhadj and Petrovic, 2009; Kokossis and Yang, 2010). Knowledge-based systems
    have been applied to conventional waste treatment decision-support (Aulinas et
    al., 2011) but more exploration on artificial intelligence supported dynamic design
    has emerged as a new research direction. Other techniques including pinch analyses,
    energy analyses and hierarchical decomposition have been evidenced to be effective
    in process industrial applications (Grossmann and Guillén-Gosálbez, 2010) with
    the potential to contribute to sustainable bio-product synthesis (Othman et al.,
    2017; Cai et al., 2016; Yong et al., 2016). These concepts were further combined
    with mathematical programming approaches to support process design. Under the
    mathematical programming framework, the representative superstructure-based synthesis
    problem is defined with given sets of feedstock and product streams and alternative
    processing units; a mathematical optimisation is further formulated to define
    the objective functions and a range of continuous and discrete variables. Such
    superstructure-based optimisation model often lead to mixed integer programming
    (MIP) problems, which can be generalised as follows - Where notes the objective
    functions consisting of conflicting multiple objectives. The continuous variables
    x are normally non-negative, presenting the input-output flows and compositions
    as well as certain design and operational decisions; discrete variables y define
    the selection of process units/locations etc. and their interconnections. Both
    continuous and discrete variables follow the equality constraints g. material
    balance and inequality constraints d satisfy the design specifications (e.g. production
    discharge allowance, physical operational limits and demands) and logical constraints.
    In contrast to the conventional fossil-based processing industry, biorenewable
    conversion synthesis problems are characteristic of carbon flows from carbon sequestration
    via photosynthesis to carbon transformation to bioproducts. This has been captured
    in the published superstructure-based optimisation studies integrated with life
    cycle approach. Chen et al. (2011) presented a process synthesis optimisation
    problem for the poly-generation system using biomass and coal as feedstock for
    power, biofuel and chemical production. They explored the carbon taxation effects
    of the carbon capture and storage via biomass use. Wang et al. (2013) formulated
    a multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to investigate
    the trade-off between cost optimal and GHG minimised solutions for thermochemical
    conversion processes of lignocellulosic resources to hydrocarbons. In their study,
    the LCA end-point characterisation (Eco-indicator 99) method was introduced to
    set the upper boundary for threshold constraints on gate-to-gate overall environmental
    impacts, with the carbon accounted for by using a carbon counting approach. Later,
    this attributional life cycle optimisation framework was expanded to include consequential
    perspectives, where a deterministic MINLP model was formulated to optimise the
    production network for microalgae biofuel and both GWP mid-point and Recipe end-point
    characterisation models were applied (Gong and You, 2017). They adopted a system
    expansion allocation principle to account for the changes in environmental impacts
    caused by the system decision with boundary expanded to include the upstream and
    downstream markets change as a consequence of algae biofuel production. This represents
    an emerging research direction where a systematic comparison between attributional
    and consequential life cycle optimisation deserves further research attention.
    Martín and Grossmann (2011) formulated a MINLP superstructure optimisation model
    to derive energy-optimised solutions for switchgrass-based bioethanol via gasification
    route where the optimisation problem was decomposed to eight sub-problems and
    pinch analyses was applied for heat integration. A decomposition principle was
    introduced to another methodology study to decompose the biorefinery synthesis
    optimisation model into sub-problems to solve the possible pathways while considering
    global optimal solutions (Pham and El-Halwagi, 2012). The research group from
    Texas A & M University employed a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve a large-scale
    non-convex MINLP optimisation model and optimised a range of process synthesis
    problems on biofuel and bio-chemicals derived from MSW (Niziolek et al., 2017)
    wastewater and lignocellulosic biomass (Matthews et al., 2016; Baliban et al.,
    2013; Niziolek et al., 2016) via integrated thermochemical and biochemical routes.
    The studies reviewed above were based on deterministic optimisation frameworks
    with the processes formulated by adopting publically available results from either
    simulation (e.g. NREL studies) or laboratory work (Voll and Marquardt, 2012a),
    and the life cycle inventory retrieved from available databases e.g. Ecoinvent
    (Wang et al., 2013). Puchongkawarin et al. (2015), Puchongkawarin et al. (2016)
    presented an integrated superstructure-based modelling framework for wastewater
    recovery process synthesis by incorporating process simulation, life cycle approach
    and optimisation. These authors proposed an iterative approach to 1) feed the
    surrogate models constructed from state-of-the-art WWT simulators (GPS-X) and
    performance regression approximated from the techno-economic and LCA evaluation
    to the multi-objective MINLP optimisation model to generate the Pareto frontiers
    for the trade-offs between maximised net present value (NPV) and minimised GHG
    and eutrophication; 2) to refine and verify the process design by feeding back
    the optimal design solutions until model convergence. In addition, mixed integer
    linear programming (MILP) models have been developed and applied for process synthesis
    particularly for metabolic pathways (Lee et al., 2000). A reaction-network-flux
    analysis (RNFA) has been developed by a research group from RWTH University (Voll
    and Marquardt, 2012b). The MILP optimisation-based RNFA has been applied as a
    screening method for ranking and identifying optimal routes amongst a large number
    of alternative reaction pathways for a wide range of novel biofuels (e.g. furan,
    2-methyfuran, butyllevulinate) generated from lignocellulosic biosynthesis (Voll
    and Marquardt, 2012a). The authors further extended RNFA to include sensitivity
    analyses to account for the parametric uncertainties in the reaction efficiency
    and achieved robust ranking (Ulonska et al., 2016); their results highlighted
    promising alternatives to bioethanol (ethyllevulinate and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran)
    and concluded that lignin-based biofuel is considered as not competitive in terms
    of costs and environmental impacts (evaluated using end-point approach Eco-indicator
    99). Kim et al. (2013) presented a superstructure-based MILP framework for biofuel
    conversion system configuration considering 1 G and 2 G biomass. In their study,
    the reaction network was explored from both bottom-up and top-down perspectives
    (i.e. optimal strategy for a desired product, optimal utilisation of a given feedstock).
    Bao et al. (2011) presented a MILP model to screen alternative reaction pathways
    and determine the biorefinery network configurations to meet a certain objective,
    where a case study is given considering thermal (gasification) and biochemical
    routes (AD and fermentation). In addition to reaction and process networks, MILP
    has also been introduced in the process configuration e.g. separation. (Kong and
    Shah 2016) presented a MILP optimisation approach for the conceptual design of
    an economic optimal reaction distillation system; this framework can be further
    expanded for the wider applications in biorefinery process design with multiple
    design criteria. The biorefinery process synthesis design problem is also one
    of three used by Martin et al. (2022) to highlight the need for further development
    of computational design tools in process systems engineering in order to deliver
    on sustainable development objectives. 3.5.2. Enterprise-wide optimisation At
    the multi-site level, wider temporal and spatial scales are involved; enterprise-wide
    optimisation (EWO) has emerged as an effective approach to solve the design problem.
    EWO involves optimising the operations of supply, manufacturing (batch or continuous)
    and distribution in an enterprise (Grossmann, 2005) with some overlap with the
    term ‘supply chain management’. In contrast to supply chain modelling, EWO focuses
    more on the manufacturing stages of a process industry with emphasis on their
    planning, scheduling and control. This often involves nonlinear programming (e.g.
    MINLP) due to the realistic manufacturing presentation (e.g. capacity) (Grossmann
    and Guillén-Gosálbez, 2010; Grossmann, 2005), although Toorajipour et al. (2021)
    noted an increase in academic research using AI-based methods . Compared with
    widely adopted supply chain optimisation, EWO applications in biorenewable system
    design are rather limited. Sitting at the interface of PSE and operations research
    (OR), EWO has received increasing recent interest with many models developed for
    fossil-based process industry in both OR and PSE fields. Grossmann (2005) reviewed
    the development and the challenges on multi-scale EWO, uncertainty and algorithms.
    The long-term strategy (e.g. investment) need to be coordinated with the medium-term
    tactical decisions (e.g. production, planning and material flows) and the short-term
    operational decisions (e.g. scheduling and control); uncertainties vary with different
    scales thus how to account for stochastic variations remains an unsolved issue.
    The author (Grossmann, 2005) pointed out the development of advanced computational
    algorithms and grid computing toolkit are needed for solving such large-scale
    EWO problems with uncertainties (e.g. demands, capital inputs). Later, Grossmann
    (2012) presented a follow-up review of the mathematical programming techniques
    (e.g. MIP, stochastic programming and decomposition approach) applied to the EWO
    research and highlighted EWO features i.e. the integration of internet of things
    (IoT) data with decision-making across enterprise-centric multi-scale functions.
    The incorporation of economic and environmental sustainability criteria into multi-objective
    EWO was discussed by Grossmann and Guillén-Gosálbez (2010) with an overview of
    the mathematical modelling techniques. EWO applications so far range from petroleum
    industry (Shah et al., 2011) to pharmaceutical sectors (Shah, 2004a). Especially
    under the Industry 4.0 strategic initiative proposed in 2013 (National Academy
    of Science and Engineering, 2013), multi-scale EWO is expected to play a more
    significant role. Industry 4.0 envisages factories and supply chains where products
    and machines are all connected to achieve inter-connective communication, and
    smart collection and analyses of data, as well as the co-ordinated processes in
    a distributed fashion (National Academy of Science and Engineering, 2013). This
    industrial revolution is expected to bring new business models, enhanced collaboration
    across the supply chain and information-track capability for identifying individual
    resource and products (Branke et al., 2016). Data-driven EWO can deal well with
    multi-scale optimisation problems, with van de Berg et al. (2023) showing that
    distributed data-driven EWO can in some cases recover the performance of the centralized
    problem formulation. Thus EWO and data-driven integrated approaches can be used
    to bridge the long-term design problems (e.g. process and network design) with
    medium and short-term objectives (such as responsiveness and flexibility at operational
    level). Several optimisation methods have been proposed for solving multi-scale
    problems in manufacturing systems. For process scheduling at multi-site, the existing
    scheduling formulation can be broadly classified into discrete-time and continuous-time
    approaches. The most generally-adopted unified frameworks for process representations
    (State-Task and Resource-Task Network (RTN)) have been developed based on discrete-time
    scheduling formulations (Kondili et al., 1993; Grossmann, 2003; Pantelides, 1994);
    this has been further explored to reduce computational time by deploying different
    optimisation techniques (e.g. linear programming relaxation of MILP) (Shah et
    al., 1993). Later, the unified framework was extended to RTN-based rolling horizon
    algorithms, which enable to solve large-scale optimisation problems and reduce
    computational time (Dimitriadis et al., 1997). Due to the inherent limitations
    of the discrete-time approaches, significant research efforts were also devoted
    to develop continuous-time representations, (Floudas and Lin, 2004). To bridge
    multi-scale optimisation problem, Maravelias and Grossman (Maravelias and Grossmann,
    2001) formulated a large-scale MILP model to optimise the short-term scheduling,
    process network design and capacity planning for batch manufacturing facilities,
    where the discrete uncertainties in raw material prices and final product demands
    were captured. The derived large-scale MILP model was solved using a Lagrangean
    decomposition heuristic algorithm (Maravelias and Grossmann, 2001). Later the
    simultaneous short-term batch scheduling and middle-term planning for a single-unit
    continuous multi-product system was optimised using a MILP model (Dogan and Grossmann,
    2006). To improve the computational tractability, the authors proposed a bi-level
    decomposition algorithm to solve this MILP for large-scale design problem in a
    continuous plants with multiple units operated in parallel (Erdirik-Dogan and
    Grossmann, 2008). More recently, two algorithms (bi-level and Lagrangean decomposition)
    were compared (You et al., 2011; Calfa et al., 2013); the results demonstrated
    bi-level decomposition as a superior approach in terms of computation time for
    solving the multi-period MILP model to achieve the simultaneous multi-site solutions
    for capacity transformation via reactor modification(or batch scheduling) and
    production-distribution network planning. The optimisation frameworks reviewed
    above could potentially be applied to design the highly customised batch operation
    system under Industry 4.0, where the users can adjust smart factory configuration
    through remote/control terminals and data advances (Wang et al., 2016). In addition
    to the supply side, EWO is also proposed to explore industrial demand side management
    across multi temporal and spatial scales such as 1-year electricity demand scheduling
    integrated with long-term procurement problem (Zhang and Grossmann, 2016). Compared
    with the petroleum industry, little research has been carried out on the applications
    of EWO in biorenewable multi-scale optimisation. A MILP model was presented to
    solve the bioethanol-gasoline integrated system, which bridged several level design
    problems including short-term scheduling (e.g. sales at retail centre and batch
    production), medium-term planning at biomass cultivation and fuel production sites
    (e.g. capacity, resource flows) and long-term strategy (e.g. location and capacity
    planning) (Andersen et al., 2013). 3.5.3. Research challenge Overall, biorenewable
    production systems differ substantially from conventional petroleum chemical industry
    due to the carbon circular nature, underlying uncertainties and the digital transformation
    potential under Industry 4.0. There exist ‘smart and circular manufacturing system’
    opportunities in biorenewable sectors where process synthesis and EWO are effective
    approaches for exploring enterprise-centric optimal configurations. The identified
    example systems and research opportunities include - • Process synthesis for closed-loop
    systems with biorenewable production from waste resources to capture and fix atmospheric
    carbon dioxide and recover other pollutants; • Biogenic carbon circular bio-refinery
    network design for phototrophic microbial carbon fixation and biorenewable synthesis;
    • Operational decisions and tactical planning under digitalisation and industry
    4.0 – batch processing with optimised responsiveness, flexibility and resource-use
    efficiency; • Strategic decisions on process/infrastructure repurposing or substituting
    to achieve the transition from petroleum to biorenewable production system; •
    Multi-scale biorenewable enterprise optimisation problems to bridge the strategic
    and tactical planning with operational decisions and incorporate the stochastic
    variations. 3.6. Supply chain optimisation As discussed in the previous reviews
    (Mirkouei et al., 2017; Shah, 2004b), supply chain (SC) optimisation concerns
    multi-site operational decisions on manufacturing and distribution, including
    upstream biomass cultivation, biomass and waste collection, pretreatment and conversion,
    downstream distribution and storage. Compared with the petroleum sector, biorenewable
    supply chains are complicated by their interconnection with ecosystems and built
    environments, and multi-echelon complexity with new agent groups and SC structure
    evolved from the bioeconomy transition. A number of excellent reviews have been
    published on supply chain optimisation (Shah, 2004b; Papageorgiou, 2009; Garcia
    and You, 2015; Yue et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2013a). Instead of a broad coverage
    of SC studies, this section reviews state-of-the-art model advances in multi-echelon
    and multi-scale biorenewable value chain design, analyses the biorenewable SC
    characteristics and proposes future research opportunities. 3.6.1. Overview of
    terrestrial/aquatic/waste supply chain optimisation A number of biorenewable supply
    chain optimisation studies have been published with majority focusing on pyrolysis,
    gasification, bioethanol, anaerobic digestion, hydrogen production technologies
    (Fig. 12B) and lignocellulosic feedstock sourced from terrestrial plants and agricultural/forests
    waste (Ghaderi et al., 2016). Aquatic phototrophs and waste value chain planning
    have attracted more research attention lately. A microalgae based supply chain
    was modelled using spatial-temporal MILP under both deterministic 640, 641and
    robust modes (Mohseni et al., 2016) to explore the cost optimal design for biodiesel
    under supply-demand variance and constraints. Both studies (Ahn et al., 2015;
    Mohseni et al., 2016) considered the supply chain integration i.e. the wastewater
    nutrient recovery via algae cultivation and carbon capture and utilisation cycles
    through microalgae photosynthesis and lipid-extraction and conversion at the refinery.
    The modelled systems were bounded by the logistics and capacity of the wastewater
    treatment facilities and pipelines. However, the important spatially-explicit
    abiotic environmental drivers (solar radiation and temperature) underpinning microalgae
    photosynthesis were only modelled in the study by Mohseni et al. (2016). Due to
    the resource complexity and variability at spatial/temporal horizons, waste streams,
    particularly BFMSW, remain as a relatively untapped opportunity in supply chain
    optimisation (Floudas et al., 2016). A multi-objective MIP model was proposed
    accounting for the overall sustainability of multiple bio-solid waste streams
    throughout their cradle-to-grave life cycles (Čuček et al., 2012b). The model
    was configured to consider the mechanical pre-treatment and energy conversation
    via incineration and anaerobic digestion of MSW, forestry and crop residuals and
    manure; through system boundary expansion, authors modelled the consequential
    LCA implications of product substitution on value chain design (Čuček et al.,
    2012b). Santibañez-Aguilar et al. (Santibañez-Aguilar et al., 2013) formulated
    a multi-objective MILP model to investigate the stream-separated MSW value chain
    design across-cities to achieve the maximisation of profit and waste recovery.
    A follow-up study was performed to incorporate the sustainability and safety design
    criteria in the MILP framework for the strategic planning of MSW supply chains
    considering mechanical (e.g. recycling) and thermochemical (pyrolysis, gasification,
    combustion) routes (Santibañez-Aguilar et al., 2015). Waste gas and water streams
    from various processing industries were addressed in supply chain planning but
    previous research often focused on single stream management rather than integrated
    multiple streams with diverse composition. As the diversified waste feedstocks
    increase the optimisation complexity significantly, bringing multi-scale design
    problems, which need to consider both superstructure-based process synthesis and
    value chain planning. Gao and You (2015) formulated a life cycle based MINLP model
    to design the network and management strategy of the wastewater stream from shale
    gas extraction; a MILP model was proposed to bridge the long-term supply chain
    planning and short-term batch scheduling problems for water management on shale
    gas sites considering environmental constraints (Yang et al., 2015b; Bartholomew
    and Mauter, 2016). Previous optimisation studies addressed carbon capture and
    storage or utilisation and its integration with algae biofuel value chains, where
    the spatial carbon sink and source effects over discrete time intervals were mapped
    (Yue et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2013). A flare-gas to bio-butanol NLP model was
    presented to explore the trade-offs between NPV optimal and GHG minimisation,
    considering the spatially-explicit flare gas streams from multi-sites (Hoseinzade
    and Adams, 2016). Through an overview of biorenewable SC upstream and downstream
    optimisation studies, a range of promising supply chains have emerged, which deserve
    future research attention- • demand-driven SC integration particularly biorenewable
    products (e.g. pyrolysis bio-crude/bioethanol) with the functional-equivalent
    petroleum counterparts (e.g. petroleum oil/gasoline) 632; • supply-driven SC integration
    for multiple feedstock streams with similar processability e.g. 2 G terrestrial
    biomass integration with 3 G algae via HTL; • centralised and decentralised SC
    integration for multiple bio-products from diversified feedstock such as the wastewater
    recovery network design for business parks with effluents from diverse processing
    industries (O''Dwyer et al., 2018); • waste value chain design under uncertainty
    considering the high variance in waste stream composition and supply; • sustainable
    value chain optimisation for new bio-clusters especially those with higher added-value
    but lower natural capital inputs such as the microbial single cell protein as
    resource-efficient food/feed sources; • Research gaps on value-added biorenewables.
    As mapped out in Fig. 11, considerable empirical research has been carried out
    on novel reaction routes and production pathways, which represents future interests
    e.g. lignocellulosic biochemicals derived from multi-functioning non-food crops
    (phytoremediation on degraded land). • Optimisation studies typically have simplified
    bio-physical models with fixed exogenous pollution coefficients; knowledge gap
    emerged on optimisation with interlinked biophysical and supply-demand modelling.
    3.6.2. Multi-echelon and multi-scale challenges in biorenewable supply chains
    Five interconnected echelons can be generally associated with the biorenewable
    supply chains – resource supply and collection, manufacturing, storage, distribution
    and market (Garcia and You, 2015a; Miranda-Ackerman et al., 2017). As demonstrated
    in Fig. 14, each echelon concerns different decision spaces across temporal and
    spatial scales. Most long-term strategic optimisation studies reflect the decision
    region across supply-manufacturing-distribution echelons but in the short/mid-term
    SC operation, more optimisation effort has been placed on manufacturing decisions
    with a research gap identified on the operational decisions at supply echelons
    (e.g. biomass cultivation stage (Mirkouei et al., 2017)). Supply chain optimisation
    under fixed echelon settings reflects a rigid network structure, focusing on the
    logistics, process capacity, transportation mode, inventory control, resource
    and product flow management. On the contrary, the complexity of the echelons,
    connectivity between adjacent echelons and functions of nodes are not defined
    a priori in flexible echelon supply chain design (Shah, 2004b). Tsiakis et al.
    (2001) proposed an MILP framework for flexible multi-product multi-echelon network
    design with manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and market operated under
    uncertainty. Lima et al. (2023) presented an MILP formulation for optimizing the
    design of a sugarcane-based bioethanol supply chain, comprising harvesting, production,
    storage, and distribution, under demand uncertainty. The sugarcane to bioethanol
    supply chain was also addressed by Wheeler et al. (2021).This has been followed
    by a large amount of literature published on multi-period spatially-explicit models
    for country/region-level multi-product supply chain design, where the decomposition
    techniques (e.g. Lagrangean, Benders decomposition, bi-level decomposition) have
    been proposed to solve the large-scale models and enhance the computational performance
    (Andersen et al., 2013; Jackson and Grossmann, 2003; Rahmaniani et al., 2017;
    Yue and You, 2016). The flexible echelon optimisation framework has been widely
    applied in the biorenewable SC design, enabling systems to consider spatially-explicit
    natural capital resources (e.g. land use), which are essential ecological drivers
    interconnected with biomass (d''Amore and Bezzo, 2016; Natarajan et al., 2014;
    Santibañez-Aguilar et al., 2014). The fixed-echelon concept was adopted for supply
    chain transition design to achieve repurposing or retrofitting existing facilities
    (e.g. petroleum (Tong et al., 2014a) or paper pulp (Martinkus et al., 2017) retrofitted
    to biorefinery). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    associated with different sources of biomass. Multiple spatial and temporal scales
    need to be coordinated in biorenewable value chain decision-making, ranging from
    decisions across time steps (hour, day, month, year) to decisions on site location
    and network at each echelon. As the multi-scale effects relating to the manufacturing
    echelon have been well addressed in previous reviews (Garcia and You, 2015a),
    our discussion focuses on the supply echelon. At the biomass supply stage, not
    only strategic planning on land use pattern (e.g. food vs. energy), crop rotation
    and resource flows, but also the short-term on-farm operational decisions (field
    operations, irrigation, agro-chemical or fertiliser applications) are important.
    There have been some attempts to bring a PSE-style optimisation approach to operational
    decision-making in controlled-environment agriculture (such as (Hu and You, 2023)
    and (Chen et al., 2022)), and mathematical programming also has been widely applied
    to large-scale long-term agricultural land management; however, the decision variables
    relating to the operational management of conventional farms are rarely considered
    (Li et al., 2017). These variables (e.g. fertilization, irrigation, harvesting)
    not only affect the biomass yield and quality but also are highly related to biogeochemical
    cycles (e.g. carbon and nitrogen cycling), which impact the environmental performances
    of biomass and biorenewable systems (e.g. field emissions CO2, CH4, N2O NH3, impacting
    eutrophication and global warming) (Guo, 2012). In addition, biomass supply can
    be distributed over large spatial areas, where multiple layers are involved e.g.
    distribution and trading layer, biomass growth layer. The biomass plantation location
    and sizing selection highly depend on the soil and climate variables (e.g. temperature,
    solar radiation, soil texture and quality) across spatial scales, which are environmental
    drivers for biomass yields and influence biogeochemical processes. The response
    functions of biomass growth and agro-ecosystem C/N cycling to both operational
    and ecological factors could be captured by first-principle modelling (e.g. biogeochemical
    simulation) and incorporated into optimisation using surrogate models or discrete
    scenarios. Surrogate modelling can be traced back to the end of 1980s. New research
    areas emerged to apply response surface model (RSM) to computer experiments and
    approximate functions to model and optimise complex systems. To reduce computational
    complexity using simulation, a ‘black-box’ approach can be applied to use the
    original simulator as a source of computational experiments to generate data points.
    The sampled input-output data can be fit into surrogate functions. Different sampling
    techniques have been explored such as Sobol’ sequences techniques (Sobol′, 2001),
    which provide good input space coverage in a minimum number of samples. Research
    also covered different RSM methods including noninterpolating (i.e. least squared
    error of some predetermined functional form) and interpolating (pass through all
    points e.g. Kriging interpolation) approaches. As applied in previous research
    (Caballero and Grossmann, 2008), Kriging interpolation method models the underlying
    function as a stochastic process and has the benefit of quantifying the uncertainty
    in the surrogate model predictions. However, the requirement for the inversion
    of a covariance matrix in the model formulation means high-dimensional problems
    can become computationally demanding. Alternatively, artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) or other metaheuristic algorithms can correlate multiple input-output relationships
    and derive a good degree of accuracy (Gonzalez-Garay and Guillen-Gosalbez, 2018;
    Ibrahim et al., 2018). Recent advances in surrogate-based optimisation has been
    covered in a comprehensive review by Forrester and Keane (Forrester and Keane,
    2009) and surrogate-based optimisation advances in PSE is reviewed by Bhosekar
    and Ierapetritou (Bhosekar and Ierapetritou, 2018). Despite the wide applications
    of surrogate modelling in modular flowsheet optimisation of chemical processes
    (Henao and Maravelias, 2011), its application in soft-linking first-principle
    biogeochemical models with mathematical optimisation remains unexplored. By applying
    such meta-model approach, the derived surrogate models are expected to represent
    the accuracy of first-principle modelling and project the C/N cycling over continuous
    time. Integrating surrogate functions into whole system optimisation, the date-driven
    modelling techniques could enable computationally tractable decision based on
    accurate projection of environmental process over temporal and spatial scales.
    Such data-driven optimisation can reflect the implications of the temporal and
    spatial-scale decisions on the wider biorenewable supply chain design. Overall,
    the biorenewable complexity at multiple scales may result in large scale optimisation
    models thus the future research challenge in this highly cross-disciplinary field
    lies in the trade-offs between optimisation solution quality and computational
    complexity. 3.6.3. Natural capital and built environment resources Biorenewable
    supply chains are interconnected with natural capital (e.g. land, water, air)
    and built environmental resources (e.g. electricity, infrastructure) and constrained
    by their capacities (e.g. land availability and electricity generation capacity)
    across spatial and temporal scales. These not only form the optimisation model
    exogenous constraints but also underpin the resource competition issues between
    multiple sectors (e.g. food vs. bioenergy, biorenewable vs. petroleum). The majority
    of the optimisation models define biomass availability as given parameters independent
    of natural capital resource e.g. land (Lautenbach et al., 2013) and water (Reed
    et al., 2013). Relatively different, few studies considered biorenewable value
    chain competition and decision variables on land use (Guo et al., 2016; Cobuloglu
    and Buyuktahtakin, 2015; Cucek et al., 2014; Cobuloglu and Büyüktahtakın, 2017).
    Cobuloglu and Büyüktahtakın (2015) formulated a deterministic MILP model to explore
    the arable land decisions on a switch grass-based biofuel and food competition
    at different spatial scales; the authors further proposed a stochastic MIP model
    to optimise food-biofuel competition considering the variance in biomass yield
    and price (Cobuloglu and Buyuktahtakin, 2017). A Stackelberg–Nash game model was
    developed to study the effects of land use regulations on the food and biofuel
    balance (Cobuloglu and Büyüktahtakın, 2017). Cucek et al. (2014) developed a multi-period
    MILP model to optimise the total land areas devoted for biofuel and food demands.
    However, not all the land is suitable for biomass production due to soil and typographic
    constraints. Two land taxonomy systems arise here which are related to biomass
    optimisation problems – soil type and land cover. The former refers to different
    sizes of mineral particles (clay, silt, sand) in the soil samples, varying with
    countries e.g. the UK soil taxonomy with 10 major groups (Clayden and Hollis,
    1984); whereas the latter represents the observed biophysical cover on the earth''s
    surface (FAO, 2017), which has been developed at national or regional level e.g.
    UK land cover map (Centre for Ecology and Hyrology, 2015) and EU CORINE (coordination
    of information on the environment) land cover classification (EuropeanCommission,
    2009). Soil type as an important environmental driver has been taken into account
    in various biogeochemical models; spatial land cover and slope layers have been
    incorporated in national SC optimisation models to identify the optimal site location
    for PV water pumping systems in China (Campana et al., 2015) and to design UK
    spatial-temporal bioenergy supply chains accounting for the trade-offs of cost
    optimal and environmental targets (Samsatli et al., 2014; Newton-Cross, 2015).
    The UK national bioenergy model ETI-BVCM (Samsatli et al., 2014; Newton-Cross,
    2015) was formulated as a MILP optimisation, where the GHG and biomass yield derived
    from empirical models were embedded and initial land cover GIS layers were included;
    this model was further extended to incorporate spatially explicit land competition
    between bioenergy and non-energy systems over time at different land types (arable,
    grassland, forestry land etc.) and the ecosystem services impacts in response
    to the decisions on land use changes (Guo et al., 2016). However, an overarching
    framework to integrate first-principle biogeochemical models (e.g. DNDC, ECOSSE)
    with multi-scale multi-echelon optimisation has not been explored and represents
    a promising research direction; this approach brings soil biogeochemical cycles
    and soil-plant interaction into the land use decision framework, which underpins
    the terrestrial biomass-dependent biorenewables and enables supply chain optimisation
    to account for soil and other environmental variables. It is particularly interesting
    to model a range of land-use mitigation strategies e.g. land sharing and sparing
    schemes (Smith et al., 2013b; Phalan et al., 2011) in the optimisation to shift
    the land competition to land-use integration or reconfigure the biorenewable systems
    via sustainable agriculture intensification (Phalan et al., 2011). In addition,
    land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as alternative strategies to achieve
    both production and biodiversity conservation (Fischer et al., 2014). Land-sparing
    involves specialization of land uses, setting aside lands for conservation and
    implies agriculture intensification somewhere else to compensate for a reduced
    area availability (Green et al., 2005). In contrast, land-sharing is defined as
    making production lands more conducive to biodiversity conservation to integrate
    food production with ecosystem services (Green et al., 2005).Both strategies require
    a financial concession to conservation (i.e. opportunity cost), thus it is essential
    to identify the cost-effective strategy for ecosystem services conservation (Edwards
    et al., 2014). Alternative land-sharing and land-sparing strategies, including
    mixed strategies, have been evaluated by integrating multi-objective integer programming
    with conservation planning in previous research (Law et al., 2017). With the increasing
    concerns on the ongoing global degradation of natural capital, the competition
    issues on other resources especially water, and interaction of natural landscape
    and environment with biorenewable products deserve future research efforts. Substantial
    amounts of water are used and waterborne pollutants are discharged at multiple
    supply chain echelons (biomass cultivation, biorenewable conversion). The water-biorenewable
    nexus have been considered in several optimisation works. By bringing the water
    footprint into the objective function, Garcia and You (2015b) proposed a multi-objective
    MILP model for water-biofuel network design. Similarly, water resource use, regional
    watershed management and wastewater discharge were considered in the design criteria
    in the biorefinery supply chain model proposed by López-Díaz et al. (2017), where
    the interaction of a watershed with the entire supply chain was characterised
    using material flows. Another important natural capital is carbon dioxide assimilation.
    In contrast to linear supply chain optimisation problems, the carbon circular
    and waste-based biorenewable systems lead to closed-loop supply chain design.
    Closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) has been of great interest for mathematical modellers;
    an up-to-date review on the CLSC research can be found in Cui et al. (2017), Hamdouch
    et al. (2017a), Soleimani et al. (2017). The strategic (e.g. location), tactical
    and operational (e.g. inventory) decisions at multiple echelons have been modelled
    in multi-objective CLSC research considering social-economic-environmental criteria
    under uncertain environment with varying infrastructure, demand, costs, recycling
    and social impacts (Zhalechian et al., 2016; Pishvaee and Torabi, 2010; Pishvaee
    et al., 2011; Devika et al., 2014; Amin and Zhang, 2013). In contrast to the centralised
    supply chain design strategy, Nash equilibrium framework was adopted to formulate
    decentralised stochastic CLSC under demand and return uncertainties (Hamdouch
    et al., 2017b; Rezapour et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2009). Applying CLSC design
    in biorenewables, the closed-loop biogenic carbon refinery supply chains (e.g.
    bio-based recyclable PET bottle) can be simulated to explore the potential contribution
    of such circular biorenewables to the global climate change mitigation. Natural
    capital underpin ecosystem services, which are delivered to human wellbeing through
    the flows and interactions between natural capital assets, built capital (built
    environment) and human capital assets (people and society). Previous research
    has elaborated the interconnection between natural capital and built capital assets
    by examining ecosystem services trade-offs (Costanza et al., 2014). The evolvements
    of existing infrastructure and resource flows as part of the built environment
    (e.g. transportation, energy, waste treatment and water supply) can be defined
    as exogenous but uncertain parameters in optimisation models. Two types of supply
    chain risks arise from the uncertainty in built environment resources and infrastructure
    i.e. operational or disruption risks. The former refers to the fluctuation in
    the biorenewable supply chains due to the uncertainties in the supply and demand
    of the built environment resources; while the latter is associated with the external
    interruption in built environment (e.g. infrastructure failure) caused by natural
    or artificial extreme events (e.g. policy intervention, flooding, hurricane) (Tang,
    2006). The capacity, demand and interdependency of these infrastructures under
    future uncertainty can be captured via system simulation e.g. the UK ITRC national
    infrastructure modelling platform based on a system of systems approaches (UK
    Infrastructure Transition Research Consortium, 2017). By adopting simulation parameters
    as exogenous boundary conditions, scenario-based stochastic optimisation can be
    used to explore biorenewable SC decision-making under built environment uncertainties
    and risks (Huang and Pang, 2014). 3.6.4. Cooperative vs. non-cooperative supply
    chain strategies Across five supply chain echelons, multiple interactive nodes
    are involved in the supply chain decision-making, where the nodes can compete
    in either cooperative or non-cooperative fashion. Unlike the centralised optimisation
    approach, competitive supply chain problems represent a decentralised system with
    each decision-maker taking their own strategies, which often conflict with each
    other. Different negotiation scenarios have been studied in optimisation - cooperative
    games with competition between groups of players (Wu et al., 2017b), non-cooperative
    games and standalone cases (Hjaila et al., 2016). A scenario-based dynamic negotiation
    model was formulated by Hjaila et al. (2016), which enables leaders and followers
    to participate in production-distribution decentralised networks and explore both
    cooperative/non-cooperative games under uncertainties. The cooperative mode was
    also modelled for decentralised water-use network (Cao et al., 2007). In comparison,
    the non-cooperative game with n nodes underpinned by the Nash equilibrium concept
    (Nash, 1950, 1951) is the most widely used methods of predicting the outcomes
    of a strategic interaction. Nash-type mathematical programming proposed by Gjerdrum
    et al. (2002), Gjerdrum et al. (2001) was a new method to model the inter-organizational
    cooperation and information sharing mechanisms as well as profit distribution
    amongst nodes under a competitive environment. The authors formulated a deterministic
    MINLP model to determine the optimal transfer prices for n-node supply chain;
    MINLP functions were linearised using logarithmic differentiation and approximation.
    Yue and You (2014) further studied the profit allocation in a non-cooperative
    supply chain by optimising transfer prices and revenue sharing, where a branch-and-refine
    algorithm developed by You and Grossmann (2011) was applied to solve the model.
    Later on, the same authors proposed a bi-level optimisation model to explore competitive
    biofuel supply chain decisions following the Stackelberg leader–follower game
    theory (Yue and You, 2017). To model the uncertainties in both leader and follower''s
    problems under a non-cooperative and non-zero-sum Stackelberg game, Hjaila et
    al. (2017) proposed an integrated framework to solve the Stackelberg game by a
    MINLP tactical decision model and consider the competition between Stackelberg
    nodes and third parties in a Nash equilibrium model. By using Monte-Carlo simulation,
    the authors derived the pareto-frontier win-win solution set under uncertain competition
    conditions from both leader and follower perspectives. The Nash equilibrium state
    was also explored in the closed-loop supply chain optimisation problems using
    deterministic optimisation (Yang et al., 2009) and a stochastic model considering
    the demand and return variance (Hamdouch et al., 2017b). CLSC Stackelberg leader–follower
    game was formulated as a multi-objective optimisation model and solved using genetic
    algorithms (Aydin et al., 2016). These game-theory models were mostly based on
    fixed supply chain echelon models with exception of Yue and You (2017) and Bai
    et al. (2012), where the flexible echelon based supply chain models were constructed
    with binary variables determining the candidate site selection and biorefinery
    capacity levels. Although land use competition has been recognised as a critical
    issue, facing triple challenges amongst food, bioproduct, and environmental conservation,
    only the Stackelberg–Nash game model formulated by Bai et al. (2012) considered
    the strategic decisions on candidate biorefinery locations and land allocation
    for food and bioenergy crops while taking into account the non-cooperative gaming
    behaviours. The model was further enhanced by the authors Bai et al. (2016) to
    simulate how the farmland use policy regulates food-biofuel production. However,
    as discussed in the previous section, interaction of land with biomass is dynamic,
    varying with land type. Thereby, one of the major challenges lies in how to simultaneously
    model the competitive n-node game and capture the type-specific natural capital
    allocation decisions for resource-competing biorenewable supply chains at fine
    spatial and temporal scales. An optimisation framework was proposed to incorporate
    crop simulators and multiple echelon supply chain competitive games to achieve
    the equilibrium solutions for multi-players (feedstock suppliers, existing industries,
    centralised/decentralised biorenewable operators, investors, and policy-makers)
    (Guo et al., 2017). The land use allocation at four land types (arable, forestry,
    grassland and abandoned) for resource-competing systems and closed-loop waste
    recovery were modelled as decision variables; such modelling approach could be
    extended to simulate other innovative sectors under circular economy. 3.6.5. LCSA
    optimisation incorporating wider ecosystem services By bringing life cycle thinking
    into the decision-making framework, the PSE research community proposed a life
    cycle optimisation (LCO) methodology and applied it to biorenewable multi-scale
    design problems (Grossmann and Guillén-Gosálbez, 2010; Gong and You, 2017; Yue
    et al., 2014; Cambero and Sowlati, 2016; Miret et al., 2016; You et al., 2012).
    Earlier LCO models focused on the trade-off between economic and environmental
    criteria in biofuel supply chain planning from attributional perspectives over
    entire life cycle (Mele et al., 2009) or cradle-to-gate life stages (Zamboni et
    al., 2009). Čuček et al. (2012b) considered sustainability in three pillars and
    extended the attrtibutional LCO framework to social dimensions, which was followed
    by the multi-criteria models presented by You et al. (2012) and Miret et al. (2016).
    They proposed to model direct and indirect job creation as social performance
    indicators, including the employment impacts reflected in biomass supply chain
    operation and infrastructure construction phases and the jobs resulting from local
    economy change throughout the biomass cradle-to-grave life cycle. The activities
    in local micro-economy concerning multiple sectors and nodes were quantified using
    an input-output modelling approach (You et al., 2012); in particular the ‘induced’
    employment opportunities (Miret et al., 2016) resulted from the economic activities
    supported by the household expenditure spent by biorenewable sector-related employees
    have multiplier effects. Such effects in fact reflect the consequential impacts
    although were not discussed by the authors. Until recently, the consequential
    LCO concept was formulated as a global MINLP problem and introduced by Gong and
    You (2017) to capture the changes to the upstream and downstream processes as
    a consequence of trade-off design for a algal biodiesel production network. Landscapes
    generate a range of ecosystem services; the type, magnitude, and relative mix
    of services provided by ecosystems can vary with management interventions, where
    the ES trade-offs could occur at various spatial and temporal scales (Rodriguez
    et al., 2006). Although the importance to incorporate such ES into decisions at
    international, national, local and corporate scales is increasingly recognised
    (Daily and Matson, 2008; Gómez-Baggethun and Ruiz-Pérez, 2011) especially for
    the natural capital-dependent biorenewables, their value is often overlooked in
    resource or biorenewable supply chain planning (Bateman et al., 2013). By introducing
    the location-independent regulating ES impact factors into their MIP model, Hanes
    et al. (2017) formulated an optimisation model to optimise the ES use sustainability
    with supply and demand balance accounted for. In this study, climate-regulation
    and air quality regulation impacts induced by farmland use change were quantified
    as CO2 eq and NO2 eq where the farming activities and carbon nitrogen balances
    were captured using a process-based model WinEPIC but soil drivers were excluded
    by assuming homogeneous soil type. Kovacs et al. (2017) explored the implication
    of ES conservation policies on the trade-offs between ES and agricultural economic
    return optimal for landscape management. In a proposed bioenergy value chain optimisation
    framework (Guo et al., 2016), spatially-explicit provisioning ES relating to the
    food bioenergy, livestock production from dedicated and competing land resources
    were considered quantitatively as is the regulating ES; a semi-quantified matrix
    was introduced as a synthetic measure to account for biodiversity and other ES
    as a consequence of land use transition across different land types. Under this
    framework, the authors proposed to implement quantitative approaches based on
    provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services at various spatial and
    temporal scales to optimise the ES trade-offs for the bioenergy supply chain design.
    An interesting yet unexplored direction is to bring the ES supply-demand mitigation
    strategies into the LCO framework e.g. multi-functional landscape planning (Shifflett
    et al., 2016), phytoremediation or bioremediation on degraded land. Overall, life
    cycle underpinned optimisation offers a promising framework to inform decision-making
    towards biorenewable sustainability; several interesting yet challenging research
    directions lie in the methodological exploration for consequential LCO of closed-loop
    biorenewable supply chains (e.g. biogenic CO2 based recyclable plastic), spatially-explicit
    ES optimisation linked with eco-informatics and ES databank, LCO with wider quantitative
    social dimensions. These challenges can only be addressed via collaborative research
    efforts to bring together multidisciplinary expertise across Ecology, PSE and
    Social Sciences. 3.7. Multi-criteria challenge and supply chain simulation 3.7.1.
    Multi-criteria decision-making Under each biorenewable supply chain echelon, multiple
    nodes are involved in the decision-making process, thereby the biorenewable system
    may lead to many-objective large scale optimisation problems. The term ‘many-objective’
    refers to the optimising systems with four or more design objectives as introduced
    by Fleming et al. (2005), which could be expressed as – ≔ Where the parameter
    vector is subject to boundary constraints, forming the feasible space. The vector
    function f maps the objective space. The PSE literature reviewed above represents
    multi-objective optimisation problems with 2–3 design criteria, which are often
    resolved using a priori or posteriori algorithms to find a whole set or a subset
    of non-dominated solutions. The former involves decision makers prior to the optimisation,
    considering multiple attributes in the form of a weighted sum in a single objective
    function, but it does not reveal the Pareto front supporting an informative decision
    making process and weights introduced for each criteria may change the dominance
    structure of the multi-objective problem and hinder the discovery of global optimum
    solutions (Guillén-Gosálbez, 2011). The latter provides a set of solutions based
    on the trade-off between conflicting objectives and articulates the decision-makers
    preference in searching optimal solutions in the objective space. However, because
    the complexity of multi-objective problems increases sharply increases with the
    number of objectives, (Weidner et al., 2022) more than three conflicting objectives
    in posteriori approach are regarded as computationally intractable. Indeed, Weidner
    et al. (2022) note that optimizing over all nine PBs would be highly computationally
    demanding. Instead of aggregating or omitting the objectives, an alternative approach
    is to reduce the objectives without losing information. Guillén-Gosálbez (2011)
    introduced a posteriori algorithms based on a branch and bound technique to reduce
    the Pareto objective space; via iteration, a set of solutions will be derived
    until the termination criteria are satisfied. Different from both approaches,
    interactive optimisation represents a human-in-the-loop approach (Fig. 14), aiming
    to turn efficient optimisation methods into effective decision-making tools (Meignan
    et al., 2015). The interactive methods articulate the dynamical preferences of
    multi decision-makers based on their gradually-built understanding of the optimisation
    topology and enables the solution search to be progressively refined and directed
    towards the regions of interest; thus this approach can outperform a black box
    optimisation methodology (Hettenhausen et al., 2013). Evolutionary algorithms
    e.g. genetic algorithm (Matrosov et al., 2015), particle swarm optimisation (PSO)
    (Kennedy et al., 1995) and other artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods e.g.
    fuzzy chance-constrained programming (Jin et al., 2017b) have attracted great
    research attention; they were applied to solve many-objective engineering design
    problems including hybrid electricity and gas network (Kou et al., 2017),renewable
    energy scheduling (Lei et al., 2016), collaborative water supply planning (Matrosov
    et al., 2015), and biochemical system design (Taras and Woinaroschy, 2012). Research
    efforts has been also placed on interactive methods for multi-objective MIP; published
    description of methods on the interactive MIP can be found in the review conducted
    by Alves and Clímaco (2007). Visualisation of high dimensional (four or more)
    objective or decision spaces is another challenge. Pryke et al. (2007) presented
    a heatmap visualisation method and compared it with two other approaches (self-organising
    map and distance and distribution charts); a heatmap-based user interface was
    introduced to interactive PSO models (Hettenhausen et al., 2010). Inselberg (Inselberg,
    1985) proposed a parallel coordinates approach to visualise non-dominated candidate
    solutions; this method was combined with evolutionary algorithms (Fleming et al.,
    2005) e.g. web-based PSO-based interactive many-objective optimisation and a scatter-plot
    to plot out any two parameter or objectives to facilitate decision-makers progressively
    articulating design preference (Hettenhausen et al., 2014). Despite the fact that
    interactive optimisation has been successfully applied to engineering design e.g.
    aeronautics, the methodology and application research on many-objective biorenewable
    optimisation is still challenging due to the multi-scale, multi-echelon complexity,
    resource-competing issues concerned and the interaction with wider natural and
    built environments. 3.7.2. Stakeholder interaction and policy intervention Amongst
    multiple decision-maker groups, governmental agencies, policy-makers and regulators
    play significant roles in the new biorenewable technology and supply chain deployment.
    The optimisation studies reported in the literature often focus on the market
    players but considered policy instruments as exogenously parameters (e.g. carbon
    trading price). It is important to account for the policy-makers in the modelled
    system as decision-makers, bring the governmental economic (e.g. budget) targets
    into the objective space and their deployment policy variables into design space.
    This could be achieved by introducing the policy stakeholders as key market regulators
    in the models, which enables them to explore the strategic planning options defining
    the macro economy boundary conditions, setting rules and implementing policies.
    Based on the IRN21, IPCC and IEA renewable energy deployment reports (Agency,
    2011; IPCC, 2015; REN21, 2016), different deployment policies could be summarised
    and expressed as several key schemes (please see related material in the Supplementary
    Information SI-5) (Guo, 2018). By bridging the dialogue barriers and engaging
    the stakeholder groups throughout model development, the academic community could
    scope the model functions from different user perspectives and formulate optimisation
    problems with user-oriented architectures. Such a modelling strategy could more
    effectively inform the decision-making process to ensure the solutions are applicable
    for read-world problem-solving. In addition to policy instruments, the governance
    and supply chain structure, node interaction and behaviours have proven to be
    important factors influencing bioproduct technology deployment (Roos et al., 1999).
    These can be addressed by using agent-based modelling (ABM). ABM adopts a bottom-up
    approach considering each node to react autonomously and cognitively to environmental
    change (Guillem et al., 2015). It has been applied to investigate agriculture-level
    decision making (Guillem et al., 2015; Shastri et al., 2011) as well as biofuel
    supply chain design (Bichraoui-Draper et al., 2015a; Singh et al., 2014; Moncada
    et al., 2015, 2017a, 2017b) and carbon emission trading schemes (Tang et al.,
    2015). The decisions and interactions of each node can be modelled simultaneously
    with solving the multi-scale design problems by using ABM and enabling dynamic
    simulation-optimisation loops in a complex system analysis. Singh et al. (2014)
    combined ABM with a genetic algorithm to investigate how the node decisions at
    biomass-supply echelon under a food-biorefinery competing market affect corn price
    and further influence the biofuel supply chain design. Delval et al. (2016) formulated
    an ABM simulation-optimisation framework to simulate the node interaction at multiple
    levels (vertical and horizontal) based on behavioural diversity and optimise the
    sugarcane supply chain strategic design and each node''s tactical planning simultaneously
    under the demographic evolving context over five decades in South Africa. Via
    soft-linking ABM with LCSA and ecosystem services, research has been carried out
    to evaluate the implications of farmers’ decisions on the greenhouse gases and
    ecosystem services performances of bioenergy supply chains (Guillem et al., 2015;
    Bichraoui-Draper et al., 2015b). Robust optimisation offers an alternative approach
    to supply chain optimisation, treating exogenous decisions, such as demand, as
    uncertainties (Golpîra and Javanmardan, 2022). Employing systems approach, the
    simulation-optimisation-evaluation loops offer powerful modelling tools to explore
    the multi-scale, multi-echelon biorenewable system design space, interconnected
    with natural capital and built environment and accounting for multiple criteria
    from different decision-maker perspectives. However, all models introduce some
    form of approximation, uncertainty or assumptions. Citing George E.P.Box (Box,
    1976) and Sterman (2002) ‘all models are wrong.’ Biorenewables have inherent system
    complexity, which cannot be artificially divided into sub-systems or segments;
    thereby, it is very important to take a whole system approach and break down the
    disciplinary barriers. Forming a systematic cross-disciplinary modelling framework
    (Fig. 14) offers a promising way to merge multi-level research questions and capture
    the dynamic interactions of biorenewable system components as well as their inter-linkage
    with the wider ecosystems, natural and built environments. 3.8. Optimisation under
    uncertainty Following the taxonomy proposed by Peidro et al. (2009), this section
    addresses optimisation under uncertainty from three perspectives – uncertainty
    sources, problem types and modelling approaches. Differing from petroleum based
    counterparts, biorenewable systems particularly those based on the terrestrial
    and aquatic phototrophs are highly dependent on the environmental and ecological
    drivers (e.g. climate, soil, water, vegetation). Thus, there are significant uncertainties
    e.g. feedstock quantity quality and seasonality, across the systems at multiple
    levels due to the temporal, spatial, environmental and socio-economic uncertainty
    and variance, which can be categorised following temporal-scale. As summaries
    in Table 7, in addition to the uncertainty associated with supply chain (demand,
    supply and process) (Peidro et al., 2009), uncertainty is also associated with
    exogenous factors due to environmental or socio-economic interventions (e.g. policy).
    The probability distribution of the ecology or environment related exogenous factors
    can be estimated either based on historical data (e.g. extreme events such as
    flooding earthquakes or meteorological data) or computer simulation (e.g. crop
    yield projection (Guo et al., 2012)); whereas the probability distribution of
    exogenous socio-economic drivers (e.g. market demand, technology evolution) could
    be obtained from system dynamic or economic model forecasts. Often, an optimisation
    problems with discrete (finite) probability spaces are derived for biorenewable
    systems particularly those combining multi-scale uncertainties which could result
    in intractable nonlinear problems if assuming continuous distributions (Govindan
    et al., 2017). Table 7. Overview of the optimisation under uncertainty. STAKEHOLDERS

    unpredictability. Previous studies proposed the classification of uncertainty
    modelling approaches into four groups (Peidro et al., 2009; Awudu and Zhang, 2012)
    – analytical methods (e.g. robust optimisation, stochastic programming), simulation
    methods (e.g. discrete-event simulation, Monte Carlo simulation), artificial intelligence-based
    model (e.g. fuzzy programming, evolutionary programing, genetic algorithm), hybrid
    model (integration of analytical and simulation methods e.g. stochastic dynamic
    programming (Kogut and Kulatilaka, 1994)). As recommended by Peidro et al. (2009),
    analytical approaches generally can be adapted to manage the random uncertainties
    while the simulation and AI-based models can be applicable to capture complex
    system behaviours. Specifically, stochastic programming presents a suitable method
    for biorenewable problems with uncertain parameters represented as a set of discrete
    scenarios with probability levels or a continuous projection ranges (e.g. temperature,
    yield); while robust optimisation could be suitable for the cases where the uncertain
    parameters are represented as uncertainty bounds (e.g. land availability) (Tong
    et al., 2014b). Via literature review, the following points emerged which highlight
    potential opportunities (see Supplementary Information SI-6) - • planning on upstream
    (cultivation (Cobuloglu and Buyuktahtakin, 2014), production (Castillo-Villar
    et al., 2017)), downstream distribution (Zamar et al., 2017), and demand side
    (Fu et al., 2017).have been modelled under uncertain decision-making environment.
    The supply and demand flows and their market prices were widely addressed as uncertainty
    sources but process (e.g. technology evolution (Tong et al., 2014b)) and other
    factors (e.g. policy, biomass quality (Castillo-Villar et al., 2017), climate
    (Sharma et al., 2013b), land availability (Yılmaz Balaman and Selim, 2014; Balaman
    and Selim, 2015)) were not commonly included; • uncertainty-based optimisation
    studies focused on supply chain planning with very little research concerning
    the process synthesis (Geraili and Romagnoli, 2015; Vujanovic et al., 2015; Cheali
    et al., 2016); planning across multi-period horizons is concerned in several studies
    e.g. (Mohseni et al., 2016; Cobuloglu and Buyuktahtakin, 2014; Babazadeh et al.,
    2017; Balaman and Selim, 2016) but the incorporation of tactical, strategic, operational
    planning simultaneously in an uncertain decision-making environment is rarely
    investigated (Geraili and Romagnoli, 2015); • multiple biorenewable supply chain
    integration, resource-competing issues (food vs. biofuel), process repurposing
    and multi-echelon supply chain design under uncertainties still remains unexplored;
    • the analytical and simulation methods along with fuzzy programming were commonly
    adopted approaches in previous research to solve the design problems whereas other
    AI-based models e.g. meta-heuristics approach are worth future research efforts;
    • Benders decomposition was widely applied to solve the scenario-based stochastic
    optimisation programs but other applicable methods e.g. progressive hedging algorithm
    have not been explored in multi-stage stochastic optimisation (Peidro et al.,
    2009; Govindan et al., 2017). • LCA-based optimisation under uncertainty was presented
    to solve multi-criteria design problems for biomass and biorenewables e.g. (Balaman
    and Selim, 2016; Tan et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2009), but social performance was
    often overlooked (e.g. job creation) (Osmani and Zhang, 2017). • Our review confirmed
    the statement of Govindan et al. (2017) that the systematic comparison between
    different modelling approaches deserve further research attention. Linking uncertainty
    concepts with the biorenewable system design, three performance indicators emerged
    - robustness, responsiveness and resilience (Klibi et al., 2010). The solution
    robustness determines the extent to which the system can carry out its functions
    under a variety of future scenarios; as proposed by Klibi et al. (2010) weighted
    scenarios based on random, and worst discrete events should be integrated and
    accounted for in stochastic programming to measure the robustness. System responsiveness
    provides a matrix to evaluate how the system performs in response to short-term
    variations in system inherent operational risks (fluctuation in supply and demand)
    (Tang, 2006); resilience evaluates the system capacity (e.g. structure and resources)
    to quickly recover, adapt and grow facing the unexpected external disruption risks
    caused by natural and artificial disasters (Green Alliance 2013; Tang, 2006; Klibi
    et al., 2010). Deterministic optimisation approaches applied in majority of biorenewable
    systems are not capable of capturing these indicators but uncertainty is particularly
    important for biorenewable system design, which faces higher levels of operational
    and disruption risks than petroleum counterparts (e.g. feedstock supply interruption
    due to natural disaster). Few studies addressed this topic. Pishvaee et al. (2010)
    presented a robust linear optimisation model to address multi-echelon logistic
    network operational design, considering conflicting cost and responsiveness objectives.
    Network responsiveness was also concerned in closed-loop supply chain decisions
    under uncertainty (Shi et al., 2017; Hamidieh et al., 2017; Kadambala et al.,
    2017), where metaheuristic approach (fuzzy genetic programming, PSO) were proposed
    to solve the optimisation problems. At the manufacturing level, responsiveness
    is also important design criterion in particular for assemble-to-order production
    models (Atan et al., 2017). The resilient supply chain as an emerging field has
    not attracted attention until very recently, when pre-disaster planning and infrastructure
    retrofit decision elucidated the concerns on resilience (Li et al., 2011; Huang
    et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2010). Huang and Pang (2014) proposed a multi-objective
    stochastic MIP model for biofuel infrastructure design; the model accounted for
    the conflicting cost and four resilience measures i.e. robustness, rapidity as
    the inherent resistance measures in the infrastructure change to extreme events,
    and redundancy and resourcefulness as the system stability indicators to recover
    functionality from the supply/demand changes. However, the multi-scale, multi-echelon
    responsiveness and resilience in biorenewable system design has not yet been explored;
    by integrating the risk mitigation and resilience-building measures into the stochastic
    spatial-temporal optimisation models, this complex area presents a potential future
    research direction. 3.9. Technology learning curves Understanding how technology
    performance evolves over time is the key for multi-level decision-making on biorenewables
    and underlines the projections on costs of achieving sustainability targets. Different
    hypotheses on endogenous learning-diffusion have been proposed and tested in previous
    research e.g. Moore''s law (Moore, 2006), Wright''s law (Wright, 1936), Goddard
    learning curve (Goddard, 1982), SKC curve (Sinclair et al., 2000), Nordhaus logarithmic
    function (Nordhaus, 2013) (equations presented in Supplementary Information SI-7).
    Previous statistical analyses with tests of over 60 technologies demonstrate Wright''s
    and Moore''s laws outperforming other approaches (Nagy et al., 2013); the authors
    concluded that information technologies tend to follow the Wright''s law whereas
    Moore''s law represents better the patterns of other technologies like fermentation
    although with slower improvement trends. Wright''s law generalised as an experience
    curve (Yeh and Rubin, 2012) represents the ‘learning-by-doing’ phenomenon observed
    in the manufacturing industries and forecasts the unit costs at a cumulative production
    level over time t. Parameters a and b denote the unit cost of the first production
    unit and the rate of cost reduction, respectively (Arrow, 1962). Extending to
    a class of technologies, e.g. energy power plants, the independent variable reflects
    all experience factors affecting the cost trajectory (Rubin et al., 2015). It
    is the most often adopted learning function in energy systems including bioenergy,
    biofuels (van den Wall Bake et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2017; Nogueira et al.,
    2016). One factor experience curves were further expanded to multi-factor models,
    component-based learning curves (see Supplementary Information SI-7) to account
    for other endogenous technology factors (learning-by-researching, knowledge shock
    etc.) and exogenous changes (Yeh and Rubin, 2012; Rubin et al., 2007; McNerney
    et al., 2011; Ferioli et al., 2009). In particular the component-based learning
    hypothesis has been further expanded to model design complexity (interconnectivity
    of sub-components) (McNerney et al., 2011) and entire supply chains with decomposed
    technology learning (Bergesen and Suh, 2016), where four types of learning effects
    were differentiated i.e. endogenous labour-associated learning, endogenous input
    learning, exogenous supply chain learning (labour and input). Such expansion and
    decomposition enable system optimisation models to capture the learning implications
    for economic and environmental objectives (Bergesen and Suh, 2016; Gavankar et
    al., 2015). Although the exogenous learning curve-derived parameters were introduced
    in previous studies e.g. bottom-up model MARKAL and TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL–EFOM
    System) (Zhang et al., 2016; Chen, 2005), the deterministic optimisation approach
    is not capable of capturing the uncertainty associated with technology evolution.
    Stochastic and dynamic programing are promising methods to incorporate technology
    learning curves into optimisation frameworks (Chen et al., 2017; Chen and Fan,
    2014; Wand and Leuthold, 2011; Cristóbal et al., 2013). In both methods, two types
    of variables can be distinguished–decision variables controlled by decision-makers
    and state variables used to describe the mathematical state of a dynamic system
    at stage n, which is indirectly determined by decision variables at the previous
    stage n-1 and influence the decision variables at a later stage n+1 (Chen et al.,
    2017). Chen and Fan (2014) used exogenous approach (i.e. externally determined
    boundary conditions) and adopted stochastic optimisation with discrete scenarios
    to model the cost reduction in response to evolving biofuel technologies. An exogenous
    approach has been also applied in the stochastic MILP study on carbon capture
    technologies where the future cost parameters were determined by Wright''s curve
    (Cristóbal et al., 2013). A similar method was used in renewable energy production
    network design by Cong (2013). Chen et al. (2017) later explored endogenous methods
    applying multi-stage dynamic optimisation to build a learning-by-doing function
    in the model and investigate from a regulator perspective how the cumulative production
    interacts with the inter-temporal strategic planning. They set the cumulative
    production of 2 G biofuel at each stage n as a state variable, which determines
    the unit cost of the given biofuel following Wright''s law, and defined the production
    of other competing fuels as decision variables; the model was lower bounded by
    the total fuel demands. Stochastic and dynamic programming can be further expanded
    to (1) incorporate the multi-factor environmental learning curves e.g. carbon
    intensity abatement and derive the trade-off solutions between conflicting objectives;
    or (2) formulate the value chain learning in the time-dependent system design
    from both centralised and distributed perspectives (e.g. equilibrium system with
    competing nodes). The accuracy and representativeness of the learning coefficients
    underlying the optimisation model is the key for obtaining robust decision-making
    support, which could be estimated using various methods e.g. PSO algorithm (Yu
    et al., 2015); thus how to integrate the learning curve simulation of biorenewable
    technologies with multi-scale decision-making within an dynamic optimisation framework
    worth research efforts. However, this highly dynamic topic remains unexplored.
    3.10. Modelling research frontier beyond state-of-the-art Overall, terrestrial,
    aquatic biomass and waste resources can be converted into value-added biorenewables,
    which are regarded as highly complex systems of flows that are subject to nonlinearity,
    sensitivity and uncertainty. Take terrestrial C3/C4 higher plant species as an
    example. Their carbon sequestration and composition are regulated by physiological
    traits, photosynthesis pathways and environmental variables. Thus the resulting
    chemical compositions vary with species and show spatial-temporal variation, which
    further affect downstream biorenewable manufacturing. Decoupled modelling approaches
    (e.g. first-principles modelling, empirical modelling) have been developed to
    advance fundamental understanding and design new solutions to biorenewable subsystems.
    However, this increases computational complexity and brings challenges to model
    the whole biorenewable system in a unifying framework. State-of-the-art computational
    methods have been reviewed in this study. Coupling these modelling methods leads
    to a multi-scale modelling framework (Fig. 14), which offers a potential approach
    to tackle the biorenewable system complexity. Such multi-scale modelling framework
    represents a highly cross-disciplinary approach, which can link inherently the
    biorenewable subsystems (natural capital resources, agro-ecosystems, refinery
    manufacturing, waste and pollutant fate and treatment, transport and network).
    Specifically, metabolic modelling can advance the understanding of the phototrophic
    microbial cluster in biological carbon sequestration and cycling and catalyse
    aspiration towards photosynthetic microbial refineries. Biogeochemical models
    combined with process simulation enable to simulate agro-ecosystem complexity
    (e.g. biogeochemical cycles and environmental interaction with higher plant species)
    and biorefinery processes and compute resource flows and carbon and nitrogen transport
    and transformation across biorenewable whole systems. Coupling LCSA, ecosystem
    services and PB framework not only provides quantitative approaches to evaluate
    the holistic sustainability of biorenewables, but also offers a systematic tool
    to investigate the implications of biorenewable on wider ecosystems and planetary
    boundaries. Further, the GIS-aided model integration brings multi-spatial scales
    into the framework and links spatially-explicit ecosystems with biorenewable manufacturing;
    whereas the advanced mathematical optimisation research offers a way to design
    complex biorenewable systems with conflicting decision criteria. Overall, our
    literature review suggested a range of emerging modelling gaps in multi-scale
    biorenewable systems modelling, which represent frontier research directions beyond
    the state-of-the-art and can be summarised as follows– • Coupling data advances
    (remote sensing) and modelling (e.g. machine learning, GIS-aided tools and biogeochemical
    simulation) to understand availability of terrestrial, aquatic biomass and waste
    resources and project their chemical composition in response to environmental
    variables, socio-economic and demographical changes. • Simulation and design of
    integrative CO2 biorefinery based on empirical research advances on designed versatile
    microbial consortia and technologies to convert higher plant species to value-added
    biorenewables. • Methods to optimise biorenewable recovery from waste resources
    to transform CO2 from a pollutant to a resource and converge zero-carbon technologies
    and resource-circular biorefining towards a zero-waste, zero-pollution biorenewable
    system. • Approaches to tackle the varied non-linearity and sensitivities of numerical
    models and combine different computational methods and models into an integrative
    framework. • Mathematical modelling approaches to bridge ecosystem and biorenewable
    manufacturing design spaces and capture dynamic feedbacks and interdependencies
    (e.g. interdependence of biorenewable and natural capital) to enable computationally
    trackable optimisation from whole systems perspective. • Mathematical optimisation
    development to optimise flows and decision spaces across spatial and temporal
    scales e.g. bridge agricultural operation scheduling and value chain planning.
    • Optimisation framework development to design biorenewable flows and interaction
    with natural capital and built capital assets to achieve ecosystem services trade-offs.
    • User-interactive optimisation model with module-oriented architectures and preference-learning
    interface to enable decision-makers to articulate the preferences of multiple
    decision criteria, define the feasible spaces and feedback objectives and decision
    spaces. • Mathematical theories and techniques for improving the model performances
    (e.g. precision and responsive decision) in response to big data advances e.g.
    trade-offs between solution quality and model complexity reduction. • Advanced
    cross-platform life cycle optimisation software underpinned by collaborative data
    value chains and server platform to support real-time database update and responsive
    decision-making. • Stochastic optimisation with risk mitigation and resilience-building
    measures to optimise multi-scale, multi-echelon biorenewable supply chain under
    uncertainty. 4. Final remark Increasing environmental stress coupled with expanding
    population bring challenges to sustainable development of ecosystems and wellbeing.
    The transformation to a resource-circular bio-economy offers a mechanism to tackle
    environmental changes and degradation. As advanced bioeconomy components, biorenewables
    are expected to play significant roles over the next decades. This comprehensive
    review reflects the empirical advances in upstream and downstream processes and
    highlights the system perspectives of biorenewable, which are subject to nonlinearity,
    complexity and variability. From a whole systems perspective, biorenewables feature
    biogenic carbon flows and resource circularity. Upstream phototrophs and the related
    terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems represent carbon sinks for atmospheric CO2
    capture and fixation; whereas at downstream stages, emerging technologies to enable
    carbon utilisation and waste-sourced biorenewables have potentials to catalyse
    a low-carbon and resource circular bioeconomy. The biorenewable system complexity
    spans from resource-environment interaction underpinned by photosynthesis and
    biogeochemical cycles to the interlinked subsystems across upstream ecosystems
    and downstream manufacturing. Upstream resources e.g. terrestrial and aquatic
    plant species are regulated by environmental drivers whereas their availabilities
    are constrained by capacities and boundaries of natural and built capital assets;
    thereby, the downstream technology solutions may vary at different spatial and
    temporal scales due to the variability in resource quality and quantity. Unlocking
    complex resource-biorenewable-waste systems is mandatory to catalyse a sustainable
    circular bio-economy transition. By reviewing the state-of-the-art computational
    methods, this study presents a whole systems approach where spatial data analyses,
    advanced statistical methods, first principle models, quantitative evaluation
    of sustainability and mathematical optimisation are coupled and integrated into
    a multi-scale modelling framework. This framework inherently links the processes
    and subsystems across ecosystems and biorenewable manufacturing. Reflecting the
    fundamental computational methods and modelling advances, our study provides insights
    into the emerging opportunities and highlights the identified frontier research
    directions to unlock the complexity of biorenewable systems. Declaration of Competing

    to other packages in this field, this package puts a much heavier focus on providing
    reusable components that can be used in the design of new implementation of new

  description: 'Nutrient (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) loss from point and non-point
    sources can cause critical environmental problems, deteriorating the quality of
    surface water and groundwater. Therefore, the protection of surface water and
    groundwater is imperative for maintaining a healthy environment. Although many
    review studies have investigated nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater,
    most of them concentrated on examining nutrient transport in one or two water
    systems, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater without considering and including
    the research gaps in other systems. To date, there are no systematic studies that
    have determined the main insights and research gaps in the field of nutrient transport
    in surface and subsurface water using a text mining algorithm and topic identification
    through a quantitative and qualitative analysis. Therefore, meta-research (research
    on research) was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm
    (a text mining algorithm) to identify the most frequent topics in the literature
    that covered the nutrient transport processes in surface water and groundwater
    using a quantitative analysis. Based on the results of the quantitative analysis,
    ten key topics were identified: nitrogen transport in groundwater; nitrogen transport
    in surface water; phosphorus transport in surface water; sediment transport in
    watersheds; nutrient loss in subsurface drainage; nutrient transport associated
    with lakes; nutrient transport in forest-dominated watersheds; modeling of nutrient
    transport; agricultural watershed management; and effect of soil-litter on nutrient
    transport. Furthermore, these topics were explained in a qualitative analysis
    to highlight the most important insights from literature and to identify the main
    knowledge gaps for further investigation in future studies. According to the most
    frequent topics in the literature, five research gaps were evident: developing
    integrated models for nutrient transport processes in the surface water-groundwater
    interactions; evaluating the effect of climate change and crop management practices
    on nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater; application of machine
    learning algorithms in nutrient transport; and describing the in-stream sediment
    and nutrient transport in fluvial environments such as rivers and creeks. The
    results of the current meta-research study are a steppingstone towards better
    identification of the common themes and trends in the previous publications in
    literature pertaining to nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater by
    applying an informative text mining algorithm where key knowledge gaps were determined
    based on the recommendations of these publications.'

    Abstract Nutrient (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) loss from point and non-point
    sources can cause critical environmental problems, deteriorating the quality of
    surface water and groundwater. Therefore, the protection of surface water and
    groundwater is imperative for maintaining a healthy environment. Although many
    review studies have investigated nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater,
    most of them concentrated on examining nutrient transport in one or two water
    systems, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater without considering and including
    the research gaps in other systems. To date, there are no systematic studies that
    have determined the main insights and research gaps in the field of nutrient transport
    in surface and subsurface water using a text mining algorithm and topic identification
    through a quantitative and qualitative analysis. Therefore, meta-research (research
    on research) was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm
    (a text mining algorithm) to identify the most frequent topics in the literature
    that covered the nutrient transport processes in surface water and groundwater
    using a quantitative analysis. Based on the results of the quantitative analysis,
    ten key topics were identified: nitrogen transport in groundwater; nitrogen transport
    in surface water; phosphorus transport in surface water; sediment transport in
    watersheds; nutrient loss in subsurface drainage; nutrient transport associated
    with lakes; nutrient transport in forest-dominated watersheds; modeling of nutrient
    transport; agricultural watershed management; and effect of soil-litter on nutrient
    transport. Furthermore, these topics were explained in a qualitative analysis
    to highlight the most important insights from literature and to identify the main
    knowledge gaps for further investigation in future studies. According to the most
    frequent topics in the literature, five research gaps were evident: developing
    integrated models for nutrient transport processes in the surface water-groundwater
    interactions; evaluating the effect of climate change and crop management practices
    on nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater; application of machine
    learning algorithms in nutrient transport; and describing the in-stream sediment
    and nutrient transport in fluvial environments such as rivers and creeks. The
    results of the current meta-research study are a steppingstone towards better
    identification of the common themes and trends in the previous publications in
    literature pertaining to nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater by
    applying an informative text mining algorithm where key knowledge gaps were determined
    based on the recommendations of these publications. Graphical abstract Download

    loss of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) has a negative influence on
    the environment and public health. High concentrations of nutrients can cause
    eutrophication and algal bloom formation in lakes and rivers, leading to serious
    threats to aquatic life and ecosystem health (Elsayed et al., 2021, Elsayed et
    al., 2022a, Kerr et al., 2016). Groundwater, an important source for irrigation
    and drinking water, is significantly affected by anthropogenic activities and
    nutrient leaching. In North America, 60% of rivers and 50% of lakes are suffering
    from elevated concentrations of nutrients due to rapidly growing industrial expansion
    and coastal development (Edlund et al., 2009). In Canada, for example, high nutrient
    loading rates have been deteriorating surface water and groundwater quality in
    the Great Lakes Basin since the early 1970s (Kerr et al., 2016, Rixon et al.,
    2020). In addition, several locations in Prince Edward Island (Canada) are threatened
    by high levels of nutrient loss due to the development of agricultural lands (Benjannet
    et al., 2018, Coffin et al., 2018, Schmidt et al., 2012). In the United States,
    68% of estuaries along the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and
    Gulf of Mexico have shown critical signs of high coastal eutrophication rates
    (Bricker et al., 2008) while 90% of rivers have exceeded the average typical limits
    of total nitrogen and phosphorus in fresh water (Dodds et al., 2009). Harmful
    algal blooms are also increased in the estuaries of California because of excessive
    loss of nitrogen by human activities (Anderson et al., 2016, Hughes et al., 2011,
    Kessouri et al., 2021, Kudela et al., 2008). In the Mississippi River catchment
    where phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations are relatively high, industrial and
    sewage activities contribute 40% and 20% of the total loss of phosphorus and nitrogen,
    respectively (Bargu et al., 2019, Pinckney et al., 2001). Therefore, quantification
    of nutrient transport in groundwater and surface water is essential to overcome
    environmental and public health concerns and for enhancing the understanding and
    development of effective mitigation approaches. Agricultural activities are one
    of the most crucial non-point sources of pollution and nutrient loss in surface
    water and groundwater. Although synthetic fertilizers, including nitrogen and
    phosphorus, are required for efficient plant growth and crop productivity in agricultural
    watersheds, they can degrade the quality of groundwater and surface water if not
    managed. For example, Lake Erie has experienced elevated phosphorus concentrations
    from agricultural lands and fields, resulting in high levels of contamination
    and eutrophication in the lake (Elsayed et al., 2022b, Watson et al., 2016). Moreover,
    groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin is considered an active receptor of nutrients
    and contaminants (Barton et al., 2013, Costa et al., 2021). Therefore, nutrient
    loss in agricultural watersheds has gained much attention in recent decades. In
    the literature, nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater has been discussed
    in a number of review studies. Some previous studies reviewed nutrient transport
    in water systems such as lakes (Bhagowati and Ahamad, 2019, Zamparas and Zacharias,
    2014), stream water (Badruzzaman et al., 2012, Drewry et al., 2006, Pärn et al.,
    2012), and groundwater (Rivett et al., 2008, Robinson, 2015). In addition, some
    review studies investigated nutrient transport in hydrological processes associated
    with different land uses such as forest-dominated watersheds (Johnson and Turner,
    2019, Kreutzweiser et al., 2008) and agricultural landscapes (Grenon et al., 2021,
    King et al., 2015, Prosser et al., 2020, Qi and Qi, 2017). Further studies reviewed
    the most common mathematical modeling approaches for simulating the nutrient transport
    processes in surface and subsurface water (Alam and Dutta, 2021, Neumann et al.,
    2021). However, these studies were diverse and wide in scope because of the variety
    of the case studies and the surrounding metrological and hydrogeological properties
    that are associated with each watershed. Also, watershed size, topography, land
    cover and crop pattern can differ from one site to another, making the determination
    of optimal nutrient management practices for each site unique (Plach et al., 2022,
    Sharpley et al., 2015, Williams et al., 2022). Therefore, meta-research (research
    on research) is an effective approach to extract meaningful information and highlight
    the important insights from the previous publications using topic modelling. Meta-research
    can be applied using text mining algorithms since these algorithms can track previous
    research directions, trends, and themes, discovering the potential research gaps
    for future research. In addition, topic modeling using text mining algorithms
    can group text by content and similarities to prescribe the topics (Asmussen and
    Møller, 2020). Topic modeling using text mining is also considered a replicable
    process since it allows further analysis to be performed with additional articles
    to identify possible emerging topics (Ragany et al., 2023). Thus, text mining
    algorithms are realistic and practical approaches for reviewing literature with
    the support of knowledge, experience, and interpretation of researchers. Meta-research
    has been applied in various fields of study to determine research trends and identify
    opportunities and knowledge gaps in unexplored research areas. For example, systematic
    literature review using meta-research was conducted in the field of transportation
    engineering (Das et al., 2016, Sun and Yin, 2017), structural engineering (Ezzeldin
    and El-Dakhakhni, 2020), operational research (Gatti et al., 2015), process safety
    and risk analysis (Amin et al., 2019), infrastructure systems (Haggag et al.,
    2022), water security management (Dennis and Grady, 2022), biological water treatment
    (Jin et al., 2023), heavy metal pollution in urban soils (Yuan et al., 2021) and
    storm-water management (Islam et al., 2021). However, to the best knowledge of
    the authors, no published systematic review study has investigated nutrient transport
    in surface water and groundwater using topic modelling based on the meta-research
    approach. In addition, there is a lack of consideration for different aspects
    of nutrient transport in various water systems (e.g., lakes, streams, and groundwater)
    and the governing factors responsible for the transport process in a single systematic
    review study using text analysis. Also, no previous studies focused on identifying
    the main research gaps in the field of nutrient transport in surface and subsurface
    waters based on a realistic and systematic approach using word importance and
    topic modelling. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to present a
    systematic review (meta-research) of literature related to nutrient transport
    in surface water and groundwater to better understand the major themes and research
    gaps in previous research. The objective of the study can be implemented by: (1)
    applying a text mining algorithm on previous publications to determine the latent
    topics in the literature within the area of nutrient transport in surface water
    and groundwater using quantitative analysis (i.e., topic modelling); (2) performing
    a qualitative analysis on the identified topics to highlight the meaningful findings
    and definitions regarding nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater;
    and (3) identifying the crucial research gaps in the previous publications of
    nutrient dynamics in surface and subsurface water and recommending topics for
    further investigations in future research. 2. Methods Two steps of analyses were
    performed to formulate a systematic literature review of nutrient transport in
    surface and subsurface waters. The first step was to implement a quantitative
    analysis using the relevant publications (i.e., articles) about nutrient dynamics
    in surface water and groundwater to determine the most frequently examined topics
    in the previous publications. The quantitative analysis included the collection
    and processing of the dataset (i.e., abstracts), application of a text mining
    algorithm (i.e., text analysis), determination of word frequency (i.e., word importance)
    and identifying the examined topics in the literature (Fig. 1). In the second
    step, these examined topics were investigated and reviewed in a qualitative analysis
    (i.e., typical literature review) to highlight the meaningful information and
    strengths in the literature based on the results of the quantitative analysis.
    In addition, the main research gaps in the literature were determined based on
    the recommendations, discussions, and insights of the articles (i.e., publications)
    that were used in the text mining application. In the current study, the procedure
    of the systematic literature review is consistent with the approach that was adopted
    in previous meta-research studies in process safety and risk analysis (Amin et
    al., 2019) and infrastructure systems (Haggag et al., 2022). To the best knowledge
    of the authors, no published studies have applied the meta-research approach in
    determining the major themes and research gaps in the field of nutrient transport
    in hydrological systems. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download :

    analysis (The approach/sequence was adopted from Amin et al., 2019, Haggag et
    al., 2022). 2.1. Data collection and processing In this study, more than 800 publications
    were identified and explored from searching through Engineering Village and Web
    of Science platforms for the period of 1974–2022. The start date of the analysis
    was selected to be 1974 based on the first available publications about nutrient
    transport in surface and subsurface water on the Engineering Village searching
    platform. It should be noted that using other search platforms will not significantly
    affect the results since Engineering Village and Web of Science are the largest
    platforms for worldwide-used reference and publication databases. The search criterion
    was guided by the title of each publication to include the keywords of (“nutrient(s)”
    or “nitrogen” or “phosphorus”), (“dynamic(s)” or “transport” or “loss” or “export”)
    and (“surface water” or “groundwater” or “subsurface water” or “watershed” or
    “catchment”) to be consistent with the primary objective of the current study.
    Journal publications were only considered in this study while conference publications,
    textbooks and symposium articles were not included in the search criteria. This
    is mainly because textbooks do not contain abstracts while many conference publications
    are not available and not peer-reviewed articles, creating difficulties in applying
    text mining on the abstracts. Then, the relevancy of the considered publications
    to the current field (i.e., nutrient transport in surface and subsurface water)
    was checked and articles irrelevant to the scope of this study were eliminated
    (i.e., title-based screening). For example, although the title of some articles
    contained the exact combination of the search keywords, they were related to other
    fields such as thermodynamics and manufacturing engineering. Thus, the total number
    of publications was reduced to approximately 600 publications. These publications
    were further filtered by eliminating the publications without abstracts especially
    for relatively old publications because text mining algorithm deals with the abstract
    as the dataset in the current study. Then, the remaining publications were screened
    to check and assess the relevancy of the abstract of each publication to the theme
    of this study (i.e., abstract-based screening). After title and abstract screening,
    516 publications remained to initiate the quantitative analysis wherein the abstract
    of these publications is the main dataset for this study. It should be mentioned
    that text mining algorithms are generally applied on the abstracts of the selected
    articles (i.e., not on the entire article) due to high computational requirements
    for simulating the entire text in publications. In addition, abstracts of articles
    contain the most important information, keywords, and messages related to the
    study, providing a practical impression about the relevancy of articles to the
    field of study. Moreover, the procedure of the selection of the articles was adopted
    from previous meta-research studies (Das et al., 2016, Ezzeldin and El-Dakhakhni,
    2020, Haggag et al., 2022, Islam et al., 2021). 2.2. Word importance and frequency
    The word importance in the abstract dataset was estimated and assessed through
    the frequency of the word appearance in the dataset. A word cloud was developed
    to gather all the words that appeared in the abstract dataset where words with
    large font indicated higher probability of appearance in the dataset. The minimum
    frequency of words was selected to be 60 which means that a word should be detected
    at least 60 times in the abstracts to appear in the word cloud. The word cloud
    for the raw abstract dataset included various non-technical and common words such
    as “the”, “and”, “from” and “was” (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the quality of the word
    cloud needed to be enhanced to reflect the scope of this study by processing the
    raw abstract dataset and thus removing the non-technical and common words. The
    raw abstract dataset was processed through four steps including transformation,
    tokenization, treatment, and stemming approaches (Miner, 2012). The transformation
    step changed the format of all words to lower case style. Unstructured text was
    changed into words in the tokenization step. The common words and affixes were
    removed in the treatment and stemming steps, respectively. The processing of raw
    abstract dataset was implemented using some packages in the R software such as
    tm_map function (R Studio Team, 2019, R Core Team, 2020). After the processing
    of the raw abstract dataset, the technical expressions with high frequency (e.g.,
    “soil”, “water”, “runoff” and “nutrient”), which are related to the main scope
    of this study, appeared in the word cloud (Fig. 2b), highlighting the importance
    of data processing for obtaining meaningful information from the word cloud. It
    must be noted that the procedure of text cleaning and screening was adopted from
    previous meta-research studies (Ezzeldin and El-Dakhakhni, 2020, Haggag et al.,
    2022, Islam et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (314KB) Download

    probability of appearance) words in the abstract dataset: (a) before processing
    and (b) after processing. 2.3. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm The
    Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is a text mining technique (i.e.,
    type of machine learning algorithm) that was implemented to identify the main
    topics and extract the important information from the abstract dataset. LDA algorithm
    is a completely generative and probabilistic technique that is used for text mining
    (Blei et al., 2003). It is considered as an efficient text mining algorithm compared
    to other algorithms (e.g., Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing) because it
    can deal with big data and large-scale corpus (Liu et al., 2011, Lu et al., 2011).
    LDA can also reduce the number of words in a document (d) (i.e., article) while
    considering the interdependence between these words and their associated key topics
    in the documents (Blei et al., 2003). In addition, LDA is a hierarchical algorithm
    that includes the hyper-parameter concept where the parameters act as random variables,
    creating higher stability of the algorithm with less probability of overfitting
    (Liu et al., 2011). The main hyperparameters in the LDA model are related to the
    number of topics ( ) where each topic ( ) has a word distribution ( ) that can
    be assessed using a Dirichlet distribution (β). According to these topics, each
    document ( ) is examined by addressing a topic distribution ( ) that is determined
    from another Dirichlet distribution (α) to allocate a topic for each word ( )
    in each document based on a multinomial distribution ( ). The hyperparameters
    (α and β) can be used to control the mean shape and sparsity of word and document
    topic distributions. In the LDA model, multiple inference techniques can be used
    to evaluate the word and document topic distributions and further select the optimal
    number of topics. For example, the perplexity and Griffiths’ index, that were
    derived from the Gibbs sampling technique, are the most common evaluation methods.
    Further details about the characteristics of the LDA model can be found in Minka
    (2000) and Correa (2001). Publications relevant to nutrient dynamics in surface
    water and groundwater were gathered and read by the LDA algorithm. The implementation
    of the LDA algorithm was completed in R software (R Studio Team, 2019, R Core
    Team, 2020). Then, these publications were randomly divided into training and
    testing sets where the training set represented 80% of the total number of publications
    while the rest was assigned for the testing set (Ezzeldin and El-Dakhakhni, 2020,
    Haggag et al., 2022). For the hyperparameters (α and β) that were used in the
    model, it was assumed that α = 5/number of topics and β = 0.01 to follow sparse
    topic distributions (Griffiths et al., 2004, Ezzeldin and El-Dakhakhni, 2020).
    The selection of the number of topics (K) is considered as one of the central
    challenges in topic modelling. In the current study, two metrics were adopted
    to evaluate the optimal number of topics (Haggag et al., 2022). The first evaluation
    metric was the perplexity that is a statistical measurement to assess the goodness
    of the probability distribution or the sample prediction by the algorithm and
    the calculation of the uncertainty associated with each simulation of K (Labs,
    2018). Low perplexity values reflect sufficient goodness of the probability distribution
    and higher ability of the algorithm in predicting the sample. The second evaluation
    metric was the Griffiths’ index that is determined based on Gibbs sampling model
    (i.e., Markov chain approach) (Griffiths et al., 2004). The optimal number of
    topics corresponds to the highest Griffiths’ index. Therefore, a range for K values
    was selected to be from two to 30 topics to visualize the variation of the two
    implemented evaluation metrics with the number of topics. After determining the
    optimal number of topics, the LDA algorithm was implemented to calculate the Beta
    and Gamma values based on the available number of topics. The Beta value represents
    a measure of per topic per word (i.e., probability of appearance for a word in
    a topic) where the Beta value for each word in each topic can be used to create
    the word cloud for this topic, highlighting the more frequent words within this
    topic. The Gamma value is a measure of per article per topic (i.e., probability
    of appearance for a topic in a publication), showing the most frequent topics
    and the main knowledge gaps in the literature. Using an iterative approach within
    the LDA algorithm, the Beta value is updated based on the percentage of allocations
    to a topic for across the articles for a certain word while the Gamma value is
    updated within each iteration based on the percentage of words in an article that
    are allocated in a specific topic. 3. Results 3.1. Number of topics selection
    The sensitivity of the two used evaluation metrics to K was plotted to determine
    the optimal number of topics (Fig. 3). For the perplexity metric, the optimal
    number of topics corresponds to the minimum value of the perplexity (Labs, 2018).
    However, the minimum perplexity value in this study was corresponding to 30 topics
    as the optimal number of topics. This number of optimal topics is relatively large
    compared to the total number of considered articles (Fig. 3a). The perplexity
    value also decreased with a high and constant rate with the increase of K. At
    K = 12, there was a sudden change in the decrease rate of the perplexity value
    with the number of topics. Therefore, 12 topics can be considered as the threshold
    for the optimal number of topics. Using Griffiths’ index, a K-value of ten topics
    yielded the maximum value of Griffiths’ index after a rapid increase in the relation
    of Griffiths’ index with K (Fig. 3b). For K > 7, the rate of increase of Griffiths’
    index was slow compared to that from K = 2 to K = 7, indicating that the optimal
    K-value should be larger than 7. Also, there was no significant change in the
    Griffiths’ index for K > 10. Based on the variation of the perplexity value and
    Griffiths’ index with number of topics, the optimal range for K was determined
    to be 7–12 topics. Therefore, ten topics were selected to be the optimal number
    to conduct the quantitative analysis and topic identification. In the current
    study, the number of topics (K) is consistent with those determined in previous
    meta-research studies where the number of topics was 9 (Haggag et al., 2022),
    8 (Das et al., 2016) and 6 topics (Dennis and Grady, 2022). In addition, the trends
    of the relationship between the evaluation metrics (i.e., perplexity and Griffiths’
    index) and the number of topics for the training purposes (Fig. S1) are similar
    to those observed in Fig. 3, confirming that the selection of number of topics
    (K = 10 topics) is feasible for training and testing datasets using these two
    used evaluation metrics. Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download :

    analysis and identification The Beta value (i.e., per topic per word probability)
    was determined for the ten most frequent words in each of the ten topics (Fig.
    4). In some topics, Beta values were much greater than those of other topics,
    indicating high probability of appearance for these words compared to those in
    other topics. For example, the highest Beta value in Topic 3 was 0.146 for the
    word “soil” while the word with the highest probability in Topic 8 was “dynamic”
    with a Beta value of 0.019. This comparison highlights that the Beta value of
    each word in each topic is highly dependent on the frequency and nature of the
    topic itself. Download : Download high-res image (521KB) Download : Download full-size

    For the ten identified topics, the word cloud for each topic was generated where
    the words with high Beta values were shown in larger font size (Fig. 5). For Topic
    1, the most frequent words were “water”, “lake”, “nutrient” and “rate”, indicating
    that the topic is highly related to nutrient transport associated with lakes.
    The words “groundwater”, “nitrate”, “nitrogen” and “transport” were the main scientific
    terms in Topic 2 that is linked to nitrogen transport in groundwater. Topic 3
    investigated the effect of soil-litter on nutrient transport where the word “soil”
    was shown in large font. Topic 4 was named by phosphorus transport in surface
    runoff/surface water where the words “runoff”, “surface”, “phosphorus” and “loss”
    were highlighted in the word cloud. Moreover, the words “nitrogen”, “loss”, “surface”
    and “increase” appeared in Topic 5 that was expressed into nitrogen transport
    in surface water. Nutrient loss in subsurface drainage and tile drains was investigated
    in Topic 6 where the words “subsurface”, “loss”, “drainage” and “drain” were the
    most common words. In Topic 7, the words “watershed”, “sediment”, and “concentration”
    had the highest probability of appearance in the word cloud, indicating that this
    topic was related to sediment transport in watersheds. The word cloud of topic
    8 included the words “model”, “simulation” and “transport”, resulting in the topic
    of modelling of nutrient transport. Topic 9 contained the words “dynamic”, “forest”,
    “nitrogen” and “spatial” in the word cloud, indicating that this topic addressed
    the area of nutrient transport in forest-dominated watersheds. Finally, Topic
    10 regarded nutrient management in agricultural watersheds where “nutrient”, “agricultural”,
    “management” and “phosphorus” were the most frequent words with large font in
    the word cloud. Based on the Beta value and word cloud identifications, the ten
    examined topics were summarized in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image

    the field of nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater. It should be
    noted that the word “agricultural/agriculture” was not used as one of the keywords
    during gathering related publications from the searching platforms (e.g., Web
    of Science) to cover the whole potential sources of nutrient transport in water
    courses without being biased to agricultural watersheds. Since the current study
    investigates the nutrient transport process in surface water and groundwater,
    it is anticipated that a lot of previous publications related to agricultural
    watersheds and fields appear in the topics identified by text mining (e.g., Topic
    6 and 10). However, additional publications that examined nutrient transport in
    forest dominated watersheds appeared in the word clouds (i.e., Topic 9) because
    forests are considered as a major source of nutrient release to surface water.
    In addition, nutrient transport from soil litter (i.e., Topic 3) appeared in a
    word cloud and was considered as one of the identified topics because soil litter
    includes the leaf litterfall from forests, crop litterfall from agricultural fields,
    and manure-based litter (i.e., animal and poultry litter) from agricultural lands.
    Therefore, the literature pertaining to nutrient transport in surface water and
    groundwater from agricultural and forested landscapes are included and discussed
    in the following sections. 4. Discussion In this section, the qualitative analysis
    was performed where the ten identified topics are briefly reviewed and discussed.
    The relevant publications, which were used in the quantitative analysis, were
    reviewed to extract meaningful information and trends in the literature. For example,
    the main definitions for the nutrient transport process, the governing factors
    on the process and the most common mathematical models for nutrient and sediment
    transport processes are discussed in depth. Moreover, the main insights, knowledge
    gaps and useful recommendations for future work for nutrient transport in surface
    water and groundwater are explained subsequent to the qualitative analysis of
    the ten identified topics from the literature. Since the main objective of the
    current study is to apply text mining on the previous publications related to
    nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater to extract the important research
    trends and themes from literature, a brief review without in-depth details was
    conducted and introduced about the ten topics identified by text mining in the
    following subsections. The brief review aims to uncover the main knowledge gaps
    based on the recommendations of the previous publications in literature. For deep
    synthesis about the ten identified topics, a lot of typical review studies about
    nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater were published to deeply dive
    into each of these topics. For example, numerous previous review studies investigated
    nutrient transport in surface water (Badruzzaman et al., 2012, Bhagowati and Ahamad,
    2019, Zamparas and Zacharias, 2014) and groundwater (Rivett et al., 2008, Robinson,
    2015). Also, various studies investigated the role of tile drains (Grenon et al.,
    2021, King et al., 2015, Qi and Qi, 2017) and the best management practices (Arnillas
    et al., 2021, Cherry et al., 2008, Lintern et al., 2020, Prosser et al., 2020)
    on the nutrient transport processes in surface water and groundwater in agricultural
    landscapes. Other review studies examined multiple mathematical models for simulating
    nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater (Alam and Dutta, 2021, Neumann
    et al., 2021). The results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis were obtained
    based on the adopted keywords and searching platforms (e.g., Web of Science) during
    collection of articles. Therefore, the ten topics were identified based on the
    available articles on the Web of Science and Engineering Village platforms using
    the previously mentioned keywords in the methods section. These topics may slightly
    vary under different search conditions including the keywords, platforms, and
    dates. Although some of the adopted articles are discussed in the following sections,
    some of them are not covered in this study to avoid off-date and repetitive articles.
    In addition, some articles were considered using manual searching (i.e., not included
    in the quantitative analysis) to support the main insights and show comparisons
    in the literature. These articles did not contain the combination of keywords
    that were used in the searching platforms, reflecting the major limitation of
    using text mining techniques in literature review studies. 4.1. Nutrient transport
    associated with lakes Although Topic 1 was defined by the main words of “water”,
    “lake”, and “nutrient”, it was difficult to specify the scope of the main articles
    that are related to this topic. Some papers (i.e., articles) were related to “within-lake
    nutrient dynamics” while others were highly related to “nutrient transport to
    lakes” and “nutrient transport to coastal/sea waters”. To differentiate between
    the scope of the examined articles in Topic 1 (i.e., 29 out of 516 publications),
    they were investigated and categorized into three categories. These categories
    included “within-lake nutrient dynamics”, “nutrient transport to lakes” and “nutrient
    transport to coastal/sea waters” where they represented approximately 28, 38 and
    34% of the examined articles, respectively. In the following paragraphs, the three
    categories are briefly discussed since the main scope of our study is to uncover
    the key knowledge gaps in nutrient transport associated with lakes based on the
    recommendation of previous studies in literature. Nutrient transport within a
    lake is influenced by different factors such as water circulation (Burnett et
    al., 2017), microbial activity (Kang et al., 2016), and groundwater-surface water
    interactions (Essaid et al., 2021). For example, the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia
    is a unique water body as its flow direction can be reversed during the wet and
    dry seasons. During the dry season, the low water level allows for resuspension
    of P in sediment due to both wind-related turbulence and increased groundwater
    upwelling because of the dramatic drop in stage (Burnett et al., 2017). Groundwater
    and surface water runoff are known as important pathways of nutrient transport
    to surface water bodies, creating ideal conditions for formation of algal blooms;
    however, the dynamics of nutrient movement within the water body also needs to
    be considered. In a previous nutrient transport study, it was found that the release
    of the lakebed sediment phosphorus plays an important role in the hyper-eutrophication
    of a lake in Oregon, USA (Essaid et al., 2021). Groundwater discharge, surface
    runoff, and soil erosion are the driving force behind the nutrient transport process
    to lakes which are, in turn, heavily impacted by regional geology, geography,
    meteorology, and land use. For example, some lakes receive high amount of its
    phosphorous input from groundwater discharge through sandy aquifers (Kazmierczak
    et al., 2020, Kazmierczak et al., 2021) and shallow water (Evans et al., 2000).
    In addition, the land use significantly affects the nutrient loss and loading
    rate from watersheds to lakes in agricultural regions (Fraterrigo and Downing,
    2008). In addition, the phosphorus transport (mainly soluble and particulate phosphorus)
    was found to be correlated to the surface runoff and sediment transport from the
    main tributaries in the watershed (Sadeghi et al., 2017). The transport and redistribution
    of phosphorus in some lakes from large and complex river networks were identified
    through formulating relationships between the sediment phosphorus spatial distribution
    and the sorption behavior of phosphorus on the particles with various grain size
    (Yi et al., 2017). Transport of nutrients from coastal watersheds represents a
    serious problem for the health of estuaries, often the locations of important
    fisheries. Groundwater carrying nitrogen from sewage and discharging to the coast
    of the Saipan, Mariana Islands was found to account for 60% of the total lagoon
    being studied, emphasizing the importance of groundwater as a focus of remediation
    and prevention efforts (Knapp et al., 2020). Worldwide, excess nutrient transport
    to coastal waters is a concern for these critical habitats, driving a lot of research
    due to the variety and complexity of the issue (Ikeda et al., 2009, Ozer et al.,
    2017, Pitchaikani and Lipton, 2016, Zheng et al., 2019). In India, the effect
    of nutrient dynamics from Tamirabarani River to the Gulf of Mannar on the fishing
    zones was investigated where it was found that the concentration of nutrients
    can affect the phytoplankton diversity, leading to serious changes in the performance
    of marine ecosystem (Pitchaikani and Lipton, 2016). Although some previous studies
    covered the scope of nutrient transport associated with lakes, there are some
    key knowledge gaps that were not well investigated in literature. For example,
    there is a lack in integrated models that can simulate the overall nutrient transport
    processes starting from surface runoff and groundwater in watersheds to the lakes.
    In addition, machine learning algorithms can be used to classify and predict the
    nutrient concentrations at certain points within the lake based on some observations
    in the watershed and groundwater. Beside the modeling perspective, assessing the
    effect of climate change and crop management practices on the health of lakes
    is not well articulated in the literature, creating a crucial research gap in
    nutrient transport associated with lakes. 4.2. Nitrogen transport in groundwater
    Through keywords such as “groundwater”, “nitrate”, “transport” and “stream”, and
    “aquifer”, Topic 2 was defined as nitrogen transport in groundwater, which includes
    transport of nitrogen via groundwater to surface water and groundwater resources.
    Nitrate (NO3–) is the dominant form of nitrogen in groundwater where it can be
    readily transported through subsurface pathways and delivered to surface water
    or deeper groundwater stores due to its mobile and soluble characteristics (Kennedy
    et al., 2009, Pärn et al., 2012, Ranalli and Macalady, 2010, Robinson, 2015).
    Thus, the following review section will focus on nitrate transport. 4.2.1. Subsurface
    transport of nitrate to surface water Nitrate can be transported to surface water
    through the subsurface flow pathways including interflow (i.e., lateral movement
    of water in the shallow subsurface and above water table elevations) and deeper
    groundwater flow (Tesoriero et al., 2013, Woessner, 2000). Subsurface water enters
    stream water through the transition zone (Conant et al. 2019). The transition
    zone (including the hyporheic zone) encompasses the three-dimensional interface
    between groundwater and surface water, where stream morphology and subsurface
    material can dictate biogeochemical processes and flow dynamics, moderating nitrate
    transport between groundwater and surface water, and vice versa (Briody et al.,
    2016, Brookfield et al., 2021, Conant et al., 2019). Different nitrogen processes
    can occur within the transition zone, which can vary spatially and temporally
    including denitrification (i.e., removal of nitrate) and nitrification (i.e.,
    conversion of soil ammonia to nitrate) (Briody et al., 2016, Lansdown et al.,
    2014, May et al., 2023). Denitrification and nitrification can be driven by biogeochemical
    conditions such as streambed depth and dissolved oxygen (Stelzer and Bartsch,
    2012), or bacteria density (Sánchez-Pérez et al., 2003); and flow conditions such
    as morphology (Cardenas, 2009) and regulated flow (Briody et al., 2016). Governing
    factors of denitrification and nitrification within the transition zone are important
    to be understood because these processes can dictate whether nitrate is removed
    or added to hyporheic water where exchange between groundwater and surface water
    can occur (Briody et al., 2016, Pretty et al., 2006, Woessner, 2000). Immediate
    or later release of nitrate to surface water, through groundwater sources, can
    support or prevent water quality issues such as algal blooms (Brookfield et al.,
    2021, Tesoriero et al., 2009, Tesoriero et al., 2013). Artificial subsurface drainage
    (e.g., agricultural tile drains) can move infiltrated water laterally, similar
    to interflow, and can act as a preferential pathway for nitrate-laden subsurface
    water to directly enter surface water, skipping the transition zone barrier (Mackie
    et al., 2021, May et al., 2023, Rixon et al., 2020, Tomer et al., 2003). Further
    discussion on nutrient loss through subsurface drainage can be found in Section
    4.5. 4.2.2. Transport of nitrate to aquifers Leaching (i.e., downward movement)
    of nitrate from non-point (e.g., agricultural fertilizer) and point (e.g., septic
    systems) sources of pollution to groundwater is a serious global concern (Padilla
    et al., 2018). The rate and fate of nitrate leaching depends on biochemical and
    geologic properties of overburden and bedrock material (Rivett et al., 2008).
    Understanding the settings that impact downward movement of nitrate is important
    because contaminated aquifers with elevated concentrations of nitrate are harmful
    for human consumption (Padilla et al., 2018, Townsend et al., 2003). Agricultural
    practices (e.g., continuous corn with no crop rotation), climate conditions (e.g.,
    changes in precipitation), and hydrogeological settings (e.g., soil type) are
    the main drivers of nitrate leaching from source to groundwater (Gardner et al.,
    2020, Hill, 1996, Rudolph et al., 1998). Land cover also significantly affects
    the likelihood of nitrate leaching, where forests have minimal nitrate loss compared
    to horticultural or vegetable crop fields where nutrients are applied (Cameron
    et al., 2013). Agricultural areas with well-drained soils have high vulnerability
    to nitrate in the groundwater (Gardner et al., 2020, Kohn et al., 2016, Wheeler
    et al., 2015). Contrarily, agricultural fields with low permeability soils may
    have low nitrate leaching to deeper aquifers due to denitrification processes
    resulting from anoxic conditions and slow travel times (Rivett et al., 2008, Rixon
    et al., 2020, Robinson, 2015). In a clay plain system in Ontario, nitrate concentrations
    were minimal in shallow and deep aquifers, while increased nitrate concentrations
    were found in tile drains and surface water (Mackie et al., 2021, May et al.,
    2023, Rixon et al., 2020). Nitrate leaching, transport and attenuation can also
    occur in bedrock systems particularly in the locations where overburden thickness
    is minimal (Levison and Novakowski, 2009, Opazo et al., 2016). Nitrate can be
    quickly transported through fractures in bedrock or can be attenuated through
    denitrification in these settings (Kim et al., 2016). 4.2.3. Areas of focus for
    continued research in nitrogen transport via groundwater There is an understanding
    that, although streams may respond promptly to “new” precipitation inputs, the
    water that contributes to the relatively rapid hydrograph response may be “old”
    (Brookfield et al., 2021, Brown et al., 1999, Mcdonnell and Beven, 2014). Groundwater
    flow can be a source of nitrate to streams, even decades after the source is removed
    due to slow groundwater flow or cycling of nitrate in and out of storage (Gardner
    et al., 2020, Robinson, 2015, Sprague et al., 2011, Tesoriero et al., 2009). There
    is a need for increased combined observation and understanding of groundwater
    transport processes (at shallow and deep depths) and in-stream water quality (Brookfield
    et al., 2021, Williams and McAfee, 2021). This magnifies the importance of investigating
    the surface water-groundwater interactions using integrated models and/or machine
    learning algorithms. Best Management Practices (BMPs) at the field and riparian
    scales are important for nitrate transport control (e.g., constructed wetlands)
    where further studies are required for improved management practices in tile-drained
    watersheds (Mackie et al., 2021, Martin et al., 2021, Tomer et al., 2003). There
    is also a lack of research focuses on monitoring the subsurface nutrient transport
    processes at different depths and scales, especially studies that investigate
    varying scales of groundwater-surface water interactions, since groundwater has
    a crucial influence on surface water (Blanco et al., 2010, Woessner, 2000). For
    example, within a 200 m stream reach, complex spatial and temporal hyporheic exchange
    was reported (Heathwaite et al., 2021). In addition, spatial understanding of
    groundwater impacts on nutrient movement is especially important in relation to
    changing climate conditions (Costa et al., 2021). 4.3. Effect of soil litter on
    nutrient transport In this section, different types of soil litter are discussed
    where some of them appear in forested landscape such as leaf litter while the
    rest can be found in agricultural landscapes such as crop litter and manure-based
    litter (i.e., animal and poultry litter). Although there are many sources of nutrient
    loss to water systems in agricultural and forested landscapes such as fertilizer
    application in agricultural fields, which will be discussed in 4.6 Sediment transport
    in watersheds, 4.9 Nutrient management in agricultural watersheds, 4.10 Main insights
    and knowledge gaps, soil litter is one of these crucial sources of nutrient transport
    in surface water and groundwater. The LDA algorithm identified this topic in a
    separate word cloud since it appeared frequently in the literature (Fig. 4, Fig.
    5). The nutrient cycle and loss within the ecosystems can be significantly affected
    by the quantity of litterfall that can also change the plant uptake and soil microbial
    activity (e.g., denitrification) (Franklin et al., 2020a, Joly et al., 2016, Woos
    et al., 2009). The decomposition rate of litterfall is considered as the main
    factor of nutrient loss of the litterfall, controlling the nutrient cycle in groundwater
    and surface water (Gong et al., 2020). It can also affect the soil fertility status
    and soil nutrient budget (Potthast et al., 2012). Litterfall decomposition rate
    is generally dependent on the chemical characteristics of litterfall (Zhao et
    al., 2014), lignin concentration (Martínez-Yrízar et al., 2007, Tilston et al.,
    2013) and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (Moore et al., 2011). In addition, the availability
    of soil nutrients and surface soil chemical properties have a significant influence
    on the quantity and quality of litter substrates (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus)
    (Ge et al., 2013). Climate conditions can control the nutrient transport process
    from litterfall to soil and waterways. For example, high temperature can accelerate
    the decomposition rate of litterfall (Wang et al., 2021). Moreover, high wind
    coupled with subtropical/tropical storms and high-volume rainfall events can dramatically
    change the nutrient cycle within the soil–water interactions (Brandt et al., 2009,
    Ostertag et al., 2003). The alternation of dry and wet seasons in the tropical
    forests can also significantly affect the nutrient dynamics from the forest litterfall
    to the soil (Inagaki et al., 2010, Yamashita et al., 2010). Precipitation also
    can increase nutrient leaching from soil to waterways by accelerating the decay
    rate of litterfall and/or the activity of soil microorganisms (Clein and Schimel,
    1994, Franklin et al., 2020a). Precipitation can also alter the decomposition
    rate of litterfall by changing the chemical properties of litterfall (Austin and
    Vitousek, 2000). On the other hand, drought events can reduce the decomposition
    rate of litterfall and nutrient leaching in ecosystems (Qu et al., 2020, Yahdjian
    et al., 2006). Although multiple studies have examined the effect of climate conditions
    on the litterfall, there is a lack of assessing the effect of climate change on
    the decomposition rate of litterfall and its contribution to nutrient loss to
    water systems. Riparian vegetation can be implemented to protect the ecosystems
    from different threats such as floods, grazing and high nutrient and sediment
    loss rate from catchments to water bodies (Franklin et al., 2020b). However, it
    is an active source of leaching nutrients from litterfall-soil to water bodies
    especially during the extreme rainfall events (Yang et al., 2015). It was found
    that nutrient transport rate from litterfall of riparian vegetation to water bodies
    is more rapid (i.e., hours) during heavy rainfall events compared to normal climate
    conditions (Cleveland et al., 2015). Nutrient leaching from leaves of riparian
    vegetation, falling directly in streams and water bodies, is also considered as
    an important source of nutrients in the ecosystems (Bayarsaikhan et al., 2016,
    Neilen et al., 2017). In addition to climate conditions, forest age, soil fertility,
    plant species, and topography have a crucial influence on the leaching rate of
    organic and inorganic nutrients from soil during extreme rainfall events (Neilen
    et al., 2017, Woos et al., 2009). Moreover, clay soils leach less nutrients from
    litterfall decay than sandy soils because of the low permeability to water and
    high nutrient adsorption capacity of clay soils compared to sandy types (Deb and
    Shukla, 2011). In temperate desert, nutrient loss from the decomposition of surface
    and root litterfall is correlated to the initial nutrient concentration of litterfall
    and the plant life form (Zhao et al., 2014). For manure-based litter, much research
    highlighted the contribution of swine, animal and poultry-based litter to the
    nutrient transport process within the soil and waterways (Felton et al., 2007,
    Lamba et al., 2012). During rainfall events, the surface runoff from the cultivated
    lands receiving manure litter represents the main governing factor on nutrient
    transport to waterways based on the method, timing and rate of fertilizers and
    manure application (Gupta et al., 2009). Thus, some approaches were recommended
    to reduce the negative effect of manure litter application on the water quality.
    For example, subsurface application of broiler litter can significantly decrease
    the nutrient transport in surface runoff by 85% compared to surface banding of
    broiler litter without affecting the crop yield (Sistani et al., 2009, Warren
    et al., 2008). 4.4. Nitrogen and phosphorus transport through overland runoff
    to surface water Topics 4 and 5 (phosphorus transport in runoff/surface water
    and nitrogen transport in surface water) were combined in this review section
    to discuss phosphorus and nitrogen transport through overland flow to surface
    water. Algorithm results were dominantly focused on agricultural landscapes; thus,
    this section focuses on nutrient transport through runoff relating to agricultural
    settings. It should be noted that runoff in forested landscapes can also contribute
    to nutrient transport through surface runoff. This is discussed in the previous
    section, Section 4.3 that discussed the effect of litterfall on nutrient transport,
    and Section 4.8 that outlines nutrient transport in forested watersheds. Runoff
    can be defined as the “quick” movement (within approximately one day) of water
    to a surface water body, including lakes, rivers, and streams. There are dominant
    factors that can affect runoff and influence nutrient transport such as climate
    inputs (e.g., rain and snow events), runoff interception (e.g., plant canopies),
    infiltration (i.e., soil properties), and land management practices (e.g., artificial
    drainage) (Beven and Germann, 2013, Goyette et al., 2019). Runoff typically includes
    overland flow (i.e., surface runoff) and subsurface runoff (i.e., shallow interflow).
    Excess nutrients can be located on the surface or stored in the root zone where
    they are susceptible to being transported to surface water features (e.g., rivers,
    lakes, and ponds) through overland flow (Goyette et al., 2019). Mechanisms of
    N and P transport through overland flow depend on numerous interconnecting factors
    such as nutrient sources, antecedent conditions, input climate conditions, land
    cover and land management practices. 4.4.1. Nitrogen and phosphorus transport
    to surface water overview Nitrate is the most common form of nitrogen in surface
    water as it can be easily transported through surface runoff to receiving water
    bodies because of its high mobility and solubility in water. Typically, nitrate
    concentrations in surface water are increased during wet periods and decreased
    during dry seasons (Reynolds et al., 1992), where nitrate concentration peaks
    typically occur before the event stream flow peaks (Kalkhoff et al., 2016, Kleinman
    et al., 2006, Ranalli and Macalady, 2010). Contrarily, some studies have reported
    that there was a deviation from the typical nitrate transport cycle (Martin et
    al., 2004, May et al., 2023) where increased nitrate concentrations in low flow
    periods (i.e., summer) were attributed to potential groundwater-surface water
    connections as opposed to surface transport of nitrate (Ghimire et al., 2020,
    Martin et al., 2004). Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), also referred to as
    soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) is the speciation of phosphorus that is of high
    concern to be transported from field to surface water bodies since it is immediately
    available for plant uptake, which can lead to algal growth. DRP can be directly
    transported through overland runoff during highly erosive events such as thaw
    and intensive rainfall events; however, it can also be transported sediment-bound
    since phosphorus is highly reactive (unlike nitrate) (Pärn et al., 2012, Pierzynski
    et al., 2005). The amount and speciation of transported phosphorus are dependent
    on soil properties (e.g., biogeochemical properties) and hill-slope hydrology
    (e.g., potential pathways of transport) (Ballantine et al., 2009). Phosphorus-laden
    runoff (i.e., soluble forms of P in runoff water and sediment bound P) can be
    elevated in small runoff events (e.g., summer rainfall); however, phosphorus losses
    are typically greater during large melt and/or intense rainfall events (Ballantine
    et al., 2009, Fraser et al., 1999, Jamieson et al., 2003). Excess soluble phosphorus,
    that is not lost in runoff, can percolate to aquifers, be taken up by plants and
    crops, or can be cycled into solid forms through the processes of sorption and
    precipitation. Solid forms of phosphorus that are stored in shallow layers of
    soil or in the streambed can be re-mobilized to soluble forms decades after application
    through runoff processes. This is commonly referred to as “legacy phosphorus”
    (Jarvie et al., 2013). 4.4.2. Hydrometric influences on nitrate and phosphorus
    transport in runoff Nutrient transport through surface runoff is highly dependent
    on climate inputs, antecedent soil conditions and streamflow response. The majority
    of the total annual nutrient loss typically occurs during few large surface runoff
    events throughout the year that are driven by intensive rainfall or snowmelt (Banner
    et al., 2009, Fraser et al., 1999, Irvine et al., 2019, Shigaki et al., 2007,
    Van Esbroeck et al., 2016). In humid conditions, where snowmelt is not a factor,
    nutrient mobility in runoff is governed by the same antecedent and input climate
    conditions (Kwong et al., 2002). Nitrate losses have been associated to increases
    in precipitation (Kwong et al., 2002, May et al., 2023, Rixon et al., 2020) and
    streamflow (Kalkhoff et al., 2016, Macrae et al., 2007a). For example, during
    a two-year study period, flow-weighted nitrate exports were not impacted by seasonality,
    but increased with size of event (i.e., streamflow response), and particularly
    impacted by events that followed long periods of dry conditions (Macrae et al.,
    2007a). Phosphorus losses are more episodic than nitrate losses, where increased
    phosphorus losses are frequently linked to events with increased erosion (i.e.,
    sediment transport) and streamflow (Ballantine et al., 2009, Kwong et al., 2002,
    Macrae et al., 2007a). Erosive events with increased streamflow are typically
    a result of freeze–thaw cycles (e.g., quick snowmelt event) and intensive rainfall
    on land without cover (Fraser et al., 1999, Macrae et al., 2007a). In cold climate
    regions of the northern hemisphere, phosphorus exports from surface runoff primarily
    occur during the non-growing season (i.e., from October to March) due to heavy
    rains and snowmelt (Fraser et al., 1999, Van Esbroeck et al., 2016). High phosphorus
    losses have been observed to be dependent on event-based conditions, regardless
    of season or growing stage. For example, it was observed that high stream discharge
    rates are strongly linked to phosphorus concentrations, regardless of season,
    where 88% of the total phosphorus loss in the study period occurred in only 10%
    of the observation time (Banner et al., 2009). Additionally, it was emphasized
    that greater runoff from increased rainfall intensity can increase phosphorus
    losses in runoff (Shigaki et al., 2007). 4.4.3. Landscape influences Many studies
    confirmed that climate inputs are important drivers for nutrient transport through
    runoff; however, landscape characteristics, including hillslope, soil type, and
    land management, also play a significant role in the quantity and quality of runoff
    (Kleinman et al., 2011). Runoff mechanisms can vary based on hillslope position,
    where saturation excess runoff is typically more common in foot slope areas, with
    infiltration excess runoff in upslope areas (Buda et al., 2009a, Buda et al.,
    2009b). Hillslope positions and runoff mechanisms are important parameters for
    understanding nutrient transport from different parts of a watershed, with varying
    vulnerable times of nutrient-laden runoff (Buda et al., 2009a). Specifically,
    the greatest phosphorus concentrations in runoff are found in upper landscape
    positions, with the largest loads of phosphorus coming from the foot slope areas
    (Buda et al., 2009b). It was also observed that there is a disconnection between
    runoff upslope and streamflow, exemplifying that critical sources areas of nutrients
    can vary within a hillslope (Buda et al., 2009b). Soil type plays an important
    role in nutrient transport via runoff mechanisms. In low permeability settings
    (e.g., clay soils), fast overland flow paths can occur during saturated (e.g.,
    heavy rainfall) or frozen conditions (Demand et al., 2019, Gospodyn et al., 2023).
    In dry conditions, clay soils can be cracked which is considered one of major
    causes for creating macropores in the soil that allow water to enter the upper
    layers of soil, and although not overland flow, quick flow paths can be created
    in the shallow subsurface typically through tile drainage (Beven and Germann,
    2013; Grant et al., 2019). In higher permeability settings (e.g., sand and loam
    soils), there is greater soil infiltration capacity, reducing events that result
    in overland flow due to saturated conditions (Lam et al., 2016). When multiple
    watersheds were compared in a previous study, it was found that events in watersheds
    with clay soil were dominated by quick flow compared to a loamier watershed, despite
    the presence of tile drains (Gospodyn et al., 2023). Recently, it was also found
    that soil characteristics had a stronger influence on quick flow paths than catchments
    that were tile drained (Dimitrova-Petrova et al., 2020, Gospodyn et al., 2023,
    Grant et al., 2019, Macrae et al., 2019, Williams and McAfee, 2021). Further details
    on nutrient transport through tile drainage can be found in Section 4.5 on Subsurface
    Drainage. Land management practices (e.g., tillage and fertilization practices)
    have a strong influence on timing and quantities of nutrient loss. For example,
    a natural watershed produced small nutrient export compared to agricultural watersheds,
    illustrating that land use and land management affect nutrient laden runoff, despite
    the input climate conditions (Irvine et al., 2019). Further details about the
    effects of agricultural land management (e.g., Best Management Practices) on nutrient
    transport are discussed in Section 4.9. 4.4.4. Scales of measurement There are
    multiple scales at which nutrient transport through surface runoff can be monitored,
    including micro-plot, field and watershed scales. Micro-plot scales can be conducted
    and applied on either field plots (Sánchez-Pérez et al., 2003) or soil boxes (similar
    to Kleinman et al., 2004) with simulated rainfall events. Micro-plot scale evaluations
    play an important role in assessing the effects of field and climate properties,
    such as fertilizer application, soil, land cover and precipitation, on nutrient
    losses (Jokela and Casler, 2011, Kleinman et al., 2006, Kwong et al., 2002, Shigaki
    et al., 2006). Edge-of-field (EoF) measurement studies are important for understanding
    agricultural field-specific properties that can contribute to nutrient losses.
    EoF sites can be set up to monitor overland and subsurface nutrient losses (Jamieson
    et al., 2003, Lam et al., 2016, Van Esbroeck et al., 2016). To measure overland
    flow and nutrient concentrations, flumes can be designed and installed to capture
    water that flows over the field. Flume design is unique and specific for each
    site based on the field and climate conditions (Jamieson et al., 2003). The collection
    of EoF overland flow data is important to determine the runoff hydrologic patterns
    and differentiate nutrient losses that are related to overland runoff compared
    to those are specific to groundwater interflow or tile drainage (Smith et al.,
    2015, Tomer et al., 2010). Recent work highlights the importance of continuing
    EoF hydrological studies to achieve long-term EoF datasets especially in cold-climate
    regions (e.g., snowmelt effects on nutrient transport) (Jamieson et al., 2003,
    Kerr et al., 2016, Schilling et al., 2020, Twombly et al., 2021, Van Esbroeck
    et al., 2016). Watershed and sub-watershed scale studies are important to evaluate
    spatial and temporal differences in water-flow pathways, identifying the areas
    of concern of nutrient transport (Tomer et al., 2003). Paired or nested watershed
    monitoring is an alternative watershed method for research on management effects
    on agricultural runoff where nutrient losses can be measured under various best
    management practices (Irvine et al., 2019, Jiang et al., 2012, Jokela and Casler,
    2011, Sherman et al., 2021, Ssegane et al., 2013). For example, Jokela and Casler,
    2011, used the paired-watershed approach to identify that land use and seasonality
    (e.g., fall manure application and snowmelt events) affected dissolved nutrient
    transport. 4.4.5. Perceived research gaps in nutrient transport through overland
    flow There are many studies about nutrient transport through surface runoff using
    different methods at varying scales. Within this vast set of research, there is
    a lack of unified messaging for mitigating nutrient loss through surface runoff
    (i.e., across different soil, crop types and climates). This review has identified
    a few key research gaps. For example, there is a need for year-round event-based
    nutrient transport studies that include varying scales of study from edge-of-field
    locations to watershed-wide monitoring to identify critical periods and locations
    vulnerable to nutrient loss (Jokela and Casler, 2011, Macrae et al., 2007b, Tomer
    et al., 2003) because large nutrient losses can occur in any season and during
    small duration events. In addition, high resolution data may help in identifying
    the flow mechanisms and nutrient inputs that are driving large surface runoff
    exports. Moreover, there is a research gap in investigating the relationships
    between the mode of surface water runoff generation (i.e., infiltration excess
    or saturation) and nutrient transport (Buda et al., 2009b). Determining the spatial
    and temporal variations of flow generation methods may enhance the understanding
    of the connections between the hydrological processes and nutrient export process,
    leading to better land management strategies to reduce nutrient loss (Macrae et
    al., 2019). In addition to the identification of the surface runoff mechanisms,
    recognition of the nutrient source and differentiation between the released nutrients
    from recent applications and legacy nutrients in soil is crucial for better determination
    of remediation approaches (Goyette et al., 2019, Jarvie et al., 2013). Multi-scale
    watershed studies (e.g., nested watersheds or a combination of edge-of-field and
    watershed) are limited yet can be informative of specific vulnerable areas and
    times of nutrient loss through surface runoff (Irvine et al., 2019, Jarvie et
    al., 2017). As previously discussed, landscape and flow mechanisms vary over a
    watershed, so monitoring runoff losses at different scales is important for comprehensive
    understanding for nutrient transport, and targeted implementation for reduction
    strategies. Moreover, climate conditions (e.g., increased intensities) and stream
    responses (e.g., “flashiness”) are becoming more variable over smaller scales
    (Baker et al., 2004, Rose and Karwan, 2021); thus, monitoring varying scales and
    locations within a watershed is extremely important for understanding the overall
    watershed nutrient runoff mechanisms (Jarvie et al., 2017). 4.5. Nutrient loss
    in subsurface drainage Text mining identified subsurface drainage (i.e., tile
    drains) as one of the most frequent topics in the literature related to nutrient
    transport in water systems since it is essential in poorly drained agricultural
    watersheds to remove the excess water from fields, improving the crop growth and
    soil productivity. Tile drainage networks can also increase the aeration and quality
    of soil and root zone while enhancing the field conditions for better crop growth.
    For example, more than 50% of agricultural fields in the province of Ontario,
    Canada are drained using artificial subsurface drainage (Golmohammadi et al.,
    2016). However, tile drains are preferential pathways for contaminants, pesticides
    and sediments that accelerate nutrient transport and the loading rate from agricultural
    fields to streams and rivers. It was found that tile drains can be responsible
    for transporting up to 92% of the nitrate, 77% of total phosphorus and 67% of
    soluble reactive phosphorus loads from agricultural fields to surface water (Smith
    et al., 2015, Van Esbroeck et al., 2016, Williams et al., 2015a). In addition,
    subsurface drainage is responsible for transporting elevated concentrations of
    suspended sediments that can reach up to 63% of the total watershed fluxes (Grangeon
    et al., 2017). There are different factors that can affect nutrient and sediment
    transport in subsurface drainage systems such as topography (e.g., slope), soil
    type, drainage system design (e.g., depth and spacing of drains) and tile land
    management practices (King et al., 2015, Muma et al., 2017, Rahman et al., 2014).
    The performance of tile drainage system can also be affected by the hydrological
    characteristics such as soil properties, soil moisture conditions and rainfall
    properties (e.g., rainfall intensity) (Macrae et al., 2007b). In addition, rainfall
    events substantially impact nutrient and sediment dynamics in tile drains (Grangeon
    et al., 2021, Uusitalo et al., 2001). Temporal variation in nutrient concentrations
    in streams is usually affected by nutrient fluxes from tile drains because of
    the direct hydrological connectivity between stream flow and subsurface drainage
    system. Different factors can control the relationship between tile drains and
    stream nutrient fluxes such as nutrient management practices, soil type, land
    use, local climatic patterns and tile drain spacing (Kennedy et al., 2012, Nangia
    et al., 2010). In addition, precipitation amount, and fertilizers application
    rate are the most important parameters for mirroring the nutrient fluxes in tile
    drains to surface water (Randall and Goss, 2008, Zhao et al., 2001). In previous
    modelling studies, nutrient transport in tile drains in agricultural watersheds
    was simulated using different mathematical models to better understand the effect
    of tile drains on nutrient cycles. For example, some studies simulated nutrient
    transport within tile drains using DRAINMOD (Golmohammadi et al., 2016, Golmohammadi
    et al., 2021) and SWAT (Guo et al., 2018, Ikenberry et al., 2017, Mehan et al.,
    2019, Moriasi et al., 2013). Different models were also developed and calibrated
    to simulate the effect of subsurface tile drains on the salt ions (e.g., calcium,
    sodium, and chloride) transport in agricultural watersheds (Addab and Bailey,
    2022, Yang et al., 2022). However, there is a lack of integrated models that can
    simulate tile drains at the watershed scale including surface water and groundwater.
    Controlled drainage is an effective conservation practice to decrease drain flow
    and nutrient transport to streams and rivers by managing the drain outlet (Williams
    et al., 2015b). Controlled drainage systems can reduce the annual loads of nitrate
    by 26–79% (Ross et al., 2016, Saadat et al., 2018, Skaggs et al., 2012), total
    phosphorus by 57% (Ross et al., 2016), and soluble phosphorus by 57–80% (Nash
    et al., 2015, Ross et al., 2016). It was also found that nitrate load reduction
    under controlled drainage followed the same pattern of changes in drain flow (Saadat
    et al., 2018). In the literature, there are some knowledge gaps related to nutrient
    transport to water courses through subsurface drainage. Although tile drains are
    an active source of nutrient and sediment loss to surface water, there is a lack
    of simulating the contribution of tile drains in these transport processes with
    the rest of water systems such as groundwater and surface water using watershed-scale
    integrated models. In addition, the influence of climate change on the nutrient
    and sediment loss through subsurface drainage has not been well investigated in
    the literature. There is also a research gap in assessing the effect of crop management
    practices on nutrient and sediment transport through tile drainage. This confirms
    the importance of integrated models as an effective tool for simulating nutrient
    transport under various climate and field conditions. Machine learning algorithms
    can be also implemented to reduce the complexity level of integrated models since
    they can explain the relationships between nutrient transport and the involved
    variables (e.g., hydrological and meteorological conditions) in a practical way.
    4.6. Sediment transport in watersheds There are two types of sediment transport
    mechanisms including the in-stream sediment transport in the fluvial environment
    (e.g., rivers, streams, and creeks) and soil erosion from fields and watersheds.
    Most of the previous studies concentrated on the soil erosion from watersheds
    and basins where it is strongly linked with the nitrogen and phosphorus transport
    in soil and waterways, affecting the freshwater availability, soil organic matter
    and soil productivity (Krasa et al., 2019). Sediment also acts as a crucial carrier
    for contaminants and nutrients to surface water resources such as rivers and lakes
    (Varol, 2013). Sediment transport from fields and watersheds is affected by different
    anthropogenic and natural parameters such as rainfall intensity, land cover, topography,
    and vegetation (Walia et al., 2020). The mechanisms, main causes, and hazards
    of sediment loss from watersheds are varied with the location, natural characteristics,
    and socioeconomic conditions of each region (Falcão et al., 2020). Therefore,
    various studies and models were proposed to determine the governing factors on
    the sediment transport process, identify the mechanisms of soil erosion, simulate
    the soil erosion quantification and clarify the linkage between sediment and nutrient
    losses in waterways and catchments. On the other hand, there is a lack of describing
    the in-stream sediment and nutrient transport in fluvial environments, creating
    a significant knowledge gap for future research work. Several previous studies
    investigated the effect of climate conditions (e.g., precipitation) on the quantity
    and frequency of sediment and nutrient transport in rivers and watersheds. For
    example, it was found that there is a significant interdependence between water
    discharge and sediment transport in the Po River in Italy during intense rainfall
    events where nitrite and ammonia concentrations were positively correlated with
    the suspended sediment concentration (Tesi et al., 2013). It was also highlighted
    that the bacterial activity, biological reactions (e.g., nitrification) and ionic
    exchange rate, which is related to the sediment concentration, are the main governing
    factors on nitrite and ammonia transport in the Po River during flood events.
    In addition, storm events have a substantial influence on nutrient and sediment
    transport especially for the first storm after drought events where large amounts
    of sediments and nutrients can be transported in temporary and intermittent rivers
    (Ramos et al., 2015). Surface runoff dynamics also have a major influence on the
    sediment and nutrient transport processes especially in agricultural watersheds
    (Ballantine et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2014; Tuset et al., 2016). The scope of
    various previous sediment transport studies was oriented towards diagnosing the
    relationship between the sediment and nutrient losses. For example, it was observed
    that the phosphorus loss is positively correlated to soil erosion where the areas
    with high particulate phosphorus transport rate are the same of those with high
    soil erosion where the rainfall, slope and soil erodibility are high (Han et al.,
    2021). In another study, it was found that reservoirs with high sediment deposition
    rate act as huge phosphorus sinks, highlighting the strong relationship between
    sediment and phosphorus transport processes (Krasa et al., 2019). Some factors
    are considered the governing factors in the relationship between nutrient and
    sediment transport in watersheds such as soil type, crop practices, rainfall,
    and snow-melt events (Aryal and Reba, 2017, Varol, 2013). A number of mathematical
    models and tools were developed and applied to describe the watershed sediment
    transport process, estimate the soil erosion and define the possible risk of sediment
    loss in the ecosystems. These models include the USLE, the revised universal soil
    loss equation (RUSLE), the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), and many other
    models. The USLE approach is the most common mathematical model for predicting
    the annual soil erosion rate (Parveen and Kumar, 2012). In many cases, USLE is
    coupled with geographic information system (GIS)-based techniques as these techniques
    can be used for soil erosion mapping where they can manage the spatial data in
    an effective manner (Ali and Hagos, 2016, Liu et al., 2015, Pham et al., 2018).
    Beside the integrated USLE-GIS models, other studies adopted different mathematical
    models, such as SWAT (Bieger et al., 2015, Gamvroudis et al., 2015, Ricci et al.,
    2018, Shrestha and Wang, 2018) and Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment (PESERA)
    (Fernández and Vega, 2016), for simulating the soil erosion rate in rivers and
    watersheds within different locations. Most common mathematical models in previous
    studies, that were used for simulating sediment transport in watersheds, are summarized
    in Table S1. Different remediation approaches were suggested in previous studies
    to protect against soil erosion and decrease the effect of surface runoff on sediment
    transport. For example, check dams and appropriate watershed management practices
    can reduce surface runoff, soil erosion and suspended solids concentration by
    affecting the relation between surface runoff and watershed sediment transport
    (Bai et al., 2020, Yan et al., 2015). Small farm ponds coupled with efficient
    trapping methods also have a significant effect on sediment transport process
    in rivers and agricultural watersheds (Berg et al., 2016). In addition, it was
    found that the increase in vegetation cover and planting native tree species can
    decrease sediment transport in watersheds through decreasing the runoff coefficients
    (Chu et al., 2019, Yan et al., 2015). Besides the clear knowledge gap in describing
    the in-stream sediment and nutrient transport in fluvial environments, there are
    additional research gaps that should be investigated using systematic studies.
    For example, watershed-scale integrated models should be used to include the component
    of sediment transport in agricultural and forest landscapes since sediments act
    as a crucial carrier for pollutants and nutrients to surface water courses. In
    addition, the impact of climate change and crop management practices on sediment
    and nutrient transport to water courses represents a significant research gap
    due to the strong correlation between sediments and their associated nutrient
    concentrations. This complicated relation between sediment and nutrient transport
    requires the implementation of machine learning algorithms to diagnose the interdependence
    between them and explain the causal relationship between different variables involved
    in the nutrient transport processes. 4.7. Modelling of nutrient transport In the
    following section, the most common mathematical and analytical models of nutrient
    transport in surface and subsurface waters are briefly discussed and the main
    knowledge gaps from previous publications in literature are highlighted. In addition,
    selected studies that applied these mathematical and analytical models are discussed
    and summarized in Table S2. It should be noted that most of the considered articles,
    based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis in the current study, are focused
    on nutrient transport in surface water or surface water-groundwater interactions.
    Also, some articles investigated nutrient transport processes in the vadose zone
    using solute transport models such as HYDRUS while some focused on the modelling
    of nutrient transport in groundwater using MODFLOW and contaminant transport models
    such as MT3D and RT3D. In addition, approximately 44% of the considered articles
    (26 out of 59 articles) have concentrated on the modeling of only nitrogen transport
    in watersheds while the scope of 26% of the studies was oriented towards modelling
    of phosphorus transport. Moreover, 15% of the articles investigated the transport
    of both nitrogen and phosphorus through numerical modeling studies while the remaining
    articles (15%) studied different types of pollutants (e.g., carbon and salts)
    beside nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater. According to some
    previous review studies pertaining to nutrient transport in surface water and
    groundwater, critical selection of modelling approach and scale is extremely important
    since they can affect the robustness of models (Alam and Dutta, 2021, Costa et
    al., 2020). For example, development and validation of mathematical models require
    efficient data collection that varies greatly based on the nutrient of interest,
    modelling scale and availability of data. After constructing a mathematical model
    on a certain scale, using the model as a predictive tool is considered as another
    challenging aspect due to the variation in climatic, geologic, and anthropogenic
    conditions. Although mathematical models can be used as a tool for decision making,
    they are fraught with a high level of uncertainty that can be difficult to quantify.
    Therefore, previous studies in the literature have introduced and implemented
    different mathematical models to describe the nutrient transport process in surface
    water and groundwater, determining the effect of various parameters on the predication
    accuracy of these models. Mathematical models can be divided into three types:
    (1) plot-scale models for agricultural lands, (2) river water quality models for
    stream analysis, and (3) integrated basin-scale models of the first two types
    for including groundwater modelling (Alam and Dutta, 2021). The structure and
    function of many types of models can be classified into conceptual, process-based,
    and physics-based models (Alam and Dutta, 2021). The Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool (SWAT) is one of the commonly used models for simulating flow, sediment and
    nutrient transport on watershed scale and assessing the effect of land management
    practices on these processes. It is a basin-scale and semi-distributed hydrological
    model that depends on continuous-time and daily time step for simulation (Arnold
    et al., 1998). In addition, the SWAT model can be combined with different groundwater
    numerical models (e.g., MODFLOW) and solute transport models (e.g., Reactive Transport
    3-dimensional model (RT3D)) to formulate a large-scale model to simulate the nutrient
    transport processes in surface water and groundwater (Wei et al., 2019, Wei and
    Bailey, 2021). HydroGeoSphere (HGS) is another example for finite element and
    fully integrated numerical models that can simulate physically-based hydrological
    systems on a watershed scale (Aquanty, 2018, Therrien and Sudicky, 1996). Soil
    Moisture Distribution and Routing (SMDR) is considered as another surface water
    simulation software that is a physically-based, fully distributed and non-calibrated
    numerical model (Soil and Water Laboratory, 2002). HYDRUS is a common program
    for simulating nutrient transport in subsurface systems including the vadose zone
    using one, two and three-dimensions (Simunek et al., 2008). HYDRUS-1D can simulate
    the one-dimensional scale of soil water, solute and heat in variably saturated
    and unsaturated media while HYDRUS-2D and 3D can describe dynamics and patterns
    of nutrient transport and retention within the soil (Šimůnek et al.. 2011). The
    Integrated Catchment Model (INCA), Hydrological Predictions for the Environment
    (HYPE), and MIKE-SHE are also considered important models that can simulate nitrogen
    and phosphorus in river basins and catchments. INCA is a process-based semi-distributed
    dynamic model that can simulate the flow and nutrient pathways in terrestrial
    and aquatic compartments using mass-balance principles (Ervinia et al., 2020,
    Rankinen et al., 2021, Whitehead et al., 2019). The Integrated Catchment Model
    for Nitrogen Dynamics (INCA-N) is used to simulate the nitrogen fluxes at multiple
    points along rivers (Wade et al., 2002, Whitehead et al., 1998) while the Integrated
    Catchment Model for Phosphorus Dynamics (INCA-P) is more complicated and used
    for modelling phosphorus species and sediment erosion in rivers (Jackson-Blake
    et al., 2016, Lazar et al., 2010, Wade et al., 2002). HYPE is a semi-distributed
    process-based that can simulate stream flow, nutrient dynamics, and transformation
    from precipitation to river outlets (Ghaffar et al., 2021, Yin et al., 2016).
    It can simulate nutrient transport in rivers, lakes, and soil in large and small
    watershed sizes at a daily time-step (Capell et al., 2021, Namugize et al., 2017).
    MIKE-SHE is a fully distributed three-dimensional physics-based model that can
    simulate overland and channel flow coupled with solute transport in the unsaturated
    zone (Liu et al., 2022, Olesen et al., 2019). It can be combined with DAISY, a
    complex mathematical model used for in-detail describing nitrogen biogeochemical
    process, for better simulation of flow, nitrogen dynamics, and crop growth in
    agroecosystems (Alam and Dutta, 2021, Neumann et al., 2021). In addition to numerical
    models, there are multiple analytical models that can simulate nutrient transport
    in surface water and groundwater. For instance, the Model of Acidification of
    Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) is an example of an analytical model that has
    been used for surface water modeling which is a lumped-parameter model of intermediate
    complexity, predicting long-term effects of acidic deposition on soil and surface
    water chemistry (Cosby et al., 1985, Cosby et al., 2001). Spatially Referenced
    Regression on Watershed attributes (SPARROW) is considered as one of the most
    efficient analytical models that is operated as a black-box statistical method
    (Schwarz et al., 2006). It is a non-linear space-based regression model that can
    determine the contamination load in different locations within the watershed,
    identifying the main contamination sources and the nutrient dynamics on the watershed
    scale. In the current topic, multiple research gaps were determined based on the
    recommendation of previous publications that examined the common mathematical
    modeling approaches for describing nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater.
    For example, limited studies have developed and applied integrated large-scale
    models to better describe flow, nutrient and sediment transport in multiple water
    systems such as streams, lakes, groundwater, and tile drains and their interactions.
    Integration of models, focusing on different aspects of nutrient transport process
    including different hydrological systems, allows for more realistic modelling
    conditions with presenting additional technical issues, such as spatiotemporal
    discretization discrepancies (Haacker et al., 2019). In addition, there is a lack
    of applying data-driven models using machine learning algorithms on watershed-scale
    datasets to classify and predict the nutrient transport process in surface and
    subsurface water. In addition, the effect of climate change and crop management
    practices on nutrient transport in water systems should be included in the scope
    of modelling approaches to better understand their influences on the hydrological
    and nutrient cycles. 4.8. Nutrient transport in forested watersheds Although more
    research was conducted in quantifying nutrient transport in water systems (e.g.,
    rivers and lakes) within agricultural landscapes, forest landscapes still represent
    an active source of nutrient transport to these water courses. Thus, nutrient
    transport in forested watersheds has gained much attention during recent years
    since forested catchments are considered one of the central sources of water supply
    where lakes and small rivers are intensively located within these catchments.
    Various studies, that covered the hydrology and nutrient transport in forested
    watersheds, are summarized where the main hydrological, geological, and climatic
    conditions are highlighted (Table S3). Many previous publications showed that
    nitrogen loss from forested watersheds to waterways is one of the most active
    sources of surface and subsurface water contamination (Brookshire et al., 2012,
    Liu et al., 2016, Shinozuka et al., 2017). Nitrate (NO3), ammonia (NH4) and dissolved
    organic nitrogen (DON) are the most dominant nitrogen forms in the loss process
    from forests. Nitrate, as a form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, can represent
    up to 80% of the total dissolved nitrogen in some tropical forests (Sebilo et
    al., 2013). Ammonia also plays a crucial role in transforming the nitrogen compounds
    in forest soils (Yu et al., 2017). For organic nitrogen, DON contains several
    simple and complex compounds of organic nitrogen and is usually dominated over
    inorganic nitrogen in old forests. Transport paths and hydrological conditions
    have a significant influence on the nitrogen transport from forested catchments
    to surface and subsurface waters. The main nitrogen transport paths in forest-dominated
    catchments include surface flow, groundwater flow and lateral flow (Arnold et
    al., 1993, Wang et al., 2020). Based on results of previous studies, DON and NH4
    were increased with the surface runoff (i.e., high flow conditions) because they
    were the dominant nitrogen compounds in the topsoil water compared to NO3 that
    was generated from the subsurface runoff (Chen et al., 2012, Hagedorn et al.,
    2001). It was also noticed that leaching of NO3 was increased with the increase
    of nitrogen deposition rate while DON loss from the forested catchments was independent
    of nitrogen deposition rate (Hagedorn et al., 2001). Watershed characteristics,
    including forest cover, tree species, and soil properties, play a crucial role
    in the nitrogen cycle and export processes from forested watersheds to forest
    streams and groundwater (Meghdadi, 2018, Wang et al., 2020).). In addition, watershed
    topographic properties (e.g., watershed slope) can also change the mechanism and
    rate of diffuse nitrogen export from forested catchments (Kuriqi et al., 2019).
    Coniferous coverage and watershed slope are crucial factors on stream nitrate
    concentration, as noted using 40 observation sites within a nitrogen-saturated
    forest (Watanabe et al., 2018). Moreover, it was found that the nitrogen concentration
    variance in nine coastal lakes in forest-dominated watersheds in Canada is affected
    by the vegetation type, drainage class and forest soil type (Zhu et al., 2008).
    Beside watershed properties, the transport of dissolved inorganic and organic
    nitrogen compounds in forest landscapes is controlled by various climate factors
    such as temperature, wind, rainfall, and snowfall events that can affect the diffuse
    nitrogen export from forests to natural water bodies (Hellsten et al., 2015, Rusjan
    and Vidmar, 2017). For example, high NO3 concentration can be observed during
    late winter, while DON was the highest in summer and fall conditions (Hagedorn
    et al., 2001). In addition, the seasonal changes affect the biological reactions
    and the dynamics of organic and inorganic nitrogen where the microbial activity
    increases at high temperature during summer, stimulating the production rate of
    DON while NO3 is retained in the forested system (Hagedorn et al., 2001). The
    snowfall events and freezing-thawing process have a significant effect on the
    nitrogen loss from forested watersheds to lakes and rivers (Ouyang et al., 2013,
    Yano et al., 2019). For example, heavy snowfall and snow melt can inhibit the
    microbial activity in shallow soils, leading to insufficient nitrification and
    denitrification where the nitrogen cycle and plant uptake are extremely affected
    during winter (Hattori et al., 2019). Precipitation coupled with soil percolation
    has a strong relationship with diffusive nitrogen export especially during non-growing
    seasons (Chen et al., 2012, Lin et al., 2015). Phosphorus transport is important
    in order to understand the nutrient budget in forest ecosystems. Although phosphorus
    is a crucial element for plant nutrition and productivity, phosphorus concentration
    has decreased compared to nitrogen (i.e., high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio) in
    forests in recent years (Jonard et al., 2015). Also, there are different phosphorus
    dynamic paths in forest-dominated watersheds, including surface flow (i.e., overland
    flow) and vertical and lateral subsurface flow (Fuchs et al., 2009). For example,
    lateral and vertical subsurface flow paths are the most dominant phosphorus transport
    mechanisms during intensive rainfall events in three forest sites in Germany (Rinderer
    et al., 2021). In 26 forest-dominated watersheds in Europe, it was observed that
    the surface flow was the major phosphorus transport mechanism (Gottselig et al.,
    2017). In addition, preferential flow is considered as a potential path for phosphorus
    transport during large rainfall events where phosphorus in the subsurface flow
    can bypass the soil matrix without being retained in the soil (Julich et al.,
    2017, Missong et al., 2018). Bio-pores (e.g., root channels) are also considered
    a phosphorus pathway since they contain higher phosphorus concentration compared
    to typical soil matrix especially in clay soils (Backnäs et al., 2012). Many potential
    approaches (e.g., wetlands and riparian zones) are recommended to reduce the nitrogen
    loss from the forested watersheds to natural water bodies. For example, near-stream
    wetlands can form a transition between the upland soils and forest streams and
    outlets, regulating nitrogen concentration in forest streams (Davis et al., 2011,
    McHale et al., 2004). Moreover, wetlands in suitable geographic locations can
    achieve high nitrogen removal (up to 25%) in watersheds with a dominant forest
    cover (Hansen et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2020). Plant-soil relationships, biological
    activities, vegetation cover, hydrogeomorphology and climate conditions are governing
    factors on the efficiency of riparian forests in nitrogen removal in groundwater
    and surface water (Davis et al., 2011, Mayer et al., 2007). Although there is
    much research conducted in characterizing nutrient transport to water systems
    within forest and agricultural landscapes, there is a lack in research pertaining
    to assessing the influence of natural infrastructure (e.g., forests, wetlands,
    and riparian zones) on nutrient transport in agricultural watersheds. This can
    be simulated using either large-scale integrated models or machine learning techniques.
    This will help to better understand the nutrient transport process since natural
    infrastructure can control the quantity and quality of water courses. Moreover,
    climate change has a remarkable impact on nutrient transport to water systems
    within these multiple landscapes, creating a crucial knowledge gap in the field.
    4.9. Nutrient management in agricultural watersheds In the dataset used in the
    quantitative analysis, the articles about nutrient management in agricultural
    watersheds varied widely where some of these articles focused on economic methods
    for efficient crop production (Maja et al., 2017). These economic methods include
    a direct portion associated with the cost of the fertilizer and an indirect reflection
    through the crop production (Li et al., 2022). In addition, economic losses resulting
    from inadequate use of fertilizers are problematic and have gained much attention
    during the recent decades (Haacker et al., 2019). Other articles concentrated
    on the complex nutrient transport conceptualization and modelling in multiple
    geological formations in agricultural watersheds (Ford et al., 2019). This is
    mainly because management of nutrient loss from agricultural fields requires appropriate
    understanding with the underlying geology (e.g., sandy aquifer, karstic bedrock
    and unfractured clay) (Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, additional articles were
    considered where the focus of these studies was oriented towards the integrated
    modelling for agricultural water management (Haacker et al., 2019). Different
    approaches were deployed and implemented in previous studies for proposing the
    best management practices in agricultural landscapes (Martin et al., 2021). For
    example, some studies adopted nutrient management plans by reducing the fertilizer
    application within agricultural watershed (Bartolini et al., 2007, Crossman et
    al., 2013, Santhi et al., 2006). Many studies investigated the feasibility of
    using structural systems such as riparian buffers (Weller and Baker, 2014), detention/retention
    ponds (Chretien et al., 2016, Myers et al., 2018, Schwartz et al., 2017), vegetated
    filter strip (Gall et al., 2018) and manure storage (Chadwick et al., 2015) to
    mitigate the risk of elevated concentrations of nutrient within the agricultural
    watersheds. In addition, subsurface drainage in agricultural fields was assessed
    to overcome the impacts of high-water tables on agricultural plant growth; however,
    it can expedite the loss of fertilizers (Grenon et al., 2021). Management of drainage
    water can also be a dominant factor in reducing the amount of phosphorous entering
    surface water bodies via tile drainage while organic and mineral soils can behave
    differently with phosphorus transport in agricultural watersheds (Grenon et al.,
    2021). Since the commonly implemented best management practices for mitigation
    of high nutrient concentrations are not the main scope of this current study,
    the main knowledge gaps in this particular area will be discussed in the following
    paragraphs. Based on the recommendations of previous studies in literature, multiple
    research gaps were determined in the implementation of optimal agricultural watershed
    management. The effect of climate change and crop use on the management practices
    is the main knowledge gap since there is a lack in understanding the effect of
    numerous climate and field conditions on the function of agricultural management
    practices. These conditions include the storm size, seasonality and the influent
    pollutant loads due to agricultural activities. In addition, there are a lot of
    challenges associated with the existing watershed-scale models which highlights
    the importance of integrated models for better understanding of the agricultural
    watershed management. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used
    as suitable alternative for the typical mathematical models since they can simplify
    the simulation of agricultural watershed under various hydrological, hydrogeological,
    meteorological, and field conditions. 4.10. Main insights and knowledge gaps The
    Gamma values (i.e., probability of per document per topic) were determined and
    summed up for each topic for all relevant publications to evaluate the contribution
    of each examined topic in the content of the analyzed publications using the LDA
    algorithm (Fig. 7). The summation of Gamma values can be used as an indication
    for the most frequent topics in previous publications and the main research gaps
    in literature. Based on the algorithm results, Topic 4 (phosphorus transport in
    surface water), Topic 7 (sediment transport in watersheds) and Topic 6 (nutrient
    transport in subsurface drainage) had the highest summation of Gamma values, indicating
    that these topics are the most common in the literature and have the largest contribution
    in the considered articles. Download : Download high-res image (155KB) Download

    per topic probability) for all topics. Based on the research gaps associated with
    each topic that were mentioned within the context of the previous sub-sections,
    five major knowledge gaps were determined based on the topic identification and
    summation of Gamma values for the topics using the quantitative and qualitative
    analysis by the LDA algorithm (Fig. 8). These research gaps did not contribute
    or appear in the identified topics and their word clouds (Fig. 5), indicating
    that further investigations are required to explore these research gaps. In addition,
    these research gaps were tagged from the discussions of the reviewed articles
    that were used in the application of the text mining algorithm (i.e., LDA model).
    Since text mining was used to show what has been conducted in the research and
    identify the common themes and topics, identified topics in the literature, which
    was resulted from the application of text mining, was used to determine these
    research gaps. Also, some topics had a quantitatively significant contribution
    to the considered publications; however, gaps still qualitatively appear in the
    research depth/breadth of the examined topics. Therefore, these research gaps
    should be highlighted to cover the effect of various aspects on the nutrient transport
    in surface and subsurface waters. Download : Download high-res image (838KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Schematic figure for the five knowledge gaps
    in the field of nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater. The first
    knowledge gap is related to the most effective method to understand and describe
    the interaction between surface water and groundwater. Although the interaction
    between surface and subsurface water plays a crucial role in nutrient exchange
    in watersheds in many cases, it was neglected in most of the previous studies
    (Robinson, 2015). The evaluation of surface water-groundwater interaction is problematic
    because of its highly spatiotemporal variations on the watershed-scale (Mackie
    et al., 2021). Also, the development and calibration of integrated mathematical
    models for the interaction between surface and subsurface waters is quite challenging
    and requires further investigations. This knowledge gap is related to Topics 2,
    4, 5, 6 and 8, reflecting the importance of considering the interaction between
    the surface water and groundwater where the surface runoff and subsurface flow
    are the dominant pathways of nutrient transport. Moreover, integrated mathematical
    models can link the hydrology and nutrient transport of surface water and groundwater
    with sediment transport in a comprehensive way to better understand the governing
    factors on the nutrient and sediment transport processes. Although various studies
    developed mathematical models for nutrient transport process, they were only concerned
    with a certain aspect of the process. For example, some studies investigated only
    the nutrient transport in groundwater or in tile drains. Also, other studies examined
    only the hydrology of surface and subsurface waters (i.e., flow studies). Therefore,
    integrated modelling is required to simulate the whole system under the contribution
    of flow, nutrients, and sediments. This research gap is consistent with those
    mentioned and highlighted in previous nutrient transport studies (Blöschl et al.,
    2019, Cochand et al., 2019, Goderniaux et al., 2009, Neumann et al., 2021, Sulis
    et al., 2012) where the importance of integrated models was emphasized to better
    describe the nutrient transport process in surface and subsurface water. The second
    research gap is related to the effect of climate change on nutrient transport.
    Climate change has a significant effect on nutrient transport in lakes, groundwater,
    forest-dominated watersheds, and tile drains where it can be engaged to the ten
    identified topics. However, the word “climate change” did not appear in any of
    the topic word clouds, highlighting that the probability of appearance for the
    climate change was not high in the identified topics. This research gap can be
    combined with the first gap where integrated models can be implemented to assess
    the effect of climate change on the nutrient transport in surface–subsurface water
    interactions. This knowledge gap was mentioned in multiple previous studies (Blöschl
    et al., 2019, Costa et al., 2021, Jayakody et al., 2014, Jeon et al., 2018, Xie
    et al., 2015), confirming the importance of evaluating the effect of climate change
    on nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater. In the third knowledge
    gap, land use, crop cover and crop management practices are considered as crucial
    factors on the nutrient transport process in surface water and groundwater. Similar
    to climate change, land use and crop management are highly related to the ten
    identified topics where their contribution to nutrient and sediment transport
    in lakes, forests and groundwater is remarkable. Also, their effect can be coupled
    with the climate change influence on the nutrient transport process using integrated
    mathematical models for simulating the overall system under different sources
    of stresses. This research gap is comparable with the main knowledge gaps that
    were stated in literature (Arnillas et al., 2021, Blöschl et al., 2019, Bosch
    et al., 2014, Lintern et al., 2020, Sharpley et al., 2015) where it was demonstrated
    that the land use, crop management practices, and crop cover are dominant parameters
    on the nutrient transport process in surface water and groundwater. Based on the
    results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the fourth research gap
    concerns the application of machine learning algorithms in the field of nutrient
    transport in surface and subsurface water interactions. The term “machine learning”
    did not appear in any of the identified topic word clouds, showing a significant
    research gap in the literature. This research gap is connected to most of the
    identified topics where machine learning algorithms can be implemented on any
    high-quality dataset. Machine learning techniques can be used to determine the
    interdependence of different parameters that are involved in the nutrient transport
    process. They can also deal with the uncertainty and non-linearity in the parameters
    such as soil properties. Moreover, they can illustrate the cause-result relationships
    between the different nutrient transport process parameters. Therefore, further
    studies are essential to develop and implement machine learning algorithms on
    nutrient transport-based datasets. In addition, multiple previous studies have
    highlighted the significance of machine learning models for better understanding
    of nutrient transport in surface and subsurface waters (Elsayed et al., 2023,
    Lintern et al., 2020, Shen, 2018, Shen et al., 2018), asserting that machine learning
    models represent an efficient and robust tool for simulating the transport process
    in a simple and accurate way. The fifth research gap is related to the description
    of the in-stream sediment transport in fluvial environments including rivers,
    streams, and creeks. Although soil and nutrient loss from watersheds and basins
    was well studied in the previous publications (as it was shown in section 4.6),
    the in-stream sediment and nutrient transport did not gain great attention in
    the literature. Also, there is a lack of linking the movement of sediments in
    streams and rivers with nutrients and contaminants. Moreover, the governing factors
    on the nutrient and sediment movement within channels are different and require
    further investigations. This knowledge gap is consistent with those stated in
    previous studies (Griffith and McManus, 2020, Hajigholizadeh et al., 2018, Jensen
    et al., 2018, Lintern et al., 2018) where the in-stream sediment and nutrient
    transport processes were not well-investigated in literature. It should be noted
    that the application of text mining techniques can assist in identifying the research
    gaps in the field of nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater within
    literature. These research gaps are recognized in the field of nutrient transport
    and known as “known unknowns” such as the importance of integrated models for
    surface water and groundwater interactions and application of machine learning
    algorithms in simulating the nutrient transport process in surface water and groundwater.
    On the other hand, text mining cannot determine the gaps that are not mentioned
    in the literature (i.e., less frequent) which can be called “unknown unknowns”.
    This point represents one of the major limitations of the application of text
    mining algorithms, developing a room for improvement by addressing the experience
    of researchers and scientists in the field of nutrient transport in surface and
    subsurface waters to conceptualize these unknowns. Also of note, the research
    gaps identified by text mining are highly related to the time window of the articles
    that were used in the application and training of text mining algorithms. During
    certain times and conditions, extensive research is performed more on specific
    topics because the public opinion and research agencies (e.g., federal, and provincial
    agencies) pay more attention to these topics. For example, starting from 2011,
    a lot of research was oriented towards investigating the negative influence of
    high phosphorus loss rate from agricultural fields on the health of the Great
    Lakes in North America, that caused high levels of eutrophication in Lake Erie
    (Jarvie et al., 2017, Matisoff et al., 2016, Scavia et al., 2016, Watson et al.,
    2016). This can stimulate many researchers to investigate the governing parameters
    on this phenomenon more frequently compared to previous time periods, enriching
    the literature with multiple publications about this topic and their remediation
    approaches during this time window. The partnership between the identified research
    gaps by text mining and the time window of the articles is one of the limitations
    in the application of text mining algorithms in the research fields. Therefore,
    in the current study, a wide range of publications was covered (i.e., from 1974
    to 2022) to confirm the feasibility of the identified knowledge gaps in the field
    of nutrient transport in surface water and groundwater. 5. Conclusions Some previous
    studies investigated and reviewed the nutrient transport in groundwater or surface
    water through typical literature review studies; however, there are no systematic
    review studies using meta-research based on the previous publications to determine
    the most frequent topics and main research gaps in the literature. Therefore,
    meta-research was applied on 516 previous publications using quantitative and
    qualitative analyses to extract the meaningful information from these publications.
    The quantitative analysis was performed using a text mining algorithm to identify
    the most common topics in the field of nutrient transport in surface and subsurface
    water. Based on the results of the algorithm, ten topics were identified as the
    main topics including nitrogen transport in groundwater; nitrogen transport in
    surface water; phosphorus transport in surface water; sediment transport in watersheds;
    nutrient loss in subsurface drainage; nutrient transport associated with lakes;
    nutrient transport in forest-dominated watersheds; modeling of nutrient transport;
    agricultural watershed management; and effect of soil-litter on nutrient transport.
    Then, these topics were quantitatively analyzed and reviewed to highlight the
    trends and insights such as the fundamental factors on nutrient transport process.
    Also, five knowledge gaps were determined from the literature according to the
    topic identification results by the text mining algorithm, including the development
    of integrated mathematical models for the surface water-groundwater interactions,
    assessment of the effect of climate change on the transport process, evaluation
    of the influence of crop management practices on nutrient transport, application
    of machine learning algorithms on nutrient transport datasets and understanding
    of the governing factors of in-stream sediment and nutrient transport in fluvial
    environments. The results of qualitative analysis can serve as a reference for
    the most frequent topics published in nutrient transport studies. The current
    study can also guide future research towards uncovering the main research gaps
    and opportunities, making a significant contribution to the field of nutrient
    transport in surface water and groundwater. Funding This work was supported by

  description: The adverse effects of climate change and climate variability are hindering
    agricultural productivity in developing countries. When combined with the laborious
    nature of irrigated agriculture, many smallholder farmers in these countries abandon
    irrigation systems or occasionally fail to implement an irrigation event due to
    other commitments. Therefore, this necessitates smart technology advances in agriculture
    to deal with irrigated agriculture problems of energy use efficiency, cost, water
    conservation, and drudgery. This study aimed at developing a mobile solar-powered
    control system for real-time scheduling using feedback from soil moisture sensors.
    A smart solar-powered irrigation control system (Smart Irri-Kit) was developed
    to schedule and automate water delivery to crops based on soil moisture levels.

    rights and content Under a Creative Commons license open access Abstract The adverse
    effects of climate change and climate variability are hindering agricultural productivity
    in developing countries. When combined with the laborious nature of irrigated
    agriculture, many smallholder farmers in these countries abandon irrigation systems
    or occasionally fail to implement an irrigation event due to other commitments.
    Therefore, this necessitates smart technology advances in agriculture to deal
    with irrigated agriculture problems of energy use efficiency, cost, water conservation,
    and drudgery. This study aimed at developing a mobile solar-powered control system
    for real-time scheduling using feedback from soil moisture sensors. A smart solar-powered
    irrigation control system (Smart Irri-Kit) was developed to schedule and automate
    water delivery to crops based on soil moisture levels. Itincorporates an automated
    tank water level control system that triggers pump activation during irrigation.
    The Kit was designed, fabricated, programmed, and field tested at Makerere University
    Agricultural Research Station Kabanyolo, using sandy clay loam soil. In this study,
    efficient irrigation scheduling and relay of soil moisture updates to the farmers
    were achieved. The Smart Irri-Kit soil moisture sensors were able to detect soil
    moisture with no significant difference from the gravimetric method. The development
    of the solar-powered Smart Irri-Kit presents a sustainable and automated solution
    for optimizing irrigation practices, contributing to water conservation and improved
    crop yield. The integration of solar power enhances its autonomy and reduces operational
    costs. Future research directions include the incorporation of weather parameters
    and advanced communication capabilities for remote monitoring and control. Overall,

    powered irrigation, Water use efficiency Introduction Agriculture is the backbone
    of most economies in developing countriessince it contributes significantly to
    the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and provides food on which human life depends
    [1]. Conversely, agriculture has been regarded as a wasteful water user sector
    as it abstracts 70% of the world''s freshwater resources to irrigate 25% of the
    world''s croplands [2]. Climate change and climate variability and the increasing
    population are putting enormous pressure on agriculture as the demand for food
    rises [3]. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs
    [4], the world population will hit 9.7 billion by 2050 translating into increased
    demand for nutritious food and water resources. The Food and Agricultural Organization
    (FAO) forecasts a more than 50% increase in irrigated food production by 2050,
    which will require a 10% increase in water abstracted for agriculture, provided
    water productivity improves [5]. The land on which food is cultivated does not
    expand, which means agricultural cropping systems need to utilize the available
    water and land resources efficiently to feed the future population. Understanding
    the mechanisms that can improve water use efficiency and result in significant
    water savings and higher yield is, therefore, paramount [6]. Irrigation plays
    a crucial role in modern agriculture, enabling farmers to supplement natural rainfall
    and ensure optimal water supply for crops [7]. With global population growth and
    increasing food demand, efficient irrigation practices have become essential for
    sustainable agriculture and food security [8,9]. However, traditional irrigation
    methods often suffer from inefficiencies and water wastage, leading to significant
    economic and environmental challenges [10], [11], [12]. One of the primary issues
    with conventional irrigation techniques, such as flood irrigation or manual watering,
    is their inability to deliver water precisely to the plants'' root zones. As a
    result, substantial amounts of water are lost due to evaporation, runoff, and
    deep percolation, leading to unnecessary water consumption and reduced water-use
    efficiency. Inefficient irrigation not only strains freshwater resources but also
    increases energy consumption and operational costs for farmers [13]. To address
    these challenges, smart irrigation control systems have emerged as a promising
    solution. These systems leverage advanced technologies and automation to optimize
    irrigation practices, reducing water usage while improving crop productivity [14],
    [15], [16]. By integrating sensors, actuators, and intelligent algorithms, smart
    irrigation control systems enable precise and timely water delivery based on the
    actual needs of crops. Sensor-based irrigation scheduling lies at the core of
    smart irrigation systems. Soil moisture sensors, for example, provide real-time
    measurements of soil moisture content, allowing farmers to accurately assess the
    water requirements of their crops [17]. This data is then used to determine when
    and how much water should be applied, ensuring that plants receive adequate moisture
    while minimizing water loss [18]. The benefits of smart irrigation systems are
    manifold. Firstly, they promote water conservation by eliminating wasteful practices
    and reducing overwatering. By delivering water directly to the root zones, smart
    irrigation minimizes evaporation and runoff, maximizing the utilization of available
    water resources. Secondly, these systems contribute to improved crop health and
    yield. By maintaining optimal soil moisture levels, plants can access the necessary
    nutrients and oxygen, reducing the risk of water stress and enhancing their ability
    to withstand drought conditions. Moreover, smart irrigation control systems offer
    convenience and labor savings for farmers. By automating the irrigation process,
    farmers can remotely monitor and control their irrigation systems, reducing the
    need for manual intervention [19]. This automation not only saves time and effort
    but also allows farmers to focus on other essential tasks, leading to increased
    operational efficiency [20]. Given the growing need for sustainable agriculture
    practices, the development of a solar-powered smart irrigation control system
    kit holds immense promise. By harnessing solar energy, this kit can operate autonomously,
    reducing dependence on conventional energy sources and minimizing operational
    costs for farmers. Furthermore, the integration of intelligent control algorithms
    ensures precise water delivery based on real-time soil moisture data, optimizing
    water usage and enhancing overall irrigation efficiency. Even though irrigation
    control strategies have been researched over recent years [21], [22], [23], [24],
    many are simulation-based and are not implemented on the farm. Existing irrigation
    control systems are open-loop time-based systems that do not send feedback on
    real-time moisture conditions for irrigation scheduling. As a result, there are
    few or no low-cost clean energy irrigation control systems in Sub-Saharan Africa
    to aid in irrigation scheduling decisions.This paper presents the design, development,
    and evaluation of a solar-powered smart irrigation control system kit, referred
    to as the Smart Irri-Kit. It provides detailed insights into the system components,
    methodology, results, and future directions, underscoring the potential impact
    of this innovative technology on the agricultural sector. The kit combines the
    advantages of solar power and intelligent irrigation scheduling to create an efficient
    and sustainable solution for agricultural irrigation. Materials and methods Design
    of the smart irrigation control system Kit The Smart Irri-Kit was designed and
    constructed taking into consideration the use of appropriate materials, ease of
    disassembling and reassembling, and ease of operation. The kit consists of hardware,
    electro ware, and software systems. Fig. 1 presents the conceptual design of the
    Smart Irri-Kit. Download : Download high-res image (523KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Conceptual design of the smart solar-powered irrigation
    control kit. Hardware system design The hardware system was designed using Solid
    Edge® ST9, a synchronous Technology software developed by Siemens Product Lifecycle
    Management (PLM).The system is a moveable framework housing the microcontroller
    unit and onto which soil moisture sensors, water-level sensors, the valve solenoid,
    and the pump are wired. This system is a combination of links, wheels, mild steel
    plates, and pipes that form the framework of the Smart Irri-Kit. The design considerations
    for the hardware system were: (i) Compactness. An all-in-one solution giving users
    ease of use. It was designed to carry the entire power supply system and the microcontroller
    unit. (ii) Lightweight but robust. A system offering a high strength-to-weight
    ratio. aluminum offers the best strength-to-weight ratio but provisions of variants
    of mild steel sections were made due to high upfront costs. (iii) Free rotation
    of the solar panels. Since the solar panels were to be freely tilted towards the
    direction of the sun, ball bearings and the hollow pipes were designed to allow
    for continuous rotations and a locking mechanism to lock them in the desired direction.
    (iv) Free movement. The height of the wheels was set at 25 cm above the ground
    to provide enough clearance for the uneven farm terrain. The microcontroller unit
    was to be housed in 2.5mm-thick water-proof acrylic material. Electro ware system
    design The electro ware system is the electrical circuitry that makes the Smart
    Irri-Kit interactive and triggers the water pump and solenoid valve on or off
    based on information received from the sonar ultrasonic sound water level sensors
    and the soil moisture sensors respectively. The electro ware system was designed
    to have the following features: (i) The circuit had to maintain a steady current
    flow into the pump, soil moisture sensors, solenoid valve, and the water-level
    sensors simultaneously even if normal operating conditions will only have a section
    of the sub-system running simultaneously; (ii) The components making up the circuit
    had to be strongly soldered onto the circuit board, but flexible enough to be
    replaced in case of need replacement; (iii) The battery should store enough power
    to run the entire system for the whole day and the solar panels should be able
    to recharge the battery in one day. The circuit was built around subtasks and
    each component was carefully positioned to match the expected exterior interface
    design and the appropriate IEEE standard configuration. The power for the Smart
    Irri-Kit is generated using photovoltaic cells of two 75Wp polycrystalline solar
    modules by photo-electric effect. This power is then stored in a deep-cycle 12
    V direct current (DC) sealed lead-acid battery. When operating the system during
    the day, the current from the solar panels is divided by Kirchhoff''s current
    law at the junction between the battery and the load. When the battery is close
    to full charge (14.1 V to 14.4 V) it offers slightly higher internal resistance
    than a discharged battery. As a result, the current automatically takes the less
    resistive path to power the load directly. Therefore, in some instances, the Smart
    Irri-Kit is fully powered by the sun. But when sudden solar power fluctuations
    occur due to cloud cover obstruction on solar irradiance, current flows from the
    battery to fill the void. Software system design Irri-code was written in C++,
    but the complex syntax was mostly shielded using simple Arduino libraries. The
    tasks that the Irri-Kit is intended to do are monitoring the battery level, and
    the water level in the tank, triggering a submersible tank refill pump when connected,
    monitoring soil moisture in real-time, triggering solenoid valve when need be,
    transmitting the soil moisture data via SMS and displaying processes on a monochromatic
    graphic display. The software subsystem is divided into the user interface, logic,
    and database. The user interface part This part of the software directly communicates
    to the operator. It receives specific input from the user and gives output to
    the user. The data entered into the system is helpful in computing irrigation
    duration and tank-refill duration. The inputs received from the user when setting
    the system are: 1) Name of the farmer and telephone number; 2) Location (District,
    Sub-county, Parish, Village); 3) Field area in square meters; 4) Overhead tank
    diameter in meters; 5) Emitter flow rate (qe, l/hr); 6) Emitter spacing (es, m);
    7) Spacing between the drip lines (ds, m); 8) Pump discharge in cubic meters per
    second; 9) Soil texture; 10) Crop type and characteristics (stages, rooting depth,
    kc); and 11) Crop planting date. The database part When data is entered into the
    system, it is combined with certain coefficients or constants before processing
    necessary output formulae. This subsystem stores fixed parameters that are used
    alongside user input by the Logic part to compute desired parameters. The parameters
    stored in the system''s memory include: (i) Soil depletion factor (p). (ii) Pi
    (3.14159265359). (iii) The moisture content at field capacity (θFC). (iv) The
    moisture content at wilting point (θWP). The logic part The logic part manipulates
    user input with database values to generate the desired output. It consists of
    the equations for irrigation scheduling and for tank-refill pump running time.
    The fundamental equations governing the manipulations are as follows: If the instantaneous
    soil moisture i >= FC do not irrigate and If i < FC irrigate. (1) Where SMD is
    the soil moisture deficit (mm), θFC is the volumetric moisture content at field
    capacity (%) and θi is the instantaneous volumetric moisture content (%) and Di
    is the instantaneous root zone depth (m) at the time of logging. (2) Where Id
    is irrigation duration (mins), SMD is the soil moisture deficit (mm), Pr is the
    application rate of the drip emitters (mm/hr), and Ei is the irrigation efficiency
    (fraction) The irrigation duration depends on the amount of water that has to
    be supplied and the capacity of the distribution system. (3) Where is the application
    rate of the drip emitters (mm/hr), is the dripper discharge (l/hr), is the emitter
    spacing (m) and is the drip line spacing (m). (4) Where is irrigation volume in
    (litres), Id is irrigation duration (mins), Pr is the application rate of the
    drip emitters (mm/hr), and is the field area (m2) (5) Where is the volume to be
    refilled (m3), is the tank surface area (m2), and is the depth from top to water
    surface (m) which is read by the water level sensor Tank surface area (AT) is
    a derived quantity from the user input diameter (d) of the tank. (6) The time
    it takes to refill the tank is also automatically computed from the formula below:
    (7) Operation of smart irri-kit The ATmega microcontrollers have an inbuilt time-keeping
    ability accessible via delay and millis functions. The internal clock oscillates
    at 16 MHz and on average functions take 100 kHz. The instruction set architecture
    of Reduced Instruction Set Computing - RISC is employed in the majority of mobile
    device processors because of its high efficiency at low power. This program was
    written in an object-oriented style of programming: breaking several tasks into
    classes and objects analogous to the natural environment. One class (tank) handles
    the water refill task, and the other class (irrigate) handles the irrigation operation.
    On startup, the program first automatically reads the time from a constructor
    in the tank class and instantiates objects that call functions in the tank class
    to check whether the water level is sufficient to run an intensive irrigation
    operation. When low, the program triggers the pump''s transistor-transistor combination
    for a DC pump or a transistor-relay combination of a high voltage (220–240 V)
    ac (alternating current) pump. Remember the system is meant to be universally
    applicable with the capacity to operate either solar or electric pumps. After
    filling the tank, this class is again cycled through to confirm the tank water
    level. The program then moves on to instantiate functions on the irrigate class.
    The first function (sensor checker) is a Boolean function that checks whether
    all the soil moisture sensors are plugged in (Fig. 2). If false, it calls the
    alarm function to trigger a beep and keeps calling itself recursively in intervals
    of 50 milliseconds. If true, it returns 0 and the program moves on to the next
    function. The next function sensor read is a float-type function that takes in
    floating point values of real-time soil moisture as arguments in place of parameters.
    It is the only function that takes in parameters so far. This function reads raw
    data from the soil and converts them into volumetric moisture content values (in
    percentages) and returns these percentage values to any calling function. The
    program moves on to the irrigation function which houses all the irrigation formulae,
    but with one external parameter-current time. The formulae use values previously
    stored in the parameters of the sensor read function to compute the required discharge.
    When there is a deficiency and the time from the last irrigation operation is
    at least 6 h irrigation takes place, otherwise, the function returns 0 and the
    program moves on to the next function. The final class is the data logger function
    which registers soil moisture content of the soil once every 15 min. This is an
    average of all soil moisture values stored in an array several times every minute.
    Errors are handled and thrown into the microcontroller''s static memory and all
    operations are output to the screen every step. Download : Download high-res image

    unit. Performance testing of the smart irrigation control system System functionality
    testing Test running for structural compliance The Smart Irri Kit was tested for
    the following structural features: (i) Mechanical strength to withstand a fall
    without getting dismembered. (ii) Maneuverability. The ability of the wheels to
    overcome common obstacles during motion. (iii) The strength of the solar panels
    mount to resist the impact of winds; (iv) The flexibility of the solar mount to
    be freely adjusted to manually track the direction of the maximum sun''s irradiance.
    Test running for operational compliance Test-running was conducted to assess the
    soil sensor probe''s trigger points and valves for auto-opening and auto-closing.
    The system was tested by burying the soil moisture sensor in the soil to track
    moisture levels. When soil moisture levels drop below the critical level, the
    tank''s valve relays were triggered to allow water to flow to the soil for the
    automatically calculated irrigation duration. In addition, the system was tested
    for triggering the pump to deliver water to the tank once the level dropped to
    less than 80% of the water level sensor in the tank. The Smart Irri-Kit was tested
    for the following operational features: (1) Detecting changes in soil moisture;
    (2) Mathematically quantify the soil moisture; (3) Detecting level changes in
    the water tank. The tank level sensor was validated by comparing the readings
    measured manually using a tape measure and those displayed by the kit screen.
    (4) Mathematically quantify tank level changes; (5) Running a water refill pump
    when the quantified level is below a certain critical value; (6) Triggering irrigation
    when the quantified readings go below a certain threshold and the tank water level
    is above a certain critical amount; (7) Keeping time; (8) Logging soil, field,
    tank, and irrigation data internally every day at 6:00 pm; (9) Compiling and transmitting
    a daily activity report to a specific recipient via a local network; (10) Displaying
    all the above processes, in a simple user-understandable format on a screen. Calibration
    of smart irri-kit sensors Soil moisture sensors In this study, a resistive-based
    soil moisture sensor interfaced with Arduino Mega was used. It has a detection
    length of 38 mm and a working voltage of 2V-5 V. It has a fork-like design, which
    makes it easy to insert into the soil. The analog output voltage boosts along
    with the soil moisture level increases. The soil moisture sensors were placed
    at the rooting depth of 15–30 cm. The two probes allow the current to pass through
    the soil, which gives the resistance value to measure the moisture value. When
    there is water, the soil will conduct more electricity, which means that there
    will be less resistance. Dry soil conducts electricity poorly, so when there is
    less water, then the soil will conduct less electricity, which means that there
    will be more resistance. Calibration of the soil moisture sensors Soil-specific
    calibration was conducted because the sensors are not factory calibrated. Soil
    moisture percentages were logged to obtain curves relating moisture percentages
    to voltages provided by the sensors. The calibration procedure was as follows:
    (i) Several standard soil moisture sampling measurements were performed to provide
    an accurate source of ground truth data. (ii) The soil sample was prepared by
    using the air-drying method (iii) Progressively, a known amount of distilled water
    was added to the soil sample. (iv) The wet soil sample was mixed tightly in a
    separate container to ensure the uniform distribution of water. (v) Moisture measurements
    were taken, and output voltages were recorded. (vi) Gravimetric water content
    was determined by oven drying (105 °C, 24 h) of the soils after measurements with
    the sensor were completed [25]. (vii) By using Microsoft Excel, the results of
    the calibration experiments were utilized to develop best-fit curves and equations
    using linear regression trend lines. System validation After applying the corresponding
    moisture functions obtained by the calibration experiment to the microcontroller,
    an evaluation experiment was implemented for one month. The experiment consists
    of soil moisture sensors buried in the same soil type used in calibration experiments.
    Soil moisture percentages displayed by the sensors were recorded daily. Also,
    Gravimetric water content was determined by oven drying (105 °C, 24 h) to validate
    the sensor results. At the end of the experiment, a comparison was made between
    the values measured by the sensors and values obtained from weight measurements.
    Statistical analysis using a two-tailed t-test was conducted to analyze the difference
    between the gravimetric readings and the readings from the Smart Irri-Kit. Results
    Design results The Smart Irri-Kit was designed with a 650 × 1850 mm frame with
    drive wheels for easy mobility (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Solar panels of 150 W are mounted
    at the top inclined at an angle of 45° to tap the sun''s energy for powering the
    Smart Irri-Kit. The base is made of a 1.2 mm mild steel plate to provide a carriage
    for the battery and provide stability to the kit. The circuit (Fig. 5) was designed
    to handle the entire load''s power demand for at least all the sunshine hours.
    The circuit should maintain a steady current flow into the pump, soil moisture
    sensors, solenoid valve, and the water-level sensors simultaneously for 8 h even
    if normal operating conditions will only have a section of the sub-system running
    simultaneously. The components making up the circuit are strongly soldered onto
    the circuit board, but flexible enough to be replaced in case of need replacement.
    The components such as transistors should not loosen when the kit bumps on stones,
    but when one of them has been burnt by a high current surge, it should be relatively
    easy for a technician to replace the same rating component. The 150AH deep cycle
    should store enough power to run the entire system for the whole day and the 150Wp
    solar modules should be able to recharge the battery in one day. Normal operating
    conditions should therefore feature less than 50% of the battery''s 1.8 kWh cycle
    (0.5 × 12 V X 150AH) used up throughout the day to be sure that even in cloudy
    conditions, the 150Wp panels pumping in less than half 8 As every hour can recharge
    to full capacity. Download : Download high-res image (244KB) Download : Download

    A demonstration unit under Broccoli on a 100 m2 drip irrigation system was established
    at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute, Kabanyolo (MUARIK) for
    conducting system functionality testing for the smart solar irrigation control
    system kit (Fig. 6). The soil was characterized at 0–30 cm as sandy clay loam
    with a bulk density of 1.34 g/ cm³. Field capacity and wilting points were 0.30
    and 0.21 cm³ water/cm³ soil. Download : Download high-res image (857KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Layout of Smart Irri-Kit at MUARIK. The following
    observations showed that the system complied with structural compliance. (i) The
    kit was made to be fully dismountable. The system, though not lined with shock
    absorbers, is strong enough to overcome internal shear forces and external impact
    forces common when moving it from place to place. (ii) The kit was found to be
    raised 25 cm above the ground, which is sufficient clearance to maneuver over
    common stones and lumps of soil in and around paths to a garden. (iii) The kit
    was found to have a mechanically strong but flexible solar panel mount. Made of
    a double-axis system, it would manually be rotated in two planes to track and
    precisely position the solar panels as required. Made of 5 mm thick steel at the
    base, it would resist bending moments because of the wind load or center of gravity
    shifts. (iv) The kit was found to be resistant to wind loads but susceptible to
    sun heat. The battery''s performance degrades as the temperature increases. And
    the control system''s display screen deteriorates under direct sunlight since
    it is made of Liquid Crystals (reactive to ultraviolet light and heat). According
    to the following observations, the system complied with operational compliance.
    (i) The kit successfully detected changes in soil moisture. The probes however
    were of material that chemically reacts with reagents in the soil to eventually
    eat away the conducting material. (ii) The kit successfully detected changes in
    the overhead water tank. It did this via an ultrasonic sensor which would emit
    a sound wave and receive it, using the wave propagation/reflection time lag to
    estimate the distance and therefore the depth of the water surface. Over time,
    however, this position placed it in the way of condensing water vapor evaporating
    from the water surface beneath. The electronics driving this transducer as well
    as its transmitter and receiver “windows” are not efficient in steamy environments
    and high operating temperatures. Vaporous environments create a constantly shifting
    atmospheric density, which affects the speed of sound, attenuating the signal
    and reducing the accuracy of the readings. (iii) The kit successfully switched
    ON a water refill pump when water was critically low and turned it OFF when the
    water was slightly above 90%. Since the ultrasonic sensor algorithm has an inherent
    delay (to give enough time to read the reflected beam), the turn-off time was
    not placed at 100% to prevent the risk of overflow. (iv) The kit successfully
    triggered the valve when a certain reading received from the soil moisture sensors
    had reached a certain minimum and powered it off when the reading reached a certain
    maximum. The solenoid valve was slightly exposed, but efforts were made to insulate
    its terminals to prevent short circuits such as when it has rained and wetted.
    (v) The kit successfully kept time accurate to every second even when running
    a very resource-intensive code (occupying nearly 5 KB of the At Mega 2560′s 8kB
    dynamic memory even after heavy trimming). However, when compiling data from the
    internal storage to transmit, when data is abundant, the process unfortunately
    uses valuable seconds. (vi) The kit successfully logged several parameters of
    useful data every 24 h - once every day at 6:00 pm in different files. The settings
    file stores static parameters such as emitter spacing and periodically receive
    any updates in changed system configurations. The crop file receives daily changes
    in the planted crop parameters. The data Log file receives all activities about
    irrigation, soil moisture, and tank level. (vii) The kit would in some instances
    compile and transmit the daily activity report and in others would not. Research
    is carried on intensively to find out why to fix the issue ASAP. Possible areas
    are the missing voltage dropper resister to match the logic level of the ATmega
    2560 chip to that of the GSM 800l cellular modem, damaged GSM modem, Airtime,
    and Power irregularities, and low signal strengths. (viii) The kit successfully
    displayed all processes and prompts on the 128 × 64 pixel display 3-inch screen.
    Related commands and settings were bundled into menu options and navigated through
    using self-explanatory pushbuttons positioned adjacent to the screen. Much as
    the visual component (user interface) of the kit is very resource-intensive to
    the microcontroller both physically (taking up over 30 pins) and logically (taking
    up over 1kB), efforts were made to programmatically use fewer memory-consuming
    variables and limit intensive iterations all to save valuable time. Every second
    counts. Calibration of smart irri-kit results The system calibration results from
    the gravimetric method moisture values are shown in Table 1. Fig. 7 shows that
    resistance across the soil moisture probes reduces until the soil''s field capacity
    when the resistance remains constant. This means that the soil can no longer hold
    more water and leaching starts to take place beyond this point. Table 1. System

    The results of the two-tailed t-test give a p-value of 0.2609, which is greater
    than the significance level of 0.05. This implies that there is no significant
    difference between the readings from the kit and those measured through the gravimetric
    method. From Fig. 9, the results indicated that the system was able to sense soil
    moisture variation, quantify the moisture deficit, and supply the deficit over
    a specified period. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. System evaluation curve showing moisture variations before
    and after irrigation. Discussions The Smart Irri-Kit conforms to design specifications
    for irrigation control systems. The system was tested to be technically feasible
    and able to schedule irrigation and alert the user of the major control decisions.
    The soil moisture sensors calibration results indicate the accurate determination
    of the root zone soil moisture conditions. The major limitation encountered in
    the deployment of Smart Irri-Kit was the corrosion of the resistivity-based soil
    moisture sensors. Due to field tests, the sensors were not permanently deployed
    at a single root zone depth which increased the rate of corrosion due to exposure
    to atmospheric conditions. However, the results of the soil moisture sensor validation
    experiment revealed that the examined sensors are prone to sources of error. Sensitivity
    to electrolytic corrosion was observed as the primary source of error. The evaluation
    experiment showed that temperature is an additional source of error for this type
    of sensor. The resistance of materials varies with temperature. Warming up the
    surface soil layer due to sunlight resulted in several moisture readings lower
    than the actual moisture. The integration of a soil temperature sensor is recommended
    to handle this problem. However, this addition will lead to an increase in cost
    and sensor complexity. All these limitations affect the usability of such sensors
    in precise irrigation control systems for an extended period or under varying
    conditions. The Smart Irri-Kit is suitable for farming communities facing challenges
    with conventional drip irrigation kits with manual or time-based control. Smart
    Irri-kit irrigation decisions are closed-loop in nature since soil moisture sensor
    feedback is fed back into the algorithm to determine the next irrigation schedule.
    Future research involves deploying the Smart Irri-Kit in various agro-climatic
    zones for real-time irrigation scheduling decisions. Improvements to the sensor
    technology and computing power enable data-driven irrigation scheduling on various
    horticultural crops. Additionally, an evaluation of the Smart Irri-Kit against
    conventional drip irrigation scheduling methods will be conducted at the research
    station. Conclusion The smart irrigation control system kit is a low-cost green
    technology that enhances precise irrigation water application and creates time
    for users that can be used on other productive activities. The kit notifies the
    farmer of the soil moisture status and therefore has a track of what is happening
    on the farm without necessitating physical presence. This system has the potential
    of revolutionizing small-holder agriculture making it attractive to the young
    generation but also to potential farmers who may not be full-time at the farm.
    The Smart Irri-Kit features a solar-powered system that powers a water pump and
    a microcontroller unit all mounted onto a movable framework. The sensors are placed
    in the field and transmit their soil moisture readings via a wired universal serial
    bus (USB) communication channel to the microcontroller in realtime. The microcontroller
    connects the water pump, the tank''s water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors,
    and a solenoid valve on the water tank outlet. The metering of water is through
    the solenoid valve that is triggered by the Arduino microcontroller programmed
    using irrigation algorithms. The kit sends data to the end user via mobile phone
    and logs data on soil moisture and irrigation events and duration. These features
    make Smart Irri-Kit a one-stop solution for smallholder farmers giving the farmer
    flexibility to convert the solar system into a charging mechanism or lighting
    given the mobility of the kit. The plug-and-play nature of the kit makes it adaptable
    to most existing irrigation systems enabling smart and real-time irrigation scheduling
    decisions. The kit is portable, user-friendly, utilize freely available solar
    energy, is easily adaptable to any existing irrigation system, and is environmentally
    friendly. The system is tailored to any type of crop being grown in any soil type.
    Based on the obtained results, the system can schedule irrigation. However, the
    resistivity-based soil moisture sensor used has limitations for continuous monitoring
    under different environmental soil conditions. Future research will involve improving
    the soil moisture sensors and evaluating the irrigation control system against
    conventional irrigation scheduling approaches. Data availability and supplementary

  description: In the face of increasing water scarcity and uncertainties of climate
    change, improving crop water use efficiency and productivity, while minimizing
    negative environmental impacts, is becoming crucial to meet the surging global
    food demand. Smart irrigation has a potential of improving water use efficiency
    in precision agriculture especially when efficient irrigation control strategies
    are adopted. Conventionally, irrigation systems rely on heuristic methods to schedule
    irrigation which either leads to over-irrigation or under-irrigation. This influences
    the crop physiological characteristics as well as the water use efficiency. To
    tackle this menace, model-based irrigation management has been overemphasized.
    A closed-loop irrigation control strategy relies on a mathematical model of the
    system for irrigation scheduling decisions. In this study, a data-driven approach
    was used to learn soil moisture dynamics from a drip irrigated tomato in an open
    field agricultural system. A total number of 9674 data samples were collected
    using an ATMOS41 weather station, TERROS 12 soil moisture sensor and a YFS-201
    flow sensor for crop evapotranspiration and precipitation, soil moisture and irrigation
    volumes respectively. Data driven modelling was then performed using the system
    identification toolbox in a MATLAB environment. The model formulation was a multi-input
    single-output (MISO) system with reference evapotranspiration, irrigation and
    rainfall as inputs and soil moisture as the output. Different model structures
    including transfer functions, state space models, polynomial models and ARX models
    were evaluated. Model performance was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE),
    final prediction error (FPE) and estimated fit of the model approaches. Simulation
    results indicate that the soil moisture dynamics model provides a satisfactory
    approximation of the process dynamics with a state space model giving an estimated
    fit of 97.04 %, MSE and FPE of 1.74×10−7 and 1.75×10−7 respectively. This model
    will be used to design a model predictive controller for smart irrigation scheduling
    in open field environmental conditions.

    scarcity at a global scale is increasing, making it perplexing to achieve sustainable
    agricultural production [1], [2], [3]. Agricultural water scarcity is projected
    to increase in more than 80 % of the world''s countries by the year 2050 [4].
    This coupled with the increasing population, climate change impacts and competition
    from other sectors, puts food security at stake [5]. Irrigated agriculture is
    one of the major water users accounting for about 70 % of freshwater withdraws
    [6],[7]. Irrigation accounts for 40 % of the world''s food and fibre production
    and will therefore play a crucial role in feeding the 9.7 billion people by 2050
    [8],[9]. Water withdrawal for irrigation is projected to hit 29000 km3 by 2050
    with most of the high demand in developing countries translating into 20 million
    hectares under irrigation [10]. The need to enhance water use efficiency has never
    been over emphasized throughout the research community and industry as it is presently.
    Enhancing water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture necessitates effective
    use of available water resources to respond to real-time crop irrigation requirements.
    This requires monitoring water use and controlling how the irrigation water is
    applied. The goal of monitoring the crop environment in real-time is to control
    the root zone soil moisture between specific thresholds; field capacity and permanent
    wilting point [11]. On the other hand, irrigation control deals with applying
    what will keep the soil moisture between that threshold at the set time with precision.
    Emerging technologies, such as wireless communications, remote sensing, machine
    learning, crop physiology and soil environment monitoring systems, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and big data, have expounded the scope of irrigation monitoring
    and control [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. These technologies facilitate the generation
    of large amounts of data which when processed and analyzed can be utilized for
    predictions. This has given rise to the paradigm shift from open loop irrigation
    control to model-based irrigation management [17,18]. In model-based irrigation
    management, data from soil, weather and plant makes an integral part of the predictive
    control strategy to improve crop water use efficiency while minimizing negative
    environmental consequences [19], [20], [21], [22]. Over the years, the soil agro-hydrological
    model has been utilized to depict the soil moisture dynamics in the rootzone [23]
    as a basis for model based irrigation scheduling. The model characterizes the
    hydrological cycle between the soil, the atmosphere, and the crop [24]. Modelling
    soil moisture dynamics is very critical in irrigation automation. Unlike conventional
    irrigation systems that rely on open-loop irrigation strategies, closed-loop irrigation
    control for smart irrigation uses a plant model and the system''s current state
    to predict future irrigation amounts [25], [26], [27]. Nonetheless, these models
    have been developed for controlled environment agricultural systems especially
    in developed countries like USA, China and Australia. About, 95 % of food consumed
    in developing countries is from open field agricultural systems where most of
    the water losses occur. Therefore, developing models on which irrigation scheduling
    decisions can be based in open field agriculture is of significant importance.
    Several researchers have modelled soil moisture dynamics in an attempt to improve
    irrigation scheduling. For example, Saleem et al. [28] and Lozoya et al. [29]
    developed a soil moisture dynamics model for closed-loop irrigation The authors
    assumed negligible precipitation and ignored the crop coefficient in the evapotranspiration
    model. The drawback then becomes its suitability in different agroclimatic zones
    where supplementary irrigation is necessary. Additionally, crops need different
    volumes of water per growth stage. Similarly, Mao et al. [30] used the agro-hydrological
    model to predict the future states of an agricultural system. The authors, however,
    rely on historical data for irrigation scheduling. This means real-time plant
    water needs are dependent on past data instead of real-time soil, weather, and
    plant system parameters. Recently, Abioye et al. [31] developed an Internet of
    Things (IoT) and data-driven modelling to model soil moisture dynamics in a controlled
    environment agricultural system. The authors developed a multi-input single-output
    (MISO) system with evapotranspiration and irrigation volumes as inputs and soil
    moisture as the output. Open field agricultural systems, however, depict a more
    dynamic nature of soil moisture with many factors contributing to changes in soil
    moisture compared to controlled environment agricultural systems. There is considerably
    a small body of studies that modelled soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems using data-driven approaches. This is partly attributed to the costly
    monitoring equipment required to provide the data for all the parameters in the
    water balance equation. The major objective of this study is to therefore develop
    a soil moisture dynamics model in an open field agricultural system to aid model-based
    irrigation management for enhancement of water use efficiency in arid and semi-arid
    regions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The experiment was conducted
    at the University for Development Studies, Nyankpala campus at WACWISA experimental
    site located at 90 24’ 37” N and 00 58’53” E of the Equator as shown in Fig. 1.
    A drip irrigation experiment was designed on a 20*18m plot under tomato production
    spaced at 0.5m. The drip irrigation system consisted of 20mm HDPE laterals with
    online emitters with a flow rate of 2.1litres per hour. The experimental data
    was collected from September 21st to November 26, 2022, resulting in 9674 data
    sets for developing the soil moisture dynamics model collected in 10-mibute time-steps.

    model describes the soil moisture dynamics in an open field agricultural system.
    The agro-hydrologic balance model states that changes in rootzone soil moisture
    at a particular point in time is due to water inflows including rainfall, capillary
    rise, irrigation less the water outflows, deep percolation, water runoff and evapotranspiration
    as depicted in Fig. 3 [27]. The agro-hydrological model can be mathematically
    expressed as in Eq. (1) [28,32]. (1) Download : Download high-res image (151KB)

    , , , , , and In most agricultural fields the lateral water inflow is negligible,
    or the total effect is always zero. Likewise, the capillary rise contribution
    in soils with a deep-water table is zero. The runoff in a well-designed smart
    irrigation system is taken as zero, and thus the change in rootzone soil moisture
    becomes as shown in Eq. (2). (2) 2.2.1. Evapotranspiration The crop evapotranspiration
    then is a product of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient as
    depicted in Eq. (3) [33]. Allen et al. [33] defines the crop evapotranspiration
    under standard conditions, denoted as ETC, as the evapotranspiration from disease-free,
    well-fertilized crops, grown in large fields, under optimum soil water conditions,
    and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions. The FAO Penman
    Monteith model for reference evapotranspiration was adopted for this study. (3)
    Where; ETc is the crop evapotranspiration(mmday−1), ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration(mmday−1)
    and Kc is the crop factor which depends on the growth stage of the plant. (4)
    Where; is Reference evapotranspiration (mmday−1), is the slope vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), is net radiation at the crop surface (MJm−2day−1), is Soil heat
    flux density (MJm−2day−1), is Psychometric constant (kPa °C−1), is Air temperature
    (°C), is Wind speed (ms−1), is Saturation vapour pressure (kpa), is Actual vapour
    pressure (kpa) An ATMOS 41 weather station was used to monitor the plant environment
    in real-time and the data was sent to a wireless Zentrac data logger and stored
    in the cloud. The automated weather station gives solar radiation, air temperature,
    vapour pressure, vapour pressure deficit, precipitation, and wind speed among
    other parameters. Net radiation at the crop surface Rn, Soil heat flux density
    G, slope vapour pressure curve and psychometric constant were derived from measured
    parameters using procedures described in Allen et al. [33]. Weather data used
    in the calculation of reference evapotranspiration was collected at 10-minute
    intervals and stored on the Zetracloud. Using the FAO Penman Monteith Equation,
    a 10-minute reference evapotranspiration was determined for the 9674 samples.
    2.2.2. Soil Moisture Soil moisture measurements were conducted by using a Terros
    12 volumetric water content sensor from meter group. The sensor was located at
    a depth of 30 cm in order to measure the soil moisture at the effective rootzone
    depth of tomato crop. The crop grows over a sandy loam type of soil with a field
    capacity and permanent wilting point of 24.5 and 12.6, respectively and an infiltration
    rate of 12 l/h. 2.2.3. Irrigation Similarly, in order to estimate the irrigation
    volume, the IoT based flowmeter produces a digital output pulse which has been
    counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the water flow rate during irrigation.
    The water flowrate is calibrated in Eq. (5) and flow volume in Eq. (6). (5) (6)
    2.3. Model Structure 2.3.1. Transfer functions For a dynamical system that does
    not change over time, the transfer function provides a useful representation.
    [34]. Inspection or basic algebraic manipulations of the differential equations
    that characterize the systems can yield the transfer function. Even infinite-dimensional
    systems driven by partial differential equations may be understood with the help
    of transfer functions. Experiments on a system can be used to establish its transfer
    function. Eq. 7 depicts the mathematical formulation of a transfer function [35].
    (7) Where are matrices 2.3.2. The Box Jenkins Model The Box Jenkins model uses
    a rational polynomial function to give totally separate parameterization for the
    dynamics and noise. Eqs. 8a and b represent the Box Jenkins model [36]. (8a) Where
    (8b) Water content in volume at time t is denoted by y(t), input variables are
    denoted by u(t), and estimate error is denoted by e(t). A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x),
    and F(x) are the polynomials that determine the model''s output, inputs, and estimate
    errors, respectively. 2.3.3. The State Space Model In statistics, a state-space
    model is a kind of probabilistic graphical model that graphically expresses the
    probabilistic dependency between a latent state variable and an observed measurement.
    [37]. It represents the dynamics of an Nth order system as a first-order differential
    equation in an N-vector, which is called the state [38]. The important attribute
    of the state vector x(t) in the state space formulation is that it entirely specifies
    the system at a time t [39]. Future states are determined solely by the current
    state, x(t), and any inputs, u(t), at time t and beyond. The current state x(t)
    summarizes all previous states and the full input history; it thus encompasses
    all of the system''s memory. Eqs. 9a and 9b can be used to represent state space
    models. (9a) (9b) Where, is the state vector at time n, u is a vector of inputs,
    A is an state transition matrix, B is an input coeffient matrix, is a column vector
    of the output variables , is an matrix of the constant-coefficient that weight
    of state variables and is an m x n matrix of the constant-coefficient weight of
    the system inputs. 2.3.4. The Output Error Model When only white measurement noise
    is affecting the process output, the Output Error model structure is used as represented
    in Eqs. 10a and b [40]. (10a) This model can be expressed as (10b) 2.3.5. The
    Autoregressive with External Input Model (ARX) Model The ARX model is derived
    from Eq. 11 [41]. (11) Where and . These are polynomial matrices; d is the delay
    of the system. The ARX model is therefore simplified using equation 12 as shown.
    (12) 2.3.6. The Autoregressive Moving Average with Extra Input Model This autoregressive
    moving average with external input model (ARMAX) is in broader structure compared
    to the ARX as shown in Eq. 13. (13) Where . This is a polynomial where the noise
    term is explicitly modelled and expressed as shown in Eq. 14. (14) 2.4. System
    Identification in MATLAB Environment System identification toolbox in MATLAB was
    used to model the soil moisture dynamics starting with a lower order, increasing
    and decreasing the order of the polynomial and the variable delay. Fig. 4 shows
    the interface of the system identification toolbox where various model structures
    were used. A total of 9674 samples collected at 600s time steps were used in the
    modelling with 70 % of the data as estimation and 30 % as validation data. Additionally,
    pre-processing of the experimental data was performed to get rid of the trends,
    outliers, and means. as suggested by [42]. Download : Download high-res image

    toolbox. 2.5. Model Evaluation With the help of the lowest order of the system''s
    dynamics, the models constructed inside the MATLAB system identification toolbox
    are able to predict the behaviour of the system''s output and graphically represent
    the relationship between the system''s input and output variables [31]. Best fit,
    final prediction error (FPE), and mean square error (MSE) are three statistical
    measures that may be used to evaluate the efficacy of the developed models [31].
    2.5.1. Final Prediction Error Model quality is quantified by the absolute value
    of the prediction error obtained during validation on an independent data set.
    According to Abdul-Rahim et al. [43] the accuracy of the derived model is dependent
    on how small the FPE is. This is expressed in Eq. 15. (15) Where; Estimation data
    is denoted by N, and the associated prediction errors are represented by e(t),
    a vector of dimensions (n, -1). The estimated parameters are denoted by , while
    the total number of parameters is denoted by d 2.5.2. Mean Square Error The mean
    square error (MSE) is a statistical metric used to evaluate prediction quality
    in the same unit of the variable. The MSE score is near to zero, indicating that
    the model prediction is correct. The MSE is defined by Eq. 16: (16) Where; are
    observed and predicted values at time (i = 1,2,3,…n) and n is the data point.
    2.5.3. Estimated Fit The estimated fit (%) is a measure of the correlation between
    the measured output and the predicted output . This is computed as shown in Eq.
    17. (17) 3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Daily and Solar Radiation Fig. 5 presents
    the relationship between reference evapotranspiration , and Solar Radiation Rs,
    during the experimental data collection. It is observed that peak solar radiation
    received in the afternoon which translates into peak values of . The maximum recorded
    during the study period is 4.8 mmday−1 while the maximum solar radiation was 1357.9

    period. 3.2. Reference evapotranspiration, water content and precipitation The
    soil moisture content at the start of the experiment was 0.34 m3/m3 as depicted
    in Fig. 6. During this time precipitation values were high given that the rainy
    season was coming to an end. As the precipitation reduced, the soil moisture content
    reduced to field capacity where it was being maintained through irrigation. The
    dynamics may be seen altering because of plant water absorption and environmental
    (weather) effects that induce water loss from the soil, resulting in a changing
    variation in the volumetric water content. As evapotranspiration causes water
    loss, the volumetric water content of the soil changes, indicating that more or
    less water is required to be provided for irrigation. As a result, these variables
    have a direct influence on the amount of water applied to the plant. Download

    period. 3.3. Statistical Performance of the Models From the system identification
    simulation results in MATLAB presented in Table 1, it is evident that state space
    model performed better than other model structures (Transfer Functions, ARMAX,
    Box Jenkins, ARX and Output Error model). The state space mode yielded an estimated
    fit of 97.04 % being the highest amongst all the model structures evaluated. Additionally,
    in terms of the mean square error and final prediction error, the state space
    model performed better with the least values of the statistical criterion. The
    Output Error model on the other hand performed poorly amongst all the model structures.
    It could not mimic the soil moisture dynamics in the field and hence was not chosen
    for a model predictive controller design. The step ahead prediction results presented
    in Table 2 also support the state space model''s ability to represent the dynamic
    nature of the soil-water agricultural system. With a 5-steo ahead prediction it
    gives an estimated fit of 98.92 % making it the best choice for MPC design. The
    chosen model estimated the parameters as shown in Eqs. 15 and 17 in discrete-time
    state space model. Fig. 7 shows the 5-step ahead prediction of the system. Table

    the step response of the model structures evaluated in the MATLAB environment.
    The model structures are graded using the lowest order of the dynamic response.
    The first-order models'' output was found to be steady, with no overshoot or undershoot
    but a sluggish response time. There is no lag and a faster rising time compared
    to other models, even the Box Jenkins model with an offset. The frequency response
    curve, shown in Fig. 9, reveals that the dynamics of all model structures are
    identical over a wide range of frequencies. The purpose of this data-driven modelling
    was to create the forecasting models integral to creating a model-based controller
    for the physical system. The results show that despite the nonlinearity of the
    inputs, the output is quite steady. Despite experimental validation, the prediction
    model created in this study has some margin of error. Download : Download high-res

    Curve. The step and frequency response of the models can provide valuable information
    for practical agricultural purposes. For example, the step response can help to
    understand how quickly the system responds to changes in input (e.g., irrigation)
    and to identify any delays or oscillations in the response. The frequency response
    can help to identify the natural frequencies of the system and to design controllers
    that can regulate the system at different frequencies. 4. Conclusion Improving
    water use efficiency in precision agriculture is of paramount importance. Model-based
    irrigation management is one of the approaches through which irrigation scheduling
    can be responsive in real time especially for open field agricultural systems.
    This study demonstrates a data-driven approach where data from monitoring sensors
    in a drip irrigated tomato experiment is used to develop a soil moisture dynamics
    model using system identification. The resulting model is a state space model
    for great performance in terms of statistical evaluation criteria. In comparison
    to other model structures, it gives an estimation of fit of 97.04%, mean square
    error of 1.74 × 10−7 and final prediction error of 1.75 × 10−7. Future research
    will involve utilizing the state space model to develop a model predictive controller
    which will later be deployed on a micro-controller in an open field agricultural
    system. Funding Information The Institute de Recherché pour le Development (IRD),

  description: To tackle the globally increasing discrepancy between food, energy
    and water demands and resource availability sustainably, resource supply system
    models have to incorporate the inter-dependencies and -connectivities to other
    supply systems. This leads naturally to a food–energy–water nexus (FEWN) approach.
    The FEWN can be interpreted as the study of the connections between the food,
    energy and water resource systems, emphasizing how decision-making influences
    the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs among the various sectors. In recent years,
    modeling and optimization of FEWN systems has been receiving an increasing interest
    in the open literature, however, with limited emphasis on how decisions of the
    FEWN are derived. In this review, FEWN optimization studies are analyzed with
    focus on the employed objectives, optimization and solution strategies, as well
    as the selected sub-systems and their corresponding spatial and temporal scales
    to uncover in detail how decision-making is facilitated. More specifically, FEWN
    optimization studies are classified according to their modeling and solution strategies.
    Based on this classification it is uncovered that (i) the decision-making itself
    has not yet been investigated in detail in FEWN literature, (ii) the incorporation
    of all aspects of the FEWN is still a challenge, (iii) the interconnection between
    FEWN systems and society has to be further investigated, and (iv) the implications
    of uncertainty for the resiliency, robustness and security of process systems
    is not yet well defined. Additionally, a generic FEWN resource-task network formulation
    is introduced to illustrate the similarities across the various resource supply
    sectors. Special interest is placed on how synergies are identified and competition
    be avoided among resource systems. It is shown that the selected spatial scale
    as well as the utilized modeling and optimization strategies significantly influence
    the synergy level of obtained solutions. Furthermore, it is derived that the energy
    transition has to incorporate FEWN systems thinking for sustainable solution generation.
    Overall, this review summarizes the different applications and implications of
    process systems engineering concepts to FEWN systems.

    for Technology 1. Introduction The food–energy–water nexus (FEWN) is a complex
    multi-disciplinary research field which has gotten more and more attention of
    the research community in recent years. The main reasons for this development
    are namely its capability of (i) tackling the disparity of globally increasing
    resource demands and depleting resource supplies, (ii) mitigating the consequences
    of climate change, (iii) evaluating the sustainability of interconnected process
    systems, and (iv) incorporating various stake holder perspectives on different
    process levels. The FEWN can be defined as the study of the connections between
    the food, energy and water resource sectors, and more specifically how trade-offs,
    synergies, and conflicts arise from resource management and decision-making (Simpson
    and Jewitt, 2019). While integrated resource management has a long history, the
    FEWN framework only gained momentum in the late 2000s due to the necessity of
    expanding conventional resource management approaches beyond specific case studies
    towards more comprehensive and interdisciplinary natural resource decision-making
    (Leck et al., 2015). Especially since the 2011 Bonn Nexus Conference: “The Water
    Energy and Food Security Nexus - Solutions for the Green Economy”, the FEWN had
    an impactful influence on the research community, namely as a methodology to achieve
    sustainable and secure resource supply solution strategies (Proctor et al., 2021).
    Additionally, the FEWN does not exist in a vacuum or as an isolated theory, but
    rather within global economies which is visualized in Fig. 1.This overview emphasizes
    the interconnections of the food, energy and water resource systems, while underlining
    the key influences on each resource sector. Accordingly, the FEWN spans a multitude
    of research fields, examples include but are not limited to psychology, politics,
    sociology, economics, agricultural science, geophysics and systems engineering
    (Di Martino et al., 2022a). Albeit the increased research efforts regarding the
    FEWN over the last decade, several challenges remain, such as: the level of detail
    of FEWN process systems needed for important decision making (D’Odorico et al.,
    2018a); computational and modeling complexities of the FEWN due to its multi-scale
    nature (Garcia and You, 2016); the appropriate modeling of multiple stakeholders
    and their often conflicting objectives (Keairns et al., 2016a); the integration
    of societal, environmental, and technical dimensions (Albrecht et al., 2018a);
    the definition of best practices for the evaluation of FEWN systems and the urgent
    need of linking FEWN solution strategies with real world outcomes (Yuan and Lo,
    2022). Process systems engineering (PSE) is uniquely positioned to tackle some
    of these challenges due to its systematic and qualitative nature. In general,
    PSE tools can be utilized for tackling sustainability challenges within chemical
    engineering (Grossmann and Guillén-Gosálbez, 2010) and beyond (Guillen-Gosalbez
    et al., 2019). More specifically, the PSE community can leverage their fundamental
    expertise in synthesizing data for real-world processes modeling and optimization
    to help guide decision makers (Garcia and You, 2016). Download : Download high-res

    for food, energy and water resource supply systems within a global context to
    further synergy and avoid competition among resource supply system solutions (Di
    Martino et al., 2022a). Generally, the green development of supply system solutions
    has become more and more popular across various research communities. Nevertheless,
    the FEWN methodology has not yet been implemented on the same scale. Ultimately,
    for long-lasting sustainable solution generation, this review aims at discussing
    how sustainable decision-making can be achieved via FEWN strategies. However,
    to ultimately assess optimal nexus solutions one has to investigate (i) how decision-making
    is derived within the optimization model, (ii) what representative food, energy
    and water sub-systems have been utilized, and (iii) what kind of decision variables
    or degrees of freedom (DOF) have been selected. Therefore, this review focuses
    on the derivation of informed decision-making in FEWN optimization studies, analyzing
    how the incorporated sub-systems can be leveraged for synergistic and sustainable
    optimal decision-making. It is important to note that while there is evidence
    of a number of FEWN literature reviews available in the open literature, there
    is a lack of detailed investigation and summary of decision-making in optimization
    studies, as discussed in Section 2. In the same section, an overview and critical
    analysis of the FEWN optimization studies under investigation are given. In addition,
    all publications are classified according to the used optimization approach, system
    assumptions and problem statement. Section 3 introduces a novel generic FEWN optimization
    formulation across all resource sectors and highlights what kind of food, energy
    and water subsystems were used most among the identified studies and therefore
    were deemed representative. This approach bridges system complexity, since it
    avoids introducing individual sector-dependent formulations. Rather, the common
    generic modeling equations across all resource sectors are highlighted. As it
    will be shown, uncertainty and its implications for robustness, resiliency and
    security is a research topic of special interest due to its implications for sustainable
    solution generation and the society as a whole. In addition, it will be shown
    that there are significant shortcomings regarding societal objectives in FEWN
    optimization studies. Especially, the energy transition has not been studied extensively
    from a FEWN perspective. Therefore, Section 4.1 discusses important societal drivers
    to be considered in future FEWN studies. Moreover, the selection of modeling and
    optimization approaches significantly influences the achievable level of synergistic
    systems solutions. Here, the utilized spatial scale plays a special role in the
    competition or cooperation among sub-systems. Further, efficient research management
    and policy-making have to be discussed to achieve holistic synergy among FEWN
    systems. This discussion is of the utmost importance to derive solutions with
    real-world applicability and is presented in detail in Section 4.2. Lastly, Section
    5 concludes this work. 2. Overview of classification For this meta-analysis of
    FEWN literature the Web of Science bibliographic database is consulted. With the
    aid of this tool, all relevant literature reviews and optimization studies have
    been identified, utilizing the keywords “Food” & “Energy” & “Water” & “Nexus”.
    To identify literature reviews, the keywords & (“Modeling” OR “Optimization”)
    & (“Literature” OR “Review” OR “Perspective”) have been added, for the identification
    of FEWN optimization studies, instead & “Optimization” has been added. It is important
    to note that here & and OR denote the corresponding logical expressions. The Web
    of Science bibliographic database searches for the specified keywords in the title,
    keywords and abstracts of all listed work. No other restrictions were added, i.e.
    no study was excluded due to its year of publication. Besides the selected research
    topic of interest, this lack of restrictions distinguishes this work from other
    literature reviews. If, however, a research group published several publications
    on the same application with virtually the same methodology only the latest publication
    has been added for brevity. With this approach it was possible to identify 118
    literature reviews and 168 FEWN optimization studies. Accordingly, the only limitation
    regarding this analysis is using one bibliographic database. However, Web of Science
    has been proven to be a powerful citation analysis tool (Zhu and Liu, 2020), although
    it introduces a bias that favors natural sciences and engineering (Mongeon and
    Paul-Hus, 2016). Fig. 2 gives an overview of available literature regarding FEWN
    studies in the field of Chemical Engineering identified with the Web of Science
    bibliographic database. Initially the keywords “Food”, “Energy”, “Water”, “Nexus”
    and “Sustainability” and their combinations have been researched. Additionally,
    a refined search is performed for which the previous search results have been
    narrowed down to only modeling or optimization studies. It is evident that the
    field of energy and sustainability has been researched by far the most. To put
    this into perspective, researching water and sustainability resulted in 40% less
    number of publications, while food and sustainability yielded 84% less contributions.
    Intuitively, sustainable solution generation in the field of Chemical Engineering
    for energy, water or food systems should incorporate a nexus approach, since otherwise
    obtained solutions cannot truly be sustainable. One can see that for each nexus
    sub-system (Energy–Water (EW), Food–Energy (FE), Food–Water (FW)), the number
    of publications decrease for changing the keyword from sustainability to nexus
    to including both, which underlines a significant literature gap regarding the
    sustainable evaluation of nexus and non-nexus systems. Download : Download high-res

    found in the field of Chemical Engineering in Web of Science dependent on the
    given keyword search. To further analyze these findings, the found publications
    in the field of Chemical Engineering focusing on modeling or optimizing a FEWN
    system or sub-system have been visualized in the Venn diagram presented in Fig.
    3. It is interesting to see how much literature does not indicate sustainability
    efforts in their food, energy or water system research. Furthermore, regarding
    the sustainability of food systems, the various food nexus efforts contribute
    significantly to this research area. For the sustainable energy or water research
    the nexus approach is not as commonly incorporated. In summary, the number of
    research articles found for food and sustainability, energy and sustainability
    and water and sustainability, is reduced significantly (52%, 93%, 85% respectively)
    when one is interested in explicitly incorporating the FEWN. This observed reduction
    is a good indication of how well nexus approaches are incorporated in each research
    field. This ultimately confirms the notion that nexus approaches need to be incorporated
    when food, energy or water systems are investigated in terms of sustainability,
    with the energy–water nexus (EWN) being the most investigated sub-nexus system.

    Due to the increasing research efforts regarding the FEWN, there are a multitude
    of FEWN reviews available in the literature which focus on different aspects of
    the nexus. In this instance, it is of interest to summarize all available reviews
    or perspectives tackling FEWN modeling or optimization from all applicable research
    fields. A classification of reviews is shown in Table 1, whereas a detailed summary
    of these reviews is presented in Table A.3. Here, a column for the overall number
    of citations is added to indicate the popularity and impact of each category.
    It is evident that general FEWN reviews focusing on modeling approaches are the
    most impactful ones in terms of number of reviews (20) and number of citations
    (1134). Furthermore, one can confirm that the EWN is the most popular sub-nexus.
    Surprisingly, agricultural management is a topic which seems to be popular at
    least according to the number of citations. In nearly all instances, PSE approaches
    are at least mentioned, summarized or even utilized, underlining their sustainable
    solution generation capabilities. It is also worth mentioning that all investigated
    reviews are fairly recent with the oldest one being published in 2015. For brevity,
    a summary of the most impactful review of each category is given below. Table

    common that the decision-making, the DOF, and the investigated sub-systems of
    the analyzed studies are assumed as a given. Therefore, based on the presented
    reviews, the question of how informed decision-making for optimal FEWN solutions
    can be achieved cannot be answered in detail. Hence, this work provides a rigorous
    review of FEWN optimization studies to guide how informed decision-making can
    be established dependent on the system of interest, process assumptions and encountered
    modeling or optimization challenges. To evaluate how decision-making is enforced
    in the multi-disciplinary field of the FEWN, available FEWN optimization studies
    are consulted. Using again the Web of Science bibliographic database with the
    keywords “Optimization”, “Food”, “Energy”, “Water” and “Nexus”, 168 relevant FEWN
    optimization studies across various research fields addressing a variety of challenges
    with an array of modeling strategies to accomplish different goals have been identified.
    The utilized objective functions of these studies are presented in Table B.4 located
    in Appendix B and visualized in Fig. 4. The FEWN is characterized by an array
    of possible objectives, which are mostly conflicting each other, such as maximizing
    the economic benefit versus minimizing the resource utilization of a supply system.
    Therefore, in the majority of studies, multi-objective optimization (MOO) is employed,
    thus explaining multiple markings per row (marked with an X). Furthermore, the
    importance of considering an economic objective is illustrated by the fact that
    71% of the studies either maximize the economic benefit or minimize the cost of
    a FEWN system. Another popular objective is to minimize the negative environmental
    impact of system solutions, e.g. by minimizing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
    Furthermore, resource objectives, such as minimizing resource usage, i.e. water
    consumption of food and energy systems, maximizing resource output or production,
    i.e. food production, or maximizing resource storage, i.e. water storage of a
    reservoir, are incorporated in 44% of these studies. Additionally, other studies
    focus on the maximization of the efficiency or reliability of a FEWN system (11%
    and 10%, respectively). It is important to note that the employed strategies and
    definitions for efficiency and reliability vary from study to study, especially
    with changing applications. To maximize the FEWN itself, some studies (7%) try
    first to derive a FEWN metric or index based on historic data and then to optimize
    it. Usually, a normalized food, energy and water index is initially defined and
    then summed up to rate different system solutions. Recently, societal aspects
    and implications of FEWN system solutions are incorporated more and more, such
    as reducing the impact of substituting traditional fuel with biofuel or maximizing
    the number of jobs created, which is reflected in 10% of the publications. Seven
    of the found studies employ specialized objectives reflecting other aspects of
    the FEWN, such as maximizing cash flow, minimizing debt or maximizing observability.

    studies. All utilized objectives for each FEWN optimization study are summarized
    in Table B.4. To foster not only decision-making but rather informed decision-making,
    it is not sufficient to only focus on the objectives of each FEWN optimization
    study, but one has to take into account the addressed topic as well as the utilized
    modeling approaches. Therefore, the aforementioned optimization studies are classified
    according to their research topic and optimization model formulation into Download

    Classification of FEWN optimization studies into research topics together with
    the most common encountered challenges for each research topic. • Resource Management,
    • Design of Supply Systems, • Operation of Supply Systems, • Design and Operation
    of Supply Systems, • Synergy Assessment, or • Resiliency, Security and Sustainability,
    as shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in detail in Table B.5. To understand the details
    of how FEWN optimization studies are assigned to a classification, a resource-task
    network formulation has to be introduced first. Then, dependent on the focus of
    the study and the corresponding objectives and optimization model formulation
    the various FEWN studies can readily be assigned to a classification. This is
    described in detail in Section 3. Generally speaking, resource management is the
    field with the most, whereas design and operation of FEWN supply systems is the
    one with the least number of contributions. Additionally, the synergistic assessment,
    together with the resiliency and security of FEWN systems are becoming more and
    more popular topics. The most commonly encountered challenges for each topic are
    also illustrated in Fig. 5. More specifically, the most common challenges across
    the five topics include uncertainty, risk, resource scarcity, technology feasibility,
    nexus interconnections, and the quantification of the FEWN. The most popular modeling
    approaches for each topic are summarized in Fig. 6. This figure illustrates the
    plethora of modeling approaches employed per topic, but also that several approaches
    are used for tackling various challenges. Researchers are utilizing a plethora
    of modeling methodologies to overcome these aforementioned challenges. Overall,
    process systems are often represented as superstructures and then reformulated
    as an optimization program accordingly. Uncertainty is often addressed with stochastic
    processes, chance-constrained programming, robust programming or fuzzy set theory.
    To overcome modeling complexity, artificial intelligence (AI) or regression methods
    based on historic data are employed. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is utilized for
    assessing the environmental impact of solutions, whereas simulation tools and
    first-principle modeling approaches are utilized for modeling process sub-systems.
    Game Theory, in the form of a Stackelberg game or a Nash equilibrium, is employed
    to capture dynamics of sequential decision-making and information discrepancy
    among the decision-makers. Download : Download high-res image (218KB) Download

    To further analyze the employed modeling strategies, the most utilized modeling
    approaches for each previously identified challenge are summarized in Fig. 7.
    As expected, superstructure and first-principle modeling and optimization are
    utilized across all topics. Game Theory is used for the depiction of cooperation,
    to model the holistic complexity of the FEWN and policy integration. FEWN indices
    are mostly used to quantify the FEWN and its interconnections. LCA is utilized
    to evaluate system efficiencies, interconnections and sustainability. Further,
    stochastic programming, chance-constrained programming, robust programming and
    fuzzy set theory are utilized to capture various aspects and implications of parameter
    variation for different topics. It is important to acknowledge that Fig. 6 and
    Fig. 7 are required to paint the full picture regarding the main modeling strategies.
    The difficulty in selecting appropriate modeling approaches for informed decision-making
    is that several modeling strategies are used for the same problem class (see Fig.
    6) and that various modeling methodologies are utilized to overcome the same encountered
    challenge (see Fig. 7). In addition, different modeling approaches might result
    in varying results. Therefore, researchers have to be cognizant, and state explicitly
    which modeling strategy is utilized to overcome which encountered challenge and
    how the selected method implicitly influences optimal solutions. Moreover, the
    identified publications are analyzed in terms of the utilized food, energy and
    water sub-systems, as well as the declared DOF, to uncover similarities and discrepancies
    among FEWN optimization appications, as shown in Table B.6. The identified sub-systems
    for each sector are presented in detail Section 3, with a special focus on how
    each representative system is modeled. Based on this assessment, it is essential
    to understand how the selected modeling approach translates into an optimization
    model and how it has been solved. Download : Download high-res image (168KB) Download

    To this end, all optimization studies have been analyzed with a focus on what
    kind of optimization program has ultimately been obtained, what kind of reformulation
    strategy has been applied, if any, and how the optimization program has been solved.
    Results of this analysis are shown in Table B.7. The general classification of
    encountered optimization model formulations is stated in Fig. 8. To capture the
    complexity and multi-faceted nature of the FEWN the majority of the publications
    are indeed employing MOO, whereas only a small fraction of studies, 5%, utilized
    multi-level optimization programs. To be more precise, most frequently, multi-objective
    linear programming (LP) or multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
    problems are derived. In most of these instances, the -constraint method or the
    sum of weighted and normalized objectives are utilized to obtain a single objective
    function. Case studies of most publications try to incorporate all aspects of
    the FEWN, however, there are several occasions where special focus is placed on
    a nexus sub-system such as energy management (E). Heuristic solution algorithms,
    such as the genetic or particle swarm algorithm, are mostly employed for nonlinear
    MOO studies. Furthermore, in some instances, MOO is taken into account by solving
    independent optimization models with changing objectives and comparing solutions.
    In this case, FEWN synergies and trade-offs of interconnected systems cannot be
    evaluated directly. Download : Download high-res image (113KB) Download : Download

    Regarding resource management, the allocation of resources is the most popular
    decision variable. Resiliency, security and sustainability, either use crop land
    allocation, technology selection or water utilization as decision variables. For
    the synergy assessment of FEWN systems resource allocation or operation of supply
    systems are the identified most popular DOF. Design of supply systems utilize,
    besides the design itself, supply chain design and crop land allocation as optimization
    variables, whereas the operation and design and operation of supply systems mostly
    optimize the operation or design and operation of the system under investigation.

    spatial and time scale of FEWN optimization studies is analyzed in Table B.8.
    In addition, Table 2 denotes the number of publications for each discovered spatial
    and time scale. The coloring from red to green indicates how well researched each
    sub-field in the matrix is. Interestingly, time independence is assumed in several
    studies, although more sophisticated approaches, such as multi-period modeling,
    are employed as well. Depending on the application of the optimization study the
    time-scale can vary between hours and years, with hours being the least utilized
    time scale. The spatial scale varies from a single supply system, such as a reverse
    osmosis (RO) desalination plant to countries. In general, this table can guide
    researchers in finding and uncovering common ground among other optimization studies
    employing similar time or spatial scales for various applications. Table 2. Investigated
    spatial and time scales of relevant FEWN optimization studies. Color is selected
    dependent on frequency of investigated scale: greater than 10: Green, 10 to 4:
    Yellow, 3 to 1: Pink, 0: Red. Based on the presented analysis, one can also deduct
    several characteristics of the development and changes in time of the identified
    FEWN optimization studies. Due to the recent advancements of PSE, the FEWN systems
    under investigation tend to become more and more complex. Accordingly, obtained
    solutions have a greater real-world applicability than before. Previously developed
    LPs are extended to MILPs, and similarly non linear programming (NLP) problems
    are extended to mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. This enables
    the integration of distinct and exclusive decisions via the introduction of integer
    variables. Further, instead of optimizing solely a single objective, several conflicting
    objectives are optimized to capture a more nuanced view. In addition, the multi-scale
    nature of the FEWN is discussed more and more instead of assuming time independence
    or a single time and spatial scale. Overall, these advancements have been made
    possible due to advancements in surrogate modeling and in general due to advancements
    in systems complexity mitigation strategies (Allen et al., 2023). To summarize,
    it has been shown that the decision-making itself has not yet been investigated
    in detail by FEWN literature reviews. Further, the incorporation of all aspects
    of the FEWN has been identified as a major literature gap, especially for sustainable
    solution generation of food, energy, and water systems. To capture conflicting
    stakeholder perspectives, FEWN optimization models are regularly reformulated
    as MOO programs. Most often economic, resource and environmental objectives are
    considered. Recently, societal objectives are more and more incorporated in FEWN
    studies. However, seldomly the objective truly maximizes the benefits of society
    as a whole. In addition, the interactions of food, energy, water and society has
    so far only been denoted by the objective function. Accordingly, dependent on
    the societal objective under investigation the interactions and synergies can
    change significantly. This is a complex issue which requires further investigation.
    Especially integrating societal implications beyond the objective function in
    the system of constraints should be investigated. Therefore, various societal
    drivers to be considered in future studies are discussed in Section 4.1. In the
    same section, a more generic strategy to handle uncertainty is discussed as well,
    since in most studies uncertainty, resiliency, security and robustness are used
    interchangeably. This is a major drawback, since resiliency, robustness and security
    all depend on (i) how the uncertainty is handled in the optimization, and (ii)
    what the goal of the research is. The distinction between and clear definitions
    of resiliency, robustness and security still needs to be developed. The common
    ground among these concepts is their dependency on uncertain parameters and how
    the system handles these. The hierarchical nature of decision-making still needs
    further investigation in the form of multi-level optimization programs. Albeit
    the computational complexity of multi-level systems hinders future developments,
    due to scale limitations for real-world applications. Accordingly, strategies
    for bridging the computational and modeling complexity have to be further developed.
    Often, MOO programs are reformulated based on the -constraint method. However,
    in some instances independent optimization programs are solved and the solutions
    compared to find trade-offs, which inherently is not sufficient to truly uncover
    synergies. Synergies among independent optimization programs can only be achieved
    if decomposition or decoupling strategies are applied to the sub-systems. Although
    these strategies are powerful, they are virtually not applied in FEWN optimization
    due to their complexity. While the synergy of systems solutions is often discussed,
    the utilized spatial scale of the FEWN system under consideration is not. This
    is a major shortcoming since the spatial scale ultimately dictates the level of
    synergy the system can achieve. In addition, a plethora of studies utilize heuristic
    algorithms as a solution methodology which can result in synergistic shortcomings.
    Accordingly, there are many implicit modeling and optimization assumptions which
    inherently reduce the level of synergy that can be achieved by the system. This
    challenge will be discussed in Section 4. To obtain optimization programs which
    can still be solved with deterministic solution algorithms the optimization models
    are often formulated as LPs or MILPs with assumed time independence. Accordingly,
    time dependent analysis and optimization of different scales, preferably capturing
    the multi-scale nature of interconnected FEWN systems, should be the focus moving
    forward. As mentioned before, superstructure modeling approaches are a preferred
    strategy in FEWN studies to tackle a plethora of challenges. In these cases, the
    resource supply systems are still introduced based on individual sector-dependent
    modeling formulations. This can result in additional avoidable system complexity.
    To overcome this challenge, a novel generic resource-task network for all FEWN
    resources will be presented in Section 3. This modeling framework can be understood
    as the most generic FEWN system formulation possible. Other researchers can then
    extend and tailor the presented system of constraints to the application of their
    interest. All identified optimization studies are summarized and classified with
    respect to different topics in Appendix B. The supplementary material consists
    of an Excel file summarizing all identified literature reviews and optimization
    studies in separate tables. Filtering is enabled, so that researchers can use
    the tables similarly to a glossary for tailored identification of relevant research
    fields within FEWN optimization studies. 3. Optimizing the FEWN Nearly all of
    the previously summarized FEWN optimization studies utilize to some degree a reformulation
    of a superstructure, e.g. state-task or resource-task networks (Mencarelli et
    al., 2020), or of a transshipment model (Di Martino et al., 2022d) as the core
    of their respective process systems. Across various applications and scales these
    models have several key aspects in common, which can be summarized in the following
    way. However, a unified notation for all resources across all sectors has not
    yet been introduced in the open literature in a generic fashion. It is important
    to note that the objective functions cannot easily be summarized since these are
    highly dependent on (i) the goal of the study, (ii) the optimization model formulation
    and reformulation, and (iii) the selected application of the study. Nevertheless,
    it is of the utmost importance to understand how the model formulation informs
    and potentially enables optimal decision-making, which is presented in this section.
    The system under investigation is a generic food, energy and water supply system
    with several resources per sector. Let the set of resources be denoted by , where
    , and are various types of food, energy and water resources of different quality
    or classification. The set can for example denote the different crops under investigation,
    whereas summarizes the considered energy sources and the utilized water sources,
    possibly saline, brackish, waste and purified. To model time dependency a time
    index is introduced. The time scale can be defined from hours to years. If the
    utilized scale is not specified in detail and the model solved only once for various
    scenarios the resulting model is a single period optimization model. On the contrary,
    if solutions for various scenarios for several successive time points or periods
    are obtained, a multi-period optimization model is solved. In addition, a time
    set can be introduced, to cycle all for each yielding a multi-scale optimization
    model. To overcome the multi-scale nature of the FEWN, different time scales of
    various processes can be reduced to a common one via clustering (Tso et al., 2020).
    Each optimization model utilizes resource balances as presented in Eq. (1), (2).
    To satisfy a resource demand ( ) at time of resource one needs to account for
    resource production ( ), consumption ( ), release from ( ) and allocation to (
    ) a potential storage system. To account for demands over the entire time horizon
    ( ) the right side of Eq. (1) is summed up over in Eq. (2). (1) (2) Eq. (3) to
    (6) refer to the resource storage systems. A storage balance considering the storage
    level in the previous time point ( ) is shown in Eq. (3). Eq. (4) and (5) denote
    beginning ( ) and end of life ( ) constraints for the storage system. Here, can
    be interpreted as an initial storage level bought externally, whereas Eq. (5)
    ensures that the storage system has at least the same level of resources as initially
    bought externally in the last time step. With Eq. (6) the storage system can be
    sized ( ) optimally. (3) (4) (5) (6) The consumption and production of resources
    depends on the utilized technology and available resources, i.e. for the generation
    of solar energy solar irradiance and solar panels have to be available to the
    system. Therefore, the set represents all available resource consuming (subset
    ) and producing (subset ) technologies. It is important to note that these are
    cross-linking the FEWN resources, i.e. energy is needed to generate purified water
    or water is needed for crops farming. Accordingly, the overall production and
    consumption of for each can be obtained via Eq. (7), (8) by summing up over all
    resource producing ( , ) and consuming ( , ) processes. In addition, production
    and consumption box constraints can be enforced (Eq. (9), (10)). (7) (8) (9) (10)
    Summing up all produced and consumed resources over time yields the overall amount
    of resource produced (Eq. (11)) and consumed (Eq. (12)). Again, box constraints
    can be enforced on the total resource production and consumption as illustrated
    in Eq. (13), (14). (11) (12) (13) (14) To enable optimal technology selection
    binary decision variables for each producing ( , ) and consuming technology (
    , ) can be introduced, as shown from Eq. (15) to (19). Big-M constraints ensure
    the selection of utilized technologies (Eq. (15) and (16)). For a subset ( ) or
    potentially the complete set of technologies ( ) only a certain number of technologies
    ( , ) can be selected, i.e. choose only two out of five possible energy supply
    technologies and select only one water supply system for greenhouse farming (Eq.
    (17), (18)). (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) According to the utilized optimization model,
    publications can be classified as resource management studies if the focus of
    the work is rather the resource flow across the superstructure than the nodes
    or technologies transforming the resources. If the technology selection is fixed,
    then the studies tackle an operation optimization problem. On the contrary, if
    the operation of units is considered constant or not in detail, the main focus
    of the optimization model is the technology selection, i.e. design optimization.
    If design and operation considerations are combined, a design and operation optimization,
    also known as planning and scheduling optimization, is performed. If the focus
    is shifted to the network itself and studied in terms of resiliency, robustness,
    security or sustainability, the optimization model is classified accordingly.
    Synergy assessment focuses on the interconnections among technologies across various
    sectors through resource flows to improve the overall system performance. What
    differentiates all the studies is how , , and , , are modeled and derived, since
    these variables are sector and scale dependent. Consequently, a summary of how
    commonly used technologies within the food, energy and water sectors are modeled
    is presented in the following subsections. Furthermore, in each of the following
    sub-sections the relevant resource interconnections are highlighted, such as:
    (i) water and energy are needed for farming purposes, (ii) food waste and biomass
    can be used as an energy generating technology, and in general water might be
    required for energy generation, (iii) water purification is an energy intensive
    process depending on the water application purity level required. It is important
    to note that the goal of the research dictates not only the selected objective
    function, but also the set-up of the optimization model (single objective vs.
    multi-objective vs. multi-level), the utilized representations of , , and , ,
    and which variables of the presented generic model formulation are classified
    as DOF or parameters. The utilized objectives are summarized in detail in Table
    B.4. The most direct way of incorporating economic or environmental objectives
    is to introduce cost and environmental factors for each utilized technology and
    resource. Then, all relevant cost and pollution terms can be summed up and minimized,
    respectively. It is also possible to maximize resource flows, utilization or storage
    across the network by neglecting these factors and focusing on the resource flows.
    Societal, reliability, efficiency and FEWN index objectives have so far been highly
    specialized according to the topic and model structure under investigation so
    that a simple summary cannot be provided here. 3.1. The food system The easiest
    way of incorporating food considerations in FEWN optimization studies is to require
    an irrigation requirement to be fulfilled by the system based on the selected
    crops to satisfy a given crops demand. In this case, the considered food system
    is labeled as “Irrigation” or “Food Availability” in Table B.6. The water demand
    for food production can be summarized as shown in Eq. (20). Here, the left side
    of the equations sums up all available water sources ( , ) allocated for irrigation
    of crop in land area at time . Accordingly, the set specifies all available farming
    subareas. The needed irrigation water is then derived based on the land use allocation
    and the water requirement (CWR ) for production of crop in subarea at time . To
    additionally keep in mind the local food requirements and prevailing cropping
    practices, a lower and an upper bound of the allocated area of different crops
    can be considered (Eq. (21)) (Li et al., 2019a). Then, food demands can be met
    by adjusting the lower bound of crop land allocation ( ), which can be referred
    to as basic food production (Yu et al., 2020b). It is important to note that for
    each crop the parameter CWR of Eq. (20) and the box constraint of Eq. (21) have
    to be adjusted. Similar to the presented equations, equations can be added to
    capture the energy consumption of each crop by replacing the crop water requirement
    with its energy requirement. In this case the energy requirement of a crop summarizes
    all spent energy for farming purposes, i.e. all energy spent from irrigation to
    required farmland modifications. (20) (21) Crop land allocation can be readily
    extended to a general land-use optimization formulation, as presented from Eq.
    (22) to (25). In this case, the selection of competing producing units for a limited
    area of land is optimized via binary decision variables . If then subarea is used
    to produce resource . Accordingly, each subarea can only be used for one producing
    unit (Eq. (22)), e.g. either corn or cotton can be farmed on land (Eq. (23)).
    Further, integer cuts can be introduced to ensure that only a certain number of
    producing units (N ) are selected for simultaneous use in the overall system (Eq.
    (24)), i.e. only one of two renewable energy supply systems (solar or wind) can
    be used in the overall system (Eq. (25)) (Nie et al., 2019). Dependent on the
    system under consideration a time index can be introduced in this formulation
    as well. To do so, an additional commitment constraint has to be added to enforce
    that land allocation cannot be changed in any given time point. Before committing
    subarea for farming crop , previously farmed crop has to be harvested or otherwise
    all food production is lost. The same logic is applicable to other resources and
    producing units. (22) (23) (24) (25) For detailed crops modeling researchers can
    refer to the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model (Williams et
    al., 1989), which converts the daily intercepted photosynthetically active radiation
    into biomass and has successfully been integrated in optimization models (Zhang
    et al., 2018a). Then, the biomass production is reduced by environmental stresses
    or harvesting. The crop yield of each culture is ultimately obtained based on
    the harvesting index and biomass partitioning (Campana et al., 2021). 3.2. The
    energy system The “Energy Availability” of the system can be considered by introducing
    the overall energy available (E ) or by specifying the energy demand to be satisfied
    (E ), as shown in Eq. (26) (Kahil et al., 2018) and (27) (Sadeghi et al., 2020).
    (26) (27) Here, can be understood as the allocated energy for various applications
    or the energy produced from the same source. To consider specific energy technologies
    and how resources are transformed into energy, technology specific equations have
    to be introduced. In this case, researchers make the distinction between fossil
    fuel based and renewable energy based energy supply. Generally speaking, renewable
    energy technologies are a more popular selection for the energy supply system
    in a FEWN context due to the negative environmental impact of fossil fuel based
    GHG emissions. Albeit, renewable energy technologies face supply challenges because
    of their intermittent nature. This trade-off has for example been modeled and
    analyzed by Chamas et al. (2021) and Vinca et al. (2020). The modeling equations
    of fossil fuel energy production are presented in Eq. (28), (29), where represents
    the electricity generation from a power plant using fossil energy supply in ,
    summarizes the energy supply based on in , FE stands for the unit of energy carrier
    per unit of electricity generation for conversion technology in and AV denotes
    the availability of energy supply in (Zhang and Vesselinov, 2017). In these equations
    can be interpreted as the type of energy supply and the power plant that uses
    a given energy supply. Similarly, energy from organic waste (Leung Pah Hang et
    al., 2016) or biomass (Garcia et al., 2019) can be introduced via representative
    efficiency equations. An additional water consumption factor and equations for
    energy generating technologies can readily be added. (28) (29) Regarding the modeling
    of renewable energy supply systems Bieber et al. (2018) describe how renewable
    resource data for hydropower, biofuel, solar and wind power, together with thermal
    generation and nuclear can be captured with a resource-task network, similar to
    the one presented here. Demirhan et al. (2020) present a methodology for integrating
    solar and wind power, together with energy storage systems, to overcome the intermittency
    of renewable energy supply systems for a multi-location problem, again using a
    resource-task network. In most cases, resource-task networks or superstructures
    in general are utilized for the energy supply trade-off evaluation where historic
    renewable resource availability data is transformed via linear efficiency equations
    into energy outputs. These equations can be formulated the same way as for the
    fossil fuel case presented in Eq. (28), (29), or as for the more general case
    presented as energy availability equations (Eq. (26), (27)) by introducing technology
    dependent efficiencies. This illustrates that virtually all energy supply systems
    can be captured the same way. However, in some cases one might take into account
    more detailed first-principle modeling of the energy supply systems (Cook et al.,
    2022). But even in this case, the detailed first-principle models can be formulated
    and subsequently approximated in a generic way for varying resources, which is
    not dependent on the resource or transforming technology itself. To summarize,
    the following publications present optimization frameworks with special focus
    on one type of energy source: • Bio: Garcia et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2018, López-Díaz
    et al., 2018. • Fossil: Zhang and Vesselinov, 2017, Ahmad et al., 2021, Zhang
    et al., 2019a. • Hydro: Uen et al., 2018, Si et al., 2019, Dhaubanjar et al.,
    2017. • Nuclear: Bieber et al., 2018, Vinca et al., 2020, Lechón et al., 2018.
    • Solar: Karan et al., 2018, Gençer and Agrawal, 2018, Campana et al., 2021. •
    Thermal: Zhang et al., 2021c, Ma et al., 2021b, Gonzalez et al., 2020. • Wind:
    Hanes et al., 2018, Ji et al., 2020b, Beykal et al., 2020. All of these publications
    have a similar optimization model formulation in common. The common aspects have
    been summarized in the superstructure modeling approach presented here. In some
    cases non-linear efficiencies and resource transformations are added into the
    optimization model, which does not change the general model lay-out, however this
    modification results in a (MI)NLP rather than a (MI)LP optimization problem. 3.3.
    The water system All previously made deductions and analysis regarding the food
    and energy availability can readily be extended to the water availability of the
    system. In this case, the water available from different sources for various applications
    are summed up (Eq. (30)). Depending on the application, a water quality constraint
    might need to be introduced, i.e. drinking water has a different water quality
    restriction in terms of total dissolved solids than water for irrigation or livestock
    (Eq. (31)). This can result in nonlinearities of the system, if the exact output
    concentration of the water has to be calculated due to the required mixing constraints
    (Di Martino et al., 2021). Here, parallels to the irrigation constraints of the
    food supply system (Eq. (20)) and the efficiency constraints of the energy supply
    system (Eq. (28)) can be drawn. (30) (31) Regarding the water supply system, water
    management strategies of reservoirs received special attention due to the implications
    of decision-making on water availability for farming and power generation via
    hydropower (Oikonomou and Parvania, 2019). These cases utilize, similar to the
    energy supply system, a superstructure representation to derive optimal resource
    allocation decision in terms of water allocation for various applications utilizing
    optimization models based on the here presented constraints. Different considered
    water sources for FEWN systems include but are not limited to freshwater, groundwater,
    rain water, seawater, surface water, wastewater and recycled water. In these cases,
    purifying technologies such as desalination or filtration can be used to change
    the water quality of a water source. Accordingly, the previously introduced water
    constraints are modified as presented in Eq. (32), (33). In this instance denotes
    the input water mix, technology (e.g. reverse osmosis) utilizes to achieve water
    quality and water output , while denotes the brine water output at concentration
    . This purification step usually requires energy ( ) dependent on the desired
    water output and water quality (Eq. (34)) (Di Martino et al., 2021). The water
    output restrictions are in turn dictated by the desired application. Water for
    human consumption for example underlies a different restriction than water for
    irrigation or livestock and therefore requires a different amount of energy for
    purification. This equation can similarly be extended to the energy required to
    utilize water for agricultural purposes. It is important to note that the presented
    formulation is equivalent to introducing a water recovery ( ) of the water supply
    system. To bridge modeling complexity, surrogate models can be utilized to approximate
    the energy consumption of water purification technologies ( ) (Di Martino et al.,
    2022b). (32) (33) (34) The analysis presented above clearly reveals the similarities
    in food, energy and water supply systems modeling, which can be formulated as
    general resource constraints to bridge system complexity. 4. Extensions of FEWN
    optimization studies It has been shown that FEWN optimization studies have to
    be extended to integrate societal, environmental, and technical dimensions for
    a multi-disciplinary and multi-scale treatment of the FEWN. This extension is
    essential to successfully link derived solution strategies with real-world outcomes,
    although best practices for the evaluation of FEWN systems have yet to be derived
    (Di Martino et al., 2022a). Accordingly, important societal drivers for sustainable
    process systems solutions via FEWN modeling and optimization are discussed next.
    However, the modeling assumptions and selected optimization methodology can limit
    the extent of obtained synergistic solutions. Therefore, this section also evaluates
    and analyzes how synergy and competition of resources are captured in FEWN optimization.
    These extensions of FEWN optimization studies have to be taken into consideration
    for informed decision-making. Thus, resulting in sustainable societal impact and
    in revealing the dependency of synergistic solutions on the model formulation
    and solution approach. 4.1. Societal drivers As discussed earlier, many publications
    already investigate uncertainty, robustness, resiliency and security aspects of
    the FEWN. Although, in most of these studies these words are used interchangeably.
    This arguably results in several shortcomings of the applicability of derived
    results, because these keywords are far from identical. In general, there are
    several approaches on how to handle uncertain parameters in optimization, namely
    chance-constrained programming, interval programming or robust reformulation.
    One less researched approach for FEWN applications to handle uncertainty is to
    map the feasible optimal region via flexibility analysis (Pistikopoulos and Mazzuchi,
    1990). This approach enables to explicitly state for which uncertain parameter
    interval the obtained optimal solution remains indeed optimal (Dimitriadis and
    Pistikopoulos, 1995). Then, the feasible region can be maximized together with
    the original objective function optimization. This results in a multi-objective
    evaluation of how an increased optimal feasible region (maximizing the system’s
    flexibility), changes the objective function evaluation (Raspanti et al., 2000).
    The derived feasible region can be understood as the accepted tolerance of the
    optimal solution against uncertain influences or disturbances (Bhosekar and Ierapetritou,
    2018). Therefore, one can understand resiliency as a reformulation and extension
    of flexibility analysis (Chrisandina et al., 2022a). It is especially important
    to note that there is not yet a coherent definition of process systems resiliency
    and the differentiation of it to process systems robustness and security (Chrisandina
    et al., 2022b). In turn, security can be re-interpreted as a metric dependent
    on uncertainty through risk. Therefore, security optimization directly relies
    on how the uncertainty is reformulated in the optimization model. Accordingly,
    a feasibility reformulation through flexibility analysis can help in this case
    as well to understand the security map of optimal solutions. Thus, how resiliency,
    robustness or security considerations affect FEWN optimization is inherently dependent
    on how the associated uncertainty is handled in the model itself. One research
    field which has received an increased interest of the research community is the
    clean energy transition to reduce the harmful impacts of climate change (Kakodkar
    et al., 2022a). In this case, sustainable energy supply system solutions are derived
    with the intent of reducing negative environmental impacts (Kakodkar et al., 2022b).
    Here, interconnected energy supply systems and markets are often considered through
    the production (Allen et al., 2021) and transportation (Allen et al., 2022) of
    dense energy carriers such as hydrogen or ammonia. In these studies sustainable
    solution generation is often claimed, although implications of solutions on the
    interconnected food and water supply systems are not considered. Accordingly,
    the FEWN is not yet taken into account in detail in energy transition studies.
    For the production of hydrogen for example it is essential to consider how much
    water, from which source and with which potential purifying technology has to
    to be supplied to the system. Similarly, the water and land footprint of carbon
    capture technologies has to be derived (Rosa et al., 2021). Especially the competition
    of these resources and technologies with agriculture and livestock, or the food
    supply system in general, via land-use has to be considered for sustainable decision-making.
    Moving forward, the authors suggest that sustainable energy transition scenarios
    and clean energy system solutions have to incorporate FEWN thinking for truly
    sustainable system solutions. Societal objectives, such as maximizing employment
    (González-Bravo et al., 2018) or social welfare (Yue et al., 2021a), have already
    been incorporated in FEWN optimization studies. Additionally, Karan et al. (2018)
    designed a small-scale FEWN system that can consistently meet the food demands
    of a family of four. Al-Thani et al. (2020) maximize the nutritional value of
    agricultural output via resource allocation optimization to tackle malnutrition
    of a countries’ population. Yuan et al. (2018) maximize the impact reduction of
    transitioning from traditional fuel to biofuels via crop land allocation optimization.
    However, other important societal drivers such as life style choices or cultural
    practices (Chapman and Shigetomi, 2018) have virtually not yet been considered
    in FEWN optimization, albeit their underlined importance for the accomplishment
    of the united nation’s sustainable development goals (Lubowiecki-Vikuk et al.,
    2021). These aspects can be incorporated in future FEWN optimization frameworks
    via general land-use allocation constraints, which simultaneously enable the explicit
    incorporation of biodiversity and environmental protection constraints. Overall,
    the interconnection of society and FEWN systems is an understudied subject, which
    should receive an increased interest of the research community in the future.
    Societal benefit has to be taken into consideration for long-lasting sustainable
    decision-making. However, from a PSE perspective this is no simple task. One first
    step to close this research gap is to routinely engage stakeholders, sociologists,
    and policy-makers in the model development phase. This ultimately ensures the
    real-world impact of derived FEWN optimization frameworks. 4.2. Synergy and competition
    of resources A key strength of the FEWN methodology is the possibility of leveraging
    interconnected process sub-systems towards more cost-competitive and sustainable
    solution generation. Although, the increased modeling and computational complexity
    of the developed optimization models have to be mitigated (Allen et al., 2019).
    This is illustrated in the work of Di Martino et al. regarding the isolated (Di
    Martino et al., 2022c) and interconnected optimization (Di Martino et al., 2023b)
    of a renewable energy supply system connected to a reverse osmosis desalination
    water supply system for metropolitan and agricultural ecosystems. Results indicate
    that producing a surplus of desalinated water during periods of high renewable
    resource availability for later water demand satisfaction provides a more cost-competitive
    strategy compared to increasing energy storage. Thus, for the optimization of
    supply systems these interconnections can be readily leveraged for more sustainable
    solution generation. Furthermore, the research community has already made significant
    efforts regarding the development of synergistic FEWN system solutions at the
    urban and basin scale. Zeng et al. (2019a) for example optimize a multiple water-reservoir
    system to synergistically satisfy regional water allocation, food production and
    electricity generation. Zeng et al. (2019b) develop a water resources allocation
    and food production optimization model to confront urbanization challenges and
    to support comprehensive and sustainable policy-making. Yu et al. (2020b) derive
    an interconnected FEWN planning problem which can handle conflicts and hierarchical
    relationships among multiple decision-makers. However, depending on the spatial
    scale under investigation potential synergies among resource supply systems cannot
    be leveraged, due to the cost and infeasibility of larger resource distribution
    systems for interconnected supply system operation. To perform this trade-off
    analysis researchers can incorporate Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling
    in the optimization model to directly consider geographical dependencies. GIS
    modeling is utilized to find the optimal locations for production systems incorporating
    the distance and transportation cost between site candidates of resource production.
    In these cases the resource-task network is formulated based on the GIS model
    as a location–allocation problem, directly incorporating geospatial dependencies
    (Al-Ansari et al., 2018). Accordingly, solutions are directly applicable to the
    region under investigation, overcoming one of the general FEWN shortcomings of
    not being applicable to real-world applications (Di Martino et al., 2022a). Another
    factor to consider for the synergy assessment is how solutions change dependent
    on the introduced modeling and optimization error in the optimization model itself.
    Modeling and computational complexity are frequently encountered challenges within
    the multi-scale and multi-sectoral FEWN system (Di Martino et al., 2020). Depending
    on how the complexity is mitigated an inherent error might be introduced in the
    optimization model which potentially renders synergistic system solutions infeasible.
    Therefore, it is important to understand how replacing a first-principle model
    with a surrogate approximation changes the accuracy and quality of obtained solutions
    (Di Martino et al., 2023a). This is a complex task, which might not always be
    solvable, because of the insolvability of first-principle optimization models
    due to computational intractability. In addition, researchers have to consider
    that a surrogate model might overcome the modeling complexity of the first-principle
    models, but might result in computational intractabilities nevertheless due to
    the increase of the optimization model size (Pistikopoulos et al., 2021). A different
    approach to overcome complexity is to utilize heuristic (instead of deterministic)
    algorithms for the solution generation, such as genetic algorithms. However, in
    these cases no certificate of optimality can be attested to obtained solutions
    (Desale et al., 2015). Thus, a more optimal synergistic solution might not be
    revealed due to the selected solution generation approach. Efficient resource
    management and the development of synergistic supply systems go hand in hand with
    an accurate identification of strengths and weaknesses of the systems involved.
    Conducting a holistic performance analysis considering multiple assessment criteria
    permits the detection of discrepancies hindering systems productivity and consequently
    the systems synergy. Therefore, it is essential to design a decision-making scheme
    that guides policymakers in establishing priorities (Namany et al., 2021) and
    sectorial strategies (Namany et al., 2022) based on the synergy assessment of
    the overall system. The identification of trade-offs and potential synergies can
    be achieved by quantitative optimization frameworks for a better understanding
    of the interconnected nature of the FEWN. In turn, these tools identify challenges
    and interdependencies across multiple sectors and actors for the assessment of
    (i) policy coherence, (ii) the potential of various policy mechanisms, and (iii)
    resource planning and implementation impacts of specific technologies and infrastructure
    at a large scale. This provides an opportunity to engage key stakeholders, thereby
    offering a cross-sectoral understanding of associated challenges and opportunities
    (Stephan et al., 2018). Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that developed
    frameworks are inclusive of all stakeholders and correspond to the multi-scale
    nature of the FEWN (Daher and Mohtar, 2015), are able to assess the synergy between
    water, energy and food resources, and include integrative and holistic management
    strategies to plan for future allocation of these resources (Mohtar and Daher,
    2016). The interested reader is referred to the follow-up work of Daher et al.
    (2019) who present a modeling framework which introduces guidelines to address
    these challenges. Overall, the quality of synergy assessment of FEWN optimization
    tools dictates not only the relevance and practicability of the tool but also
    its ability to address the global challenges of increasing disparity in resource
    demand and supply, together with the mitigation of climate change implications
    (Mohtar and Daher, 2012). 5. Conclusion In this work, relevant FEWN literature
    reviews and ongoing FEWN optimization studies with special focus on how decision-making
    is facilitated have been summarized. The Tables located in Appendix A Literature
    reviews, Appendix B Food–energy–water Nexus optimization studies, as well as the
    Excel version of the compiled information in the supplementary material, can be
    understood as a glossary for reviewing FEWN optimization studies. This aids researchers
    in identifying relevant FEWN studies according to their research focus. To uncover
    how informed decision-making is derived, FEWN optimization studies have been classified
    according to their focus and objectives into Resource Management, Design of Supply
    Systems, Operation of Supply Systems, Design and Operation of Supply Systems,
    Synergy Assessment, or Resiliency, Security and Sustainability. Each of these
    groups have been analyzed in terms of: • the most common encountered challenges,
    • the utilized modeling approaches, • the selected decision variables, • the spatial
    and time scale, • the objective functions, • the optimization model formulation,
    • and the selected sub-systems. This review has uncovered a number of gaps in
    FEWN considerations in sustainable FEWN system analysis, namely: Table A.3. Utilized
    FEWN literature reviews for Table 1. Entries are sorted by year and number of
    citations according to Web of Science. Query keywords: FEWN & (Modeling OR Optimization)

    Modeling Approaches Semertzidis (2015) Energy Management • that the decision-making
    itself has not yet been investigated in detail in FEWN literature reviews, • that
    the incorporation of all aspects of the FEWN is still a challenge, • that the
    interconnection between FEWN systems and society has to be further investigated,
    • and that the implications of uncertainty for the resiliency, robustness and
    security of process systems is not yet well defined. Overall, the time-dependent
    simultaneous design and optimization of supply systems remains one of the most
    challenging FEWN optimization domains due to its modeling and computational complexity.
    Additionally, this review contributes: • A generic FEWN resource-task network
    optimization model, – illustrating how the model formulation connects to the FEWN
    optimization classification, – how the selected time scale influences the modeling
    formulation, – and how the selected spatial scale influences the synergy assessment.
    • How selected modeling and approximation strategies, as well as the solution
    algorithm selection might influence the optimal solution derivation and therefore
    the synergy assessment of the system. • How policy-making and sectoral strategies
    can influence the interdependent optimal solution generation for informed decision-making.
    • How uncertainty relates to security, resiliency and robustness considerations
    and can potentially be handled with flexibility analysis by explicitly mapping
    feasible regions of optimal solutions. • That for a sustainable clean energy transition
    and sustainable energy supply systems in general, holistic FEWN thinking has to
    be systematically incorporated, the most direct way being via land-use optimization.
    Generally, the synergy assessment of FEWN systems stands at the center of sustainable
    holistic decision-making. The system modeling, together with the implicit system
    boundaries and definitions significantly and inherently influence the limitations
    of derived synergistic solutions. Declaration of competing interest The authors

  description: The greenhouse climate is a complex dynamic system that requires careful

    The energy used by greenhouse (GH) actuators has an indirect but detrimental effect

    (PID) controllers are unable to determine the desired setpoints for the greenhouse
    microclimate. In this study, an innovative approach to monitoring the greenhouse
    microclimate is proposed, the Guidance Control Unit (GCU), which optimizes the
    setpoints of PID controllers for energy efficiency. The proposed system goes through
    two stages. The first uses Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) to minimize greenhouse
    energy consumption based on optimal setpoints generated using the non-dominating
    sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The second stage replaces the MOO with a

    After training and testing the RBFNN offline on the generated data, it was used
    to detect the optimal setpoints for the PID controllers in any weather conditions.
    The resulting setpoints represent two critical climatic variables, indoor temperature
    and relative humidity, and are provided to the PID controllers with values that
    take account of external disturbances. The proposed system showed good detection
    of the optimal setpoints and maintained the greenhouse system's energy efficiency
    at over 25.88%, the overshoot at less 10.92% and rise time showed 11.27 % with
    an average RMSE of 0.069 for the RBFNN. There was only a minor (0.0017%) difference
    in prediction error between the results using RBFNN and NSGA-II. The proposed
    system fulfilled the study's objectives by detection the optimal setpoints of
    PID controllers while saving energy and can also be applied to other complex systems,
    such as industrial buildings, that require more than one optimization step.

    controlOptimal setpointPID controllers 1. Introduction 1.1. Motivation and state
    of the art of the study Agriculture is a key sector in the global effort towards
    sustainability. However, recent shifts have led to serious considerations regarding
    implementing modern agricultural production systems. Environmental changes, increasing
    pollution (for instance, the Netherlands plans to close its remaining coal plants
    by 2030 as part of a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions by 25% before 2020, a goal
    likely unattainable due to cost constraints [1]), a steadily increasing global
    population (it is projected that by 2050, the world’s population will reach 10
    billion [2]), and a lack of food security (South Africa has experienced a decrease
    of up to 35% in food security [3]), and the world’s declining water resources,
    are but a few. Consequently, it is necessary to consider and implement innovative
    approaches to agricultural production in order to enhance both crop yield and
    quality. E. Iddio et al. & T. Karanisa et al. contend that greenhouse (GH) cultivation
    is one of the most effective current methods to secure food production [4], [5].
    Furthermore, greenhouses are highly efficient cultivation systems that can produce
    yields per unit area that are up to 10 times higher than traditional open-field
    cultivation methods [6], [7]. This predominance of the GH in production comes
    from several reasons, the most important of which are: controlled environment,
    extended growing season, protection from external factors, efficient resource
    utilization, crop customization, and reduced losses. Nonetheless, greenhouses
    (GHs) are highly non-linear, strongly coupled, Multi-Input/Multi-Output (MIMO)
    systems, and are greatly affected by outside and inside climate conditions [8].
    The GH climate can be modified to provide an optimal environment by adding ventilation,
    heating, fogging, and CO2 enrichment systems to create an ideal microclimate for
    plants making them very energy intensive [9], [10]. Moreover, Shen et al. and
    E. Ravishankar et al. state that the energy use accounts for 50% of the overall
    production costs in GH systems and the technology employed to regulate the microclimate
    has a significant impact on the energy consumption [11], [12]. Therefore, in practice,
    the complexity of the GH climate makes its control extremely difficult. Likewise,
    it is well recognized that interior temperature and relative humidity are intricately
    linked and must be controlled to enhance the energy efficiency of GHs. Currently,
    there are two different routines for optimal control in GH cultivation. One approach
    involves searching for optimal control strategies based on economic performance
    criteria, such as total profit, and using these strategies to regulate the indoor
    climate. The other approach focuses on finding the optimal setpoints for GH climate
    by solving optimization problems related to energy consumption. However, both
    routines face significant challenges. The crop growth and climate system are two
    subsystems with different timescales, making it difficult for conventional control
    methods to handle the complexity. Long-term weather forecasts are unreliable due
    to uncertainty. Inaccurate models of crop growth and GH climate further complicate
    optimal control approaches. High-dimensional non-convex optimization problems
    and numerous states and control constraints also pose difficulties in finding
    globally optimal solutions [13]. Thus, intelligent monitoring of the greenhouse
    climate is essential to finding the optimal set point for healthy plant growth
    and thus increasing energy efficiency. Accordingly, for decades researchers have
    concentrated their attention on enhancing the greenhouses’ microclimate using
    different types of controllers [14]. Examples include predictive controllers [15],
    [16], fuzzy logic controllers [17], [18], optimal controllers [19], [20], adaptive
    controllers [21], robust controllers [22], PID controllers [23], etc. However,
    the vast majority of these controllers could not meet the real requirements of
    the GH systems, due to the dynamic and complex environments of the greenhouses.
    On the other hand, most automatic control systems in industry employ PID controllers
    to regulate many different variables, including flow, temperature, pressure, etc.
    This is because PID controllers’ straightforward structure, reliability, and simplicity
    of use has resulted in their being adopted in 95% of industrial and manufacturing
    operations [24], [25]. Although PID controllers are widely used, their performance
    still depends on their ability to define the appropriate setpoints when used in
    MIMO systems. Moreover, PIDs have significant quality limitations as they account
    for neither the complexity of nonlinear dynamics and operational uncertainty,
    nor system disturbance effects [26]. Therefore, the GH microclimate presents a
    serious challenge for traditional PID controllers. However, the optimal GH climate
    setpoint has a significant impact on both energy consumption and crop yield. Therefore,
    unpredictable weather introduces complexity in solving this optimization problem.
    To address this challenge, Y. Su and L. Xu proposed an online receding horizon
    MOO that considers the trade-off between total energy consumption and final crop
    yield, resulting in a set of favourable GH climate setpoints [27]. Recently, advanced
    artificial intelligence (AI) control techniques have been implemented using fuzzy
    logic and neural networks. A. Labidi et al. present a greenhouse environmental
    control system that utilizes fuzzy logic to manage and regulate humidity setpoint
    [28]. M.C. Subin et al. designed a Fuzzy PID controller based on the Mamdani model
    to achieve a smooth control procedure to ensuring stability in greenhouse climate
    control [29]. J. Riahi et al. proposed a dynamic model and a fuzzy controller
    for smart control of indoor temperature and humidity setpoints in a greenhouse
    [8]. T. Petrakis et al. proposed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to estimate
    indoor temperature and relative humidity of the GH climate [30]. Francik and Kurpaska
    found a three-layer MLP with 10 neurons in the hidden layer to be the most effective
    of all tested networks in a study conducted in a heated foil tunnel [31]. F. Mahmood
    et al. proposed a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for energy use
    assessment and temperature setpoint prediction in a semi-closed greenhouse [32].
    A. Daliran et al. used an ANN models, including MLP, RBF, and Gaussian Process
    Regression (GPR), were used for modelling temperature and mass of dried mint in
    a Quonset greenhouse solar dryer (GSD) [33]. Similarly, Trejo-Perea developed
    an algorithm for predicting the energy demand in greenhouses based on multiple
    regression and ANN models. L. Belhaj Salah and F. Fourati use deep neural networks
    to improve greenhouse modelling and control [34]. Although several researchers
    and practitioners have provided some very fruitful versions of their own, the
    question of establishing a comprehensive monitoring system for GH remains an untouched
    problem. According to our acquired knowledge, we know that in order to conduct
    a comprehensive monitoring system for GH, we must find the optimal setpoints for
    the critical variables with direct influence of the GH climate. However, most
    previous studies have focused only on prediction of the environment of the GH
    system and some of them consider only one factor of the GH climate. On the other
    hand, the majority of these studies lack the actual value of GHs energy reduction
    and have only focused on its prediction. Furthermore, many of the control systems
    that have been developed have limited use, for example, they are used only in
    large greenhouses or only in small greenhouses, in addition to the complexity
    of their design and implementation [35]. 1.2. Contribution of the study The main
    objective of this study is to model an intelligent monitoring system for greenhouse
    climate using artificial intelligence techniques, called (GCU-PID) that is able
    to: 1. Finding the optimal setpoints for the critical variables (temperature and
    relative humidity of the GH microclimate). 2. Reducing energy use to a minimum
    while maintaining the best indoor climate. 3. Improving the efficiency of the
    traditional PID controllers by determining the setpoint of non-linear, dynamic,
    and MIMO systems. The novelty of this study was stated by finding the optimal
    setpoints for the GH system through the traditional PID controllers away from
    manipulating with their basic parameters ( ). The GCU works in two stages: the
    first stage is the optimizer stage that uses NSGA-II to determine the optimal
    setpoints for the PID controllers. The NSGA-II works in conjunction with the mathematical
    model of the GH created using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Then, NSGA-II is used to calculate
    the percentage of energy consumption reduction corresponding to the optimal setpoints
    using the objective function. The second stage is to replace the optimizer with
    RBFNN after training and testing it offline to provide the PID controllers loop
    with the optimal setpoints at any climatic conditions that the greenhouse is exposed
    to with the minimal energy use. In this way, there is no need to use different
    values of the PID parameters ( ) which is a difficult task and mainly depend on
    the designers’ experience. In addition, regulation of PID parameters is time costly
    and incorrect selections lead to poor control performance. Therefore, all these
    drawbacks were avoided by this proposed system. The rest of paper is laid out
    as follows: greenhouse microclimate modelling is detailed in Section 2; the monitoring
    system design is presented in Section 3; the results and discussions are described
    in Section 4 before concluding in Section 5. 2. Greenhouse microclimate modelling
    2.1. Greenhouse microclimate description A description of the GH microclimate
    system is provided in this section. Fig. 1 illustrates the interaction between
    the GH microclimate, the control inputs, external disturbances, and the GH yield
    in a schematic manner. The mass/energy balance equations has traditionally been
    used to describe the microclimate of GHs [36]. These equations are employed to
    estimate the rate of change in the GH system. Similarly, state variables for the
    GH would be: temperature, relative humidity, PAR, and concentration. The plant
    state variables would be: content, organ temperature, dry weight (biomass), and
    leaf level. Most analytical dynamic models of the GH microclimate are based on
    the following state equation form: (1) In which: represents the climate state
    variables; are the plant state variables; is the control input such as heating,
    fogging, ventilation and supply flux systems, and represents external disturbances,
    and finally; is the nonlinear function. In the challenge of obtaining the optimal
    setpoints for the GH microclimate based on Eq. (1), the following two-parameter
    classes must be considered: Download : Download high-res image (317KB) Download

    that occur within a typical GH microclimate [Drawn By Author]. 1. Outdoor GH environment,
    i.e., outside temperature, outside relative humidity, intensity of solar radiation,
    maximum and minimum wind speed and the concentration. 2. Indoor GH environment
    which must be assessed by measuring inside air temperature and relative humidity.
    To achieve the optimal monitoring of the parameters affecting the GH microclimate,
    it is essential to consider the crop requirements and the economic parameters.
    These economic parameters must provide minimum energy consumption expenditures
    [37]. There are two major economic parameters that have a significant impact on
    the GH’s microclimate. The first parameter is the GH air temperature ( ) provided
    by the heaters and the second is the GH relative humidity ( ) provided by the
    fogging system. The analytic expression for GH microclimate is based on the following
    inputs: heating, fogging, injection, and ventilation as demonstrated by previous
    research in the field [38], [39]. Therefore, the interaction between the GH climate,
    crop subsystems, control inputs, and external signals creates a complex and highly
    non-linear dynamical system within the GH climate system. Consequently, modelling
    this entire system is a challenging task that requires consideration of numerous
    factors. The following subsection presents the governing equations of GH microclimate.
    2.2. Governing equations In this section, we provide a briefly present of the
    governing equations that regulate the GH microclimate. Many aspects of the GH
    need to be considered to solve the microclimate control/monitoring problem. These
    include the heat exchange with the cover and soil, heat gains from the sun, thermal
    energy lost by crop transpiration, and thermal energy released by condensation
    of water vapour in the structural cover. The energy balance of the GH microclimate
    is a multidimensional quantity that consists of heat transfer and mass exchange
    in and out of the GH system [40]. The following paragraphs present the differential
    equations used to describe the mass/energy balance equations of a GH climate [41],
    [42], [43]. In order to simulate the indoor temperature of the GH system, the
    system must first be separated into its six constituent parts. These parts are
    the cover temperature, indoor air temperature, soil surface temperature, vegetation
    temperature, and two soil sub-layer temperatures as shown in the above Fig. 1.
    Using mass/energy balance equations with the assumption of a lumped system simplifies
    system equations from second-order partial differential equations in both space
    and time, to first-order differential equations in time. Therefore, to solve GH
    climate control/monitoring problems it is necessary to consider all parts of the
    GH and its contents. This includes the heat exchange with the cover and with the
    soil; sensible heat gains from the sun; sensible thermal loss energy by crop transpiration;
    and thermal energy released by condensation of water vapour in the structural
    cover. Therefore, the energy balance equation according to Fig. 1 can be expressed
    as follows: (2) In which: is the net total change in energy (in Watts), is the
    energy acquired by the GH (in Watts), and is the energy lost by the GH (in Watts).
    The two terms in Eq. (2) must first be found to determine the total energy change
    inside the GH. For the sake of brevity, only the main equations that were used
    in the simulation process of the present study are mentioned here without the
    subsidiary equations. Therefore, the following equations will be used for simulation
    purposes in MATLAB/SIMULINK for indoor greenhouse temperature and humidity [42],
    [43]: (3) Table 1. Greenhouse parametric model and simulation disturbance inputs.

    (J ); is the water capacity of the fog system ( ); is the overall heat transfer
    coefficient ( C); is the greenhouse area ; are the indoor and outdoor temperatures
    of the GH respectively; is the ventilation rate ( /s). One of the most important
    factors affecting plant growth inside a GH is the relative humidity. Relative
    humidity affects plant health and growth rate through its effect on the level
    of water evaporation. High humidity causes mildew, while low humidity dehydrates
    the plant and reduces photosynthesis. Temperature and relative humidity are closely
    related to the nonlinear laws of thermodynamics. The relative humidity decreases
    with increasing temperature if the water content of the air remains constant.
    Therefore, relative humidity increases at night and decreases during the day,
    according to the changes in solar energy. The model describing changes in the
    water vapour content of the air inside the GH is based on the mass balance equation.
    The main source of water vapour in the equilibrium equation is plant transpiration.
    The water vapour in the air inside a GH decreases due to condensation on the inner
    side of the cover. Mass transfer due to ventilation can occur in both directions
    depending on the weather conditions inside and outside the GH [44], [45]. The
    humidity ratio inside the greenhouse per unit area can take the following form:
    (4) In which: are the indoor and outdoor humidity ratios (water vapour mass ratio,
    of dry air); is the overall coefficient for shading and leaf area index, is the
    overall coefficient for thermodynamic constants and other factors affecting evapotranspiration
    (i.e., stomata, air motion, etc.) Definitions of all remaining parameters of Eq.
    (4) is as defined in Eq. (3). Table 1 presents a list of constant parameters along
    with their corresponding values. The temperature and relative humidity are commonly
    measured air properties, highly coupled through nonlinear thermodynamic laws,
    as the following equation: (5) In which: is the humidity ratio, T is temperature
    (Kelvin), RH is relative humidity, the atmospheric pressure (KPa), and is the
    saturation pressure of water vapour (KPa). This thermodynamic equation, which
    constitutes an equality constraint to the problem of calculating optimized controller
    setpoints, can be used to convert relative humidity to absolute water content.
    2.3. Greenhouse specifications To simulate the GH system, desired setpoints, initial,
    and climatic conditions must be set. All conditions and parameters used in this
    study are depicted in Table 1. It is important to mention that the inputs used
    in the SIMULINK file were derived from external weather data, which was generated
    to represent various initial and outdoor conditions as follows: initial temperature
    and outdoor temperature range [−5, 5] °C, initial humidity and outdoor humidity
    (50%), initial density (200 ), maximum wind speed range [5], [10] , minimum wind
    speed (1 ), light intensity range [400, 600] , optimal temperature range [18],
    [25] °C, and relative humidity range [0.4, 0.7]%. Finally, changes in wind speed
    and light intensity occur every 100 s. This implies that the GH model underwent
    testing in challenging scenarios that simulated the winter conditions experienced
    in Tehran city. 2.4. Greenhouse closed-loop modelling PID controllers find extensive
    use in industrial process control, offering a broad range of applications. Two
    prevalent approaches for implementing PID controllers are open-loop and closed-loop
    systems. The open-loop model is less efficient compared to the closed-loop in
    MIMO systems, causing the response to deviate from the desired reference value
    and resulting in an error or offset. For further information, readers are encouraged
    to refer to [29]. Given the highly nonlinear nature of GH, the closed-loop method
    was chosen for this study. The general mathematical representation of a PID controller,
    which is typically expressed in the ideal form as shown in Eq. (6) was mentioned
    [46]. (6) where: is the output control signal at time t; is the proportional gain;
    is the integral gain; is the derivative gain; is the error between the desired
    setpoint and the measured process variable at time t; represents the integral
    of the error over time, and represents the derivative of the error with respect
    to time. The three actions are multiplied by their respective gain values, and
    the results are summed together to generate the output control signal. Fig. 2
    illustrates the general block diagram of the PID controller for the greenhouse.
    A closed-loop model for a winter day is constructed using Eqs. (3), (4) and (5),
    and Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of closed-loop of the GH system. Therefore,
    the closed-loop can be called a Gray-Box model as represented in the Fig. 4, and

    inputs, while the second block (right hand side) illustrates the response of the
    mathematical model with the unit step inputs. Then, the outputs of these two blocks
    are compiled by Bus Creator in the SIMULINK library to evaluate the PID performance
    and find the optimal setpoints corresponding to the Heaviside parameters as illustrated

    controller. 3. Monitoring system design 3.1. Calculation of optimal monitoring
    setpoints In this section, the novel proposed monitoring system will be presented.
    The modelling procedure assumes the setpoints (temperature and relative humidity)
    are bounded, as will described in the next paragraphs. The primary objective is
    to find the optimal setpoints of the PID control unit, subject to weather conditions
    uncertainties. Several cost functions have been suggested as performance criteria
    for control systems in the literature such as: integral of absolute error (IAE),
    integral of time multiplied by absolute error (ITAE), integral of squared error
    (ISE), and integral of time multiplied by squared error (ITSE) [47]. All of these
    criteria differ according to the type of objective function, which, in turn, is
    classified as a performance criterion based on the time or frequency domain. However,
    the efficiency of the PID controllers is defined by the transient response behaviour.
    The desired response behaviour usually includes the following time domain parameters:
    rise time ( , overshoot ( ), settling time , the integral error, and the integral
    of the inputs . The most common cost functions are time-domain integral error
    performance parameters based on the error signal between the system output and
    reference setpoints as following: (7) Consequently, optimizing the control system
    response using the IAE performance criteria can result in responses with relatively
    small overshoots but long settling times or vice versa [48]. (8) where is the
    time at which the response reaches steady state. Therefore, the objective function
    includes the performance parameters to pose it as a minimization problem and the
    cost function specified in Eq. (8). Additionally, the heater, fog and fan energies
    can be incorporated into the it to penalize excessive energy utilization in the
    control signal. Hence, the objective function is given by: (9) However, reducing
    these time domain parameters (performance parameters) is the goal of designing
    an efficient controller and equates to improving the response of the signal input.
    Typically, two key elements – the speed of response and the proximity of the output
    to the reference (desired) input – can be used to describe the system’s transient
    response. The rise and peak timings are indicative of how quickly a response occurs,
    while the maximum overshoot and settling time describe how close the output is
    to the reference response [49]. The influence of each parameter defined by Eq.
    (9) is determined by a weighting factor . Each parameter’s variable range and
    percentage contribution to the overall fitness value are both unknown, as are
    the ranges over which each parameter can vary. Due to their simplicity, unit step
    responses are frequently used in the evaluation of control system performance.
    However, Heaviside functions, also known as step functions, are commonly employed
    in control systems to model optimal setpoint changes. Their suitability for representing
    abrupt transitions arises from their discontinuity at zero, enabling them to indicate
    sudden shifts in a system. Mathematically, Heaviside functions offer simplicity,
    making them convenient for modelling setpoint changes. Control systems encounter
    various factors prompting setpoint adjustments, and Heaviside functions effectively
    capture these changes by specifying the timing or conditions of transition. Additionally,
    Heaviside functions are closely associated with step response analysis, facilitating
    the assessment of system stability, performance, and other characteristics in
    response to setpoint modifications. For more information, readers are encouraged
    to refer to [50], [51]. Optimal setpoints for operation within the practical range
    of the GH microclimate was therefore made using the Heaviside function as defined
    in Eqs. (10) and (11) for the temperature and relative humidity, respectively:
    (10) (11) By adjusting the magnitude, time, and duration of the step change, can
    be create various input signals using the Heaviside function to evaluate different
    aspects of control system performance. It is important to ensure that the chosen
    constraints are appropriate for the specific control system being evaluated and
    aligned with the desired performance metrics to be assessed. Therefore, the constraints
    of Eq. (10) are as follows: and . These constraints are chosen based on the desired
    temperature setpoints and the time domain parameter of the control system, respectively.
    On the other hand, the constraints of Eq. (11) are: and . These constraints are
    chosen based on the desired relative humidity setpoints and the time domain parameter
    of the control system, respectively. Readers are referred to [52] for more details
    on the control system performance evaluation. Fig. 6 shows the graphical representation
    of the Heaviside function for both optimal setpoints. The first plot (a) illustrates
    the temperature setpoint, in which is the desired temperature setpoint, while
    the second plot (b) represents humidity setpoint, in which is the desired relative
    humidity setpoint. The Heaviside Function H(t) take the following general form:
    (12) In Eqs. (10) and (11) the optimal variables A, B, C, D, E, F, , , , and are
    determined when the objective function is minimized. The constrained parameters
    of the Heaviside functions were calculated by the evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II)
    and reflect the optimal setpoints for both temperature and relative humidity setpoints.
    This implies that the optimization problem to be addressed is as follows: For
    , the optimization algorithm employs Eq. (9) as the objective function for the
    temperature setpoint. On the other hand, for , the optimization algorithm uses
    Eq. (9) as the objective function for the relative humidity setpoint. Download

    climate The proposed monitoring system consists of two consecutive loops. The
    first loop is the Guidance Control Unit (GCU) loop and the second is the PID control
    unit loop (feedback controllers). These two loops make up the configuration of
    the hierarchical control system. The GCU acts as an optimizer and then uses Radial
    Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) - a machine-learning approach. The next
    subsections detailed the mechanism of the proposed system in details. The general
    block diagram for the intelligent monitoring model for greenhouse climate is presented
    in Fig. 7. 3.2.1. Optimizer stage The optimizer serves as the first stage in the
    GCU loop, aiming to optimize two key objectives: temperature and relative humidity,
    in order to find their optimal setpoints. It then determines the energy reduction
    corresponding to the optimal setpoints. The optimization process encompasses two
    stages. Firstly, a single objective optimization (SOO) is performed to optimize
    each objective individually within the proposed system to validate the new method
    presented. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) is employed to calculate
    the optimal setpoints for the PID control unit based on two objectives: temperature
    and relative humidity. In this step, the non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm
    (NSGA-II) is utilized. By using NSGA-II incorporating the objective function and
    the performance of PID controllers, the reduction in energy consumption corresponding
    to the optimal setpoints can be calculated. Finally, the outputs of the GCU are
    the optimal setpoints to the feedback loop at minimum energy consumption which
    are: Hence, the GCU serves as the ‘brain’ for the entire system to predict the
    PID setpoints in real-time according to GH needs. Then, the PID controllers work
    to minimize tracking errors between computed setpoints (optimized setpoints in
    the GCU loop) and the output measured in the GH microclimate. In addition, they
    compensate for disturbances to obtain the desired setpoints for the GH as indicated
    in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (423KB) Download : Download full-size

    3.2.2. RBFNN stage After completing the optimizer stage and collecting the necessary
    data, the subsequent stage begins, known as the Artificial Neural Network, specifically
    RBFNN stage. The targets for training and testing the RBFNN are obtained from
    the outputs of the optimization and closed-loop (SIMULINK) model. While the inputs
    of the RBFNN were the same as those of the closed-loop model mentioned before.
    Once the RBFNN has been trained and tested using this data, it can directly supply
    the control unit with the optimized setpoints, eliminating the need for the previous
    optimizer stage. At this point, optimal setpoints for GH climate can be detected
    regardless of external weather conditions. Therefore, the outputs of the RBFNN
    serve as the optimized setpoints, which can be utilized by the PID controllers
    as follows. However, MLPs have played an important role in universal approximation
    and in the control of nonlinear systems such as GH environments. RBFNNs are structurally
    simpler than MLPs, making the design process easier and training more efficient.
    It is strongly based on the function approximation theory and has many advantages
    that make it highly suited to the current modelling problem. The RBFNN structure
    consists of three fully connected layers: input, hidden, and output layers as
    shown in Fig. 8. The input layer connects the network to its environment (sensory
    units), the validity of this structure has been demonstrated by fulfilling the
    Stone–Weierstrass theorem [53]. The number of neurons in the input layer is equal
    to the number of variables to be controlled. The hidden layer applies a non-linear
    transformation from the input space to the hidden space (feature space) which
    in general has a higher dimension than the input space. Given two sets of points
    and and a function such that , the task of the RBFNN is to construct the mapping
    in such a way that [54], [55]: (13) The output layer applies a linear transformation
    from the hidden space ( ) to the output space ( ). The Gaussian function ( ),
    is commonly used in neural network applications as it avoids getting trapped at
    local minima in the optimization processes involved in control systems. The output,
    therefore, approaches zero as distance from the centre point approaches infinity
    [56]. In contrast, the global sigmoid function approaches 1 as the net input goes
    to infinity. The third layer of the RBFNN is a standard linear layer. The Gaussian
    function is defined as follows: (14) where is the input vector , is the norm operator,
    usually Euclidean, is the centre vector of neural network j, is the width vector
    of Gaussian function indicating where . The weight value is: (15) By this formulation,
    the network passes through all N data points, creating a strict interpolation
    (SI) problem (i.e., when measured values are not available). Interpolation is
    a mathematical technique that estimates intermediate/missing values. RBFNN is
    commonly used to solve multivariate SI problems by choosing a function f of the

    distance between neighbouring centres (maximum distance between hidden neuron)
    and , where n is the number of hidden neurons. This ensures an appropriate degree
    of overlap between the basic functions. The weights and basis selected in this
    layer should minimize the sum of square error performance index over the training
    set. RBFNN should be trained by the data with multi-input and multi-output offline
    method. In offline learning (batch processing), the weight changes depend on the
    whole dataset training, defining a global cost function. The RBFNN is trained
    repeatedly until the cost function is minimized. The gradient descent method is
    straightforward and easy to implement, but it is highly sensitive to the initial
    value. When an inappropriate initial value is provided, the initial cost function
    of the network may be excessively large, leading to a high likelihood of getting
    stuck in a local minimum during the iteration process. This can severely hamper
    or render the learning process ineffective. To achieve better outcomes, a combination
    of the k-means clustering algorithm, recursive least squares (RLS), and gradient
    descent method is employed. It has been demonstrated that this algorithm, known
    as “k-means clustering, recursive least squares (RLS)”, which involves training
    the hidden layer using the k-means method and the output layer using the RLS method,
    possesses the advantages of computational simplicity and accelerated convergence.
    As a result, it has become a more practical approach for designing RBFNN. In this
    study, the k-means clustering method is utilized during the initial iteration
    to determine the centre and spread of the RBFNN, which then serve as the initial
    values for the gradient descent method. Since the weight parameter significantly
    impacts the network’s approximation effectiveness, the RLS algorithm is employed
    to calculate it in order to avoid getting trapped in local minima during the iterative
    process. This proceeds by gradient descent to reduce errors and can be used to
    train reformulated RBFNN. The instantaneous cost function (value of the error
    energy for neuron) is: (20) where N is the number of training examples, the error
    signal for the iteration at the output of neuron is . In which t(i) and y(i) are
    the target and actual outputs for neuron i calculated using the current weights
    of the network at iteration n as defined in Eq. (17). The new estimate of each
    weight vector , , is obtained by incrementing its current estimate by an amount
    as [59], [60]: (21) where is the learning rate, is the error of the output layer
    defined above. Many statistical indicators can be used to assess model accuracy
    with smaller values denoting more accurate prediction ability. The mean absolute
    error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are employed to evaluate the prediction
    results as shown in the following equations: 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): (22)
    2. Root mean squared error (RMSE): (23) where are the actual and predicted output
    values. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Simulation setup The applicability of the
    proposed approach is demonstrated and compared to competing approaches such as
    SOO and RBFNN in terms of setpoints detection and PID performance. The first simulation
    case has been conducted to show the robustness of the proposed method and the
    ability of the RBFNN in detecting PID setpoints. To do so, the proposed method
    based on various values of weather conditions have been applied to the process
    with varying parameters of the optimization algorithm to generate the necessary
    data (setpoints). Subsequently, the RBFNN is trained and tested using the target
    data (setpoints) generated from the preceding step. The pseudocode for the generation
    of setpoints can be seen in Table 2. The initial parameters, main external disturbances,
    and setpoints were used in the simulation of GA to produce the design matrix Table
    4 are plotted in Fig. 9 and part of them are presented in Table 3. The GA for
    optimization and the mathematical model of the GH environment were coupled to
    generate output or the design matrix data. Table 2. Pseudocode of the RBFNN learning.

    Seventy percent of the design matrix data in Table 4 were used as the target for
    training the RBFNN, while the remaining 30% were reserved for testing purposes.
    The RBFNN was characterized by specific attributes, such as utilizing the K-means
    algorithm for learning, the root mean square error (RMSE) as the objective function,
    a maximum of 100 iterations, 116 clusters (k), and utilizing a learning rate of
    0.02. The RBFNN’s training results showed excellent performance and attained RMSEs
    on training and testing of 0.19 and 0.11 respectively. The result is plotted in
    Fig. 10. The first plot (a) demonstrates the RBFNN training, while the second
    plot (b) shows the performance of the RBFNN in the training phase. In addition,

    PID controllers. The initial conditions were the same as those in Table 5. The
    objective function shown in Eq. (9) was used. The comparison of the results was

    optimization phase produced excellent results for temperature setpoint detection.
    The optimum temperature for the RBFNN (black dashed line) closely matches the
    optimum temperature for GA (blue solid line). In addition, the delay time is very
    small (as indicated by the red arrow), however, and there is a delay in responding
    to the GH temperature, which is understandable given that the large amount of
    air inside the GH requires some time to warm up during initial operation. Similarly,
    Fig. 13(b), shows that excellent results were also obtained for the humidity setpoint
    by significantly reducing overshoot in the system — which is important considering
    the significance of humidity to plant growth and health. Relative humidity must
    be contained within acceptable limits to prevent saturated water vapour condensing
    on cover or crops. The proposed system was therefore verified as effective and
    the next stage of optimization could commence using the NSGA-II optimization to
    generate the data with a minimum energy reduction to train and test the RBFNN
    to find the optimal setpoints for the closed-loop model. Download : Download high-res

    basis function neural network (MOO-RBFNN) The proposed system was implemented
    in a SIMULINK/ MATLAB using NSGA-II to find the optimal setpoints and energy reduction
    for the GH system. The NSGA-II operators and parameters are presented in Table
    6. The initial parameters, main external disturbances, and desired setpoints as
    depicted in Fig. 9 and Table 3 were used in the simulation process to produce
    the output or design matrix Table 7. The NSGA-II algorithm and the mathematical
    model of the GH climate were coupled to generate the output data. The output data
    in Table 7 were used as a target values to train and test the RBFNN to find the
    final inputs (optimal setpoints) for the PID control unit. Importantly, the setpoint
    data in Table 7 produced an average energy reduction, average overshoot reduction,
    and average improvement of rise time of 25.93%, 10.94%, and 11.29%, respectively,
    part of it is shown in Table 8. These values were obtained from the energy reduction
    algorithm, which dealt with the desired and optimal values for each of the heater,
    fogging, and fan included in the objective function Eq. (9) to find the total
    energy reduction rate. Finally, the inputs to the PID control unit provided the
    ultimate goal of reducing the energy consumption of the GH to the lowest possible
    level. To verify this stage, the RBFNN results must be compared with those of
    the NSGA-II. These were combined to form the main inputs of the PID control unit.
    An example simulation case is explained here to show the validity and robustness
    of the system. In this case, GH model, initial conditions, and climatic conditions
    were considered the same as those in Table 1. The Pareto front is shown in Fig.
    14, and the results show that the two objectives temperature and relative humidity
    setpoints compete for decision variables. The value of the second objective relative
    humidity ( ) declines rapidly as the value of the first objective temperature
    ( ) remains almost unchanged as it approaches point B. However, the second objective
    ( ) began to change slowly as the first objective ( ) increased approaching point
    C. This implies that in most cases, the Pareto front from A to C marks the most
    desirable points. As a result, the two points may offer an acceptable trade-off,
    and the decision-maker can choose the optimal final answer based on his/her preferences.

    controllers for the GH is implemented to control the GH temperature and relative
    humidity. It is observed from the Fig. 15(a) and (b) that there is no initial
    overshoot with RBFNN-PID when compared with the NSGA-II -PID and smooth control
    action is achieved for step time of every 100 s with fast rise time. Here disturbance
    variables are kept constant and setpoint change is analysed for every 100 samples
    for a total time of 8000 samples for temperature and 2000 samples for relative
    humidity. Fig. 15(a) shows the effectiveness of the Heaviside step responses with
    the PID controller at the temperature response setpoint. The plot shows a good
    response for the 23 °C indoor air temperature setpoint in terms of no delay time
    in the response of the system. Likewise, Fig. 15(b) shows a very good response
    to the relative humidity setpoint at 40%, since the rise time, and the overshoot
    of the RBFNN is very close to NSGA-II. The difference in errors (RMSEs) between
    RBFNN and NSGA-II was only 0.0017% demonstrating that both responses show very
    low steady-state error and have good steady-state performance. Table 9 depicts
    a comparative study of performance characteristics of the GH model designed with
    NSGA-II-PID and RBFNN-PID strategies. For any good controller settings, overshoot
    and rise time should be minimal. Based on the aforementioned analysis, it is advisable
    to utilize RBFNN-PID for GH monitoring. After undergoing training and testing
    on data from the previous optimization stage, RBFNN-PID can generate optimal setpoints
    and effectively reduce energy consumption. Download : Download high-res image

    for two conflicting objectives. In summary, the intelligent monitoring system
    proposed in this study, employing the RBFNN stage, demonstrated excellent performance
    in detecting GH microclimate setpoints, particularly for temperature and relative
    humidity. This performance was achieved while minimizing energy consumption and
    improving overshoot and rise times, as evidenced in Table 9. This table calculates
    the changes in the energy consumption, overshoot, and rise time because the temperature
    and humidity are very interrelated factors in the GH system. Therefore, it is
    not wise to separate them when calculating GH efficiency. Moreover, the maximum
    energy consumption change was 25.88%, while the overshoot and rise time changes
    were 10.92% and 11.27%, respectively. Finally, the proposed system using RBFNN
    attained high energy efficiency with an average RMSE of 0.069 and thus fulfilled
    the objective of this study to find the PID setpoints without manipulating with
    its parameters ( ) and reducing energy use. Download : Download high-res image

    studies analysis with Fuzzy-PID controllers in literature review This section
    presents the simulation implementation of the proposed GH model and presents the
    simulation outcomes. Additionally, a comparison is made between the NSGA-II-PID
    and RBFNN-PID strategies. To ensure the dependability of our proposed system,
    we compare our results with those documented in literature [29]. The GH parameters
    utilized for this analysis are listed in Table 10. The specified active air mixing
    volume for temperature and humidity is denoted as , which is equal to 0.65 times
    the total volume. The setpoint changes for the inlet temperature and humidity
    ratios are varied in steps ranging from 18 to 21 °C and from 16.5 to 19.5 g [H2O]
    kg−1 respectively. The output is recorded for every sample time of 400 s, and
    for each setpoint change, a steady-state error is observed. The performance of
    the Fuzzy-based PID controller is presented in Table 11. Upon examining Table
    11, it is evident that the focus of the study was on the change in rise time,
    which showed a good response. However, in the GH system, the rise time does not
    play a significant role. Moreover, the fast dynamic response of the GH climate
    is in contrast to the slower response of crop growth to input changes. Additionally,
    the study did not account for energy consumption. Table 10. Parameters of greenhouse.

    W/ , reduced to 60% In our study, we achieved a good rise time of 11.27 s and
    reduced the average overshoot by 10.92% for both temperature and relative humidity.
    Furthermore, we managed to decrease energy consumption by more than 25% across
    all measurements. These indicators demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
    system over the Fuzzy-based PID controller, as reported in Table 9. Another study
    in our literature aimed to predict energy utilization and temperature setpoints,
    as mentioned in [32]. The study proposed a robust model predictive control (MPC)
    framework for temperature control and energy utilization in a semi-closed greenhouse.
    It compared an artificial neural network (ANN) model with an analytical model
    and found that the ANN had higher prediction accuracy. Comparisons showed that
    the robust MPC outperformed them, achieving lower temperature setpoint errors
    (RMSE) of 0.32 °C in winter. Additionally, it led to energy reductions of 9.67%
    in winter, demonstrating improved temperature and energy management in uncertain
    conditions. However, in our study, we present the utilization RBFNN to predict
    two key GH parameters: temperature and relative humidity. It also incorporates
    optimization algorithm to calculate energy reduction by determining optimal setpoints.
    The findings demonstrate a significant energy reduction of over 25% during the
    winter season. In contrast, the study [32] employed an ANN solely for temperature
    prediction, resulting in a mere 9.67% reduction in energy usage. Consequently,
    the RBFNN-based approach in this paper surpasses the ANN-based study in terms
    of effectiveness. Table 11. Performance analysis of the greenhouse system. Empty

    GH microclimate. This model leading to detection optimal setpoints for the PID
    controllers’ unit based on two optimization stages by the main unit which is GCU
    unit. The RBFNN was trained using the output data from the first stage in the
    GCU unit, where NSGA-II was used to minimize the energy usage in GH climate to
    a minimum. Therefore, the RBFNN detection mechanism showed a superior ability
    to provide the desired temperature and relative humidity setpoints under different
    disturbances, with an RMSE of 0.069. Furthermore, the RBFNN performance was verified
    by comparing it with the NSGA-II results. The comparison indicated that there
    was only a very small (0.0017) difference between the two approaches. Importantly,
    this model approach keeps the energy reduction rate above 25%. In summary, the
    study shows the ability of the proposed monitoring system to detect the desired
    temperature and relative humidity setpoints of the GH microclimate through the
    traditional PID controllers away from manipulating with their basic parameters
    ( ). Finally, this model can be used for other and more complex systems such industrial
    buildings and poultry farms when the necessary data is available. Abbreviations

    has been gaining momentum for implementing smart irrigation and precision agriculture.
    Thus, the chapter surveys a selection of recent studies, corroborating AI, IoT,

    also sheds light on the notion of virtual water, proposes strategies to deal with
    water scarcity, and highlights the essential components to achieve effective smart

    at developing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for water saving drip
    irrigation experiment that will regulate the soil moisture content within the
    desired field capacity and above the wilting point, while scheduling irrigation

    of the most precious resources on the earth, it is therefore imperative to measure,
    control and preserve for sustainable agricultural production and healthy living.
    The severe global competition for food and water is due to the effect of increase
    in world''s population and climate change. This has increased the interest on
    how to achieve optimal use of scarce resources such as water using precision irrigation
    aimed at increasing food production and water saving [1]. The rate of water loss
    known as reference evapotranspiration (ETo) from plant and soil is dependant on
    the nonlinear dynamic change of soil, plant, and weather interaction. The regular
    change in evapotranspiration has effect in the available water in the soil for
    plant use, as a very high rate of ETo could lead to plant wilting. This remains
    a significant issue affecting the control strategies for crop irrigation, as there
    is a need for irrigation controller to adaptively adjust to the dynamic variations
    of soil, plant and weather parameters to ensure effective irrigation management
    [2]. Commonly, most farmers do not consider these dynamic varying factors when
    making irrigation scheduling decisions, which may lead to many draw backs such
    as low water use efficiency, reduced yield and more energy usage in driving pumps
    to supply of water for irrigation [3]. Consequently, the real time monitoring
    of weather, soil, and plant parameters within a cultivation environment using
    Internet of things (IoT) as well as wireless sensor networks (WSN) can enable
    the realization of smart management of different methods irrigation systems [4],
    [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. There are various control strategies that can be
    used for irrigation management. The irrigation control strategies are basically
    categorized in open loop and close loop control methods. Irrigation decisions
    using open-loop control approach are managed based on the farmer intuition and
    using either on or off irrigation timers to control opening and closing of valves.
    The irrigation timing and volume is often specified and applied based on the farmers
    experience without considering sensors feedback on the changing parameters that
    has effect on plant such as soil moisture contents, and other weather parameters
    [11], [12], [13] The issues affecting with open-loop control of irrigation system
    affected by various environmental disturbances such as evapotranspiration, effect
    of different growth stage requirement of plants (Kc), and requires regular adjustment
    to ensure better performance [14]. The close loop control approach has been reported
    to be able to address the issue associated with open loop through the use of sensor
    based signal as feedback to keep the measured output condition close to the desired
    trajectory while deciding the duration of water supply to plants [14,15]. Research
    work on close loop control of irrigation have been implemented through simulation
    using the linear control approach such as proportional integral differential (PID)
    [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and also linear quadratic regulator (LQR) [21], [22],
    [23], [24], [25], [26]. The works reported a good control performance through
    simulation, but their real time deployment on hardware was not thoroughly explored.
    Similarly, several works on intelligent control such as fuzzy logic and expert
    system approach where rules and formulated based on expert knowledge of the dynamics
    of the system was used to decide the timing and volume irrigation were carried
    out [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. This method has
    proven to be effective, but the drawback of this method is that no matter how
    well formulated the rules are, there will always be situations that don''t exist
    in the rules. In most cases fuzzy based irrigation controllers are not often adaptive
    to the varying dynamics of plant, weather, and soil parameters. Also, reported
    in literatures is the use of artificial neural networks for soil moisture prediction
    [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]] as well
    as metaheuristic algorithm for irrigation optimization [49], [50], [51], [52],
    [53], [54], [55]. The works were carried out as a good proof of concept through
    simulation, but the need for training of the ANN models on embedded hardware makes
    their real time implementation for irrigation of plant cultivation challenging,
    hence difficult to access their performance and suitability for farmers use. Also,
    the use of predictive models for irrigation scheduling has been reported in Refs.
    [56], [57], [58], [59]. The predictive models were used to predict the future
    trajectory of the control variable, while optimizing the cost function according
    to the reference trajectory. However, the work was only conducted through simulation
    only without experimental validation. In addition, the use of generalized predictive
    control (GPC) method for scheduling irrigation for tomato plant was reported to
    have achieved 20% water saving. However, the controller was not designed to handle
    constraint management on the control variables as well as the changing dynamics
    of the crop coefficient effect on ETo [60,61]. MPC is a model based algorithm
    that utilizes the model of a process to predict the future trajectory of the system
    controlled, by solving an online optimization at every time stamp to compute the
    future control action [62]. One of the issue reported in literature is on the
    applicability of MPC for process control application will provide a burden on
    producing high computational complexity associated with solving online optimization
    repeatedly on hardware [63]. Since the application of the MPC controller is in
    the area of precision irrigation agriculture has a slow process response, the
    integration of the concept of hourly event based triggering has been considered
    in this paper to decide the sampling instant at which the controller will solve
    online optimization to compute the optimal control action needed to minimize the
    error between the predicted moisture content of the soil and the set point trajectory
    can be used to address this issue. The summary of the comparison of the various
    related literatures to the proposed technique is illustrated in Table 1, where
    the proposed technique has more features considered in terms of monitored parameters,
    performance evaluation as well as implementation in both simulation and hardware.

    through the scheduling irrigation to replace the water loss due to high ETo in
    the greenhouse environment. The performance on the proposed MPC controller deployed
    in greenhouse 1 (GH1) was benchmarked with an existing automatic ETo based controller
    deployed in greenhouse 2 (GH2). The significant contribution of this paper as
    illustrated in Table 1 which includes the consideration of soil, plant and weather
    dynamic change using a predictive model and image processing to estimate the value
    of Kc in a greenhouse. The simulation and real time experimental implementation
    of the predictive control algorithm for greenhouse cultivation experiment leveraging
    on the developed IoT frame work towards effective monitoring of the various sensed
    variables to update the model of the controller. 2. Methodology MPC requires a
    good model that captures the dynamics of a process, to formulate an optimal control
    action that can drive the process through it reference trajectories. The process
    of model formulation for a drip irrigation system is based on the hydrological
    balance model as illustrated in Fig. 1, which has established that the change
    in soil moisture content during a period of time is as result of water inflow
    actions such as rainfall, irrigation as well as water outflows such as evapotranspiration,
    capillary rise, deep percolation and surface run off effect. The reference evapotranspiration
    also known as water loss from the process, is an important parameter of the model
    that depend on the weather variable, namely speed of wind, solar radiation, air
    temperature, air humidity, and the plant characteristic such as crop coefficient
    (Kc). Some measurable and estimated parameters of the hydrological process dynamics
    can be formulated into input and output data and use to fit an existing model
    structure through data driven modelling. The model that best fit to the data was
    further use for the MPC controller design needed for optimal water saving in a

    An IoT based model predictive control framework. However, an improvement has been
    made as shown in Fig. 3 where an integration of model predictive controller has
    been designed in Raspberry Pi to control the pulse width modulated signal to drive
    the pump for supply of water through the drip irrigation network. Through the
    aid of a real-time IoT based weather station that senses weather parameters, an
    hourly computation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) inferring the loss of
    water from soil surface and plant leafs is estimated based on Modified FAO-56
    Penman–Monteith equation as shown in Eq. (1). The equation was developed in a
    customized IoT controller interfaced with the Davis weather station. Similarly,
    the real time computation of the crop coefficient (Kc) using image processing
    method which has effect on the rate of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) shown
    in Eq. (2) is also known as water loss which acts as disturbance to the process.
    (1) where, denotes the reference evapotranspiration (mm/hour); Rn represents the
    reference crop canopy net radiation (W/m2); Δ represents the slope of saturation
    vapour pressure (kPa °C-1); λ represent the latent heat of vaporization (kPa °C
    − 1); T represents the mean air temperature in Celsius; is the Mean daily or hourly
    wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1) and represent the stream pressure of saturation
    vapour (kPa) [71]. The estimated ETo is used to derive the actual evapotranspiration
    ( ), which is the loss of water from a specific crop, from where the estimated
    amount of water to replace the water loss is computed for further application
    to the plant, based on the crop coefficient ( ) which is of different value from
    one crop to another. (2) Based on the framework shown in Fig. 3, the real time
    sensing of soil moisture in terms of volumetric water content was carried out
    using a VH400 sensor connected to the IoT Expresso board. The VH400 sensor probe
    is a resistance based soil moisture content sensor which measures the dielectric
    constant of the soil when inserted vertically into the ground close to the root
    area of the plant [72]. The VH400 soil moisture sensor was calibrated using the
    piecewise linear equations as described in Eqs. (3)–(5). (3) (4) (5) where, is
    the slope of the line. The VH400’s voltage (v) to the curve can be approximated
    with 4 segments of the form in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively [73]. Similarly,
    and are the voltages recorded at the respective levels of and . The sensor has
    an inbuilt voltage regulator that operates with a DC input voltage of 3.5 to 20
    Volts, which requires an input current of less than 7 mA. It produces a DC output
    voltage in the range of 0 to 3 which infers different level of the soil water
    content [74]. Similarly, the irrigation volume and reference evapotranspiration
    was computed using an IoT based flow metre and weather station. Similarly, the
    irrigation volume of the IoT based flowmeter produces an output digital pulse
    and then further counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the amount of
    water flow per each irrigation event. The water flowrate is calibrated using Eqs.
    (6) and (7). (6) where, the number of pulses generated per litre of water flowing
    through the sensor can be found in the water flow sensors specification datasheet,
    while is the number of pulse count generated by the flow sensor. The water flow
    volume can be calculated by summing up the product of flowrate and the time interval.
    (7) Water loss also known as disturbance of the process plant which requires an
    estimation of real time crop coefficient ( ) to guide an efficient water management
    [75]. To accurately estimate the water loss actual evapotranspiration (ETc) termed
    water loss requires real time monitoring of Kc at different growth stage as well
    as measurement of real time of reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Determining
    the height of the plant as well as the leaf area index using image processing
    to compute the can guide the accurate determination for the actual water loss
    and enable the model predictive controller to be able to compensate for the loss
    [75]. The computation of the was carried out using the ratio of LAI and plant
    height estimated based on Eq. (8) using and computed on Raspberry pi with camera.
    (8) 2.1. Data driven system identification of the system The data driven system
    identification of the process was carried out offline in MATLAB using the input
    and output data collected from a previous open loop experiment on similar plant.
    The experimental data collected was pre-processed and split into two, one for
    estimation and the other for validation. The data driven model is obtained using
    a system identification method, in which 3700 data point of input and output experimental
    dataset with sampling time of 10 min was used for the identification. Different
    time series model structures were selected to get a good model of the best fit,
    but the discrete-time state space model was chosen due to it suitability for controller
    design. The identified state space model is represented by Eqs. (9) and (10) with
    , , and matrices was used to represent the dynamics of the real system. Also,
    is the state variable at time instant , is the manipulated variable (irrigation
    flow), is the measured output (volumetric water content of the soil). (9) (10)
    where, 2.2. Model predictive control for drip irrigation system Model predictive
    control (MPC) is a process control algorithm that uses a model of a system to
    predict the future evolution of the system to optimize the control signal according
    to the cost function, while bringing the predictive output of the system to track
    the desired reference trajectory [76]. MPC requires a model that fully capture
    the varying dynamics of the plant to allow a good estimation of the future process
    while the controller takes decision based on the forecasting of the system''s
    behaviour through optimization. The prediction horizon is the future number of
    samples to which the controller can predict the output of the plant, while the
    control horizon is the number of samples within the prediction horizon to which
    the controller have effect on the control signal. The MPC irrigation controller
    block diagram illustrated by Fig. 4 shows the irrigation system (plant) which
    is the cultivation environment with crop whose major monitoring and control parameter
    is the soil moisture, and often disturbed by high ETc, hence that requires the
    control action in terms of irrigation volume to compensate for the water loss
    in order to maintain the desired reference trajectory of the soil moisture content
    implied as the control variable. The MPC controller needs to predict the volume
    of irrigation in order to optimize some desired characteristics of the plant required
    at each sampling instance. Download : Download high-res image (482KB) Download

    that is denoted as the state variable SM(t) is , i.e. , ,…, , where , is the state
    variable predicted at the sampling instant . The prediction horizon , denotes
    the number of future predicted samples. The objective of the MPC is to optimize
    the future control effort trajectory where is the control input or applied irrigation,
    is the control horizon that denotes the number of parameters that determines the
    future control trajectory. Note that , while denote the reference evapotranspiration
    which act as disturbance on the plant state variable. According to Ref. [77],
    in order to calculate the set of predicted state and output variables as a function
    of the future control variable using a state space model ( ) over a prediction
    horizon of as follows: (11) (12) (13) Similarly, the predicted output variables
    can be derived using the set of future control variables as follows (14) (15)
    (16) Therefore the future control moves and the future state variable are calculated
    from the augmented matrix and based on this the predicted output variable derived
    from Eqs. (9) to (16) and is given by Eq. (17). (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) and (22)
    (23) The cost function of the optimization is formulated in Eq. (24) as follows:
    (24) is the reference trajectory of the target soil moisture value, is the future
    value of the soil moisture content, is the function of the state and input variable.
    Where the vector of the references over is , is the current reference. is the
    weighting matrix of the tracking error while is the weighting matrix of the control
    increase. The tuning of and can enhance the error and control tracking performance
    of the MPC irrigation controller. The goal of the controller cost function to
    satisfy the dynamics of the system. That is to make the future output as close
    to the set point or reduce the error between the future output and the set point
    , ie reduce by generating the sequence of the appropriate control input action
    (k) in steady state where the change in control signal is eliminated. The formulation
    optimization problem for the MPC irrigation system design is to find the sequence
    of input that will minimize the cost function in Eq. (25). (25) Subject to the
    constraints that the initial state are measured at any time is known and measured
    and maintained between the field capacity of the soil ( ) and wilting point (
    . The minimization also need to satisfy the system dynamics as well as the irrigation
    volume so as not to over irrigate the greenhouse to prevent over flooding with
    water and also maintain the soil moisture between the field capacity and wilting
    point. where, is the allowable optimal effective irrigation effort, are the wilting
    point and field capacity of the plant root zone deficit which serves as constraints
    to the irrigation system. The optimal control signal is obtained as follows in
    Eq. (26). (26) 2.4. Real time implementation of data driven MPC design in Simulink
    This section describe the application of MPC for designing a real time irrigation
    controller simulation via Simulink. The MPC controller block was designed with
    the state space model identified using the data driven modelling through system
    identification, and imported into the MPC designer app for configuration and tuning
    as described by algorithm 1 in Table 3, while flowchart guiding the controller
    is also illustrated using Fig. 8. The performance of the MPC also depends on the
    choice of the control and prediction horizon, and constraints on the control variable.
    The parameters used to design the predictive controller are, the prediction horizon
    of 5 and control horizon of 10 was chosen as seen in Table 2. One of the main
    strength is the ability to handle constraint on the plant. The constraint on the
    control variable (soil moisture) is set within the lower limit and upper limit
    called wilting point and field capacity respectively. Table 2. Parameters of the

    the weights on the control and manipulated variable (MV) was use to adjust the
    controller performance. The weight on the MV was used to penalise the control
    action, meaning that because the system is strongly nonlinear, with rapid variations
    of some variable with time, if the sampling interval is set too long, the process
    will be out of control for a long time simulation [59,78]. The input weights were
    chosen as close to zero (0.01), to provide more good control response. After the
    design, the controller is exported to the MATLAB workspace and saved as mat file.
    The MPC controller was exported and integrated with the event generator function
    in Simulink as shown in Fig. 5. In order to ensure optimal computational and controller
    performance and event based generator was integrated to update the controller
    based on a triggering event at one hour interval and when ETo is more than 1 mm/day
    for up to 10 min. Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download : Download

    The close loop simulation of the MPC controller design implemented in Simulink
    was deployed through of it support package for Raspberry Pi the hardware implementation
    realization as illustrated in Fig. 6. The model predictive irrigation algorithm
    generates the control action in form of pulse width modulated (PWM) signal a with
    a varying duty cycle to drive the manipulated variable while compensating for
    the loss and disturbance on the plant. The motor driver receives PWM control action
    signal from the GPIO pin 12 and 13 of the Raspberry Pi and provides the necessary
    driving current to the direct current (DC) water pump from the power supply. Raspberry-Pi
    4 micro-computer was used to implement the model-based irrigation control system
    in real-time. The Raspberry pi uses a 1.5 GHz quad-core Broadcom processor, 64
    bit SoC with 4 GB DDR4 of RAM, GPU 500 MHz video core vi. With this SoC specification,
    the model predictive control algorithm was able to run efficiently. The deployed

    in Simulink. The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Simulink
    is shown in Fig. 9. The graphs show the interaction plot of the soil moisture
    content, actual evapotranspiration, and irrigation flow against several sampling
    instant. The simulation results shows that the control variable, also the volumetric
    water content of the soil was brought to the set point of 0.35 m3/m3 even when
    the disturbance (water loss) in terms of actual evapotranspiration ETc is high,
    there is also corresponding control action to replace the water loss from the
    soil. The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Fig. 8 has similar
    trend with the bench marked works of [66,79], in terms of the control action denoted
    as irrigation volume, used to compensated for the water loss while regulating
    the soil moisture content within field capacity and wilting point. Similarly,
    the Fig. 10(a)–(c) further shows the relationship between the measured daily ETo,
    daily soil moisture content, and the daily hourly irrigation volume in (Liters)
    measured in MPC controlled GH1 respectively. The proposed controller was able
    to regulate the soil moisture content within the field capacity and wilting point,
    even when the rate of water loss in terms of ETo is high, while the pumped irrigation
    water was able to adaptively compensate the water loss (ETo). Download : Download

    indices were used to determine the performance comparison of the two irrigation
    methods on the cultivated Cantaloupe plants, which are cumulative water consumption
    (litre), water use efficiency, weight of fruit (kg), and sweetness of fruit (brix).

    4. Discussion Based on the comparison of the yield performance from the two greenhouses
    controlled by the MPC controller (GH1) and ETo based controller (GH2), the total
    mass of the harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of the GH1 as seen in Fig.
    11. This could be as a result of the fact that a lot of water was consumed during
    the irrigation process in GH2, when compared to that of GH1. However the quality
    of fruits harvested in terms of sweetness was recorded in GH1 is observed to be
    better that the harvested fruits in GH2 as illustrated in Fig. 12. Therefore,
    the GH1 irrigated using the MPC has better fruit quality in terms of sweetness
    and improved water use efficiency. This could be due to the gradual increase of
    water supply to the plant root area based on the plant, soil and weather demand.
    Furthermore, the computation of the daily cumulative water use was carried out
    to be able to track the water saving capability of both controllers. From the
    graph of cumulative irrigation water use (Liters) shown in Fig. 13, it can be
    seen that irrigation water consumed by the automatic ETo controller is higher
    than that of the MPC controller. Similarly, about 2022 liters of water was saved
    in GH1 controlled by MPC. It can also be deduced from Fig. 13, the MPC controller
    in GH1 was able to achieve a 30.4% water saving when compared to automatic ETo
    based controller in GH2. This is due to the fact that MPC in GH1 was able to adaptive
    to the changing dynamics of the process as compared with the GH2 controller. (27)
    In addition, the performance of both controllers in GH2 and GH1, in terms of the
    water productivity index which relates the total mass on Cantaloupe produced with
    the total irrigation water use was further estimated using Eq. (27). According
    to Fig. 13, the total cumulative irrigation volume for GH2 and GH1 is 4467 and
    2445 liters respectively, while total mass of equal samples of yield in GH2 and
    GH1 is 115.3 kg and 90 kg. Therefore, the water productivity index of GH1 is 36.8
    kg/litres as against 25.6 kg/litres in GH2. It can be further deduced that the
    MPC controller in GH1 gives water productivity of 30.4% higher than the automatic
    ETo based controller in GH2, hence, highly suitable for water saving agriculture.

    the Cantaloupe plant. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    This paper presents the design and experimental implementation of data driven
    MPC for precision irrigation. The MPC controller was designed using a data driven
    identified state space model that captures the changing dynamics of the process,
    with the ability to adaptive control the irrigation volume required to compensate
    for the water loss within the greenhouse environment and also minimise the error
    between the measured soil moisture and the reference trajectory of the volumetric
    water content of the soil. The performance of the MPC controller deployed on Raspberry
    Pi 4 was put to test on the experimental cultivation of Cantaloupe plant using
    drip irrigation in GH1. The MPC irrigated greenhouse (GH1) recorded a good quality
    of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix and higher water productivity
    index of 36.8 g/liters compared to automatic ETo based controller irrigated greenhouse
    (GH2) with 10.5 Brix and 25.6 g/liters respectively. However, the total mass of
    harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of GH1. From the performance comparison,
    both irrigation methods have their strength and weakness on Cantaloupe plant cultivation.
    Therefore, it is expected that this research effort will guide farmers to adopt
    an effective irrigation controller which comply with their cultivation objectives
    such as water saving, improve yield, and quality. Data availability Data will
    be made available on request. References [1] N. Sigrimis, P. Antsaklis, P.P. Groumpos

    to precision agriculture irrigation systems have been essential to reduce water
    consumption while growing healthy crops. Specifically, implementing closed-loop
    control irrigation based on soil moisture measurements is an effective approach
    for obtaining water savings in this resource-intensive activity. To enhance this
    strategy, the work presented in this paper proposed a new set of water management
    strategies for the case in which multiple irrigation areas share a single water
    supply source and compared them with heuristic approaches commonly used by farmers
    in practice. The proposed water allocation algorithms are based on techniques
    used in real-time computing, such as dynamic priority and feedback scheduling.
    Therefore, the multi-area irrigation system is presented as a resource allocation
    problem with availability constraints, where water consumption represents the
    main optimization parameter. The obtained results show that the data-driven water
    allocation strategies preserve the water savings for closed-loop control systems
    and avoid crop water stress due to the limited access to irrigation water. Keywords:

    feedback scheduling 1. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) of the United Nations, it is estimated that around 70% of all water withdrawal
    worldwide is due to agricultural applications [1], contrasting the industrial
    sector at 20% with municipalities’ local infrastructure for services and domestic
    water use taking the remaining 10%. This seems a logical percentage distribution
    given that around 2000 to 3000 L of water are required to grow food per person
    daily [2]. Nonetheless, what is more concerning regarding this volume of water
    is that 93% never returns to its original source, signifying an apparent complete
    loss of the resource. Irrigation efficiency refers to the ratio of water the crop
    uses to the total amount of water extracted from the source [3]. Different factors
    affect irrigation efficiency, like water run-off, evaporation, and deep percolation.
    Water efficiency mostly depends on the hydraulic infrastructure and irrigation
    method, while surface irrigation has a water efficiency from 50% to 65%, sprinklers
    range from 60% to 85%, and drip irrigation from 80% to 90% [4]. Surface irrigation
    implies surface evaporation, which contributes to water loss. Sprinkler technology
    reduces water loss but, still, the applied water evaporates off the leaves of
    the crop canopy. In contrast, drip irrigation delivers water directly to the plant’s
    root zone, reducing losses due to run-off and evaporation [5]. In any case, water
    efficiency can be considerably improved when a sensor-based smart irrigation system
    is installed over the hydraulic infrastructure [6]. Notwithstanding, food production
    is stated to rise in the following ten years and for many decades to come. In
    [7], the author states that the demand for food and agricultural products is projected
    to further increase by up to 70% by 2050 in order to satisfy the requirements
    for an estimated 10 billion person population by then. That, in addition to the
    growing effect of climate change on water shortage worldwide, can have terrible
    consequences in the near future regarding resource allocation and availability
    for agricultural purposes. Vulnerable communities in arid regions would potentially
    suffer the consequences of water scarcity and global warming more [8]. Moreover,
    severe social conflicts have already occurred in rural communities due to the
    unfair assignation of water resources for agricultural activities [9]. Therefore,
    technology and data-driven solutions for water management are required to improve
    resource efficiency, reduce water waste, and contribute to sustainable agriculture
    practices [10]. The waste and overuse of water resources for crop irrigation is
    a relevant topic that has been addressed by precision agriculture from different
    perspectives [11]. In this sense, automatic irrigation systems aim to optimize
    water utilization while helping farmers to improve crop yields by providing the
    right amount of water, at the right time, in the right place in the field [12].
    To control the amount of water used during irrigation, typically these systems
    conduct measurements of soil moisture levels (volumetric water content), environmental
    parameters (solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature, air humidity), and crop
    conditions (canopy temperature, chlorophyll content, trunk diameter) [6]. Efficient
    water management is typically achieved by implementing closed-loop irrigation,
    where real-time soil moisture measurements gathered from large crop areas determine
    when to activate irrigation. Wireless sensor networks provide the communication
    infrastructure for the devices to transmit and receive data. A control device
    receives soil moisture data from sensors, executes a control algorithm, and activates
    or deactivates the irrigation valves to determine how much water to apply to the
    crops. In addition, the control unit may receive complementary information, such
    as environmental parameters and crop conditions, to improve algorithm accuracy
    using model-based estimations. The strategies to implement the algorithms are
    mostly based on classical and modern control theories like on-off control [13],
    PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control [14], and MPC (model predictive
    control) [15,16]; however, recently artificial intelligent approaches such as
    fuzzy logic [17,18,19], machine learning [20,21], and multi-agent systems [22,23]
    have gained the attention of the research community due to the initial promising
    results in the area of data-driven agriculture. However, most works on closed-loop
    irrigation consider one crop and a single irrigation area without water constraints.
    Therefore, they usually assume full water availability, which in practice is not
    always true, especially in arid regions where water management is a priority for
    sustainable and economically profitable crops. Real-time systems refer to computing
    devices that react within precise time constraints to events in the environment
    [24]. Around this concept, different algorithms have been developed mainly within
    the scope of operating systems theory, where multiple control tasks are simultaneously
    executed, sharing common resources [25]. In these systems, the allocation of resources
    is commonly formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where the aim is
    to maximize the benefits of control performance subject to efficient use of the
    available resources. Real-time computing for control systems has been deployed
    over various fields of industry and services like automotive systems, mobile robotics,
    smart grids, gas and water distribution, and food and petrochemical industries,
    among others [26]. The work presented in this paper integrated modeling and control
    theory with real-time computing to develop dynamic water allocation algorithms
    for precision agriculture, considering different irrigation areas with different
    characteristics, such as crop types, soil conditions, and water needs. Under this
    scenario, water availability is constrained and can only be supplied to one irrigation
    area at a time. Experimental data show that dynamic resource allocation in multiple
    irrigation areas avoids stressed crops and improves water utilization compared
    to the empirical approaches commonly used by farmers. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Irrigation Dynamics An irrigation area can be modeled as a finite two-dimensional
    space where vegetation is to be raised, with water being the primary input resource
    for the system. Other relevant physical variables that can be considered in the
    analysis of the crop’s growth include, but are not limited to, soil physical characteristics
    (texture, structure, drainage), environmental parameters (temperature, air humidity,
    solar radiation, wind speed), and crop attributes (type of crop, development stage,
    plants health). A single variable that can show the irrigation’s overall performance
    concerning water usage is the soil moisture level 𝜃(𝑡) . As evidenced by its name,
    it measures the water in the soil. Soil moisture data are obtained by sensors
    that measure the volumetric water content 𝑉𝑊𝐶 , which is defined as the ratio
    of water volume 𝑉 𝑊 (𝑡) to the unit volume of soil 𝑉 𝑠 (𝑡) . Therefore, soil moisture
    can be defined as 𝜃(𝑡)= 𝑉 𝑤 (𝑡) 𝑉 𝑠 (𝑡) . (1) Even though irrigation dynamics
    present non-linear behavior, it is common to approximate the system as a linear
    model divided into three main operating zones according to normalized soil moisture
    levels [15]. As illustrated in Figure 1, these three areas are denoted as Figure
    1. Water content zones according to the soil moisture level, figure adapted from
    [27]. 1. Gravitational (water saturation zone); 2. Available (water available
    in the root crop zone); 3. Unavailable (hydric stress region). In the first workspace
    region, soil cannot retain water which is allowed to drain freely, provoking a
    significant amount of water waste. The second operating region consists of a state
    where the soil retains water and it is available for the crops. In the third area,
    there is not enough water available; at this point, visible damage can become
    apparent to the vegetation and, if not treated, can lead to crop loss. These three
    zones are exemplified in Figure 2, where it can be noticed that soil moisture
    dynamics are different for each region, and the two irrigation events rapidly
    raise the volumetric water content. Figure 2. Soil moisture dynamics for an irrigation
    system, figure adapted from [15]. Normalized soil moisture uses the maximum allowable
    depletion (MAD) as a reference level and is defined as 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)=𝜃(𝑡)−𝑀𝐴𝐷, (2) where
    MAD specifies the maximum soil water deficit that the crop may support without
    experiencing any water stress. Typically, the MAD level is located at 50% of the
    total available water capacity in the rooting zone [28]. Table 1 illustrates typical
    MAD values and maximum root zone depths for selected crops. As for the field capacity
    (FC), their volumetric water content percentage depends on the soil texture with
    values form 30% to 40% for silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam types of
    soil [27]. Table 1. Percentage values for maximum allowable depletion (MAD) and
    ranges of root depth for common crops. Data obtained from Allen et al. (1998)
    [29]. Closed loop irrigation aims to keep soil moisture above MAD and below FC
    level; this is an optimal spot for the stability of the crop’s growth since it
    avoids crop hydric stress and water waste. 2.2. Irrigation Model Based on the
    previous observations, a linearized model at the operating points is proposed;
    it is important to base the irrigation dynamics on experimentally-confirmed differential
    equations that allow for a proper realization of the input–output relationship
    for the system. A model solely based on irrigation as input is too ideal to execute
    according to the expected outcomes. Therefore, another humidity-related environmental
    factor must be added to the equation. This second time-dependent variable will
    be reference evapotranspiration 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) . It can be inferred as the amalgamation
    of the evaporation and transpiration processes that the vegetation may suffer
    and it can be obtained using weather variables (solar radiation, wind speed, air
    temperature, and relative air humidity) according to the FAO Penman-Monteith method
    [29]. Thus, it accounts for the vaporization of the moisture from the soil surface
    through heat transfer mechanisms such as convection and radiation from the immediate
    environment and it also takes into consideration the loss of water from the plant
    tissues through the stomata. The model can be enhanced by recognizing the variations
    of soil moisture with respect to time. This new variable, 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡) , should be
    equivalent to the difference of humidity inlets minus the outputs of liquid matter,
    according to the law of conservation of matter. Although a realistic model could
    employ dozens of variables, the simplest of them all are sufficient in many cases,
    including the scenario in which the climate is dry with minimum rainfall (which
    is the circumstance in which the 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) data were collected), a straightforward
    equation can take the following form via the work of [30]: 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡)= 𝑐 1 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)+
    𝑐 2 𝑟𝑓(𝑡)− 𝐾 𝑐 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡)−𝑑𝑝(𝑡), (3) where 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) and 𝑟𝑓(𝑡) represent water inflow
    from irrigation and rainfall since, in arid regions, rainfall does not have a
    significative impact, then coefficient 𝑐 2 is zero, while 𝑐 1 represents the irrigation
    efficiency which depends on the hydraulic infrastructure with values that range
    from 0.3 to 0.9 and may vary considerably from one irrigation area to another.
    Crop coefficient 𝐾 𝑐 in conjunction with the 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) integrates the actual crop
    evapotranspiration, 𝐾 𝑐 depends on the crop type and crop growth stage, and the
    reference value of 1.0 corresponds to plain grass crop. Finally, 𝑑𝑝(𝑡) stands
    for the effects of deep percolation, which is the gradual descent of surface water
    to underground levels. It is important to remark that the effect of irrigation
    is not immediate and thus a time delay 𝜏 can be considered in the expression.
    This time delay depends on the depth location of the sensors but also soil compactness
    level. As for the deep percolation, as it can be inferred from the soil moisture
    levels in the ground, it can be defined as being proportional to 𝜃(𝑡) . Consequently,
    the soil water balance model can be re-written as 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡)= 𝑐 1 𝑖𝑟(𝑡−𝜏)− 𝐾 𝑐 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡)−
    𝑐 3 𝜃(𝑡), (4) where 𝑐 3 denotes the proportionality of the soil moisture to the
    deep percolation effect. Now, (4) can be represented as a second-order state space
    model in the form of 𝑥 ˙ (𝑡)=𝑨𝑥(𝑡)+𝑩𝑢(𝑡), (5) where 𝐀,𝐁∈ ℝ 2×2 are the state and
    input matrices, which incorporate coefficients 𝑐 1 , 𝑐 3 , and 𝐾 𝑐 , and they
    can be experimentally obtained from measurements per crop area. The state vector
    𝑥(𝑡) and the input vector 𝑢(𝑡) are respectively defined as 𝑥(𝑡)=[ 𝜃(𝑡) 𝛿(𝑡) ]
    (6) and 𝑢(𝑡)=[ 𝑖𝑟(𝑡−𝜏) 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) ], (7) where 𝛿(𝑡)= 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡) and denotes the dynamic
    of the soil moisture variations. 2.3. Model Validation Over 45 days, data were
    collected from four different irrigation areas with different crop types, irrigation
    systems, and soil characteristics, as denoted in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation
    areas characteristics used for data collection. As depicted in Figure 3, the irrigation
    areas were monitored with a solar cell-powered data acquisition system that sensed
    the crop soil moisture level every minute from three volumetric water content
    sensors (10HS Sensor from Meter Group), solar radiation (PYR Sensor from Meter
    Group), wind speed (Davis Cup from Meter Group), air temperature and relative
    humidity (VP-4 Sensor from Meter Group), and water consumption (Flow-Sync from
    Hunter Industries) through a wireless sensor network as described in [31]. Figure
    3. Evaluated irrigation areas. Coefficients values for matrices 𝐀 and 𝐁 from Equation
    (5) were experimentally obtained to model the soil moisture dynamics for each
    evaluated area properly. The estimation algorithm proposed by [15] was used to
    create a linear dynamic state space model for each operating zone (gravitational,
    available, and unavailable). Figure 4 shows the correlation between the estimated
    normalized soil moisture values calculated from the model 𝜃 ̂  𝑁 (𝑡) and the normalized
    measured soil moisture values obtained from the sensor readings 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡) for a
    specific crop. Irrigation flow 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) is expressed in m 3 /mm and reference evapotranspiration
    𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) in mm/day. Correlation results showed that the identified model adequately
    captured the irrigation dynamics for the crop. Figure 4. Validation results for
    the system identification. Once the proposed irrigation model was experimentally
    validated with four different crops, an optimization problem was formulated to
    evaluate the various water management strategies for a case where multiple irrigation
    areas share a water supply source. 2.4. Optimization Problem For real-time systems,
    control performance optimization and efficient use of the available resources
    are two key elements in the design of resource-constrained control applications
    [24]. This paper analyzed the scenario in which four irrigation areas with different
    crops compete for water supply. The proposed algorithms try to solve a water management
    optimization problem in order to minimize water consumption and crop hydric stress
    subject to the constraint of water availability, which can be defined as minimize
    𝐽= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝐽 𝑐 𝑖 + 𝐽 𝑠 𝑖 ) (8) subjectto ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑐 𝑖 ℎ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑈 𝑟𝑒𝑓 , (9) where
    n is the number of irrigation areas, J is the cost function which integrates water
    consumption 𝐽 𝑐 and crop hydric stress 𝐽 𝑠 for the i area. Also, 𝑐 𝑖 is the irrigation
    time required to move soil moisture from the low threshold to the high threshold
    for each specific area and ℎ 𝑖 is the task period which represents the deadline
    before soil moisture reached stress levels. Finally, 𝑈 𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the required water
    utilization level for the entire group of n irrigation areas. Cost functions for
    water consumption and hydric stress are respectively defined as 𝐽 𝑐 = 1 𝑡 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠
    ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑖 𝑟 𝑘 (10) 𝐽 𝑠 = 100 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑠 𝑘 , (11) where 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙
    is the total number of minutes for the 45 days evaluation period. 𝐽 𝑐 is the daily
    water consumption in m 3 /day, while 𝐽 𝑠 is the percentage of time that the crop
    suffers from hydric stress; hence, s corresponds to the total time the crop soil
    moisture level is under the maximum allowable depletion level, i.e., 𝜃 𝑁 <𝑀𝐴𝐷
    . Figure 5 shows the evaluated scenario, where a single water source supplies
    irrigation to only one area at a time by activating the electro-valves (actuators)
    while the sensors conduct periodic soil moisture and environmental measurements.
    The water management algorithm runs in the controller to schedule the irrigation
    events for the areas. Figure 5. Irrigation system for four areas. 2.5. Evaluated
    Algorithms A total of six algorithms were evaluated for a simulation time of 45
    days. The evaluation was conducted through a simulation implemented in the Python
    programming language. The first algorithm considers the ideal case where no water
    constraint is considered; each irrigation area receives water immediately when
    needed. Then, two heuristic irrigation algorithms based on time-partitioning schemes
    and three data-driven techniques based on real-time control were considered in
    the analysis. 1. Full-Satisfaction Irrigation (FSI): This ideal case was used
    as a reference, where no water constraint was applied. If the moisture level is
    found below some established level 𝑀𝐴𝐷 , it is time for irrigation. The input
    signal stops when the soil moisture reaches a certain ceiling 𝐹𝐶 . 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 represents
    the flow in m 3 /min provided by the hydraulic system when the electro-valve is
    activated. Therefore, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) has only two possible values: {0,𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒} . The control
    law can be summarized as an on–off hysteresis controller with full water availability:
    𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶. (12) 2. Time Partitioning Irrigation
    (TPI): In this heuristic algorithm, a time slot is assigned to each area; during
    this time period, the area is irrigated until field capacity is reached. Let 𝑇
    𝑖 be the period of time placed in the i-th order where area i can be irrigated.
    The irrigation cycle is formed by 𝑇=( 𝑇 0 ,…, 𝑇 𝑖 ,…, 𝑇 𝑘 ) . Once 𝑇 𝑘 is over,
    the circle repeats itself. Irrigation on area i cannot occur if, at time 𝑡,𝑡∉
    𝑇 𝑖 . Therefore, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, (𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 )∧( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷) (𝑡∉ 𝑇 𝑖 )∨( 𝜃 𝑁
    (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶). (13) 3. Greedy Time Slotting (GTS): Like TPI, irrigation is divided into
    fixed time slots in a predetermined order. The main difference is that to recompense
    the expected stress during the periods of no irrigation, watering will be forced
    as long as 𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 . Therefore, the proposed control law is 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0,
    𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 𝑡∉ 𝑇 𝑖 . (14) 4. Mutual Exclusion Resource Locking (MERL): In this data-driven
    algorithm analog to a first-come, first-serve scheme, the first land lot under
    the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 level will gain access to water for irrigation. While it is being watered,
    no other crop can be irrigated. It deals with the scenarios of access collision
    like in the dining philosophers’ problem proposed by [32]. Different processes
    (irrigation areas) may require access to a shared resource (water supply) in this
    strategy. Then, to control concurrency and avoid deadlock, a mechanism (algorithm)
    allows access only if the resource is available; if not, the process will wait
    a random period of time to check if the resource is now available. It is not a
    perfect solution but, given a good random seed, the probability that different
    processes keep colliding becomes null in practice. The proposed control law is
    defined as 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, ( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷)∧(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟=𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒) ( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶)∨(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟≠𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒).
    (15) 5. Earliest Estimated Deadline First (EEDF): Given that an available mathematical
    model is obtained through system identification techniques [33], an approximate
    behavior of the real plant can be estimated. To determine which irrigation area
    to give the most priority, one can compute which one has the sooner deadline and
    define a priority ranking among the competing areas. The deadline is calculated
    by estimating the time for the area to reach the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 threshold since, below this
    level, the crop will suffer from hydric stress. In this dynamic scheduling algorithm,
    the highest priority is assigned to the task with the earliest deadline to avoid
    water stress. Once the area has access to the water supply, no preemption is allowed
    until the irrigation area reaches the field capacity level. The proposed control
    law is defined as 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, (ℎ∈𝑚𝑖𝑛{ ℎ 𝑖 })∧(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟=𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒) (ℎ∉𝑚𝑖𝑛{
    ℎ 𝑖 })∨(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟≠𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒). (16) 6. Dynamic Feedback Priority (DFP): This resource-aware
    algorithm is based on the feedback scheduling concept, where the resource manager
    continuously monitors the soil moisture level for all the areas. Similarly to
    the EEDF strategy, the water resource is assigned to the irrigation area based
    on how close the moisture level is with respect to the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 threshold to avoid
    water stress. Here, the difference is that the resource manager may preemptively
    interrupt the current irrigation area anytime if it is determined that another
    area is in a more critical stage, i.e., closer to the water stress limit. Unlike
    the previous scheduling technique, where the priority will be calculated after
    finishing the irrigation, in this new dynamic feedback algorithm, the priority
    is continuously estimated for each sample period, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, ℎ∈𝑚𝑖𝑛{
    ℎ 𝑖 } ℎ∉𝑚𝑖𝑛{ ℎ 𝑖 }. (17) 3. Results and Discussion The evaluation results in terms
    of water stress percentage 𝐽 𝑠 and water consumed daily 𝐽 𝑐 are displayed in Figure
    6, with a legend to signal the four individual areas and their performances. The
    left side belongs to an ideal case and the empirical methods, while the right
    side stands for the proposed data-driven techniques. Figure 6. Numerical results
    of the 45-day simulation period for each irrigation area following the scheduling
    policies and the constraints imposed into the system. (a) Water stress on each
    area for the ideal case and the heuristic algorithms. (b) Water stress on each
    area for the data-driven algorithms. (c) Irrigation water consumed daily in m
    3 by area for the ideal case and the heuristic algorithms. (d) Irrigation water
    consumed daily in m 3 by area for the data-driven algorithms. The ideal scenario
    of unlimited water is present in the FSI algorithm. Under there, every time the
    sensed moisture goes below the permitted threshold, irrigation is activated regardless
    of the state of the other lots. When it surpasses the upper threshold, irrigation
    stops. Therefore, as expected, the crops spend practically no time under stress
    even though it may consume a surplus of water. Otherwise, TPI irrigates only when
    necessary during the selected time slots permitted periodically. One can infer
    that, although it will save a good amount of resources, the plant will be placed
    under constant stress for most of the study horizon. If one agrees to irrigate
    heedless of the state variables during the allowed period, the expected result
    is a reduced level of water stress due to the incoming stagnant water to alleviate
    the climate in the subsequent periods at the expense of an augmented degree of
    resource usage. GTS is a technique commonly used by farmers to reduce crop water
    stress, since they use the soil to store water for the future; however, soil capacity
    to store water is very limited and this considerably increases the water waste.
    MERL enables the capacity to emulate the limitless resource case’s response while
    setting boundaries on how much water can be used in practice. Hence, the overall
    performance under this algorithm is similar to FSI. Earliest deadline scheduling
    functions similarly to the time-division multiplexed algorithms, with a considerable
    upgrade. EEDF, by always following the then-closest area to moisture fulfillment,
    ensures that the periods between irrigation will always be the shortest ones possible.
    However, three crops suffered from water stress under this algorithm and only
    one avoided the hydric stress; this can be explained by the no preemption mechanism
    imposed by the algorithm. Finally, the DFP algorithm obtained similar results
    to the MERL approach. This is because it is essentially a straight line along
    the lower threshold of the moisture level percentage. Nonetheless, it is excellent
    yet surprising news. The only mode in which one can achieve this kind of constant
    response is by periodically placing marginal magnitudes of the input at a fast
    and constant rate. This sort of reaction is the same as in drip irrigation, where
    the water is placed drop by drop into the root area. This method minimizes the
    erosion and evaporation of water commonly found in sprinkler irrigation while
    saving up to 60% of the water used and increasing crop yield by over 50% (see
    [34]). At first sight, the data-driven approaches seem to improve the extent of
    hydric stress in submerged areas. Also, they present a more organized and fair
    way to distribute the resources with the correct constraints in a real land lot.
    For a deeper evaluation, Table 3 presents the obtained cost function results as
    defined by Equations (10) and (11). Table 3. Cost function results of the evaluated
    algorithms. It can be observed that, even though the heuristic approaches tend
    to the highest and lowest values in both categories, the ability of the data-driven
    methods is more balanced and they produce an overall better performance. It is
    clear that, with the exception of EEDF, the plant suffers from much less hydric
    stress than with the heuristic methods. Additionally, at most, MERL and DFP allowed
    just under 5% water stress, while TPI and GTS put the crop under stress for more
    than 20% the duration of its intended growth. Additionally, water consumption
    stays below the ideal scenario of FSI, whose only true competitor is time partitioning
    schemes that increment the water stress exponentially, making them unsuitable
    for actual applications even if they are already used in practice by most farmers
    due to their experience and background. Of all the above, the best irrigation
    strategies that one can and should implement are the mutual exclusion resource
    locking (MERL) and the dynamic feedback priority (DFP), since they provided a
    balance of avoiding water stress while reducing water consumption in comparison
    with the heuristic TPI and GTS approaches. The first one shows how arbitrarily
    blocking the access of some agents to the main hydration supply can diminish the
    expenses and protect the vital resources in play while at the same time keeping
    the areas in good condition. The latter has more rewards that safeguard water
    utilization in this sector and consider the conservation of the immediate environment.
    The obtained results have demonstrated that data-driven water management strategies
    reduce irrigation water consumption while avoiding water stress on crops in conditions
    where multiple crop areas share a water supply. However, the drawbacks of implementing
    these automated solutions reside in the installation and maintenance cost, which
    most farmers are unwilling to accept if the return on investment is not clearly
    defined. To illustrate this, just the acquisition cost and the proper installation
    and maintenance of soil moisture sensors have a high level of complexity [31]:
    sensors require individual off-line calibration for the specific soil texture
    to reach a reliable accuracy, then installation must be carefully conducted to
    avoid soil air gaps to obtain representative readings; also, at least three sensors
    are required for an irrigation area and it is a good practice to unearth sensors
    each year for re-calibration. Since soil moisture sensor is, so far, the element
    on which closed-loop irrigation is based, lowering costs and efforts must be a
    priority to make sensor-based automated irrigation a feasible option for farmers.
    4. Conclusions A set of dynamic water allocation algorithms was proposed to optimize
    water consumption and avoid hydric stress for an agricultural irrigation system
    composed of multiple areas and a single water source. The dynamics of each area
    were modeled to represent different crops with different soil properties. The
    water management algorithms were integrated with closed-loop controllers based
    on soil moisture measurements for each irrigation area. Simulation results based
    on experimental data showed that the proposed strategies obtained a similar performance
    regarding water savings and avoiding water-stressed crops to when total water
    is available. They provided superior results compared with the heuristic strategies
    commonly used by farmers in practice. The proposed data-driven algorithms were
    formulated as a real-time computing optimization problem with resource constraints.
    The results encourage looking for other data-driven techniques to be applied in
    irrigation management. Water management for agricultural activities may have different
    perspectives: environmental, social, and economic, and the use of data-driven
    solutions may positively impact sustainable agriculture practices. Therefore,
    future works consider implementation in vulnerable communities where farmers share
    common water resources. Author Contributions Conceptualization, C.L. and A.F.-C.;

  description: At present, the increasing consumption of natural sources and rapid
    urbanization has exceeded the demand for fresh water which is a matter of serious
    concern. Paper mill wastewater contains high organic matter, nutrients, and lignin
    and their derivatives, which have economic value. Therefore, it may soon become
    “ecologically sustainable” with technological advances. Nowadays, traditional
    physicochemical and biological treatment systems have been established for wastewater
    treatment but they still face operational and procedural challenges. Researchers
    are devoted not only to the treatment approach but are also focusing on the reusability
    of wastewater in various sectors. Also, IR 4.0-based technological interventions
    can make the treatment and reusability process of wastewater treatment faster
    and error-free. This review focuses on the performance and challenges of existing
    and emerging treatment approaches in paper mill wastewater. We discussed in detailed
    the importance of adopting a circular economy along with recent technological
    advances as well as their role in reducing climate risk and dependence on existing
    resources. Also, this review emphasized the enhancement of environmental feasibility
    by using IR 4.0 technologies and some other approaches such as LCA and decentralized
    treatment systems. As evident from the literature, these collective initiatives
    may become important towards wastewater treatment and resource recovery and can
    help in providing efficient reuse of wastewater through a tie-up of concepts with
    resource efficiency and without compromising on environmental health which can
    be an opportunity for social prosperity. Future research to overcome barriers
    to the implementation and management of these technologies is also discussed.

    economyIR 4.0 1. Introduction Industrial development has been rapid around the
    world, but some contradictions have led to severe environmental conditions. The
    paper mill industry is involved in paper production, however, in the papermaking
    processes (pulp, bleaching, washing, etc.), a lot of chemicals, as well as freshwater,
    are used which generated tremendous wastewater [1], [2]. This wastewater contains
    various xenobiotic compounds; chlorinated phenols, dioxins, chlorinated lignin,
    and other metal ions, organic acids, etc. [3]. This dark brown wastewater harms
    aquatic life by limiting photosynthesis, optimum pH desirability, and reducing
    the availability of dissolved oxygen. Several earlier studies have also reported
    various abnormalities in flora and fauna such as mutagenic, clastogenic, carcinogenic,
    and endocrine-disrupting mechanisms caused by them [4], [5], [6]. Therefore, appropriate
    wastewater treatment is needed to cut environmental devastation. Consequently,
    it is compulsory for removal; otherwise, it may cause severe environmental threats,
    like loss of aesthetics which is driven by the environment, adverse impact on
    an aquatic living organism, and also upsurge salinity of soil by the availability
    of nutrients disproportionally which may cause economic instability/crisis of
    a country [7], [8]. Answering for above-mentioned concerns, many environmental
    researchers and the scientific community are regularly working on an array of
    mechanisms for recycling or treating of paper industry''s wastewater perfectly.
    Recently, there exist various well-known physicochemical and biological treatment
    systems for paper mill wastewater treatment such as coagulation-flocculation,
    adsorption, membrane separation, advanced oxidation processes, electrooxidation/electrocoagulation,
    and bioreactor-based treatment systems [7]. Among all the established treatment
    systems, biological remediation (bioremediation) is widely recognized as the most
    promising perspective for biodegradation and biotransformation efficiency of wastewater,
    and the system is widely accepted because of its low maintenance cost and environmental
    friendliness [9]. Moreover, nowadays, researchers are also moving towards circular
    economy-based models for the reduction and reusability of wastewater which can
    lead to sustainable development [10]. The circular economy of wastewater has the
    potential to revolutionize the way water resources are managed and used in the
    future. Nutrient and energy recovery from wastewater may be beneficial to create
    better treatment opportunities and further this approach may address water scarcity
    problems [11], [12]. In addition, obtaining a life cycle assessment and treatment
    decentralization approach can further boost the quality of treatment systems [13],
    [14]. Traditional wastewater treatment approaches were dependent on constraints
    such as cost, social, regulatory, governmental, and technical, as well as complex
    process parameters and operation parameters. Hence IR 4.0-based technology offers
    various benefits such as an error-free operation process, increased efficacy of
    various water treatment processes, and reduced cost of testing [15]. IR 4.0 is
    a technological advancement that incorporates digital technologies, such as the
    IoT, AI, big data, etc. to optimize and automate industrial processes. In the
    context of wastewater treatment, IR 4.0 can be used to improve the efficiency,
    effectiveness, and sustainability of the process [16]. Here are some ways IR 4.0
    can be applied to wastewater treatment which comprises; real-time monitoring,
    predictive maintenance, process optimization, energy efficiency, and resource
    recovery. Overall, IR 4.0 has the potential to transform the wastewater treatment
    process, making it more efficient, effective, and sustainable. In this review,
    we explored comprehensive information on the current state-of-the-art of treatment
    technologies including advanced treatment of paper mill industry wastewater. This
    review also described a comprehensive overview of the circular economy for the
    management of wastewater through IR 4.0-based technological intervention with
    successful practical applications in a sustainable manner. The generation of resources
    such as energy and valuable products from paper mill industry waste to ensure
    the sustainability of the industry is also covered. Additionally, this review
    proposed the mingling of decentralization, circular economy, and cutting-edge
    technologies-based framework for sustainable growth of industry and environment,
    and management of our natural water resources. 2. Major pollutants 2.1. Lignin
    Lignin is considered to be the main pollutant of the paper industry as up to 70
    million tonnes of KL is being generated annually by paper mill industries. It
    is estimated that KL production may increase to 225 million tonnes/year by 2030
    [17]. Apart from lignin, paper mill wastewater includes; tannins, fatty acids,
    chlorophenols, and high COD and BOD [7]. About 60,000–100,000 m3 of water was
    used for one ton of paper and a large amount of about 47,000–80,000 m3 of wastewater
    was generated which contained toxic substances like lignin and chlorophenols [18].
    The resultant wastewater is found to have very high levels of COD, BOD, TSS, and
    Colour which are 16,400 mg/L, 5850 mg/L, 1179 mg/L, and 3100 mg/L respectively
    [17]. Organosol lignin, soda lignin, kraft lignin, and lignosulfonate are considered
    extracted lignins, which are mostly byproducts of the paper mill industry [19],
    [20]. Kraft lignin is a major contaminant generated from the kraft pulping process.
    Most of the kraft lignin is recovered from black liquor, which is completely discharged
    as a by-product of the paper mill industry when treated with Na2S and NaOH [21].
    The mostly practiced process in the paper industry is sulfate pulping which discharges
    massive amounts of kraft lignin [22]. Another type of sulfite lignin is mostly
    discharged as a result of the sulfite pulping process, producing approximately
    7 million tons of sulfite lignin annually. The nature of sulfite lignin is less
    toxic than kraft lignin hence, currently; North America, Japan, and Europe are
    increasingly adopting sulfite pulping. Also, India and China are displacing the
    kraft lignin process and moving towards the adoption of the sulfite pulping process
    [23]. In the soda-anthraquinone pulping process, 13–16 % NaOH is used to extract
    lignin resulting in the production of soda lignin [24]. Soda lignin shows behavior
    similar to natural lignin when compared with lignosulfonate and kraft lignin.
    Two countries including France and India are pioneers in setting up of soda lignin
    recovery process [25]. However, there is still considerable progress required
    along with these facilities which need to be equipped in the coming future years.
    On the other hand, organosolv lignin is recovered with the organosolv process,
    which results from the use of an organic solvent. Organosolv lignin shows some
    important characteristics: for example, it is sulfur-free like soda lignin, therefore
    relieving the concern of environmental contamination [26]. The other chemical
    characteristics of organosolv lignin are: it is proportionally hydrophobic, and
    relatively low in molecular weight, ash, and carbohydrates [25]. 2.2. Endocrine-disrupting
    chemicals (EDCs) The release of EDCs from the paper mill industry is a major concern
    for environmentalists. EDCs are phenol compounds that are analogous to hormones,
    therefore, disrupting mechanisms performed by the endocrine system [27]. In addition,
    EDCs attack the nervous system and lead to various medical complications like
    Parkinson''s disease [28]. Alkylphenolpolyethoxylates are used as dispersing agents
    in pulp and paper production processes that have proven their potential for estrogenic
    repercussions in both in vitro and in vivo conditions [29], [30]. A variety of
    metabolites are generated following the degradation of alkylphenolpolyethoxylates
    in wastewater treatment plants. Nonylphenols are a type of alkylphenolpolyethoxylates
    metabolite, which was reported in paper mill effluent with 0.96–3.78 μg/L concentration
    [29], [30]. Concentrations of APE metabolites in treated wastewater effluent have
    been reported to range from <0.1 to 369 μg/L in the US, they range from 6 to 343
    μg/L in Spain and up to 330 μg/L in the UK [31]. Acute toxicity of nonylphenol
    and octylphenol to fish, invertebrates, and algae has been reported at concentrations
    of 17–3000 μg/L, while chronic toxicity has been reported at concentrations of
    3.7–6 μg/L [30]. It has been reported that 0.1 μM of octylphenol and > 1 μg/L
    nonylphenol concentrations can cause estrogenic effects. It has also been shown
    that mixtures of alkylphenols with alkylphenolpolyethoxylates can stimulate more
    estrogenic effects in living organisms [30], [32]. There has been a report about
    B-sitosterol, which was found in land plants, but it is also found in paper mill
    wastewater after the pulping process [33]. Phthalates are another EDCs that emerge
    in paper making process [33]. The paper mill effluents have been reported for
    the presence of different kinds of phthalates such as dimethyl phthalate (50–350
    ng/L), diethyl phthalate (30–170 ng/L), dibutyl phthalate (90–3202 ng/L), di (2-ethylhexyl)
    phthalate (1.22–2.01 μg/L), and benzyl butyl phthalate (0.89–9.91 μg/L) which
    are used in the different paper production process [29]. 2.3. Phenolic compounds
    The paper mill generates huge amounts of wastewater which incorporate extreme
    phenolic compounds. The presence of phenolic substances in wastewater is a serious
    problem for the environment and human health. Phenolic wastes such as pentachlorophenol,
    2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 4,5,6-trichloroguaiacol, and tetrachloroguaiacol are generated
    in paper mill wastewater [34], [35]. Recently two phenolic compounds namely 4-chloro-2-methoxyphenol
    and 5-chlorovanillin have been reported to be discharged from paper mill wastewater
    [36], [37]. Studies have already been done on various microorganisms that can
    degrade phenol such as yeast [38], Pseudomonas [39] and Rhodococcus, etc. [40].
    Microbes can break down phenol within 75 h with a concentration range from 1000
    to 1200 mg/L [41]. 3. Detrimental effect of paper mill wastewater Aquatic flora
    and fauna become more prone to paper mill toxicity. The morphological, physiological,
    and behavioral characteristics of flora and fauna are severely damaged when they
    are present at the base of the wastewater site [42]. Studies indicating the toxicity
    of paper mill wastewater on a fish reproductive system include an imbalance of
    sex hormones and circulation, features of masculinization and gonad size, reduced
    female vitellogenin, and that it may also modify the secondary sex characteristics
    of fish [43]. A significant amount of mercury and cadmium in chemically treated
    paper mill effluent was changing the physicochemical properties of natural river
    water. Also, crop plants from the contaminated site showed high levels of residual
    Hg and Cd and a significant reduction in pigment [44]. 4. Methods for wastewater
    treatment and challenges Various physical, chemical, and biological-based treatment
    technologies have been established to remove pollutants from paper mill wastewater
    and they are summarized in Table 1. Merits and demerits of currently employed
    methods for the treatment of paper mill wastewater are listed in Table 2. Table

    electrochemical treatment processes There are several physicochemical methods
    (Table 1) such as coagulation and precipitation, membrane separation techniques,
    photocatalytic degradation, ultrafiltration, advanced oxidation processes, ozonation,
    and electrooxidation/ electrocoagulation have been used for the removal of paper
    mill wastewater pollutants [17], but the wastewater treatment does not meet the
    proper demand as these systems are found to have some major merits and demerits.
    Nowadays, ultrafiltration and microfiltration techniques are also being used to
    remove lignin with 95 % efficiency [45]. Recently, researchers have used Zr-based
    metal-organic frameworks for the remediation of hexavalent chromium displayed
    an excellent adsorption capacity (338.98 mg/g) of chromium in mixed wastewater,
    which is 10 times higher than that reported for unmodified Zr-based metal-organic
    frameworks and most other adsorbents [46]. The major drawback of physicochemical
    methods is that they are useless when applied alone in massive-scale maneuvers.
    In the coagulation method, excessive toxic sludge is generated which leads to
    creating disposal problems [47]. The oxidation process is expensive if ozone and
    H2O2 are used for oxidation while using chlorine as an oxidizing agent generates
    secondary pollutants. Nowadays, greenhouse gas emissions are also a major challenge
    for scientists and physicochemical methods are a major contributor to their emission
    ratio. Another alternative physical method for wastewater treatment is membrane-based
    technology but suffers from the problems of membrane fouling [48]. Electrochemical
    technology such as electrocoagulation, electrooxidation, and electrodialysis has
    been considered a viable and attractive treatment technology for wastewater treatment
    due to its advantages such as cost-effectiveness, ease of automation, adaptability,
    environmental compatibility, selectivity as compared to other conventional processes
    [49], [50], [51], [52]. Furthermore, the highest removal of turbidity, colour,
    and COD was 99 %, 100 %, and 90 %, respectively, for both consecutive electrocoagulation
    electrooxidation and combined electrocoagulation electrooxidation processes with
    the use of aluminum electrodes [50]. Although the consecutive electrocoagulation
    electrooxidation method was found to be more energy efficient with 26.23 % less
    energy consumption as compared to combined electrocoagulation electrooxidation
    processes, considered a more viable method for paper mill treatment due to initial
    investment cost and ease of application [50]. Under the optimum current density
    (∼1.5 mA/cm2) and reaction time condition (∼25 min), electrocoagulation has been
    shown to remove >70 % tannin/lignin and > 95 % colour from kraft paper mill wastewater
    [52]. During wastewater treatment, the serious concern is the xenobiotic compounds
    that remain in the treated effluent in considerable concentration. Accordingly,
    there is a need for eco-friendly approaches for the elimination of remaining xenobiotic
    compounds. 4.2. Biological treatments Microorganisms are found in nature that
    imparts distinctive characteristics towards transforming paper mill wastewater
    as feedstock meant for their multiplication [53]. Additionally, biological procedures
    are environmentally and user-friendly alternatives that should be selected for
    wastewater treatment over treatment via physicochemical processes. Microorganisms
    such as algae, diatoms, cyanobacteria, fungi, bacteria, and their metabolic products
    in the form of enzymes participate in wastewater treatment [3], [54] (Table 1).
    The majority of paper industries around the world have been practicing well-known
    activated sludge and anaerobic treatment. Accordingly, a previous study showed
    the activated sludge system has the potential to eradicate 74.8 % of COD and 58.3
    % of colour from wastewater [55]. Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and
    fluidized-bed reactor are the most practiced anaerobic-based treatment technique
    for paper mill wastewater treatment in India. UASB reactor can remove COD-50 %,
    BOD-70 %, and adsorbable organic halides-50 % from bleaching wastewater. However,
    the major disadvantage of activated sludge-based treatments is that they require
    a constant high amount of oxygen and energy supply [47]. Furthermore, both biological
    treatment processes have required a larger space area, higher operational costs,
    huge manpower required, and produce a huge amount of sludge, etc. this makes the
    treatment process costly. The adaptability of bacteria to a wide range of environmental
    conditions makes them beneficial in paper mill wastewater treatment. Many studies
    have been performed on lignin depolymerization, decolorization, and toxicity reduction
    using bacterial species; Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Raoultella
    ornithinolytica, Ensifer adhaerens, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus altitudinis
    [56], [57], [58], [59]. A 67 % lignin depolymerization and 54 % colour reduction
    by Bacillus aryabhattai and 89 % lignin degradation and 40 % of colour reduction
    by Bacillus cereus were observed by Zainith et al. [60] and Kumar et al. [61],
    respectively. Chroma, lignin, phenols, BOD, and COD were effectively removed by
    Serratia sp. AXJ-M 80 %, 60 %, 95 %, 80 %, and 80 %, respectively from paper mill
    wastewater [62]. However, single-cell bacteria face difficulties in the degradation
    of higher molecular weight lignin paralleled to lower molecular weight due to
    the absence of all types of ligninolytic enzymes. Thus, complete degradation of
    lignin can be achieved by consortia of bacteria or synergism with fungi [63],
    [64]. In addition to bacterial cells, fungi are also potential organism that functions
    in the non-specific form of depolarization of lignin. The extracellular enzymatic
    system of fungi includes conventional peroxidases lignin peroxidase, manganese
    peroxidase, laccase, and other supporting enzymes that play a key role in colour
    decolorization and lignin breakdown. Additionally, the high survival adaptability
    of fungi to toxic effluent is another feature over bacteria [45]. Fungi such as
    Teammates versicolor, Aspergillus niger, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Coriolus
    versicolor, Ganodermalucidum, Fomeslividus, Irpexlacteus, Schizophyllum commune,
    Lentinusedodes, Tinctoriaborbonica, Datronia sp., and Trichoderma have been recognized
    as noteworthy lignin degrader organism [65], [66]. The repetitive batch treatment
    process utilizes the co-culture of two disparate fungal species Curvularia lunata
    and Nigrospora sp. for paper mill wastewater bioremediation, in which COD, BOD,
    and lignin were reduced by 80 %, 85.6 %, and 76.1 %, respectively [67]. Penicillium
    citrinum in paper mill wastewater was shown to reduce COD up to 91 % within 72
    h in fed-batch bioreactor mode [68]. The metabolic activity of algal species is
    used to transform/decolorize chromophoric lignin molecules to colorless ones to
    reduce toxicity [69]. Various chemicals like NO3, PO4, COD, and heavy metals can
    remove effectively in paper mill wastewater using Planktochlorella neureckis and
    Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [70]. Tarlan et al. [71] applied hybrid algae approach
    using Chlorella, Chlorococcum, Chlamydomonas, Pandorina, and Eudorina, which resulted
    in 75 % COD, 84 % colour, and 80 % absorbable organic halide removal from paper
    mill wastewater. Microbial enzymes which included laccases, xylanases, cellulases,
    catalases, peroxidases, amylases, lipases, proteases, etc., take part in the handling
    of organic waste from paper industries. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese
    peroxidase (MnP), both are major lignin-degrading enzymes formed by the white
    rot fungi [72]. Lignin peroxidases are classified under the oxidoreductase family,
    which have immense potential to degrade lignin and their derivatives in the presence
    of H2O2 and also oxidize phenolic compounds like catechol, acetosyringone, vanillyl
    alcohol, syringic acid, and guaiacol, etc. [72]. MnP is an extracellular glycoprotein
    containing heme as a prosthetic group [73]. MnP coupled with H2O2 is involved
    in the lignin degradation system and forms the main component [74]. Laccase is
    a copper-containing extracellular enzyme that depolymerizes lignin and its derivatives
    in the presence of a mediator [75]. Laccase has immense potential to reduce BOD,
    COD, and dark black wastewater of paper mills. Bacteria are involved in paper
    mill organic pollutant degradation by use of the enzymatic system that includes
    laccase, MnP, and LiP ligninolytic enzymes [76]. Bacillus paramycoides and Micrococcus
    luteus produced LiP, MnP, and laccase enzymes during the degradation of pollutants
    in paper mill effluent [77]. The bacterial strain B. paramycoides produced LiP-4.30
    U/mL, MnP-3.38 U/mL, and laccase-4.43 U/mL while Micrococcus luteus produced LiP-3.98
    U/mL, MnP-3.85 U/mL, and laccase-3.85 U/mL within 96 h of incubation. The consortium
    of these bacteria can reduce 70 % lignin, 63 % colour, 71 % COD, and 58 % BOD
    if the growth medium was enriched with 1.0 % glucose and 0.5 % peptone [77]. The
    laccase enzyme from B. altitudinis SL7 was significantly involved in the degradation
    of lignin under alkaline conditions [59]. The Bacillus albus MW407057 bacterium
    was producing a LiP enzyme with a molecular weight of 48 kDa during methylene
    blue degradation [78]. 4.3. Advance biological treatment systems 4.3.1. Membrane
    bioreactor (MBR) technology MBR techniques are successfully installed with an
    activated sludge process as a post-treatment system for the physical separation
    and mitigation of waste from paper mill effluent. The application of MBR technology
    could significantly improve liquid/biosolids separation. The major advantages
    associated with MBR are the production of effluent free from TSS and bacteria,
    higher MLSS concentration, higher sludge residence time (SRT), smaller bioreactor
    size, and low biomass yields [79]. Treatment of anionic surfactants wastewater
    in MBR using four bacterial isolates such as P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, B. safensis,
    and Staphylococcus arlettae resulted in 99.6 % degradation of anionic surfactants
    [80]. Merayo et al. [81] achieved significant COD (90 %) reduction from paper
    mill effluent by MBR technology integrated with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)
    followed by ozonation. Kumar et al. [82] incorporated bacterial consortium (Klebsiella
    sp., Alcaligenes sp., and Cronobacter sp.) in a sequence batch reactor for the
    treatment of paper mill wastewater and they found the substantial reduction of
    COD, BOD, colour, adsorbable organic halides, TDS, and TSS by 72.3 %, 91.1 %,
    55 %, 45.4 %, 22 %, and 86.7 %, respectively. Submerged polyvinylidene fluoride
    MBR has significant potential to remove 73 % COD and 79 % colour from paper industry
    wastewater [83]. Also, treatment of real paper-recycling wastewater in a novel
    hybrid airlift membrane bioreactor (HAMBR) was lead to effectively reduction of
    COD (88–99 %), ammonium (54–83 %), nitrite (70–90 %), nitrate (65–95 %) and total
    nitrogen (61–90 %) [84]. However, the major concern of MBR technology is membrane
    fouling. Recently, fixed-bed membrane bioreactors have been shown to have resistance
    against the membrane fouling phenomenon, which is a critical phenomenon for membrane
    bioreactor operation [85]. 4.3.2. Moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology
    MBBR technology expresses the immense capability to diminish substances like suspended
    solids amidst manufacturing. During the treatment process, plastic carriers are
    immersed in wastewater in aeration tanks to allow for the formation of biofilms
    [86]. MBBR does not have the problem of membrane fouling and high sludge production
    as compared to active sludge and MBR technology. A lab-scale MBBR was able to
    remove about 50 % soluble COD from paper mill wastewater with a 4.9 h hydraulic
    retention time and under nutrient-excess conditions [87]. Hydraulic retention
    time, filling fraction, and availability of nutrients are the major factors that
    significantly affect the efficiency of MBBR technology during paper mill wastewater
    treatment. Carrier geometries for biofilm formation in MBBR have impressive results
    on biofilm properties (biofilm mass, density, and thickness), and effluent properties
    (fluent particle size distribution and waste particle settlement velocity distribution,
    and settling behavior of effluent solids). AnoxK™ K5 carriers showed thicker biofilms,
    lower biofilm density, lowest formation of suspended solids, better-settling behavior,
    and faster-settling velocity compared to AnoxK™ Z-carriers designed to limit biofilm
    thickness [88]. Higher hydraulic retention time improves nutrient usage and superior
    suspended solids contact. Also, nutrient (nitrogen: N & phosphorous: P) limitation
    conditions, (COD: N: P, 100.00:0.70:0.14) boosted the soluble COD/nutrient consumption
    ratio ∼2.65 times at 4.9 hydraulic retention time [87]. MBBR technology also has
    some other significant benefits, for extant; greater treatment efficiency, a moderate
    cost to operate and maintain, elevated cell retention time, and ease of solid-liquid
    separation. In addition, MBBR technology has been integrated with microbial fuel
    cells (MFCs) for the treatment of paper mill wastewater as well as for bioelectricity
    generation. Chen et al. [89], designed an MBBR reactor coupled with MFCs, which
    can generate bioelectricity (94.5 mW/m2 power density) during paper mill wastewater
    treatment and efficiently bioremediate 65.6 % of COD from paper mill wastewater.
    MFCs were recently used for wastewater treatment with high efficiency as well
    as energy generation potential [90]. Towards a sustainable green development approach,
    single chamber up-flow membrane-less MFCs have been demonstrated in wastewater
    treatment and power generation and accelerated growth of biofilms in the MFC cathode
    to increase the internal resistance during wastewater treatment with 96 % COD
    reduction achieved [91]. In addition, photoelectrolysis, biosorption, advanced
    oxidation processes, and filtration-assisted crystallization techniques are considered
    to be other advanced treatment technologies at earlier stages [92]. There is an
    existing rapid pace of advancement in the arena of new technology development
    for wastewater treatment. 4.3.3. Genetically engineered microbes (GEMs) Single
    bacteria can only be associated with limited contaminants degradation due to their
    inherent own limitations. Biotechnological advances focus on the creation of genetically
    modified microbes that can sustainably degrade pollutants to create new engineering
    strains with high adaptability and fecundity. The genetic code of a microorganism
    is changed via genetically modified techniques to meet the requirement [93]. In
    1996, the Environmental Protection Agency released the first genetically engineered
    microbes for environmental waste mitigation. The methods used to engineer any
    microbial cell make it more capable of degradation, and more production of the
    desired amount of protein, and you will get different outcomes depending on creating
    recombinant strains. GEMs are an effective tool to transform any organism (fungi,
    bacteria, etc.) to obtain desired results [94]. The performance of GEMs in contaminant
    removal is summarized in Table 1. Modification of some algal features to cause
    cellular protein–heavy metal complex formation towards the absorption of environmental
    adverse tolerances has already been reported [95]. Some proteins are encoded by
    different genes to be mediated through cellular transport mechanisms [96]. Furthermore,
    using various genetic engineering approaches such as metabolic engineering, spontaneous
    and induced mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis, mutagenesis, recombination
    by natural method, and gene cloning [97] (Fig. 1). The catalytic efficiency and
    thermostability of phytase are improved in the Aspergillus niger N25 strain, which
    was achieved with 20 % thermostable efficiency compared to the wild-type strain
    using site-directed mutagenesis techniques [98]. The hydrolase-producing gene
    of the cloned Achromobacter sp. WM11 strain was extracted for methyl carbamate
    degradation [99]. For the degradation of persistent pollutants through recently
    developed bacterial promoter genes and expression genes, P. putida is a synthetic
    genetic circuit [100]. The recently documented engineered P. putida likely degrades
    organic pollutants such as camphor, octane, salicylate, naphthalene, polypropylene,
    polyvinyl chloride, etc. [101]. The degradation of inorganic and organic pollutants
    can be enhanced through protoplast fusion [102]. The enzymatic activity of organisms
    can be increased by physical or chemical mutagenesis. UV radiation increases the
    enzyme activity of laccase, lignin peroxidase, and oxidase [103]. Download : Download

    An integrated management approach for the assurance of food, energy, and water
    assets by a rounded tactic could help the current world faces several challenges
    which comprise climate change, social security, political instability, and environmental
    and economic development that create uncertainty about food, water, and energy
    security [136]. Therefore, the demand for resource recovery in wastewater is gradually
    increasing [137]. The concept of circular economy is a non-linear process, where
    waste material is considered as a subordinate material and re-use in contrast
    to the linear economy [10]. Limited availability of fresh raw materials and rapidly
    rising high import costs of raw materials collectively accelerate the move towards
    a circular economy (Fig. 2). Wastewater treatment plants in highly populated urban
    areas may play an important role in circular sustainability that is linked to
    energy production and resource recovery during the wastewater treatment process
    [138]. Moreover, effluent recovered from wastewater treatment plants can be used
    for fulfilling the demand for industrial, agricultural processes, and other beneficial
    utilities which reduce the demand for potable water (Fig. 2). The recovery of
    value-added products during wastewater treatment using different treatment methods
    have been summarized in Table 3. Download : Download high-res image (374KB) Download

    effluents from industry containing very useful nutrients like P, K, Mg, N, etc.
    can become sources of commercial fertilizers [149]. The recycling of useful nutrients
    from wastewater treatment plants has reduced the need for conventionally used
    fertilizers and also reduced energy consumption and water demand. Various nutrients
    such as N, P, K, and S and trace elements (Fe, Ni, Mo, Co, W, and Se) are also
    found in partially treated sewage sludge and wastewater [150]. Biosolids/sludge
    cake could become a major source that serves as fertilizer for land application.
    Adsorbent materials like zeolite, biochar, silica, activated carbon, and bio-derived
    materials when mixed with metal oxides/hydroxides showed excellent adsorption
    capacity for phosphorous from effluent [151]. Liu et al. [152] applied electrodialysis
    for nutrient recovery during secondary effluent treatment. Using this method they
    reconcentrated nitrate 40.64 mg-N/L and phosphate 21.2 mg-P/L from biologically
    treated secondary effluent. Various physical and biological recovery approaches
    including incineration, absorption, stripping, and composting and biological phosphorus
    recovery methods are applied for nutrient concentration from effluent/wastewater
    [11]. 5.2. Re-usability of treated water The rapidly increasing pressure on limited
    freshwater availability is causing water pollution. Therefore, making wastewater
    treatment plants for the irrigation of crops, agricultural utility, and industrial
    applications is a more flexible and self-sustaining tool (Fig. 3). Researchers
    are now focusing on the domestic use of treated water [153]. This treated wastewater
    negates the demand for water requirements of the local people. Florida (USA) is
    the best example with over 45 % treated wastewater for urban reuse and also for
    land irrigation [154]. Another explanation could be pipe-to-pipe reuse through
    the direct introduction of treated wastewater into the water distribution system
    [155]. Download : Download high-res image (263KB) Download : Download full-size

    5.2.1. Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) The growing tendency of freshwater scarcity
    is the most important challenge of our times, with industrial sectors consuming
    large amounts of fresh water, while generating huge wastewater in return. If the
    waste water is not discharged properly it harms the living organism. ZLD is an
    aspiring wastewater control approach that eradicates almost all liquid waste in
    the plant, as a result, most of the water is recovered for reuse [156]. ZLD can
    be accomplished in a variety of ways: reverse osmosis, thermal evaporation, forward
    osmosis, electrodialysis, and membrane distillation [157]. The size of the ZLD
    market was $39 million in 2012 and is anticipated to propagate at a steady 7 %
    rate from 2012 to 2017. Major application areas include the textile sector, distillation,
    power, and petrochemical sectors. In addition, minimal liquid discharge (MLD)
    is another valuable strategy for wastewater reuse and resource recovery. In one
    study, the total freshwater recoveries of MLD and ZLD from brine were 84.6 % and
    98.15 %, respectively, although the energy consumption was 1.93 times higher for
    ZLD than for MLD [158]. Merging of new wastewater treatment technologies such
    as membrane-based processes, reverse osmosis, etc. with conventional technologies
    made ZLD systems energy-efficient, economical, and proficient in the industrial,
    domestic, and agriculture sectors [159]. Further, textile wastewater treatment
    based on microfiltration followed by nanofiltration was able to reduce 92 % COD
    and 98.5 % colour which helps to increase water recovery and reduce environmental
    impacts [160]. In addition, membrane distillation crystallization is a newly emerging
    advanced hybrid technology that combines membrane distillation and crystallization
    towards zero liquid discharge and recovery of useful resources [161]. 5.2.2. Use
    in energy supply chain Energy recovery from wastewater treatment plants become
    an Indian government important policy for resource sustainability. This can be
    done by using various high-temperature streams in biogas production, and treatment
    plant effluents by heat exchangers and heat pump methods [12]. Combined heat and
    power is the most adopted self-sufficient technology in the market which generates
    electricity as well as heat from biogas at the same time. Further, this biogas
    can be used for electricity production. Anaerobic digestion is a common approach
    for increasing the energy self-sufficiency of wastewater treatment plants [12].
    At present, thermal hydrolysis technologies; Biothelys, Exelys, and Cambi are
    the most popular and widespread technologies to improve the anaerobic digestive
    system in wastewater treatment plants. In the first wastewater treatment plant
    in North America, which implemented the Cambi Technology, USA, a short hydraulic
    retention time (15 days) of about 50 % biogas production was observed. Waste material
    and industrial discharge can be converted into bio‑hydrogen production through
    biological processing [162]. A mixed-integer linear programming model was designed
    by Mohseni and Pishvaee, [163] for data-driven robust optimization to accelerate
    biodiesel production from wastewater sludge, which demonstrated strong supply
    chain decisions during the wastewater sludge-to-biodiesel supply chain over several
    periods. Also, the anaerobic MBR process has the potential to become an improved
    approach towards the recovery of freshwater, mineral nutrients, and energy from
    wastewater towards energy and carbon neutrality [164]. An H2 evolution rate of
    41.59 μmol/g/h was observed due to enrofloxacin degradation when treating pharmaceutical
    wastewater using MoS2 − x@TiO2-OV, whereas, a hydrogen liberation rate of 102.72
    μmol/g/ h and a mineralization rate of 50 % was achieved during the treatment
    of the coking wastewater [165]. 5.2.3. Development of blue-green infrastructure
    in large cities Currently, most of the metropolitan cities in India facing water
    stress due to the gradually increasing migration of the population from rural
    to urban, climate change trends, exceeding water demand, and ineffective wastewater
    management systems. Therefore, the use of wastewater in conjunction with modern
    infrastructure planning for blue and green infrastructure can become an effective
    way to provide sustainable applications of wastewater. In addition, the treated
    wastewater can be used for the plantation of large-size gardens/parks, the development
    of green corridors parallel or in between roads, the development of ponds for
    promoting fishing activities, aquaponics, algae cultivation, plant nursery livestock
    feed production, create local carbon sink, and wetland [166]. Its other applications
    could be in local canal circuits for irrigation for local farmers, who are facing
    the problem of water availability and irrigation infrastructure. This approaches
    earns extra revenue, reduce social tension and government expenditure without
    compromising environmental health, and making opportunity for social prosperity.
    In this way, we all are going one step towards sustainable development to achieve
    carbon neutrality in the environment. Quantitative analysis of blue-green infrastructure
    showed improvement in storm-water-related functions and a reduction in rainwater
    utilization. Other beneficial aspects of blue-green infrastructure in Chinese
    cities were documented as green space expansion, energy-saving function, and retention
    basin [166]. Vegetated engineered systems a type of blue-green infrastructure
    can mitigate flood risk in Southeast Asian cities [167]. 5.2.4. Liquid fertilizer
    Essential useful nutrients found in wastewater play an important role in farming
    activities [168]. In addition, wastewater as a fertilizer has other benefits:
    for example, less dependence on fertilizer for better crop cultivation improved
    grain quality, and enriched in essential elements such as Mg, Ca, Na, etc. The
    problem of micronutrient insufficiency in the soil can be fulfilled by using wastewater
    as liquid fertilizers [169], [170]. The study by Zhang and Liu [171] recommended
    that municipal wastewater can serve as a good source of liquid fertilizer after
    ammonia recovery. Similarly, the recovery of N and P from the waste stream can
    become an ecological fertilizer that can play an important role in the food supply
    chain [172]. However, repeated use of wastewater for irrigation purposes can disturb
    the agricultural ecosystem [173]. For example, excessive amounts of N and P accumulate
    in the soil which can lead to toxicity over time [174]. Additionally, lignin has
    hitherto been regarded as an unutilized by-product in paper mill wastewater that
    can be transformed into compost via KOH-mediated oxidation [175]. Various European
    countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland have adopted thermal
    treatment followed by the wet-chemical process for municipal wastewater-driven
    P recovery [176]. 5.2.5. Applications in SMART cities development Introduction
    to the concept of SMART cities is a practical and sensible amalgamation of ecological,
    economic, social, and sustainable development for overall sustainable development
    objectives. The goal of ecological self-sustainable cities is to “boost the well-being
    of citizens and society using integrated urban planning and management that fully
    harnesses the benefits of ecological systems, and protects and nurtures these
    assets for future generations”. Build a tie-up between the paper mill industries
    and the wastewater treatment plants of a SMART city that can allow optimal reuse
    of wastewater with useful product recovery as energy and fertilizers [177], [178].
    The initiative aims to convert wastewater streams into renewable energy and other
    useful activities such as construction activities. This recycling model could
    become a cost-effective and reliable wastewater treatment system in future Indian
    cities. In recent decades, SMART approaches are increasingly being implemented
    regularly in many cities around the world. The important project wastewater treatment
    plant developed in the city of Borås (Sweden) will be connected with the local
    power plant and the city''s power plant [154]. Furthermore, smart treatment architecture
    connected with IoT facilities showed excellent results towards sustainable development
    in the wastewater treatment system of the industrial area of South India [179].
    6. Enhancement of environmental feasibility by using smart technologies and approaches
    6.1. Strictly practiced life cycle assessment (LCA) for paper mill wastewater
    An emerging assessment approaches such as LCA is an essential tool for the paper
    mill wastewater treatment plant. LCA should be strictly practiced and followed
    for the assessment of the environmental relevance and importance of wastewater
    treatment systems through pre-existing LCA process data. Based on CML-IA and echo
    indicators, the LCA method addresses the environmental impact that is created
    by wastewater treatment plants at the midpoint and endpoint [180]. The midpoint
    includes major impacts like terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication,
    land use, global warming, freshwater eco-toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, water
    consumption, human carcinogenic toxicity, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity.
    At the endpoint, three types of impact are listed resources, human health, and
    ecosystems. The LCA of an integrated wastewater-derived duckweed biorefinery revealed
    that this integrated system significantly reduced the eutrophication effects of
    wastewater through excellent nutrient upcycling mechanisms and also increased
    land use change impacts due to duckweed pond formation [13]. In one study, Zhou
    et al. [181] used LCA to assess the treatment and disposal techniques of lake
    dredged sludge and the results indicated that the land use process is a better
    approach for less polluted dredged sludge, however, heavy metals pollution dominated
    the land use process. They recommended that the manufacture of water storage clay
    or non-fired brick from highly polluted dredged sludge for stabilization of heavy
    metals is an impressive treatment technology to cut down toxic environmental impacts.
    Further, four single sustainable development indicators and one aggregated sustainable
    development indicator have been achieved by merging LCA with the emergy analysis
    method for the sustainable valorization of bioenergy from agro-industrial biological
    wastewater treatment systems [182]. Moreover, Chen et al. [183] studied LCA to
    compare the energy- and greenhouse gas-emission footprints of sludge-to-energy
    systems through two methods, including anaerobic digestion with incineration and
    direct incineration for sewage sludge treatment and disposal. They found that
    anaerobic digestion with an incineration system was the good choice for the treatment
    of high-organic-content sludge in terms of energy and greenhouse gas emissions,
    while direct incineration was superior for low-organic content sludge. 6.2. Improving
    wastewater treatment efficiency by using IR 4.0 Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR
    4.0) envisions a rapid change in the technological arena, which facilitates ease
    of industrial sector operation and working of societal patterns, and processes
    resulting in inter-connectedness. IR 4.0 is a unique engineering approach that
    has the potential trait for a paradigm shift by characterizing high procedural
    efficiency and achieving sustainable development goals quicker than manually expected
    (Fig. 4). Better use of available natural resources and extended life span of
    equipment is possible by using IR 4.0 [15]. If IR 4.0 is efficiently used, it
    becomes a game-changer technique without compromising available limited resources
    in terms of increased revenue collection while cutting costs and unnecessary expenses.
    The advantage of this technology can be to eliminate process hassle and generate
    income savings through the optimization of process protocols. It also solves the
    problem of very complex physicochemical interactions such as the removal of organic
    nutrients, Problems associated with a small number of effluent parameters that
    were neither well understood nor could be properly assessed by existing technology
    may be resolved by IR 4.0. Also, machine learning technology may be used for the
    prediction of operation parameters, effluent characteristics, biomass properties,
    etc. [16]. Table 4 describes the features and utility of IR 4.0-based technology.

    treatment. Table 4. Using various IR 4.0-based technologies for paper mill wastewater
    treatment. IR 4.0 Utility References Internet of things It is sensor-enabled technology,
    it allows data to be accessed anywhere, communicates wirelessly through a network
    set up [185] Big data analytics It overcomes the bottleneck of dealing with large
    amounts of unstructured and structured data from various sources to help with
    predictive analysis, data mining, and decision-making. [209] Cloud computing It
    enables data to be stored elsewhere and facilitates quick feedback regarding the
    operational process [210] Robotics Robotics based on artificial intelligence makes
    it flexible and cooperative machines that efficiently interact with each other
    without explicit human control [211] Augmented reality It is based on augmented
    reality which allows the user to synthesize the real and virtual worlds. It provides
    real-time data monitoring to help them in better decision-making and work efficiency
    [212] Artificial intelligence It can reduce the operating expense of the water
    treatment process and optimize the use of chemicals [213], [214] Machine learning
    (ML) ML-enabled designed framework to improve effluent quality control in the
    wastewater treatment process by clarifying relationships between operational variables
    and effluent parameters. [215] Blockchain technology Highly accurate detection
    of water quality parameters for decentralized water information and wastewater
    quality information for management systems [216] 3D printing technology Development
    of novel geometrically complex, and porous 3D structures for adsorption, advanced
    oxidation processes, bioreactors, and microfluidic technology. [204] 6.2.1. Internet
    of thing (IoT) IoT refers to the interconnected network of computer devices that
    enable permits the communication and exchange of data that are geographically
    separated. The use of IoT in the wastewater treatment industry can televise the
    different treatment processes at a time, coupled with an automatic computer-based
    online controller. The primary object of the IoT during wastewater treatment is
    to data collection, quickly respond during times of crisis, and increase economic
    proficiency. Monitoring of the data management center, the operation state of
    equipment, and other related services can be done with help of IoT [184]. Kumar
    and Hong [185] have proposed a surveillance-based sewage wastewater monitoring
    system along with sensor-enabled IoT to monitor and improve water quality parameters.
    If IoT is combined with MBR technology, it can help in decision-making analysis,
    real-time monitoring, and automatically adjusted operational parameters in sewage
    treatment systems [186]. An intelligent control system based on IoT and deep learning
    were designed for predicting and controlling the printing and dyeing wastewater
    discharge. The device was found to improve the accuracy rate and efficiency of
    wastewater treatment discharge [187]. 6.2.2. Cloud computing and big data Big
    data denotes the data gathered from various sources, for example, sensors, digitizers,
    numerical modeling, etc. On the other hand cloud computing refers to the on-demand
    resources available through the integration of computing services without local
    resources to facilitate user access. Similarly, several researchers have proposed
    various models/approaches to investigate wastewater which is derived from based
    on big data analysis and smart cloud computing services. Various wastewater analysis
    is followed by engendering numerous big data that are stockpiled as a cloud for
    examination and monitoring of wastewater [188]. Big data was found to be helpful
    in the accurate prediction of wastewater treatment process design, control, and
    troubleshooting, increasing water quality and improving wastewater treatment plant
    performance [189]. 6.2.3. Artificial intelligence and machine learning Computer-based
    and sensor-derived technology has provided us with a variety of wastewater treatment
    facilities, which improves overall efficiency. In the latest decade, there has
    been an increasing trend of development based on real-time data monitoring and
    collection with the help of coupled sensor technology [190], [191]. The emergence
    of useful prediction models for wastewater treatment based on artificial intelligence
    [192]. The use of artificial neural networks and computational artificial intelligence
    at a time can process extensive data and is connected to billions of neurons [193].
    The artificial infusion system, the artificial neural network, and the hybrid
    system have the potential to deplete the fecal coliform in wastewater using a
    sequential batch reactor which was validated by Golzar et al. [194] and Khatri
    et al. [195]. Deep cascade-forward back propagation and deep learning time series
    forecasting machine learning techniques showed better results for predicting and
    forecasting TSS, BOD, COD, sulfide, and ammonia removal efficiency of wastewater
    treatment plants [196]. A machine learning model assembled with an artificial
    neural network was developed to predict biomass properties, effluent characteristics,
    and operation parameters and showed 5 % better prediction accuracy than other
    machine learning-based models [16]. An artificial neural network, an artificial
    intelligence-based model, was found to be a robust tool for COD prediction and
    trace metal detection in wastewater [197]. 6.2.4. Block chain technology Blockchain
    technology stands for efficient and accurate collection of information that enables
    operators to avoid mistakes and develop healthy strategies for waste management
    and limiting the chances of leakage. This technology has anticipated a complete
    mechanism for the evaluation and display of waste generated. The primary advantage
    of this technology is real-time monitoring of water consumption and wastewater
    [198]. Hakak et al. [199] have discussed blockchain-based architecture in tannery
    and textile industries to monitor and manage the wastewater amount generated by
    industries and wastewater treatment plants. Data retrieved by blockchain technology
    can be helpful for government agencies, environmental protection agencies, and
    industries to restore the glory of the environment. In addition, blockchain technology
    can be introduced in the plastic waste recycling sector. Khadke et al. [200] have
    proposed that blockchain technology can enormously improve plastic waste management
    via the collection and sorting of plastic recycling. 6.2.5. Robotics and drones
    Small drones can be used to monitor industrial pollution and environmental laws
    including related wastewater treatment facilities in wastewater treatment plants.
    Drones are also used to ensure worker safety purpose and inspection of treatment
    plant infrastructures such as cracks. Nano/micro-sized drones and robotics are
    useful for odor monitoring of wastewater such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia using
    electrochemical sensors [201]. The drone-based chemical sensor system (rotary
    wing drone with 1.3 Kg weight) has benchmarked potential for odor emissions and
    predictions in wastewater treatment plants [202]. RHINOS, a type of portable e-nose
    was developed by Burgués et al. [203] for real-time monitoring of odor quantification
    in wastewater treatment plants. 6.2.6. Polymer-based 3D printing technology Many
    researchers using polymer-based materials have gained significant curiosity towards
    wastewater treatment using desired polymer-based geometrically complex, and porous
    structures [204]. Wastewater treatment performance can be improved using cost-effective
    3D printing membrane fabrication. 3D printing technology could facilitate gradual
    decentralization in remote communities, the hospital sector, and oil and gas extraction
    operations [205]. Nowadays, the scope of 3D printing technology is rapidly increasing
    in research for water purification, membrane separation, and desalination purposes
    [206]. Mai et al. [207] has been successfully used photocatalytic technology coupled
    with 3D printing material for organic pollutants degradation in wastewater and
    found good degradability of wastewater organic compounds. 3D printing technology
    has the potential for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy generation,
    achieving carbon neutrality, manufacturing activities, and carbon capture storage
    technologies [208]. The 3D-printed MoS2/Ni electrodes were used for the dechlorination
    of florfenicol in water, showing a 94.0 % florfenicol degradation rate and proving
    their long-term stability and excellent performance in water pollution [187].
    6.2.7. Critical analysis of IR 4.0 in wastewater treatment applications It is
    needed to practice standard, advanced, and suitable treatment technologies for
    industrial wastewater, as it declares a notable threat to health and the environment.
    Most traditional wastewater treatment approaches are based on mathematical modeling.
    However, IR 4.0-based techniques offer many advantages including an increase in
    the efficacy of various water treatment processes and a lowering cost of testing.
    Despite this, these techniques may help operators by making advanced intelligent
    judgments that improve the accuracy as well as reliability of the treatment system
    despite requiring the operators to analyze complicated data. It may also improve
    the performance and, as a result, lead to their speedy commercialization. IR 4.0
    has the potential to play a major role in achieving the goal of the sustainable
    development goals for clean water. This will result in faster resource recovery,
    the achievement of higher standards of treatment and disposal, and a significant
    pollution reduction. IR 4.0-enabled technologies are comprised such as cloud computing,
    artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, machine learning, robotics, drones,
    etc. are already being explored by various industries. The data can be used through
    the metaverse and augmented reality for a variety of applications, such as monitoring
    water quality or analyzing contaminants. Apart from technological advancement,
    perspectives of wastewater treatment in a circular economy play important role
    in valuable resource recovery i.e. nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), energy,
    and water. In addition to the amazing utility of IR 4.0 in wastewater treatment,
    there are also some bottlenecks attached to their performance in these areas.
    Current research and work done are based on implementing IR 4.0 technologies on
    individual waste management systems but lack the necessary coherence to capitalize
    on technologies such as cloud computing, interconnectivity, and big data, on a
    large scale. Furthermore, such innovative technology is costly to implement due
    to the need for new infrastructure. It also faces the risk of cyberattacks, major
    industry disruption, and the threat of high operation and maintenance costs, lack
    of comprehensive government policy, ethical issues, need for high skilled manpower,
    and high rates of failure. The implementation, operations, and maintenance constraints
    can be addressed by these comprehensive strategies: government promote public-private
    partnership (PPP), endorse foreign direct investment (FDI), like-minded countries
    collaboration to address common problems, and provide incentive, subsidies, a
    rebate to industry for automation of wastewater treatment infrastructure. Further,
    Industry 5.0 is the roadmap of IR 4.0 and is now a new trend that can enhance
    human-machine connectivity and collaboration. The transition from IR 4.0 will
    be evolved into IR 5.0, which will fundamentally change the way we live, work
    and connect. The next wave of technological revolution needs to describe how we
    work together and define laws for the interaction between humans and machines.
    As more automation, machine intelligence, and even robotics assist workers and
    take over key parts of distribution, production, and operations. IR 5.0-based
    technology can enable customization, product creation, and other functions to
    meet the growing demands. 6.3. Transition from a centralized to a decentralized
    treatment system A centralized wastewater treatment system acting as an underground
    network of sewer pipes (collection system) followed by a central, wastewater treatment
    plant was the biggest blunder of mankind [217]. This has resulted in a decline
    in groundwater levels across the world, with many countries facing water scarcity
    [218]. This is a strong barrier to the potential for water reuse. Furthermore,
    once the treated wastewater goes back to the users, it will be uneconomical. In
    addition, a vast network of sewer pipes is very expensive due to higher operational
    and maintenance costs, and wastewater leaking into the surface creates fear of
    drinking water wells contamination that causes serious health implications for
    millions of people [14]. However, in a decentralized wastewater treatment system,
    wastewater must be treated at or near the source. Decentralized treatment systems
    allow water to be reused for non-potable water applications, thereby overcoming
    problems of groundwater depletion and also reducing the utility''s net consumption
    of fresh water, and the high installation and maintenance costs of a large underground
    network of sewer pipes can be avoided. Decentralized wastewater treatment systems
    are operated by a single entity or company over a group of the entity. Hence,
    the global must move towards a decentralized system with centralized real-time
    monitoring and indulge strict regulation. 7. The role of paper mill wastewater
    based circular economy and IR 4.0 in achieving the SDGs More recently, based on
    accuracy and performance, IR 4.0 and circular economy may be able to achieve a
    sustainable operating process. IR 4.0 and circular economy have immense potential
    to transform the linear economy practiced in circular economy-based sustainable
    and flexible supply chains through consolidation of collections and sharing of
    data to maintain continuous operations management [219], [220]. The commitment
    in the COP21 Paris Agreement (COP: Conference of the Parties) in 2015 has emerged
    with an agenda to transform our world through sustainable development by 2030.
    The interplay between digitization and sustainability reveals bright opportunities
    to shape a green economy and society, towards achieving inclusive growth and sustainable
    development [221]. Among 17 SDGs, SDGs 6, 13, 14, and 15 come under the umbrella
    of environmental goals while SDGs 7, 9, and 12 be subjected to clean industry
    and economic goals [222], [223]. According to Rodriguez-Anton et al. [224], societies
    can achieve the following SDGs: SDG 6—Clean water and sanitation; SDG 7 – Affordable
    and clean energy; SDG 9-Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure; SDG 12-Sustainable
    consumption and production patterns; SDG 13 - Climate action through the circular
    economy and IR 4.0 tools (Fig. 5). The application of algae-based sewage treatment
    and resource recovery systems has become a sustainable way for future cities to
    have wastewater utility services and at the same time helps to achieve the SDGs

    action plan to develop resource-efficient wastewater treatment systems. The government
    should promote the public-private model and also provide subsidies to incentivize
    businesses in this sector. Evaluation and comparison of various alternatives with
    a traditional treatment approach and significant scientific and procedural challenges
    to be overcome shortly and move towards the circular economy. Further, the metaverse
    is an extension of our real world into the digital realm that provides an immersive
    multi-user experience for anyone accessing it around the globe. It is also known
    as augmented reality where you will feel experience virtual reality in 3D fiction.
    This technique will have immense potential to connect existing wastewater treatment
    operation mechanisms globally by real-time 3D virtual for the real-time monitoring
    of wastewater, wastewater treatment facilities, and real-time collaboration researcher
    for using better practices transparently and also increase economic proficiency
    of the country. 9. Conclusion Several toxic pollutants are released during the
    papermaking process by paper mill industries. Treatment of toxic wastewater is
    performed by applying various conventional and advanced treatment strategies.
    But nowadays people are focusing on resource recovery and energy generation with
    simultaneous treatment of paper mill wastewater for sustainable growth of industry
    and society. Lignin present in wastewater can be used as feedstock for the generation
    of various useful chemicals. Paper mill wastewater may become a regenerative dynamic
    source of freshwater, energy, and mineral nutrients instead of wastewater. IR
    4.0 technologies enable environmental sustainability and the circular economy
    can represent an effective approach in practices to improve sustainability and
    achieve a “sustainable future”. This will change the wastewater nexus in an environmentally
    and economically sustainable manner. In conclusion, the present review has focused
    on developing resource-efficient wastewater treatment systems, which can never
    be underestimated given the significant impact and role of treated wastewater
    on the receiving environment. All of these steps taken together can help in wastewater
    treatment that leads to a circular economy, maximizes resource recovery, improves
    efficiency, ensures sustainability, and leaves us with a digital future for generations
    to come. CRediT authorship contribtuion statement Rajesh Kumar: Literature search,

    world’s population is rapidly growing and is expected to reach around 9.7 billion
    by 2050 [1]. As a result, there is a growing concern about how to meet the increasing
    demand for food while also ensuring food security and sustainability. In this
    regard, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the agri-food
    sector has the potential to revolutionize the industry and increase sustainability
    in several ways. It can help farmers, food manufacturers, and distributors make
    more informed decisions, improve efficiency, reduce waste, and improve food security
    and sustainability. The Nobel-prize-winning economist Herbert Simon in 1965 said,
    “Machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do”. His visionary perspective
    has come true today through the remarkable achievements that occurred through
    AI applications [2]. AI refers to the ability of machines or computer programs
    to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning,
    problem-solving, and decision-making. There are various subfields of AI, including
    machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision,
    robotics, and cognitive computing. There are several algorithms, for instance,
    reinforcement learning [3], swarm intelligence, cognitive science, expert system,
    fuzzy logic (FL), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Logic Programming, that
    can be used in AI technology [4]. Each of these algorithms has its own unique
    advantages and limitations, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the specific
    task or problem at hand. AI is being used in a wide range of applications, such
    as speech recognition, image and video analysis [5], autonomous vehicles [6],
    medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and many others [7]. Similar to any
    other industry, AI can also be used in the agri-food sector to improve efficiency
    [8] and develop new, more nutritious crops [9], reduce waste [10], and ensure
    safety [11]. AI can be used to optimize crop yields [12] and improve distribution
    and logistics [13]. Table 1 presents summary of the equipment and product’ developed
    by various AI technologies and their domains. Table 1. Summary of the equipment
    and product’ developed by various AI technologies and their domains. In precision
    agriculture, AI can be used to analyze data from sensors, drones, and satellites
    to optimize farming practices, such as irrigation, fertilization, and pest management.
    This can lead to higher yields, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact
    [29,30]. In crop monitoring, AI-powered cameras and sensors can monitor crops
    in real-time, detecting diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies. This allows
    farmers to take action quickly and prevent crop loss [31,32]. AI algorithms can
    analyze weather patterns, soil conditions, and historical data to predict crop
    yields and market demand. This can help farmers plan their planting and harvesting
    schedules and optimize their pricing strategies [33]. During supply chain optimization,
    AI can help streamline the supply chain by predicting demand, optimizing logistics,
    and reducing waste. For example, AI algorithms can be used to predict the optimal
    time to harvest crops and route trucks, and optimize inventory levels [34,35].
    In the food processing industry, AI can be used to optimize food processing operations,
    such as sorting and grading, and to detect defects or contaminants in food products
    [30,36]. AI can also be used to identify and sort fruits and vegetables based
    on their size, color, and other attributes [37]. This can help improve the quality
    and consistency of food products and reduce waste. AI can be used to monitor food
    safety by analyzing data from sensors and cameras to detect potential contaminants
    or other hazards. This can help prevent foodborne illness and improve public health
    [38,39]. In addition, AI can be used to analyze individual consumer data, such
    as age, gender, and activity level, to provide personalized nutritional recommendations.
    This can help consumers make more informed choices about their diet and improve
    their overall health [40]. While these studies provide some valuable insights
    into AI applications in the agri-food sector, a detailed review is still needed
    to understand the current advancements of AI technology in the agri-food sector.
    Therefore, the objective of this review is to highlight the recent developments
    in the food and agriculture sector along with the application of AI technology,
    providing specific examples by the databases during 2010–2023. The review also
    summarizes the future prospects, challenges, and limitations in the field. 2.
    Role of AI in the Agriculture The food industry has always been dependent on the
    agriculture sector since its inception. An increase in food production by the
    agriculture sector can lead to a larger supply of raw materials for the Fast-Moving
    Consumer Goods (FMCG) industries, which rely on these raw materials for processing
    and manufacturing products [26]. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected
    innumerable lives and the supply of these industries pessimistically [41,42].
    The government’s decision to declare a state of emergency led to the closure of
    numerous industries worldwide, which had an effect on the entire supply chain,
    from the farmer to the consumer [43]. The unexpected decline in output and income,
    the drop in oil prices, the drop in tourism receipts, the issues with climate
    change, and other reasons are all connected to the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. According
    to the FAO, the number of people suffering from hunger and malnutrition has been
    on the rise in recent years [45]. However, by introducing AI and ML in crop management
    and using high-tech automated systems, the agriculture industry can tackle many
    of the problems that affect crop production and improve the quality and quantity
    of raw materials available to the food industry. Figure 1 depicts the impact of
    AI on the Argo food sector and FMCG. Some of the ML technologies introduced in
    the agriculture sector that have contributed to improving crop management are
    discussed in this section. Figure 1. Impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and
    machine learning (ML) in the Agrofood and FMCG sector. 2.1. Grain Quality Manual
    grain inspection is a time-consuming process and is prone to human error, which
    can result in the selection of lower-quality grains. This is because manual inspection
    relies on human visual acuity and can be affected by factors, such as fatigue,
    distractions, or variability in lighting conditions. Therefore, the use of computer
    vision systems in grain inspection is becoming increasingly popular. These systems
    use advanced imaging techniques and ML algorithms to analyze images of grains
    and identify defects or impurities, such as broken kernels, foreign materials,
    or fungal infestations [46]. ANN, dense scale-invariant feature transform (DSIFT)
    algorithm, and support vector machines (SVM) are ML techniques that have been
    successfully applied in the agriculture sector for the classification and identification
    of grains and other agricultural products. ANNs are used to classify different
    wheat species based on their visual characteristics, such as shape, size, and
    color [47]. DSIFT algorithm is a computer vision technique that can identify features,
    such as the size, shape, and texture of the wheat grains, and use them to classify
    the grains into different categories [48]. SVM is another ML technique that is
    used for the categorization of wheat grains, identification of fungal species
    in rice, germinated wheat grains, and analysis of milled rice grains. Some technologies
    apply computer vision systems for the inspection of grains in the agricultural
    sector: (i) examination of milled rice grains using SVM, (ii) computerized wheat
    quality assessment system, and (iii) development of a method using hyperspectral
    imaging system for the detection of Fusarium infected wheat grains [49,50]. Computer
    vision systems can help in the accurate and automated monitoring of various plant
    phenology stages, such as seedling emergence, leaf unfolding, flowering, and fruit
    ripening. They can also aid in the early detection of plant stress and diseases,
    allowing for timely interventions and preventing crop losses. In 2015, researchers
    proposed a computer vision system that uses disease-specific image processing
    algorithms to identify the presence and severity of leaf spot diseases in rice
    plants [51]. Backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) have been used in conjunction
    with other technologies, such as wavelets and fuzzy inference systems, for crop
    disease detection and classification [52]. In 2017, a study was conducted to investigate
    the risks of chlorosis due to iron deficiency in soybean plants using real-time
    phenotyping and ML techniques [53]. This approach allowed for the early detection
    and monitoring of iron deficiency stress in soybean plants, enabling researchers
    to optimize iron fertilization strategies and improve crop yields [54,55,56,57].
    2.2. Pest Detection and Weed Management Accurate identification of insect species,
    size variation, and stage of development is crucial for effective pest management
    in agriculture. By identifying the type and number of insects present in a crop
    field, farmers can take appropriate measures to control the pest population and
    prevent damage to their crops. Several AI and ML technologies are being developed
    and tested for insect detection and counting. Some of these technologies use computer
    vision algorithms, while others rely on ML algorithms to identify and classify
    different insect species [58,59]. However, it is important to note that these
    technologies are still in their testing stages and have not yet been widely adopted
    in the agricultural industry. Similarly, herbicides have been widely used by farmers
    for many years to control weeds and improve crop yields. However, the overuse
    or improper application of herbicides can have negative impacts on both human
    health and the environment. To minimize the negative impacts of herbicides, there
    is a growing need for more precise and accurate application methods [60]. Precision
    agriculture techniques, such as site-specific application, can help farmers apply
    herbicides only where they are needed, reducing the amount of chemicals used and
    minimizing the risk of contamination. The development of AI-based technologies
    which use ML algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect and classify
    different types of weeds in crop fields has the potential to improve the efficiency
    and sustainability of agriculture while also reducing the need for herbicides
    and improving crop yields [61]. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and counter propagation-artificial
    neural networks (CP-ANN) were used for the detection of the weed Silybum marianum
    [62]. The use of ANN and Multispectral/Hyperspectral imaging technologies can
    be very effective in detecting and recognizing weed species in crop fields. CP-ANN
    and multispectral imaging captured by UAS were used to detect the weed Silybum
    marianum [63]. CP-ANN is a type of artificial neural network that can be used
    for pattern recognition tasks, while multispectral imaging involves capturing
    images of crop fields at different wavelengths of light. The combination of these
    technologies allowed the researchers to identify the presence of the weed with
    high accuracy and precision. In another research, hyperspectral imaging and ML
    techniques were used to develop a method for crop and weed species recognition
    [3]. Hyperspectral imaging involves capturing images of crop fields at many different
    wavelengths of light, which can provide more detailed information about the spectral
    properties of different plant species. ML algorithms were then used to analyze
    these images and classify different plant species, including both crops and weeds.
    Researchers have also developed SVM based algorithm for the classification of
    different types of weeds in grassland cropping systems based on images captured
    by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [64]. Robotic weed control is also an emerging
    technology that shows great promise for the future of agriculture. Robotic weed
    control systems typically use computer vision and ML algorithms to detect and
    identify weeds in crop fields, then use robotic arms or other mechanical tools
    to remove or destroy the weeds. These systems can operate in a wide range of crop
    environments, including greenhouses, where traditional weed control methods, such
    as herbicides, may not be effective or appropriate [65]. There is the possibility
    of cultivars being equipped with finger weeders or elastic tines for both inter
    and intra-row types of weed control [66]. For analyzing site-specific weed control,
    precision weed management as a part of precision farming is grounded on the utilization
    of information technology [67]. Although intelligent mechanical weed control would
    be more felicitous than weeding devices with cutting action, contrary to time-based
    weed removal [68], it is possible to remotely regulate the tendency of tines of
    spring-tine harrow prototype systems based on the conditions of soil, the density
    of weed, and crop production [69]. 2.3. Crop Selection and Yield Improvement Agricultural
    planning performs an important role in food security around the world, especially
    in countries with the agro-based sector. The challenge in selection of suitable
    crops with improved yield is critical as this could be varied depending on numerous
    conditions, such as weather, soil quality, water access, and pests and diseases
    [8]. AI and ML technologies are being increasingly used in crop selection and
    yield improvement in agriculture. These technologies are particularly useful in
    crop breeding and genetic improvement. By analyzing genetic data from different
    crop varieties and using ML algorithms to identify key traits associated with
    yield and other desirable characteristics, plant breeders can develop new crop
    varieties that are better adapted to specific environmental conditions and produce
    higher yields. Automation technologies, such as robots, are being increasingly
    used to improve crop yields by reducing labor costs and improving efficiency in
    various agricultural tasks, including spraying herbicides, removing weeds, and
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [4,7,8]. Robots, such as the Berry 5 Robot from
    Harvest Croo Robotics (Tampa, FL, USA), are designed to automate the harvesting
    of strawberries, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process [12]. The
    robot uses computer vision and ML algorithms to identify and pick ripe strawberries
    at a faster rate than humans can. This can help farmers to reduce labor costs
    and improve their yields by ensuring that more strawberries are harvested at the
    optimal time. Similarly, robots, such as the “Robocrop”, are being developed for
    specific agricultural tasks, such as pruning flowers on strawberry plants. Furthermore,
    the image-processing robot being developed for picking ripened strawberries uses
    computer vision and ML algorithms to identify and pick the strawberries, reducing
    labor costs and improving the speed and efficiency of the harvesting process [70].
    The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London is developing robots that use
    computer vision and ML to identify water and nutrient levels, control weeds, and
    perform sorting and packaging [71]. Researchers have developed a method for measuring
    plant water retention using image processing techniques in combination with software,
    such as Adobe Photoshop CC 2021 (version 22.0.0.) and MATLAB (version R2022b (9.13)).
    For the purpose of using X-ray CT to study unsaturated Hostun sand and its water
    retention behavior, a complete configuration and setup were created. A “step-by-step”
    technique for obtaining sufficiently high-quality reconstructions that allow the
    three phases of the material (grain, water, and air) to be differentiated was
    also provided. The visualization and characterization of the three stages inside
    the specimen were made easier using picture post-processing. This made it easier
    to create a measuring map that encompasses the full specimen field [72]. Robotic
    chassis are developed for robot software where they are assigned their specific
    tasks. This robot system includes navigation through a field, robotic arms to
    eliminate unwanted flowers, and image capturing [70]. Similarly, Agboka et al.
    [73] applied Agroecological breeding methods, such as maize–legume intercropping
    (MLI) and push-pull technology (PPT), that have been found to be effective in
    minimizing the losses due to insects. Two simple and explainable models, namely,
    the hybrid fuzzy logic combined with the genetic algorithm and symbolic regression,
    are used to forecast maize production. This study also reported that the scale-up
    of MLI and PPT systems improved productivity in sustainable farming. 2.4. Big
    Data and IoT in Smart Farming With the use of modern technology called the Internet
    of Things (IoT), gadgets may link remotely to enable smart farming. To improve
    efficiency and performance across all sectors, the IoT has started to have an
    impact on a wide variety of businesses, including those in health, trade, communications,
    energy, and agriculture [8]. The adoption of modernized technologies in agriculture
    has led to the emergence of “smart farming”, which is a revolutionary approach
    that leverages advanced technologies to increase the quality and quantity of agricultural
    production. AI encourages smart farming, a sustainable technique that helps to
    avoid resource waste (such as fertilizers and pesticides) and achieve sustainable
    development, to replace conventional agricultural practices and methodologies
    [62]. By providing farmers with detailed information on specific crops, such as
    soil nutritional deficiencies, and moisture levels, and hyper-spectral data to
    prevent damage, smart farming enables farmers to make more informed decisions
    about their crops and to optimize their production processes [9]. According to
    research, the Supply Chain Big Data Analytics Market will climb to $9.28 billion
    by 2026 [74]. The Agri-IoT framework has the potential to significantly benefit
    farmers by providing them with real-time data and alerts. By integrating social
    media trends, farm council alerts, and automatic reasoning, the platform can help
    farmers to make informed decisions and take action to mitigate the impact of climatic
    conditions on their crops [75]. Another aspect of smart farming is climate condition-based
    irrigation. The Specialty Crop Research Initiative-Managing Irrigation and Nutrients
    with Distributed Sensing (SCRI-MINDS) project is a great initiative aimed at improving
    plant production. It has been developed to increase efficiency in plant production
    while controlling the excessive use of irrigation water and nutrients [8]. Microsoft
    (Redmond, WA, USA) has also developed an AI-based sowing application that provides
    recommendations, such as the optimal period for sowing seeds, preparing land for
    cultivation, etc. The model by mobile phone app uses remote sensing data from
    geo-stationary satellite images to predict crop yields through every stage of
    farming. To determine the optimal sowing period, the moisture adequacy index was
    calculated. The input data include historical sowing area, production, yield,
    and weather. The app sends sowing advisories to participating farmers on the optimal
    date to sow. The farmers do not need to install any sensors in their fields or
    incur any capital expenditure; they just need a feature phone capable of receiving
    text messages [76]. It is thus imperative that smart solutions are being developed
    for global food safety and security, sustainability of food consumption, and the
    well-being of society. Likewise, environmentally friendly strategies could reduce
    the use of resources (water, fertilizers, herbicides, etc.) for agriculture, reduce
    losses, and shelf-life extension of food products for global food security [77].
    Low altitude spectral imaging for identifying pest infestation, nutrient or moisture
    deficiency, and many more computer-aided systems are being introduced for the
    protection of natural resources and sustainable agriculture. The use of sensors
    deployed to monitor farm conditions and low-altitude air-borne hyperspectral imaging
    is an example of smart farming [78]. Smart farming is one of the biggest methods
    or systems of precision farming. Precision farming involves the precise number
    of inputs, such as soil, water, fertilizer, etc., to be distributed in an accurate
    time and at an accurate place, such as weed control [79]. Trimble Agriculture
    (Westminster, CO, USA), an industrial technology company, has developed a system
    called WeedSeeker spot spray which is an innovative solution for efficient and
    targeted weed control. By using sensors to detect the presence of weeds and a
    spray nozzle to deliver a precise amount of chemicals, the system can help reduce
    the use of herbicides and minimize the environmental impact of weed control [65,66].
    This system can be mounted even on traditional spraying machines with some modifications
    and is most effective in areas with intermittent growth of weeds. Precision Agriculture
    (PA) can be described as a management concept having the ability to recognize
    variability within the soil environment and maximize agricultural production while
    minimizing environmental concussion, i.e., temperature and humidity changes, for
    a particular location. Yield Technology (Carrollton, MO, USA) and Bosch (Stuttgart,
    Germany) have developed a range of technologies that can be used in precision
    agriculture to optimize crop yield and reduce resource waste. These technologies
    include drones, computers, data analytics, and robots, among others [77]. 3. Role
    of AI in the Food Processing AI and ML technologies are being increasingly adopted
    in the food processing industry. These technologies are helping to optimize various
    processes and improve overall efficiency and quality control. The capabilities
    of the intelligent systems in various tasks, such as intelligent food packaging,
    product sorting, foreign object detection, new food product development, equipment
    cleaning, and supply chain management, are elucidated along with the equipment
    and products developed by various AI technologies. 3.1. Intelligent Food Packaging
    The proper arrangement and packing of food products are among the challenging
    tasks and time-consuming processes in the manufacturing sections of the food industry.
    Food packing has four vital roles—protecting the food, displaying the product,
    sanitation, and transportation ability [80]. It protects the food from damage
    caused by biological, chemical, and physiological reasons during the complete
    food logistic system. The visual appearance of the package helps consumers to
    judge the quality of the food and is the first impression about the product. Therefore,
    effective packaging is an essential part of the food manufacturing sector [81].
    AI and ML are increasingly being used in the food packaging industry to improve
    the design, production, and functionality of packaging materials. AI and ML technologies
    are being used in the food packaging industry to improve packaging design. Liu
    [82] applied a packaging design model based on deep convolution generative adversarial
    networks (DCGAN). A packaging design image can be enhanced using visual communication
    technology, resulting in better visual communication ability, a higher degree
    of image information fusion, and an improved packaging design effect. However,
    the development of AI-based systems is a tedious task in the fruits and vegetables
    sector owing to the inconsistency in shape, color, and size [83]. Thus, a copious
    quantity of data is required to train the system properly and perform the task
    in a structured manner. Intelligent tools, such as robotics and drones, can also
    perform a critical role in reducing the packaging cost significantly [14,84].
    For instance, robotics can be used to automate the packaging process, reducing
    the need for human labor and improving the speed and efficiency of the process.
    Robots can be used to sort and inspect food products to ensure that they are properly
    packaged and meet quality standards. Robotics can be used to manage inventory,
    ensuring that packaging materials are available when needed and reducing the risk
    of shortages or excess inventory. In addition, drones can be used to deliver food
    products directly to consumers, reducing the need for packaging and transportation
    [85]. 3.2. Product Sorting AI-based systems can incorporate a variety of technologies,
    such as laser technology, X-ray systems, high-resolution cameras, and infrared
    (IR) spectroscopy, to evaluate the parameters of products at the input level [86].
    These technologies can help identify defects, contaminants, and inconsistencies
    in the products, enabling intelligent decision-making and improving the overall
    quality of the products. However, the inconsistent product homogeneity can be
    a major drawback for sorting methods that rely on input-level evaluation. Inhomogeneous
    products may result in inaccurate sorting decisions, leading to increased waste
    or lower product quality [15]. To overcome this challenge, some sorting systems
    use multiple sensors or technologies to assess product quality and identify defects
    from multiple perspectives. Additionally, ML algorithms can be trained to recognize
    patterns and variations in product properties, helping to improve accuracy and
    consistency in sorting decisions. TOMRA (Asker Municipality, Norway), the global
    provider of advanced collection and sorting systems, has developed an AI system
    that can efficiently perform the sorting task with 90% efficiency. Industries,
    by utilizing such systems, have gained some advantages, such as increased production,
    high-quality yielding, and reduced labor cost. It has been reported that the segregation
    and arrangement issues can be enhanced by 5–10% in the case of potatoes [14].
    In the apple processing industry, deep learning, a subdivision of ML, and a sub-field
    of AI help to categorize the apples with the help of datasets through pattern
    recognition and decision-making. Similarly, Deep Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) assists in identifying the type of apple with the support of CVS (Concurrent
    Versions System). The deep learning model was processed by the data from image
    processing, apple detection, and ripeness classification. The classifiers are
    able to achieve the best result, i.e., the ripeness class of an apple from a given
    digital image [15]. In addition, coffee beans are classified based on the standards,
    category, defects, and nature of the beverage produced. The types of Arabic espresso
    are numbered from the grouping by type or imperfection, from two to eight [87].
    3.3. Foreign Object Detection Contamination by foreign objects causes major issues,
    including food recalls, rejection by consumers, harm to customers, and leads to
    a fall in brand reliability. Foreign matter, including insects, glass, metal,
    or rubber, may accidentally enter the food or packing material during food processing,
    handling, or preparation. Although the magnitude of risks associated with foreign
    matter depends on the size, type, clarity, and hardness of the object, the consumption
    of food contaminated with such objects could lead to choking or other complications
    [88]. As identification of such contaminants with the unaided eye is tough, AI
    and ML technologies can perform an important role in their detection by analyzing
    images of the food products to identify any foreign objects that may be present
    [47]. One approach to foreign object detection using AI and ML is to use image
    recognition algorithms that are trained on large datasets of images of contaminated
    and uncontaminated food products. The algorithm can then analyze images of the
    food products in real-time and identify any foreign objects that may be present
    [89]. Shimonomura et al. [90] applied a cylindrical tactile image sensor for detecting
    foreign objects in food based on differences in hardness. Small, hard foreign
    bodies that were sub-millimeter in size and mixed in with soft food could be successfully
    detected by using a reflective membrane-type sensor surface with high sensitivity.
    Through investigations to find shell pieces left on the surface of raw shrimp
    and bones left in fish fillets, the effectiveness of the suggested method was
    confirmed. 3.4. New Food Product Development As new product development in the
    food industry completely relies on the consumer’s perspectives, the data collected
    by the various decision-making systems are useful in the launch of new products.
    By analyzing the data gathered by the system, the ML-based module could answer
    the question “what exactly the consumers are looking for” and make proper decisions.
    One of the multinational companies has installed automatic vending machines throughout
    the USA for delivering soft drinks, and consumers have thousands of options to
    select their favorite flavors. The information stored by the machine could be
    analyzed by the ML module and deep learning algorithms for the development of
    a new product; one such example is Cherry Sprite, launched by the company. It
    has also been proposed that, in the upcoming decades, many of the food industries
    will benefit from the ML-based decision-making system for the launch of new food
    products [91]. A biotechnology company has launched the world’s first bioactive
    peptide through AI technology. A sports nutrition ingredient is a unique peptide
    network derived from rice protein for alleviating inflammation via modulating
    cytokine responses and for improving immune activity. The company has become the
    world’s first company to demonstrate the potential of AI in improving human health
    [92]. Another US-based IoT-focused technology company has introduced AI-powdered
    ‘home cooking sidekick’, a web and mobile application that integrates with smart
    kitchen assistant Hello Egg to fully automate kitchen needs. The home assistant
    is powered through voice technology to recommend a diet plan based on the preferences
    of an individual. This can also manage the pantry, categorize shopping cart, exhibits
    video recipes, and assists in the delivery of groceries [93]. The role of sensory
    panelists employed in food and beverage industries aim to sensory evaluate the
    new products based on the flavor preferences of consumers. Unfortunately, it is
    difficult to predict the perception and preferences of the target group. This
    led industries to develop a robust methodology for measuring and predicting consumer
    preferences through an AI-based Gastrograph system which uses ML and predictive
    algorithms to understand market preference [94]. 3.5. Equipment Cleaning and Maintenance
    Pieces of machinery and processing tools used in food processing industries must
    be cleaned regularly for proper maintenance. AI-based systems, such as Cleaning
    in place (CIP) and Clean-out-of-place (COP) systems, assist the food industry
    to ensure hygiene and maintain product quality at high standards. For its implementation,
    various cameras and sensors are installed to carry out the tasks. Currently, a
    European company specializing in providing cleaning solutions has introduced SOCIP,
    a Self-Optimizing-Clean-In-Place system to autonomously optimize the cleaning
    process for food manufacturing equipment using AI technology. SOCIP employs ultrasonic
    sensing imaging methods and optical fluorescence methods to assess the number
    of food particles and microbial debris that is present inside the equipment. The
    SOCIP system works by using sensors to scan the inside of the equipment and create
    a real-time image of the surface. This information is then used to determine how
    much cleaning is necessary to achieve the desired level of cleanliness [36,74].
    3.6. Demand-Supply Chain Management Presently, food industries are concerned about
    food safety policies, which are necessary for the transparent execution of all
    food logistic activities [2,62]. To monitor every stage of the process, for instance,
    from cost regulation to resource management, AI is being employed. It manages
    and predicts the passage of possessions from where they are grown to the place
    where consumers gather them [95]. One company provides integrated AI-enabled solutions
    for the retail industry. Their solutions can help to optimize various aspects
    of retail operations, including transportation, billing, resource management,
    and inventory control. The system can improve the retail industry using AI algorithms
    to optimize packaging and improve shelf life [96]. By analyzing data on product
    characteristics, environmental conditions, and other factors, AI algorithms can
    help to identify the optimal packaging materials and designs to improve product
    quality and extend shelf life. Additionally, AI can help to improve food safety
    by providing greater transparency and visibility into the logistics and supply
    chain process. By tracking products from farm to table, retailers can identify
    and address potential food safety issues before they become a problem. There will
    be a need for more contributions that make use of a variety of data sources in
    order to realize the goal of an expanded agri-food supply chain that involves
    more stakeholders and the whole supply chain lifetime. Additionally, to complete
    the loop in sustainable agri-food, the extended AI support for agri-food needs
    to increase the use of contextual information, food consumption, and food waste
    reduction [97]. 3.7. 3D/4D Food Printing-Extrusion Technology AI can be of particular
    interest when combined with 3D and 4D printing technologies. By integrating AI
    into 3D/4D printing process, it is possible to increase the performance of the
    printers, reduce the risk of errors, and facilitate automated production. The
    combination of AI and 3D/4D printing technologies can lead to the establishment
    of start-ups and research projects that integrate AI into 3D/4D printing products
    and services [98,99]. The food processing sectors worldwide are now adopting 3D
    food printing technology to engender operations more systematically and independently.
    This technology can cause active food value chains more client-friendly and viable
    by delivering on-demand food manufacturing, empowering computerized food customization,
    and reducing food wastage. A 3D/4D food printer operates in a similar way to a
    regular 3D printer, with the primary difference being the printing medium used.
    Instead of using melted plastic, a 3D/4D food printer uses a food material as
    the printing medium. Consumers can materialize designs from an e-commerce platform
    via websites or mobile applications, and this would minimize warehousing, packaging,
    and delivery charges [100]. The effectiveness of printing food is improved while
    food processing expenses and time are minimized, and time is saved by refining
    3D printing techniques and equipment [101]. An additional aspect is that personalized
    products will be delivered very quickly using 3D printing technology than regular
    food processing technology. As the products are delivered much faster, the need
    for synthetic polymer-based packing materials and chemical preservatives could
    be eliminated, and this will also improve food safety. Furthermore, multiphase
    processing of food products could be minimized to a single stage [102]. 4. Role
    of AI in Food Quality and Food Safety AI’s captivating capability has made it
    an extremely appealing technology to use in industries not only for decision-making,
    process estimation, cost savings, and high profitability but also for overall
    quality improvement [103]. AI, combined with data science, has the potential to
    improve the quality of food and service offered by cafes, restaurants, online
    food delivery systems, and food stores, leading to increased sales, profitability,
    and customer satisfaction. By analyzing data and applying algorithms, AI can help
    to improve sales prediction, menu optimization, personalized recommendations,
    and supply chain optimization [16]. AI has made significant contributions to various
    aspects of the food industry, and these contributions can be broadly classified
    into three main categories, food quality management, food security management,
    and food waste management [74]. AI has significant roles and potential applications
    in several food sectors, including dairy, beverage, and bakery, and are presented
    in Figure 2. Figure 2. The layout of the functions of AI in several food sectors.
    AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data from dairy production processes
    to identify patterns and make predictions that can optimize production and improve
    product quality. By using AI tools, such as fuzzy logic and ANN, dairy producers
    can make more accurate predictions and adjust their processes accordingly, leading
    to more efficient and higher-quality production. Similarly, AI tools, such as
    e-nose, e-tongue, CVS, and image analysis, can help producers optimize their production
    processes and understand consumer preferences in the beverage industry. AI can
    also help the bakery industry to improve product quality, increase productivity,
    and by using AI-powered tools, such as robots and visualization, bakeries can
    create more innovative products and optimize their production processes [85].
    4.1. Food Quality Management Fresh fruits and vegetables are highly perishable
    and can quickly spoil if not stored and monitored properly. In the past, many
    vendors did not have access to the necessary tools to monitor the real-time condition
    of fruits in storage, which resulted in significant food waste. However, with
    the advancements in technology, there are now several solutions available that
    can help vendors to monitor the condition of fresh fruits and vegetables in real-time
    [104]. Digital twin (DT) technology is a promising tool for monitoring the quality
    and condition of fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the cold chain. The extent
    of tissue damage that occurs in fruits depends on several factors, including physical
    and biochemical properties, and environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity,
    and postharvest treatments. By using DT technology to monitor these factors, it
    is possible to identify potential issues early on and take corrective action to
    prevent further damage [17]. In addition to monitoring the cold chain, DT technology
    can also be used to optimize the storage and transportation of fresh fruits and
    vegetables [17,105]. Thermal imaging is a non-contact and emerging technology
    that is becoming increasingly popular for fruit quality examination in the fruit
    and food industry. It offers a non-destructive way to examine a product without
    the need for extraction, which could cause permanent damage. Infrared thermal
    imaging detects the presence of damage or defects in fresh fruits and vegetables
    by measuring the change in temperature between undamaged and damaged tissues,
    which is caused by the variation in thermal diffusion coefficients [105]. Likewise,
    CVS technologies are increasingly being used in the food industry to examine the
    quality of different kinds of food products. By using different types of CVS,
    including traditional CVS, hyperspectral CVS, and multispectral CVS to examine
    the exterior quality of food products, it is possible to identify potential issues
    early on and take corrective action to prevent further deterioration or contamination
    [106]. Electric noses (Ens) and electric tongues (Ets) are among the most promising
    inventions of AI in the food industry [107]. EN is an instrument that consists
    of an array of electronic chemical sensors with an appropriate pattern recognition
    system and partial specificity, capable of recognizing complex or simple odors
    and Ets are multisensory systems for liquid analysis based on chemical sensor
    arrays and pattern recognition [108]. The sensors used in Ens are able to collect
    data on the different smells and flavors present in the food or beverage being
    analyzed. This data is then transferred to a data center, where it can be accessed
    by ML algorithms [109]. These algorithms are able to analyze the data and make
    decisions based on the information gathered. In addition, EN technology can also
    be used to improve the overall quality of food products. By detecting subtle differences
    in the smells and flavors of different batches of food products, companies can
    make adjustments to their production processes to ensure that their products are
    consistent and of the highest quality [110]. The coffee cupping method was developed
    by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). It is a well-established
    process for assessing the quality of roasted coffee, and it involves steeping
    ground coffee beans in boiling water and evaluating the aroma, flavor, and other
    sensory characteristics of the resulting brew. In recent years, AI technologies,
    such as Ens and ANNs, have been used to enhance the coffee cupping process. E-noses
    can be used to detect and analyze the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are
    responsible for the aroma of coffee. By using an EN in combination with an ANN,
    it is possible to predict the quality and flavor of roasted coffee with a high
    degree of accuracy [111]. Ets are another promising technology in the food industry
    that can be used to assess the qualities of various types of beverages, including
    dairy and alcoholic beverages. Ets can detect different taste characteristics,
    such as sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and bitterness, which can be important
    factors in determining the overall quality of a product. For example, in the case
    of tea, there are certain flavor compounds, such as theaflavin (TF) and thearubigin
    (TR), which can vary in concentration depending on the age of the tea. By using
    a pulse voltametric ET in combination with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer-based analysis,
    these compounds can be measured and used to identify the type of tea being analyzed
    [112,113]. One of the key advantages of the e-tongue is its ability to detect
    dissolved solids and volatile compounds that are responsible for the aroma and
    can give off odors after evaporation. This makes it a useful tool for analyzing
    the overall flavor profile of a sample, and its aroma [114]. The use of Ets for
    food recognition has been studied extensively, including for the differentiation
    of liquid and flesh foods. In a study by Rudnitskaya et al. [113], an ET was used
    to analyze a range of liquid and flesh food samples, including juices, wines,
    and meat products. The results of the study showed that the ET was able to successfully
    differentiate between different types of liquid and flesh foods based on their
    taste profiles. The study conducted by Tan and Xu [114] reviewed the applications
    of electronic noses (e-noses) and electronic tongues (e-tongues) in the determination
    of food quality-related properties. The study found that e-noses and e-tongues
    are increasingly being used in the food industry due to their ability to detect
    and identify various volatile and non-volatile compounds that contribute to food
    aroma and taste. 4.2. Food Safety Management Food safety ensures the absence of
    any harmful/toxic substances in it and fulfills the obligatory nutritional requirements.
    A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to ensure food safety and good hygiene
    during food processing, storage, and sale, and to eliminate the risk of biotic
    and abiotic contaminants, which causes food poisoning. Image processing techniques
    can be used to analyze various characteristics of food products, including size,
    shape, color, and texture. By estimating the projected area and perimeter of food
    items, one can quantify their size and shape, which can be useful for quality
    control purposes [115]. However, it is worth noting that image processing techniques
    alone cannot detect the presence of harmful microorganisms or other potential
    food safety hazards. That is where next-generation sequencing (NGS) comes into
    perform by the determination of the whole genome sequence of a single cultured
    isolate (e.g., a bacterial colony, a virus, or any other organism), also known
    as “whole genome sequencing” (WGS), and “metagenomics”, in which NGS is used to
    generate sequences of several microorganisms in a biological sample [11]. Furthermore,
    the use of AI and automation can greatly speed up the analysis of NGS data, allowing
    for more rapid identification of potential food safety hazards. This can help
    prevent widespread illness by allowing for quick intervention before contaminated
    products reach consumers [116]. 4.3. Food Waste Management Food waste is a significant
    issue that affects not only the environment but also food security and financial
    sustainability. It is estimated that 1.6 billion tons of food are wasted annually,
    and most of this waste (81%) is made up of inedible by-products of food production
    practices. There is a growing recognition within the food industry that food waste
    is not just an unavoidable cost of doing business but also a significant sustainability
    issue and an underutilized resource [85]. According to McKinsey & Company (New
    York, NY, USA), a consulting firm that has been at the forefront of researching
    and implementing AI in various industries, AI could offer a $127 billion opportunity
    by reducing food waste by 2030 [74]. Modern techniques, such as omics, can be
    exploited to overcome food waste reduction and management challenges. For example,
    metagenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, waste omics, and disease omics can
    be used to understand the biochemical processes that occur during food waste decomposition
    and identify potential hazards and contaminants in food waste [10]. There have
    been various conglomerate concepts and solutions developed and tested by researchers
    and government organizations to mitigate and manage food waste issues. For instance,
    Black Soldier Fly (BSF) farming is a promising practice for its versatility and
    multi-roles in various applications, such as sustainable food production and food
    waste management. The implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in
    BSF farming can offer significant benefits in terms of efficient production and
    waste management. By integrating sensors and devices with software and mobile
    applications, farmers can remotely monitor and control various parameters of BSF
    farming. This allows for more precise and customized control over the growing
    conditions of the BSF larvae, leading to higher yields and better-quality biomass
    [117,118]. 4.4. Predicting Shelf Life AI and ML techniques, including ANNs, have
    been widely applied to predict the shelf life of foods. These techniques use mathematical
    models and data from various physicochemical and sensory parameters of the food
    product to develop predictive models that can estimate the expected shelf life
    [18,119]. A research study conducted by Goyal and Goyal [120] proposed the use
    of time-delayed neural network (TDNN) models for predicting the shelf life of
    processed cheese. The study aimed to develop a model that could accurately predict
    the shelf life of processed cheese and reduce the need for time-consuming physical
    testing. The results of the study showed that the TDNN model was able to accurately
    predict the shelf life of processed cheese. AI models for shelf-life prediction
    of mangoes stored under different conditions were developed based on respiration
    rate and ripeness levels under different supply chain scenarios. A deep-CNN was
    fine-tuned on 1524 image data of mangoes that can classify the ripeness levels
    of mangoes [121]. 5. Role of AI in the Personalized Nutrition Nutrition can be
    a complex and individualized aspect of life, and what works for one person may
    not work for another. Personalized nutrition is an approach that considers an
    individual’s unique nutritional needs, preferences, and health goals. Advancements
    in technology, such as AI and ML, are enabling the development of personalized
    nutrition solutions. These solutions use data about an individual’s genetics,
    microbiome, lifestyle, and dietary habits to provide personalized nutrition recommendations
    [122]. One example of a personalized nutrition solution is a digital health company
    that offers personalized nutrition solutions for individuals and healthcare organizations,
    which uses ML to analyze an individual’s dietary habits and provide personalized
    food recommendations. Another example is a biotechnology company that offers personalized
    nutrition solutions based on an individual’s microbiome. The company uses AI and
    ML to analyze an individual’s gut microbiome and provide personalized dietary
    recommendations based on the types and amounts of gut bacteria present [123].
    Similarly, another digital health company offers a range of personalized health
    coaching solutions, including personalized nutrition coaching, weight management,
    diabetes management, and hypertension management. This company uses speech recognition
    and voice AI technologies to provide personalized health coaching to individuals.
    The company’s mobile app uses speech recognition technology to analyze an individual’s
    voice and provide personalized coaching based on their responses. One is a mobile
    app and website that allows individuals to track their daily food intake and monitor
    their nutrition goals. The app provides users with access to a database of over
    800,000 food items, allowing them to easily log their meals and track their calories,
    macronutrients, and micronutrients. Im2Calories uses a combination of computer
    vision algorithms and deep learning to analyze the visual features of food images
    and estimate the number of calories in the food [124]. 6. Conclusions and Future
    Perspectives AI has the potential to revolutionize the food and agriculture sector
    by improving efficiency, increasing productivity, and promoting sustainability.
    However, the future of AI in the food and agriculture sector also raises some
    concerns. For example, there are concerns about the potential for AI to increase
    inequality and reduce jobs in rural areas. A major constraint is the high cost
    of implementing AI systems. AI requires significant investment in hardware, software,
    and training, which can be prohibitively expensive for small and medium-sized
    businesses. Additionally, there are concerns about the reliability and accuracy
    of AI systems, particularly when it comes to making decisions about crop management
    and food safety. Smart, robotic farming and factories are just some of the ways
    in which AI and ML are being used to improve efficiency, productivity, and sustainability
    in the Agri-food industry. The future of the agriculture and food industry is
    likely to be shaped by AI and ML technologies with a range of potential applications
    across farming, pest management, food processing, packaging, quality control,
    shelf-life extension, and supply chain management. While there is a lot of potential
    for AI to revolutionize the agri-food sector, making it more efficient, sustainable,
    and innovative, it also raises important ethical, legal, and social implications
    that need to be carefully considered and addressed. It is important to ensure
    that these technologies are developed and used in a sustainable and ethical manner
    to ensure their long-term benefits. The sustainability of AI will depend on a
    range of factors, including the development and deployment of AI technologies,
    the policies and regulations that govern their use, and the way in which society
    adapts to the changes that AI brings. The sustainability of AI encompasses a range
    of environmental, social, and economic factors. There are several key considerations
    that need to be considered when it comes to the sustainability and future of AI.
    There is a need to address the skills gap and to ensure that there is a sufficient
    pool of talent to develop and deploy AI systems in a sustainable and responsible
    manner. This requires investment in education and training programs that can equip
    individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to work in the field of AI. While
    there are still challenges to be overcome, such as data privacy concerns, high
    cost, ethical issues, and the need for specialized training, the future looks
    promising for AI in this industry. As more and more farmers adopt AI-powered technologies,
    one can expect to see significant improvements in food production and distribution
    in the years to come. Future works could include a comparison of different ML
    algorithms in terms of predictive performance on operational processes in the
    agri-food sector. Author Contributions A.T., G.N., M.J., S.S. (Somesh Sharma),

    1. Introduction By the year 2050, the human population is expected to reach 9.7
    billion, a 50% growth from 2019 (UN DESA, 2019). In the same year, more than two-thirds
    of this population is expected to live in urban areas, up from the current 4 billion
    (Our World In Data, 2019), while cities contribute to around 80% of a country’s
    gross domestic product (GDP) (Bank, 2020). Global material footprint is forecasted
    to grow from 92 billion MT in 2017, to 190 billion MT in 2060, with a material
    intensity increase per dollar to GDP of 1.16 between 2010 and 2017 (UNSTATS, 2019),
    and it is forecasted that this footprint will grow from 40 billion MT in 2010,
    to 90 billion MT by 2050 (UN Environment, 2018). Populations are consuming 75%
    more than the earth can regenerate material resources (Lacy et al., 2020). Governance
    bodies such as the European Union (EU), held the COP25 Summit in Madrid, Spain,
    where the European Green Deal was presented and accepted in January 2020 (European
    Parliament, 2020). As part of the European Green Deal, calls for new circular
    economy (CE) initiatives were established with the goal of reducing waste in the
    digital sector without increasing administrative workloads, while simultaneously
    seeking to lower emissions in the agricultural sector (European Parliament, 2020).
    In 2020, the Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP)
    recently published a report studying the impacts cities have and, despite occupying
    less than 2% of the world’s surface area, globally contribute up to 76% of greenhouse
    gas emissions (GHG), 75% of natural resource consumption, and 50% of waste production
    (CSCP and Dhawan, 2020). As wealth grows, so too will migration from rural to
    urban cities around the world alongside challenges that require smarter infrastructural
    designs that address: increased scarcity to resources that threaten living standards;
    the threat of climate change which could displace millions of people in the future;
    and a food security crisis which, the current conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated
    – are all factors precipitating the need for solutions that address both food
    security and sustainability objectives (Silva et al., 2018a, Joshi et al., 2016,
    Behnassi and El Haiba, 2022, Grimm et al., 2008, Del Borghi et al., 2020). For
    example, Russia and Belarus account for about 38% of potassic, 17% compound, and
    15% nitrous fertilisers worldwide (The World Bank, 2022). The consumption of Phosphorous
    (P) – an element essential in crop production – is predicted to deplete globally
    within the next century (Herrera-Estrella and López-Arredondo, 2016), and in 2014,
    the European Commission has declared it a critical raw material (European Commission,
    2014). Predictions in the scarcity of nutrients such as demand for P vary, with
    some estimates peaking 45 – 50 million tonnes by 2050 (Herrera-Estrella and López-Arredondo,
    2016), and 55 – 60 million tonnes by 2030–2040 (Vance and Notes, 2001). P has
    no substitute compound or element for fertilisers used in crop production, and
    its depletion will lead to a severe food shortage globally – pushing up prices
    (Scholz et al., 2013) and potentially increasing malnutrition across human populations
    (Vance and Notes, 2001). Despite food production reaching $US 1 trillion annually,
    approximately 30% of this is thrown out (Foundation, 2023). CE is one solution
    towards tackling the myriad of problems regarding nutrient wastage arising from
    urbanisation (Robles et al., 2020, Godoy-Faúndez et al., 2021, Cordell et al.,
    2009). CE in itself, currently faces multifaceted challenges (Galvão et al., 2018),
    including: technology implementation, policy and regulatory barriers, financially
    and economically costly investment, resistance in companies, performance, lack
    of customer interest and social acceptance (Rajput and Singh, 2021, Kirchherr
    et al., 2018, Hart et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019). There also exists a lack
    of institutional legitimacy beyond conventional recycling systems that bars further
    progress of CE acceptance (Ranta et al., 2018). This lack of acceptance for CE
    in some institutions for recognition as a legitimate methodology creates ripe
    conditions for regulatory and policy barriers to its implementation. Additionally,
    private sector companies and consumers lack favourable incentives or perceptive
    inclinations towards CE operations (Klein et al., 2022), and its derived outputs
    are commonly and publicly perceived as being “second hand” (Urbinati et al., 2017).
    Within the private sector, business leaders are confronted by paradoxical forces
    between adopting CE for the greater good of society while neglecting a small pool
    of stakeholders; or continue business as usual, suffice economic and financial
    objectives, and operate on linear economies (De Angelis, 2021). Because businesses
    occupy much of the city’s commercial landscape, relative to other regions, resource
    consumption is heavily concentrated within this. At the governance level, city
    planners, developers and managers have faced difficulties improving the performance
    efficiency of CE city ecosystems due to the lack of waste collection infrastructure
    (Aceleanu et al., 2019). These barriers however, are further exacerbated by countries
    with weak institutions, capital funding, and infrastructure. For example, only
    8% of all wastewater is treated in low-income countries (EIB, 2022). There are
    therefore, both physical and governance barriers to CE city implementation which
    are affected by the country’s level of development, while wealthier regions, such
    as the EU, have seen a rapid adoption of CE (Mhatre et al., 2021). Despite this,
    there are benefits to countries adopting CE. The introduction of ecodesign principles
    has seen EU consumers save €120 billion, a 10% reduction in power consumption
    costs, and by 2030, the new Circular Economy Action Plan is expected to help generate
    132 MT of primary energy savings (European Commission, 2022). The adoption of
    CE, according to the UN Environment Statistics, could also lead to a 72% reduction
    in GHG emissions and a 28% reduction in primary resource use (CSCP and Dhawan,
    2020). Because about 40% of the world’s cropland is located within 20 km of cities,
    CE nutrient recovery and logistics becomes all the more attractive (Foundation,
    2023). Cities can become centres for nutrient collection, as opposed to disposal
    – requiring a combination of community effort, effective regulatory and governance
    initiatives, and city management and planning. However, even more rarely studied
    is the use of state-of-the-art digital technologies to facilitate CE adoption
    in smart, interconnected cities to recover nutrients from organic waste, and drive
    its integration with society. Past review papers examined and discussed the applications
    of machine learning (ML) for CE. Sundui et al. (2021). deduced that ML technologies
    are being used with algae-bacteria as the hidden layer within ANN models to predict
    nutrient recovery and wastewater by-products. Guo et al. (2021). reviewed ML technologies
    used in organic solid waste management (SWM), with artificial neural network (ANN)
    being the most popularised ML model for improving the efficiency, accuracy, cost
    and environmental benefits of organic SWM on municipal SWM, anaerobic digestion,
    thermal treatment, composting, and landfill. Macura et al. (2019). proposed promising
    technologies in the recovery of Nitrogen (N) and P. Other review papers have applied
    ML to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) (Sundui et al., 2021; Xia et al., 2022a).
    Conducting a bibliometric analysis and using SCOPUS with keywords: “Nutrient”
    AND “Circular Economy”; “Nutrients” AND “Machine Learning” OR “Artificial Intelligence”
    and \"Machine Learning” AND “Smart Cities\" OR \"Smart City\", there has been
    growth in interest in combining CE with nutrients and machine learning. Meanwhile,
    popularity has increased across applications for machine learning with CE and
    smart cities, however, very rarely has there been studies combining the use of
    nutrients with circular economies within smart cities despite the huge research
    occurring across ML, smart cities, nutrients and CE (Fig. 1). Research has grown
    in the area of reusing waste within the context of nutrients, energy and predictive
    modelling techniques and in particular, within smart cities to drive sustainable
    outcomes. Similar analysis was conducted with Web of Science and inputted into
    VOS Viewer to visually represent the relationships between nutrient waste, smart
    cities, and circular economy related topics (Fig. 2) with the following search
    queries: “Smart City” OR “Smart Cities” OR “Circular Economy” OR “Circular Economies”
    OR “Machine Learning” OR “Artificial Intelligence” OR “Nutrient” OR “Phosphorous”
    OR “Nitrogen” OR “Potassium”. The use of ML as a technical driver of CE is gaining
    traction as governments and academia alike are moving towards policies to reduce
    waste generation in a world of growing urbanisation. Download : Download high-res

    There is growing interest in the application of smart learning technologies with
    the recovery and reuse of nutrients, energy and waste collected from cities which
    behave as concentrated centres for waste generation. ML technologies offers one
    supporting solution towards streamlining the adoption of CE operations for smart
    cities, and recent research has seen ML technologies being applied for CE (Prioux
    et al., 2022a, Arranz et al., 2022, Chen, 2022). This area of digital adoption
    for CE frameworks and its impacts are rarely studied (Uçar and Le, 2020; Petit-Boix
    and Leipold, 2018), particularly when combined with city management. Machine learning
    circular economy studies have seen applications throughout various environmental
    settings, including: improving lifecycle assessments (LCA) (Prioux et al., 2022b),
    supply chain management (Wang and Zhang, 2020; Alavi et al., 2021), plastic waste
    management (Chin et al., 2022a), manufacturing (Akanbi et al., 2020), and so forth.
    Various studies have pointed out the use of digital technologies as drivers towards
    CE adoption (Chauhan et al., 2021, Russell et al., 2020, Rejeb et al., 2022) and
    as tools to overcomes barriers (Krishnakumari et al., 2021). However, it was only
    recently that serious interest in the integration of both CE practices and frameworks
    with digital technologies had begun growing. IoT and Industry 4.0 studies combining
    CE have been done (Cheah et al., 2022), offering smarter waste segregation, landfilling,
    composting, recycling and energy conversion. 1.1. Understanding the concept of
    circular economies Kenneth E. Boulding, an environment economist, first introduced
    the concept of CE in his book “The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth” in
    his discussion of open- and closed-looped systems (Boulding, 1966). Boulding interpreted
    the earth as a cosmic body of finite resources that could retain circularity in
    its material economics, so long as the outputs were recycled as inputs. Circularity
    requires both material and energy inputs to work in converting waste to valuable
    inputs. Energy constantly undergoes entropy that is nonrecoverable when transformed
    into a form of work - an argument against a fully circular system, where systems
    could be isolated in a completely self-sufficient, thermodynamic black box without
    external energy consumption. Boulding even boasted alongside Richard Meier that
    energy could be extracted from methane-producing algae to refute this (Boulding,
    1966), an idea backing the use of microorganisms to recover energy from human
    waste. This concept of using microorganisms and other technologies to recover
    valuable waste products has been proposed to support circular self-sufficiency
    without the consumption of either sunlight or fossil fuels, energy sources that
    exist in open-looped economies. There are, however, many other definitions depending
    on what stakeholder is asked. Business definitions have been put forth, defining
    CE as a cradle-to-cradle concept of maximising “eco-effectiveness” and “inter-system
    ecology” (Korhonen et al., 2018). From this perspective, CE is more likely to
    be defined along the lines of stakeholder management, financial and regulatory
    factors, organisational resistance and consumer acceptance (Ritzén and Sandström,
    2017; Stewart et al., 2018), framed and conveyed as business models (Lüdeke-Freund
    et al., 2019; Pieroni et al., 2019). Authors in the past have introduced economic
    principles (George et al., 2015), governance (Joshi et al., 2016), manufacturing
    (Lieder and Rashid, 2016), and more to shape the definition of CE. Kirchherr et
    al. (2017). best summarises CE with the 10 R core principles of the framework:
    refuse; rethink; reduce; reuse; repair; refurbish; remanufacture; repurpose, recycle;
    and recover (Fig. 3). Although, the reduction principle is often rejected as this
    would lead to excess converted output that is no longer needed for input. Within
    the context of smart cities, CE - defined by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (Ellen
    Macarthur Foundation, 2017) and alongside the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2017)
    - is the regenerative and restorative design of cities promoting circularity and
    prosperity for the city’s inhabitants and the decoupling of finite resource consumption
    with value creation, with digital technologies as a key enabler. CE offers a promising
    outlook for businesses globally, with a potential, unlockable economic value of
    $US4.5 trillion by 2030 across: energy; metals and mining; oil and gas; chemical;
    manufacturing; information technology; transportation; fast moving consumer goods;
    household goods, and fashion (Lacy et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res

    the use of CE and nutrient recovery from waste. 1.2. The ‘smart city’ Smart cities
    are ecosystems that are deeply interconnected through the IoT. Rapid advancements
    in technologies over the years have pushed research into this new realm of incorporating
    technologies into urban city life. Silva et al. (2018b). proposed four pillars
    to the smart city: institutional, physical, social and economic infrastructure.
    Effective institutional governance are the bodies (public, private, and not-for-profits)
    which implement smart city principles. Physicality refers to the infrastructure
    of the city which facilitates sustainable practices and waste management, for
    example, waste collection bins. Social infrastructure is the societal awareness
    and support for smart cities from its citizens. Finally, economic infrastructure
    in smart cities should lead to wealth and job creation opportunities through combined
    advanced technology implementations and management. Of course, smart cities also
    have underlying technical architectures that make all this happen. Sensing (systems
    that measure data), transmission (5 G networks, wireless, relay data and satellite),
    data (management, monitoring and storage), and application (transport, infrastructure,
    healthcare, security) layers are the technical hierarchies of a smart city (Silva
    et al., 2018b). ML rests in the processing layer of the smart city architecture,
    and is also an emerging area to make smart cities smarter (Fig. 4). The sensing
    layer utilises hardware to collect data that is then relayed to the communication
    layer. The data is then communicated through transmission technologies to the
    processing layer that then processes the data into an actionable environmental
    outcome. The focus of the review paper is the processing layer and the range of
    ML models available for accurate nutrient CE management. Download : Download high-res

    the smart city to measure, relay, process, and apply meaningful data into actionable
    environmental areas. Other literatures have applied ML to smart city. Chen (Chen,
    2022) used automatic ML and IoT methods to measure and predict recycling data
    by integrating sensors into waste bins. This data could be used to improve the
    efficiency of recycling materials with complex waste mixtures by better identifying
    and predicting materials that can be recycled. Joshi et al. (2016). proposed the
    use of the Social, Management, Economic, Legal, Technology and Sustainability
    (or SMELTS) model to establish a framework for developing smart cities - an approach
    that treats cities as operating integrally with other services such as transportation,
    waterways, electricity channels, communications, waste management, monitoring
    and control systems, and GHG emissions. Other studies have approached smart city
    circular economy (SCCE) with similar levels of connectedness. For example, George
    et al. (2015). proposed international connectivity and cooperation between countries
    and cities to improve environmental quality by utilising the economic comparative
    advantages of each country in recycling waste. McKinsey and Company and the Ellen
    Macarthur Foundation (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2015) breaks CE into the ReSOLVE
    framework: regenerate, share, optimise, loop, virtualise and exchange. The virtualise
    concept is particularly profound in the drive towards connectivity, automation,
    virtual delivery of services, and monitoring of materials for ML IoT smart cities.
    IoT offers greater connectivity for nutrient recovery technologies that combine
    both ML and online database for remote waste monitoring and management. If anything,
    IoT and ML technologies provide a myriad of opportunities to make CE implementation
    seamlessly easy and hassle free, creating a digital economy where nutrients can
    be resold back to consumers – optimised through the IoT – resulting in leaner
    supply chains through better route planning, collection frequencies, fleet management,
    waste sorting, communication and certification of material shipments, and biomass
    storage. According to Accenture, the addition of CE business models can reduce
    costs by up to $500 million and raise revenue through CE generated products by
    $100 million (Lacy et al., 2020). Different nutrient recovery technologies can
    be connected to the IoT, allowing data to be shared and processed in a single
    location (Adi et al., 2023). This connectivity aids governing institutions towards
    improved smart city management through rich quantities of real-time data presented
    to them (Zekić-Sušac et al., 2021). However, poor quality data, speed versus accuracy
    trade-offs, large complex quantities and heterogeneity of data will become challenging
    for IoT SCCEs (Adi et al., 2023; Sarc et al., 2019). Unfortunately, the relationship
    between governance, technologies, urban planning, management, and society with
    SCCE nutrient recovery is hardly understood nor reached a level of maturity throughout
    current research. Other barriers include poor societal acceptance of smart cities,
    strong fossil fuel usage, low private-public sector collaboration, and a lack
    of IoT technologies throughout cities due to incompatible technologies with outdated
    infrastructure (Razmjoo et al., 2021). Countries most interested in adopting CE
    with IoT and big data are China and the United States, while countries with high
    GHG emissions tend to take lesser interest in CE, and there are gaps between current
    research and CE industry initiatives (Nobre and Tavares, 2017). Overwhelming research
    in sustainable smart cities has taken interest in the use of IoT and big data
    systems for GHG emissions reduction and innovative renewable energy management
    (Razmjoo et al., 2021, Nobre and Tavares, 2017, Kamyab et al., 2020, Aliero et
    al., 2021, Dubey et al., 2020a), however, CE nutrient recovery and its end-to-end
    implementation within smart cities is often overlooked during this pursuit for
    net zero GHG emissions. 1.3. Machine learning The area of ML emerged from the
    1950 s as a way to understand and model learning patterns seen throughout human
    thought processes. The first ML was developed by Arthur Samuel, a program which
    could learn to play chess and improve over time based on the probability of each
    successful or losing move (Samuel, 1959). Researchers in the past have attempted
    to explain ML through the lenses of psychological (modelling based on human behaviour),
    empirical (adjusting algorithms or the environment), mathematical equations, and
    practical applications to the real world (Langley, 1996). Classification involves
    the use of both supervised (where correct steps are suggested throughout the ML
    process and data classification is pre-determined) and unsupervised (data classes
    are not known in advance) learning methods (Kung, 2014). Superfluous data and
    undesirable noise are all barriers that affect the learning and performance accuracies
    of ML (Langley, 1996). The domains of ML can be further broken down into linear
    and nonlinear approaches to solving problems – where linear ML assumes linear
    predictive results, while nonlinear ML is good for variables with many adversities
    that affect prediction accuracies and outcomes. By the early 2000 s, four general
    trends could be said to have been established due to the enormous strides in ML
    progress over the past seven decades: rule-based systems; kernel-based algorithms;
    neural networks, and Bayesian statistics (Pereira and Borysov, 2019). Rule-based
    systems are ML models that rely on iterative success probabilities and possibilities
    to determine the best solution (Lim and Schneider, 1993). They are can be rule-based
    decision trees (RBDT) with AND/OR/BOTH functions branching down cascading nodes
    that arrive to a conclusion after testing numerous hypothesis (Nilsson, 1982).
    Rule-based systems are supervised due to the IF-THEN rules needed to be set by
    observers with pre-determined classifications. RBDT can also be expanded to include
    random forest (RF), which is simply a collection of randomly created DTs. Kernel-based
    algorithms include support vector machines (SVM). K-Nearest Neighbour and SVM
    are supervised MLs, however, combined clustering approaches and analysis can yield
    a certain degree of unsupervised potential (Kung, 2014). KNN was first proposed
    by Evelyn and Hodges in 1951 (Evelyn and Hodges, 1951) and then later modified
    by Thomas Cover in 1968 (Cover, 1968) as an extension of earlier works on Bayesian
    risk. KNN uses data distance classification, or data similarity measurements between
    test and training sample sets for predicting outcomes (Ali et al., 2019). Data
    points are trained and then classified into the nearest neighbours measured about
    a point to describe the similarity between different data (Ali et al., 2019).
    The point with the highest number of nearest neighbouring datapoints becomes the
    prediction. While SVM uses decision vectors or boundaries to predict, with these
    data points being the supporting patterns (Boser et al., 1992). Data separation
    is binary, meaning there are two classes, and separated by a hyperplane (Cortes
    and Vapnik, 1995). SVM is ideal for small datasets, but input data must first
    be transformed onto the vector space, with a deciding hyperplane constructed,
    and then finally determining the output of this data (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995).
    Neural networks simulate the human brain and was first introduced by Marvin Minsky
    in 1951 in the development of the neural networking machine (Minsky, 1954). However,
    it was Frank Rosenblatt that would introduce the concept of the artificial neural
    network (ANN) in The Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958). Neural networks are well-suited
    for solving nonlinear problems through a series of simple arithmetic steps and
    self-organising features that differ to traditional computing approaches. Neural
    networks involve an input, hidden, and output layer. The hidden layer contains
    nodes that are connected to other nodes which are assigned a weight. Deep neural
    networks (DNN) are an extended version of the neural network, and instead, have
    multiple hidden layers as opposed to one which improves prediction accuracies.
    There are also two other neural networks - recurrent neural networks (RNN) and
    convoluted neural networks (CNN) (Pereira and Borysov, 2019; Anon, 1998). RNN
    connects between nodes that create a cycle, allowing output from some nodes to
    affect subsequent input to the same nodes and is well suited for videos and text.
    While CNN is a type of DNN and can only be fed forward and backpropagated, and
    is ideal for images. To train the ANN ML model, backpropagation is used to update
    weights throughout the network. Feedforward neural networks move the problem-solving
    stages in one direction from the input through to the output layer and do not
    form returning loops (Fig. 5). Finally, Bayesian ML approaches rely on probability
    relationships between nodes to determine an outcome. Bayesian methods are used
    to improve prediction performance over small datasets (Waterhouse et al., 1995),
    do not require complete datasets and explain causal relationships (Needham et
    al., 2007). Overfitting is when ML cannot reliably predict outcomes resulting
    from lack of data and poor generalisations, and presents a challenge to ML studies
    where there is not enough data. Selection of each ML type will depend on the quality
    and quantity of input data available, however, throughout ML nutrient CE studies,
    all ML models have seen wide-ranging applications from performance predictions
    to supporting decisions in institutional policy making. Download : Download high-res

    about 30 million tonnes of organic waste is produced and 6.7 million of this is
    sent to landfills (DCCEEW, 2020). 75% of the organic waste comes from food and
    gardens, which end up in landfills that then decompose and contribute towards
    CO2 emissions (DCCEEW, 2020). The targets within Australia are to reduce total
    waste generated per person by 10% and to recover and reuse 80% of different types
    of waste (DCCEEW, 2020). However, Australia does not have any commercial nutrient
    recycling plants to date by contrast to the regions of Europe and North America,
    where dozens of pilots, demonstration and full-scale projects exist (Table 1 and
    Fig. 6)). The table and figure display the concentration of nutrient recovery
    pilot experiments dominating the European markets as growing environmental regulations
    push organisations and institutions to improve the commercial viability of CE
    WWTP technologies, while Australia lacks experimental pilots in nutrient CE. Although,
    companies like Australia Bio Fert have, in 2020, been recently approved for the
    construction of nutrient recovery plants capable of processing 33,750 tonnes of
    poultry waste per year in Victoria (Victoria, 2020), while an earlier 2003 pilot-scale
    project recovered P and N from duckweed (DAF, 2003). Several global nutrient recovery
    projects have been commissioned over the years with the goal of improving the
    sustainability of agricultural practices through organic solid waste reprocessing
    and stripping that co-recover energy, water and nutrients for farming applications.
    Some of these nutrient recovery commercial technologies use Ostara, Stormfisher
    and Lystek International brands; while other technologies recover nutrients through
    pyrolysis, WWTP reclamation and reuse, urine diversion (in the case of South Africa’s
    urine valorisation project), composting, biomass generation and floating treatment
    wetlands (IISD, 2018). Policies can drive the adoption of recovery technologies
    such as the ban on organic waste incineration and CE incentives seen in Canada
    (IISD, 2018). Dry biosolids are oftentimes products for nutrient recovery processes,
    making the end product easy to transport and market, while other solutions can
    be liquid. Moreover, energy from biogas and incineration is recovered for heat
    generation that can cover the cost of operating nutrient recovery processes. For
    instance, Vallei en Veluwe Amersfoot in the Netherlands generates surplus power
    that render 14 other WWTPs energy neutral (N. Platform, 2016; Kox and Geraats,
    2016). Meanwhile, other barriers are mainly driven by the structural divide between
    institutions and communities. For example, in Latin America, nutrient recovery
    projects rarely take off due to the high costs, lack of training to keep the plants
    in operation, and weak legal basis, poorer infrastructure (WorldWaterWeek, 2016;
    Spinosa, 2011), and the low percentage of populations connected to WWTPs (ranging
    between 0% and 55%, excluding Chile) (UNSTATS, 2011); while CE initiatives will
    cost the Southeast Asian region $US54 billion in capital investments by 2030,
    and an annual operating expenditure of $US21.7 billion (ADB, 2022). Optimistically,
    the European Investment Bank anticipates that the number of low to low-middle
    income countries with untreated wastewaters will fall respectively from 72 to
    36, and 92–46 between 2015 and 2030 (EIB, 2022). China is currently in the early
    stages of rolling out 100 concept WWTP nutrient recovery plants by 2025–2028 (IWA,
    2021). It is clear that countries are beginning to see wastewater as a nutrient
    resource that provides benefits in the form of sanitation, renewable energy, fertilisers,
    environmental sustainability and water reuse. Table 1. Pilot, demonstrator and

    economy on nutrient sources SCCE could be seen applied across different industries
    including healthcare, manufacturing, warehouse and logistics, transportation,
    hospitality and communities (Silva et al., 2018b). Within the context of nutrient
    management and predictions, nutrient ML modelling has been used with crop yield
    (Kaul et al., 2005), soil (Puno et al., 2017; Hengl et al., 2017), drainage water
    (Sharma et al., 2003), lakes (Hadjisolomou et al., 2021) and rivers (Stamenković,
    2021), wastewater plants (Zaghloul and Achari, 2022), population health monitoring
    (Morgenstern et al., 2022), environmental policy (Valerio et al., 2021), fertilisers
    (Xu et al., 2021a), aquaponics (Dhal et al., 2022), and many others. Current research
    (Sundui et al., 2021) - also seen in Table 2 - have examined the use of MLs for
    predicting the performance of water treatment systems in CE nutrient recovery,
    and there are lack of studies supporting nutrient ML management at the city level.
    Sewage treatment plants (Zaghloul and Achari, 2022, Morgenstern et al., 2022,
    Valerio et al., 2021, Xu et al., 2021a, Dhal et al., 2022, Yaqub and Lee, 2022,
    Shaddel et al., 2019, Munasinghe-Arachchige et al., 2020, Sichler et al., 2022,
    Fang et al., 2020), lagoons (Calicioglu et al., 2021, Cheng et al., 2002, Sobhi
    et al., 2021), urban agriculture hydroponics (Rufí-Salís et al., 2020), urban
    composting (Shrestha et al., 2020), food waste from kitchens in anaerobic digesters
    (Wirth et al., 2021), directly from toilets (Simha and Ganesapillai, 2017; Bisschops
    et al., 2019), paper waste (Gupta and Garg, 2009), and grey water (Besson et al.,
    2021) have also been explored as avenues for nutrient recovery. Other avenues
    for nutrient recovery come from human sewage and wastewater as these streams are
    easily collected at centralised wastewater processing plants. On a more decentralised
    level, CE nutrient recovery is less studied given that different countries have
    unique approaches and policies towards its acceptance. ML studies have been done
    to remove pharmaceutical pollutants from wastewater streams (Taoufik et al., 2022)
    and WWTP nutrient recovery (Sundui et al., 2021). However, studies currently examining
    the use of ML for nutrient recovery on a larger scale beyond WWTPs (for example,
    cities and entire countries) within the context of CE is still relatively new,
    with recent studies applied to monitoring the health of plants within urban farms
    (Sladojevic et al., 2016; Barbedo, 2019), demonstrating the diverse applications
    of ML from nutrient recovery, to nutrient management for plant health. There exist
    pre- and post-nutrient recovery cycles for ML applications in smart cities where
    nutrients are recovered and fed back into urban hydroponics, which are then harvested
    by the inhabitants for food consumption. ML offers ample opportunities for predicting
    and optimising recovery processes, while at the same time, relaying this data
    back to the post-recovery stages – closing the loop and creating a nutrient circular
    system. The entire CE could therefore, be connected over the IoT and managed through
    ML systems which optimises recovery and redistribution of nutrients throughout
    the entire cycle, similar to automated aquaponic systems (Yanes et al., 2020).
    Citizens of smart cities could one day, have smartphones that are capable of capturing
    images and diagnosing the health of urban plants (Sladojevic et al., 2016), so
    that technologies are not just connected interfaces between software and devices
    throughout the city, but with people as well. Table 2. List of nutrient recovery

    authors have looked into integrating CE and IoT technologies for nutrient-from-waste
    recovery. Keuter et al. (2021). presented the SUSKULT vision of food security
    through CE towards improving Germany’s food security and sustainability. SUSKULT’s
    intentions are to address the growing fertiliser requirements, rising agricultural
    costs and soil degradation in response to a growing demand for food. The three
    key elements of SUSKULT are the recovery of nutrients from wastewater; integration
    with crop cultivation practices; and assessment of consumer demands and sentiment
    towards reuse of wastewater nutrients. Accordingly, SUKSULT assumes WWTPs will
    no longer exist as disposal units by the year 2050, but rather, will be transformed
    into nutrient recovery centres integrated with cities and farmlands. Given that
    the connection rate of WWTPs to population centres is high, they serve as critical
    infrastructural elements to the CE framework in nutrient management and recovery.
    For the German government, there is legal compulsion to recover P from sewage
    and other wastewater streams by the year 2026 and 2029 (The Swiss Federal Council,
    2015; Bundesamts für Justiz, 2017), with about €132.3 million funding from the
    German Federal Ministry of Education and Research to reduce fossil fuel dependency
    for material production inputs for this new bioeconomy (SUSKULT, 2022; Finance,
    2022). Potassium (K), P and N are three key recoverable nutrients from wastewater
    streams that could be used for farming applications. However, the paper fails
    to mention urine, food waste, and IoT connected systems in the new German bio-economy
    for nutrient recovery towards sustainable food production. 2.1. Wastewater effluent
    water recovery Asides nutrient recovery, wastewater needs to be treated before
    discharging it into the environment. Wastewater effluent streams are nearly 100%
    in water content (Keuter et al., 2021), making it plausible for water recovery
    efforts to be applied at the outlet of WWTPs. While water itself is not regarded
    as a nutrient, it is an essential part of crop fertigation. Absorption studies
    have been done to remove toxic pharmaceuticals from wastewater streams with the
    aid of ML (Okolie et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022), most commonly
    through biochar and charcoal methods. Immense efforts have been conducted across
    past research into the removal of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API), which
    facilitates safe wastewater reuse for human consumption (Stadlmair et al., 2018;
    Angeles et al., 2020) or disposal into the environment (Kümmerer, 2009; Wu et
    al., 2015). ML has applications in stimulating API removals or cleaner recyclable
    water (Taoufik et al., 2022) and in combating antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria
    (Haffiez et al., 2022) (Dhoble et al., 2018). AMR characteristics can be ML predicted
    (Dhoble et al., 2018) and ranked (Li et al., 2018a) according to the severity
    in the risk of its presence. Further studies are required to better understand
    the risk of AMRs and WWTP water reuse (Höglund, 2001), and a need to apply ML
    to understand and control residual chlorine effects on AMR bacteria formation
    (Zhang et al., 2022). The removal of AMRs and other APIs constitute part of an
    important CE process to improve water reusability for its co-application with
    nutrients, and to protect the health of populations and environments, as the growth
    in AMR bacteria pose a significant threat to the health and safety of entire city
    populations - given the huge urban population density making it a prime centre
    for the spread and contraction of water-borne, human-to-human transmitted diseases.
    CE not only has nutritional, but controlling implications against AMR-disease
    borne outbreaks, and WWTPs have also been used to track Covid outbreaks based
    on water characteristics (Jeong et al., 2021). 2.2. Urine Very few literatures
    have sought to combine the use of urine and ML for nutrient recovery. Given wastewater
    pipelines connect to a large percentage of the population, these pipelines become
    an efficient and centralised method for recovering nutrients. For example, wastewater
    treatment pipelines connect to more than 96.5% of the German population (Statistisches
    Bundesamt, 2019). Urine is a nutrient rich fluid which contains roughly 80% of
    N, 56% K, and 63% P while making up less than 1% of wastewater volume (Höglund,
    2001). Some modelling suggests that urine separation infrastructure can reduce
    29–47% GHG emissions, 26–41% energy consumption, and harmful eutrophication by
    25–64% (Hilton et al., 2021). There are environmental and agricultural benefits
    to the direct extraction of nutrients from source-separated urine. Recovered P
    from urine could account for 22% of the world’s production output, with this amount
    increasing to 2.16 Mt by 2050 (Mihelcic et al., 2011). To recover nutrients from
    urine, chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis must be prevented, then urine is concentrated
    before N-P-K is recovered as either a solid or liquid fertiliser (Randall and
    Naidoo, 2018). One of the challenging aspects of nutrient recovery for urine is
    the lack of current infrastructure for its separation from faecal matter, as well
    as the upscaling and management of urine diversion (UD) systems in urban wastewater
    treatment (Mihelcic et al., 2011, Fam and Mitchell, 2013, Zhuang et al., 2021)
    and the perceptions and politics involved in supporting the urbanisation of UDs
    throughout cities (Beal et al., 2020). Some of the earliest examples of UD apparatus
    being used can be found in Sweden, with UD numbers in the 100,000 s by the end
    of the 19th century, and currently numbering in the 135,000s since the 1990s (Kvarnström
    et al., 2006). The acceptance of UDs is divisive, with water savings, environmental
    benefits and lack of flushing being prime incentives for the project (Zhuang et
    al., 2021). 78.4% of the 17,499 surveyed households were satisfied with UDs in
    the eTekhwini municipality within South Africa (Roma et al., 2013), 68% of the
    respondents were open to recycling human urine and 59% using it as fertiliser
    for food (Simha et al., 2021). Another study had lower acceptance rates of UDs
    and urine-derived fertilisers of 62% and 56%, respectively (Taher et al., 2018).
    Barriers included storage tank emptying costs seen in Sweden’s Universeum discovery
    centre at €1500/year – which was emptied 15 times a year for a volume of 180 m3
    (Kvarnström et al., 2006). Crystallisation of pipes, poor training, foul odour
    and sanitation (Abeysuriya et al., 2013) (Blume and Winker, 2011) were other barriers
    to UD acceptance. The social unacceptance of urine reuse mainly stems from society’s
    perception of its hygiene, while technical barriers come from the cleaning and
    maintenance of pipes. Compounding this issue is the lack of UDs and treatment
    facilities in current city infrastructures. A combination of these factors leads
    to pushbacks against the reuse of urine resources. Presently, ML applications
    for urine are pervasive across the healthcare sector for monitoring the health
    of patients for urinary tract infections (Dong et al., 2022), cadmium exposure
    levels (Zeng et al., 2022), and urine output from fluid resuscitation (Lin et
    al., 2019). ML was even applied in the recent Covid-19 pandemic to detect traces
    for the virus in WWTPs to measure the effectiveness of lockdowns and policies
    (Koureas et al., 2021, Morvan et al., 2022a, Morvan et al., 2022b, Jiang et al.,
    2022). Meanwhile, further studies are required in the urine domain to improve
    prediction accuracies (Tan et al., 2021) and explore its connectivity with the
    IoT (Tasoglu, 2022). To date, there is very little information regarding ML for
    UD nutrient recovery. 2.3. Biomasses and sewage sludge Anaerobic digestate (AD)
    technologies receive sewage sludge and other biomasses for nutrient and energy
    recovery. The term biomass is very broad which can encompass human sewage sludge,
    manure, food and agricultural waste (Ma et al., 2018), and is primarily used to
    produce biogas through microbial activity. There are barriers to high AD efficiency,
    being the long hydraulic reaction times of 30-days to kickstart reactions to highly
    efficient and productive levels (Appels et al., 2008) and the presence and build-up
    of extracellular polymeric substances in raw sewage sludge that hinder bacterial
    conversion efficiency (Zhen et al., 2017). The presence of viruses and toxic compounds
    are also other potential harmful factors arising from AD use. While ADs are highly
    effective ways of converting biomass into energy, recent studies have begun examining
    the use of raw sewage sludge and other urban biomasses for nutrient recovery (Barampouti
    et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020, Ayala-Parra et al., 2017). The use of microalgae
    for P and N recovery (Ayala-Parra et al., 2017) could recover energy to control
    temperatures for improved microalgae productivity (Delgadillo-Mirquez et al.,
    2016; González-Camejo et al., 2018), which could then raise nutrient recovery
    efficiencies to as high as 90.1% (Ji et al., 2021). ML has been applied to improve
    bacterial AD productivity by controlling input compositions of sewage sludge (Park
    et al., 2021, Sialve et al., 2009, Li et al., 2022b, Li et al., 2021b, Yang et
    al., 2021a, Xu et al., 2021b). Meanwhile, fuzzy inferential control systems (Spagni
    and Marsili-Libelli, 2010) and self-organizing map neural networks have been used
    for direct P-N nutrient recovery (Aguado et al., 2008; Long et al., 2021). used
    ML to identify highly productive microbial species, and in other cases automate
    decisions to optimise microbial performance (Cruz et al., 2022). Despite these
    studies, there is little application of ML connecting AD to smart cities, or through
    simultaneous prediction yields for both nutrients and energy. Influences on AD
    performances involve variables such as temperature, nutrients and chemicals present
    in the sludge or food waste, different moisture levels, substrate inhibition on
    bacteria, hydraulic retention times, pH levels, heterogeneity of sludge composition,
    microbial efficacy, biological and chemical oxygen demand, volatile fatty acids,
    carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, and treatment technologies involved (Fagbohungbe et
    al., 2015, Fagbohungbe et al., 2017, Rocha-Meneses et al., 2022). ML is seen as
    a solution to mitigating the effects of these barriers against effective AD performance
    by predicting factors that would facilitate improved conditions for nutrient and
    energy recovery. Currently, ML studies for AD mainly involve biogas and methane
    production (Park et al., 2021; Long et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a). Lack of
    data for training is another barrier to ensuring accurate predictions for AD performance
    (Mei et al., 2019) which remains a challenge (Cruz et al., 2022), and failure
    to detect outliers leads to low confidence predictions (Wang et al., 2020). This
    is worsened by the lack of sensors integrated within cities to collect data (Razmjoo
    et al., 2021). In other cases, overfitting of data is another problem where outliers
    are often missed. However, low data count training sets can be solved by using
    compatible ML models like SVM and RSM (Cruz et al., 2022). Waste segmentation
    is one area of labour intensity that ML can help alleviate within AD. The dryness
    or wetness of waste affects the nutrient recoverability of AD waste (Barampouti
    et al., 2020). Gopikumar et al. (2021). have used fuzzy logic controllers to separate
    leachate organic and inorganic waste within smart cities. Separation of such waste
    can help push towards 100% P recovery in ADs (Vaneeckhaute et al., 2017), particularly
    when connected to the IoT when segregation data can be used to train ML models.
    Surprisingly, little studies have been done on struvite recovery, despite a study
    dating back to 2007 (Forrest et al., 2007) using ANN for predictive effluent P
    recovery and crust control, and also the recent recommendations from other papers
    (Nageshwari and Balasubramanian, 2022; Macura et al., 2021), and the high 85–93%
    efficiencies respectively that are achievable for P-recovery (Wei et al., 2018).
    Applying ML for struvite precipitation nutrient recovery remains an understudied
    arena, however, this is possibly because struvite precipitation is costly (Moerman
    et al., 2009), while compacting volumes could marginally lower its disposal costs
    (Ye et al., 2020). P is best recovered through sewage sludge, and the production
    costs varies between 2 and 28 €/kg (Egle et al., 2016). Despite the high market
    potential, technologies needed to recover these precious nutrients has not reached
    maturity. Furthermore, there are also no ML studies applied to membrane-driven
    AD reactors. The heterogeneous nature of AD waste inflow makes it difficult to
    predict its performance, therefore, ML studies are done to support performance:
    stability, predictions and optimisations of ADs (Cruz et al., 2022). Therefore,
    several ML models - like box-cox transformed XGBoost DT (Choi et al., 2022) -
    used volatile fatty acids as a medium to predict the performance of AD, which
    are critical performance ingredients in P and N recovery during fermentation (Longo
    et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014) and biomethane and biohydrogen
    production (Khan et al., 2016). Waste composition plays one of the most important
    parameters in methane gas production ML predictions, and more so over the processes
    involved (Wang et al., 2021a). Predictive ML models can then examine, stabilise
    and optimise parameters such as temperature, moisture and pH levels to further
    enhance recovery performances for AD reactors using inflow measurements (Cruz
    et al., 2022), which can then be resold to generate cash flow for owners similar
    to the prosumer economy of selling excess solar electricity to the grid (Nižetić
    et al., 2020). Nevertheless, AD is one of the most promising nutrient and energy
    recovery technologies that can be used in WWTPs with profound CE benefits. 2.4.
    Organic food waste In 2016, global organic waste production comprised of 44% of
    the total waste and only 33% of all solid waste is composted (World Bank, 2016).
    The total waste is expected to grow from 2.01 billion in 2012–3.4 billion tonnes
    in 2050. Effective waste management efforts to encourage further composting of
    organic food wastes is crucial for CE. San Francisco in 2012 for example, achieved
    an 80% reduction in undiverted food waste that was then composted for local farmers
    (Kaza et al., 2018). Some of the technologies used to convert food waste into
    useful nutrients is through windrow composting, in-vessel composting, anaerobic
    digestion, and waste-to-liquid technologies. However, one of the issues to composting
    is the high cost. Putting this into perspective, low-income countries have composting
    costs for food at roughly 5–30 USD/tonne, and for high-income countries, this
    cost increases to 35–90 USD/tonne (Kaza et al., 2018). Because of this high cost,
    composting of organic waste in high-income countries deters incentives for CE
    initiatives towards food waste recycling and reuse for farmlands. Instead, 93%
    of the waste is shipped and dumped into low-income countries (Kaza et al., 2018).
    It is also important and worth mentioning, that food alone is not the only waste
    that can be composted. Cups and utensils for example, are also being sold as biodegradable
    and compostable goods (Lacy et al., 2020) with nutrients that can also potentially
    be extracted. ML is seen as a solution to reducing the cost of composting organic
    waste, and studies have seen its applications in improving logistics management
    and monitoring of waste movement and separation (Khan et al., 2021) and combined
    with automation (Dubey et al., 2020a), could also lower labour intensities (Abdullah
    et al., 2018). Khan et al. believes that 100% waste separation is not possible,
    and 25% recycling efficiencies are closer to reality (Khan et al., 2021). ANN
    dominates the ML landscape for SWM, and to a minor extent, DT and RF (Joshi et
    al., 2022). The constraints on applying ML for SWM has more to do with the limited
    data available to train on, requiring robust ML that can train with data gaps.
    Consequently, this requires edge and fog-computing approaches (Joshi et al., 2022)
    - an area where robust ML models thrive. These ML technologies can complement
    blockchain technologies that improve the traceability and safety of food and organic
    waste recycling to build trust (Tsang et al., 2019) which can be used with Radio
    Frequency Identification, image-based recognition and wireless communications
    tracking technologies (Cheah et al., 2022; Abdullah et al., 2018). Decomposition
    of organic food waste inevitably emits CO2, and ML has been used to predict emissions
    levels with high accuracies using barcode information containing the TC content
    of waste (Li et al., 2022a). The recovery of organic waste nutrients and tracking
    of GHG decomposition emissions, will become a challenge within SCCEs. 3. Applications
    of machine learning nutrient circular economies for smart cities 3.1. Predictive
    crop management The integration of facilities with Big Data and the IoT could
    pave way for predictive forecasting on seasonal crop yields, market trend analysis,
    and water-food-energy nexus management (Sun and Scanlon, 2019). ML can optimise
    the quality of agricultural produce by providing nutrients on a predictive basis
    (Araby et al., 2019) and optimise energy consumption of the CE system (Zekić-Sušac
    et al., 2021) (Mosavi et al., 2019) with opportunities for the process to be automated
    end-to-end (Ventura et al., 2014). Visual methods for detecting nutrient levels
    within plants achieved accuracies as high as 95.57% (Ponce et al., 2021), and
    detected plant malnutrition would predictively trigger the optimal release of
    nutrients from WWTPs/WWRFs to raise crop productivity and prevent losses (Ahmed
    et al., 2021). Timsina et al. (2021). used Nutrient Expert® software and combined
    this with ML KNN and RF to estimate best nutrient deposition quantities and planting
    dates. As a result, crop productivity increased by 3.5, 1.4, and 1.3 t/ha for
    maize, rice and wheat respectively and simulating return-on-investments for these
    crop yields. Connecting ML and software to the SCCE IoT, demand for nutrients
    from the city could be throttled to farms where nutrients are deposited as-needed,
    making nutrient supply chains leaner and more responsive. Growing momentum in
    connecting plant nutrient optimisation (Dhal et al., 2022) and soil nutrient degradation
    (Ahmed and Kamalakkannan, 2022) with ML and IoT technologies will likely involve
    increased connectivity with SCCE IoT systems, and therefore, presents an exciting
    area of research and commercialisation. 3.2. Predictive nutrient recovery infrastructural
    maintenance ML applications are not limited to assessments, predictions and optimisations
    of microbes and nutrient concentrations. There are IoT ML applications across
    predictive monitoring and maintenance technologies that are integral to facilities
    management (Sundui et al., 2021; Teoh et al., 2021). Yang et al. (2021a). applied
    ANN, RF and SVM MLs to monitor for corrosion and odour control for a water resource
    facility. RF was used to predict sodium hypochlorite dosage against hydrogen sulphide
    to prevent the corrosion of critical structural elements of WWTPs, while simultaneously
    keeping VFAs within range for effective P removal. The study highlights the benefits
    ML has on minimising the effects on removal efficiencies for P from carrying out
    predictive plant maintenance. RF and SVM prediction accuracies for VFAs and hydrogen
    sulphide were 93.4% and 97.6% respectively in WWRF influents. This accuracy aided
    the management of dosage frequencies and concentrations with minimal human intervention.
    Predictive maintenance applications have also been found in electrical utilities
    (Hoffmann et al., 2020) and building maintenance (Cheng et al., 2020b; Bouabdallaoui
    et al., 2021) which have allowed faults to be identified before incidence. This
    would increase the reliability and operating uptime of nutrient recovery facilities,
    while maintaining optimal conditions for effective nutrient recovery. Hence, integration
    of ML, IoT and maintenance systems can reduce the costs associated with maintaining
    large-scale nutrient recovery plants and ensuring consistent productivity. 3.3.
    Smart city hydroponics City aquaponics and hydroponics provides space saving benefits
    and lowers transportation costs and times with the use of ML (Chen et al., 2022).
    Water consumption is reduced by its soil-less nature and its close proximity to
    cities reduces logistical expenses. ML can be used to determine important input
    parameters for driving plant growth as seen in Dhal et al. (2022). where SVM and
    KNN deduced the surprising importance metals had over N-P-K nutrients in predicting
    aquaponic plant growth. Taha et al. (2022). used image-based ML techniques to
    monitor the nutrient level of aquaponic plants with KNN and DT from fish excreta
    fertiliser with a predictive accuracy of 96.5% using deep CNN (Fig. 7). The study
    used ML to predict nutrient deficiencies in plants, allowing nutrients to be deposited
    into plants as a preventive measure against malnutrition and disease – consequently
    improving aquaponic crop yields. ML could be used in predicting aquaponic plant
    yield (Debroy and Seban, 2022) and hydroponic plant health (Raju et al., 2022)
    with accuracies in the ∼99%. IoT-enabled Bayesian ML could adjust actuators and
    controllers based on pH, electrical conductivity, water temperature, and relative
    humidity (Alipio et al., 2017), while other parameters could include dissolved
    oxygen, N-P-K, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, total dissolved solids, salinity, relative
    humidity, light, and air temperature (Gayam et al., 2022). Plant yields increased
    by 66.67% (Alipio et al., 2017) and similar ML-driven productivity gains were
    also seen in other studies (Verma and Gawade, 2021, Lakshmiprabha and Govindaraju,
    2019, Ragaveena et al., 2020). One of the challenges of implementing ML aquaponics
    with nutrients is the lack of data that is readily available (Dhal et al., 2022).
    Error-rectifying Bolstered estimations combined with SVM is typically used to
    counter this problem and similar works have done the same (Cruz et al., 2022),
    while edge and fog-based cloud computing architectures with LoRa technologies
    can help democratise and enrich data training sets (Gayam et al., 2022). Aquaponics
    and hydroponics via the IoT are being driven by automation (Yanes et al., 2020)
    such that both land area and labour intensity is reduced (Shrivastava et al.,
    2021). Despite the potential for ML technologies to predict plant diseases (Barosa
    et al., 2019), given the safely sheltered nature of plants in hydroponic greenhouses,
    this application appears mostly unnecessary. ML IoT in SCCE hydroponics and aquaponics
    will improve the cost effectiveness and optimise appropriate nutrients that maximise
    crop yield, while contributing to reducing water consumption and pollution via
    simplified logistics and lower pesticide use. Download : Download high-res image

    3.4. Smart soil analysis and satellite big data According to the Food and Agricultural
    Organisation, 75 billion tonnes of soil every year are eroded from arable lands
    worldwide, leading to $400 billion worth of financial losses each year (FAO, 2016).
    Soil nutrients can be detected through the assistance of ML. MATLAB ANN and image
    processing was used to identify soil nutrient levels across N, P, K, Calcium,
    pH, Zinc and Magnesium levels with 100% accuracy (Puno et al., 2017). Satellite
    images in Fig. 8 (Hengl et al., 2017) used ANN trained with sample compositions
    to identify soil nutrient degradations affecting the environment and therefore,
    crop yields on farms. However, limitations were seen in another study (Hengl et
    al., 2017) for using ML to predict P presence at much larger soil areas, while
    land areas of 60 km2 showed high accuracies using cubist, SVM and RF ML (John
    et al., 2020) and only topsoil nutrients could be estimated seen in Fig. 8 (Hengl
    et al., 2017). Nutrient soil modelling is limited mainly to RF and XGBoost due
    to the large amounts of data required (Hengl et al., 2017), while other studies
    have found limited selections on ML models suited to predicting soil nutrient
    quality ranging from LR, DT, RF and SVM (Ahmed and Kamalakkannan, 2022; Yousefi
    et al., 2021; Nascimento et al., 2021) for processing large quantities of heterogeneous
    data. Even with 35 years of satellite soil data, maximum accuracies of 79% were
    achieved (Rukhovich et al., 2022). Other works have sought to use advanced Geographical
    Information Systems (GIS) to monitor soil degradation using ANN detection of soil
    organic matter and calcium carbonate (Alexakis et al., 2019), and with KNN and
    RF for environmentally destructive gullies (Phinzi et al., 2021; Garosi et al.,
    2019). Environmental modelling of soil destruction from urban activities with
    ML was seen in Wang et al. (2021a). who used RF-clustering that achieved accuracies
    of 95%. Urbanisation has negative consequences on surrounding habitats and ML
    could be used to improve food security by safeguarding soil integrity for farmers
    with the aid of ML, the IoT and satellites (Wang and Goll, 2021), while potentially
    diverting recovered nutrients to restore regions with stripped soil. Download

    supply chain transparency towards driving trust, safety and adoption The acceptance
    of UDs has been divisive in some parts of the world resistant to reusing urine
    as fertiliser. A survey in Hawaii found that only 22% of people knew of UDs, and
    60% were willing to pay extra for the system (Lamichhane and Babcock, 2013). In
    another survey, the number of students who were willing to pay extra for UDs was
    33%, despite the majority consensus acceptance of UDs at 84% (Ishii and Boyer,
    2016), citing water recovery as one of the most important reasons for its adoption.
    In developing parts of the world, fear of infection, foul odour, uncertainty surrounding
    consumer perceptions of human waste reuse and soil toxicity for plant fertilisation
    were the most commonly cited reasons for barriers against the adoption of CE systems
    for human faecal compost (Singh et al., 2022a, Simha et al., 2017, Smol, 2021),
    however, in the latter study, none of the organic farmers were willing to risk
    the use of human waste as a source of fertiliser due to the high risk of negative
    consumer responses from contamination. On the contrary with developed parts of
    the world, tap water is trusted and safe because of the transparency ascribed
    to it (Brouwer et al., 2020), and this quality should be carried on for waste-reuse
    fertigation of crops to drive greater adoption (Lupton, 2017). The lack of public
    awareness, low initiatives for farmers, and willingness to pay more for UD systems,
    are some of the reasons that may explain why public knowledge of human-waste recycling
    systems have not seen widespread use. Despite this, trust was cited as the key
    factor in encouraging farmers to use human-waste as a source of fertiliser (Simha
    et al., 2021; Simha et al., 2017). Technology can drive the trust paradigm between
    stakeholders of the SCCE. ML has seen applications in improving trust for e-commerce
    (Khoa et al., 2022), traceability in food waste (Tsang et al., 2019), WWTP effluent
    quality controls (Zaghloul and Achari, 2022; Guo et al., 2015), agricultural output
    quality (Araby et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2022b) and food perishability (Batool
    et al., 2022). One example of harmful substance prediction throughout the food
    supply chain involved the detection of gutter oil using KNN which achieved a prediction
    accuracy of 97.18% (Jiang et al., 2021). ML models using Bayesian, ANN, and SVMs
    have been employed to predict and monitor for food safety (Wang et al., 2022),
    as well as Big Data, IoT, blockchain, GIS, and satellite imagery techniques across
    food supply chains (Jin et al., 2020) (Batool et al., 2022) that can drive greater
    transparency, quality and safety. However, there are technical, governance, and
    societal challenges which need to be overcome for the new food supply chain to
    be accepted (Jin et al., 2020). Nevertheless, ML technologies can help drive consumer
    confidence in the safe consumption of organic food grown from recovered nutrients,
    but safety accuracies of 100% need to be reliably achieved. 3.6. ML-assisted microalgae
    nutrient and energy recovery Around 44% of energy production comes from fossil
    fuel (Aliero et al., 2021), with cities accounting for 75% of the global primary
    energy consumption and emitting 50–60% of the world’s GHG (UN, 2023). Citizens
    need to take a proactive role in the adoption of smarter energy management technologies,
    while reducing biomass, increasing smart energy systems, low CO2 emissions, and
    increased use of renewable energy technologies (Razmjoo et al., 2021) (Kamyab
    et al., 2020), however, Sundui et al. (2021). study on the contrary aimed at maximising
    biomass production for renewable power. Therefore, simultaneous nutrient and energy
    recoveries are possible. Nutrients can be fed back into microalgae which then
    produce more nutrients and valuable biomasses as seen in Kim et al. (2021). -
    where ML helped reduce nutrient loading in wastewater, grew algae biomass for
    renewable power applications, and prevented destructive algae blooms through TN
    and TP recovery. Moreover, studies have shown that CO2 demand and solar radiation
    affected microalgae growth more than nutrients did (Kim et al., 2021; Coşgun et
    al., 2021) to which future ML-eutrophication-biomass studies should factor in
    for accuracy improvements. Nevertheless, nutrient recovery efficiencies in the
    99% were achieved for N and P in one study using microalgae (Ling et al., 2019),
    and could support renewable biogas and biodiesel industries (Ayala-Parra et al.,
    2017). Hence, there are dualistic benefits to adopting microalgae to recover both
    nutrients and energy across WWTPs/WWRFs where ML will play a key role in improving
    recovery efficiencies and preventing eutrophication. 3.7. Connected decentralised
    urine recovery technologies Integrations of UDs with existing city infrastructure
    is one of the major barriers to the adoption of urine as a source of nutrient
    recovery. Decentralised urine treatment facilities, or mini-WWTPs, can help circumvent
    the difficulties in integrating urine nutrient recovery practices into current
    cities (Randall and Naidoo, 2018). In addition to the current infrastructural
    barriers, transporting urine to centralised WWTPs via expensive pipelines or trucks
    is too costly (Ledezma et al., 2015), deterring any economic incentives for property
    developers and building managers from operating UDs. The significant costs of
    transporting organic waste were also observed in Lupton (2017) where costs could
    range between 19% and 61% of total production costs. Seen in Fig. 9a and Fig.
    9b, various attempts have been made to integrate newer toilet systems that treat
    urine on the spot through nitrification concentration and urea hydrolysis prevention
    via pH control (Randall and Naidoo, 2018), and have K recovered with P through
    precipitation via magnesium potassium phosphate (Wilsenach et al., 2007). Several
    studies in the past have conducted nitrified concentration for fertiliser applications
    (Fumasoli et al., 2016) (Mackey et al., 2016). Badeti et al. (2022). modelled
    decentralised UDs which could double treatment capacities and lower capital expenditure
    costs by 24%, and combining it with aerobic MBRs can reduce land consumption in
    cities where floor costs are high. Hybrid membrane distillation and reverse electrodialysis
    technologies can offer nutrient volume compacting and off grid treatment solutions
    (Mercer et al., 2019). Despite these advances in urine nutrient recovery technologies,
    there are very few studies however, connecting these applications to the IoT and
    ML. Studies on connecting waste management bins to the IoT have been done to support
    logistics and separation (Kang et al., 2020, Xenya et al., 20202020, Sheng et
    al., 2020, Wang et al., 2021b), while others suggested its uses for greater resource
    efficiency distribution (Mocnej et al., 2018; Koirala et al., 2016a). Nonetheless,
    ML IoT applications for monitoring nutrient production from decentralised urine
    recovery facilities presents enormous opportunities towards reducing logistical
    challenges and costs. For example, ML models can predict nutrient loadings by
    each decentralised urine recovery centre, and alert nutrient collection authorities.
    One example of ML decentralised analytics of connected systems has been studied
    in Karavas et al. (2015)., where Multi Agent, Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping ML models
    were applied towards an autonomous decentralised energy management system of desalination
    plants, electrolysers, batteries, water storage and power meters for power and
    water management – yielding a 2% lower net present cost compared to centralised
    networks. Not only does decentralising technologies drive community stakeholder
    participation in supporting broader ecosystems (Koirala et al., 2016b), but also
    encourages efficiency and cost savings measures in managing resources. It is costly
    to transport raw urine, and a solution would require mini WWTPs to treat and compact
    urine into a valuable, transportable product with high nutrition to volume ratio.
    These mini WWTPs can then connect to the IoT and ML models which could predictively
    notify waste management authorities for collection. Download : Download high-res

    Adapted from (Randall and Naidoo, 2018). 3.8. Digital twins for nutrient simulations
    Digital twins allow for technologies and processes to be tested to identify failures
    and improvement opportunities before full-scale implementation is carried out
    (Cheah et al., 2022). The use of digital twins can help urban city planners optimise
    nutrient recovery logistics and technologies. However, digital twins are an emerging
    area within the space of smart agriculture and not many studies have been conducted
    in this arena (Pylianidis et al., 2021). Many digital twin applications could
    be applied to nutrient management, including: root failure analysis for system
    mapping; operations visualisation at the city scale; virtual maintenance; and
    end-to-end visualisations of smart systems (Pylianidis et al., 2021). Digital
    twins can help smart city urban planners design, realise, use and retire products
    from its cradle to grave (Verdouw et al., 2021). Devices from the real world can
    be connected to the IoT and recorded - giving a linked template for digital twins
    to operate from. This data can then be used to train smart digital twins to respond
    to certain parameters, for example, an ML digital twin with sensors connected
    to a real city that trains the virtual counterpart in real-time. Digital twins
    offer a huge potential in supporting nutrient management processes for cities
    and farms. For example, digital twins can be used to help remove weeds and grow
    lettuce as shown in Fig. 11 (using software as the application layer of smart
    farming practices that help intervene in weed removal and improve lettuce crop
    yields) (Verdouw et al., 2021), model GHG reductions for petroleum sites via soil
    degradation (Lari et al., 2022), improve aquaponic management (Ghandar et al.,
    2021), manage food supply chains (Henrichs et al., 2022), drive techno-political
    acceptance of digital farming practices (Klerkx et al., 2019), support agricultural
    robotics and greenhouse systems (Purcell and Neubauer, 2023), while other studies
    have begun exploring novel uses with predictive ML-IoT power of digital twins
    with WWTPs/WWRFs (Torfs et al., 2022), self-optimised learning techniques for
    energy savings and crop productivity (Monteiro et al., 2018) and simulate end-to-end
    nutrient distribution and recovery. However, it is difficult to simulate microbial
    and chemical activities (Lari et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image

    Modified from Bagherzadeh et al. (2021). 3.9. Security Concerns are raised throughout
    city populations on the privacy of data with the expansion in popularity from
    the use of smart city IoT (Aliero et al., 2021). The connected nutrient economy
    would require heightened security in the way nutrient information is stored and
    transmitted. With the emergence of Agriculture 4.0, farming and city data become
    equally sensitive. Compromise of Agriculture 4.0 systems can lead to sabotage
    on crop productivity and quality, requiring technology measures such as blockchain
    and cryptography systems in place (Yang et al., 2021b). While smart city food
    systems can lead to improvements in food security (Maye, 2019), nefarious acts
    against the system can yield the opposite effect (Alsinglawi et al., 2022). Cyberattacks
    in the form of phishing, denial of service, trojan attacks, are some ways of disrupting
    and sabotaging nutrient SCCE - which would hinder and reverse the crucial trust
    built over time with citizens. The use of blockchain, innovative layers of security
    software and hardware, secure wireless communication protocols, and educating
    actors on cyberattacks are ways of mitigating the risks and impacts of malicious
    IoT acts (Alsinglawi et al., 2022, Li et al., 2018b, Gupta et al., 2020). ML could
    be used to prevent cyberattacks. One example could be seen in Alkahtani and Aldhyani
    (2022)., where KNN and DT was used in the detection of man-in-the-middle, web-server
    access, and telnet cyberattacks with an accuracy of 100%. Other studies have seen
    ML applications towards predicting cyberattacks across the IoT (Hilal et al.,
    2021, Huma et al., 2021, Tzachor et al., 2022, Paricherla et al., 2022). Nevertheless,
    there are opportunities to apply ML towards building trust through enhanced cybersecurity
    and predictive risk mitigations to nutrient CEs and related food supply chains
    which can improve the level of security among digital collaborators and architects
    of tomorrow’s sustainable smart cities (Charef, 2022), therefore, ML IoT cybersecurity
    architectures become critical to the continuity of food security, stakeholder
    engagement efforts and collaboration, and the stability of SCCE for cities and
    countries. 3.10. Predictive nutrient management IoT technologies have been integrated
    with waste management practices that have helped automate and cut down disposal
    costs (Dubey et al., 2020b) (Uganya et al., 2022). ML goals vary with some designed
    for handling both energy conservation and nutrient removal (Bernardelli et al.,
    2020), while other studies aim at increasing biomass production and nutrient recovery
    (Sundui et al., 2021). Similar concepts could be applied to organic SWM and urine
    using ML that could learn and understand disposal frequencies which can then optimise
    schedules for making recovering salvageable waste leaner. In Li et al. (2022a).,
    ML was used to track TC levels with granular details down to the street level
    for GHG emissions reduction. This tracking of nutrient recovery processes has
    the potential of improving prediction accuracies of between 89% and 97.1% (Chen,
    2022) – driving down emissions and costs. Nutrients recovered from waste with
    ML can then be dispersed onto plants as was seen in Ahmed et al. (2021). The study
    (Ahmed et al., 2021) predictively optimised computational power consumption and
    N-P-K application to increase crop yield from 1865.47 kg/Hg to 2035 kg/Hg and
    soil quality. Spectral data was used in Mahajan et al. (2021). to monitor and
    predict plant nutrients using wavelength ranges between 350 and 1050 nm, combined
    models-partial least square regression with Cubist, SVR, and ELNET for magnesium
    and sulphur. Cubist R2 values of 0.94 for N, 0.91 for P, 0.97 for K were produced;
    while SVR and ELNET were better suited for other elements such as magnesium and
    sulphur predictions. Osco et al. (2020). used similar predictions with a spectral
    range of 380–1020 nm and 204,800 (640 spectral bands against 320) to model predictions
    of nutrient levels within Valencia-orange leaves for N, P and K: resulting in
    R2 values of 0.912, 0.711 and 0.763 respectively using RF, with a mean absolute
    error (MAE) of 0.093 and 0.216, and RMSE of 0.216 and 1.818. However, accuracies
    were lower for other nutrient predictions such as P and K and require improvements.
    It is expected that in the coming years, spectroscopy and more visual techniques
    for predicting soil nutrients are yet to come, with many other studies exploring
    this field of combining ML for soil and plant nutrient prediction (Trontelj ML
    and Chambers, 2021, Sun et al., 2019, Morellos et al., 2016, Smith et al., 2020,
    Das et al., 2020). ML correlation studies between WWTP effluents and nutrient
    loads have also been studied (Zaghloul and Achari, 2022; Yaqub and Lee, 2022)
    (Bagherzadeh et al., 2021). Bagherzadeh et al. (2021). used DT and ANN to predict
    TN in water effluent quality, with DT methods performing 10% better than ANN ML
    models (see Fig. 12). Gradient boosting methods yielded an R2 value of 0.58, RMSE
    of 0.092, MAE of 0.017 for Scenario III, and performed the best out of all three
    models, however, RF lost accuracy due to overfitting issues. Features contributing
    most to high prediction accuracies were prioritised first in training for ANN,
    Gradient Boosting Machine, and RF in each of the four scenarios. Yaqub and Lee
    (2022). required data normalisation using MinMaxScaler for ammonium, TN, and Total
    Phosphorous (TP) to rectify prediction inaccuracies. Download : Download high-res

    that can help predict nutrient removal from wastewater effluent. Bernardelli et
    al. (2020). used ANFIS ML connected to the IoT which regulated dissolved oxygen
    and internal recycling of oxygenated influent based on forecasted nutrient loads
    using controllers. The ML ANFIS model was able to achieve energy savings of 16%,
    reduce dissolved oxygen demand by 29%, reduced airflow by 16.7% and the effluent
    TN by 8.1% (see Fig. 13). ML ANN, SVR and ANFIS with and without ensemble, weighted
    and arithmetic averaging approaches, were also applied in similar multi-stage
    setups (Zaghloul and Achari, 2022). Ensemble approaches in the study improved
    prediction accuracies by 5% across 15 multi-stage processing parameters, therefore,
    this may become necessary for multi-stage process predictions. Similar bioreactor
    nutrient removal experiments were done with Yaqub and Lee (2022). using XGBoost
    as the more reliable predictor, achieved R2 values of 0.763, 0.814 and 0.876 with
    operating conditions, influent characteristics, and combined dataset used respectively
    as input parameters for predictions. In simulating nutrient predictive models
    for WWTPs, identifying input variables that significantly alter prediction accuracies
    will become an important factor in the selection of ML models and whether ensembling
    is required. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download full-size

    Building information modelling Building Information Modelling (BIM) forms the
    basis of the structure and design of many buildings seen in cities. However, there
    are still challenges in integrating BIM into smart cities and the IoT (Tang et
    al., 2019). These include Application Programming Interface (API) integrations,
    data democratisation driving BIM IoT adoption which disseminates building data
    across designers, standardisation and interoperability, and transition to cloud
    computing systems (Tang et al., 2019; Costin et al., 2018). BIM digital twins
    are possible, however, there has been a lack of studies done to integrate CE with
    BIM practices from both procedural and technical standpoints despite the many
    studies proposing frameworks for the integration of BIM with sustainable practices
    (Fadeyi, 2017, McArthur, 2015, Zanni et al., 2017). For example, BIM and GIS -
    critical enablers for sustainable IoT smart city designs (Xia et al., 2022b) -
    have data formats that are incompatible with one another despite the potential
    for GIS being used for soil nutrient modelling (Alexakis et al., 2019; Zhu et
    al., 2018). The use of digital twins with BIM allows for city information modelling
    - using data collected from a city that is projected onto the digital twin space
    and simulated for environmental impacts. Currently, the lack of CE principles
    throughout current BIM practices poses a barrier in the move towards SCCE (Charef
    and Emmitt, 2021). BIM for CE could assess circularity, develop material passports,
    access material data banks and identify recovery processes, digital models for
    end-of-life management, and data verifications (Charef and Emmitt, 2021). Despite
    the innovations happening with BIM technologies, incorporating UDs and smart organic
    SWM systems into the engineering design process is not widely factored in smart
    city designs, particularly with CE principles. However, future research could
    examine how BIM can help design CE cities. 3.12. Digital nutrient economy Recovery
    of nutrients within households and apartments can lead to a new digital economy
    where these nutrients could be resold as a valuable commodity for farmers and
    other buyers. These prosumers (producers who are also consumers) can be compared
    analogously to households who own solar panels that resell power back into the
    grid (Said, 2021, Zafar et al., 2018, Rodríguez-Molina et al., 2014). Mercer et
    al. (2019). offered urine concentration solutions with water recovery and power
    generation. These nutrients as seen in Miller (Miller, 2019), could use recovered
    and recycled nutritious waste to grow food – driving support for digital tools
    and high levels of communal collaboration. Prosumers can also use the recovered
    nutrients for hydroponic systems inside their smart homes to grow produce they
    can sell (Prakash et al., 2015). Given the strong case for nutrient recovery and
    reapplication onto communal and hydroponic systems combined with digital tools,
    there is room for more studies on the wider social, environmental and economic
    benefits for larger scaled, digitally supported, nutrient prosumer SCCEs. 3.13.
    Smart water recovery systems Water recovery from waste streams can be achieved
    through forward osmosis (Li et al., 2020), membrane distillation (Santos et al.,
    2020), and reverse osmosis (Hernández et al., 2022; Suthanthararajan et al., 2004),
    and can be combined with electrodialysis technologies to improve recovery rates
    (Venzke et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2011) that also offers nutrient recovery options
    (Al-Amshawee et al., 2020; (Faragò et al., 2021). The emergence of zero-liquid
    discharge systems is one effort of minimising waste made on the environment while
    maximising resource recovery from water and wastewater treatment processes (Yaqub
    and Lee, 2019). Simultaneous energy and water recoveries can be made which reduces
    the energy consumption of WWTPs using anaerobic methane biogas that can offset
    ∼50% of the plant’s energy consumption while co-producing rich fertilisers (Hao
    et al., 2015). Other studies have used forward osmosis with soluble fertiliser
    solutions that are diluted by recovering water from seawater and wastewater streams
    that are then used for fertigation (Phuntsho et al., 2012; Volpin et al., 2019;
    Chekli et al., 2017). During the Covid-19 pandemic, ML models have been used to
    monitor for Covid-19 in sewage WWTPs (Koureas et al., 2021, Morvan et al., 2022a,
    Morvan et al., 2022b, Jiang et al., 2022, Tan et al., 2021, Tasoglu, 2022) which
    has made sewage management much smarter. In water, ML has been used to improve
    recoverable water quality predictions after plant disturbances (Okolie et al.,
    2022), removal of toxic pharmaceuticals (Okolie et al., 2022), for water categorisations
    (Chin et al., 2022b), and water recovery forecasts derived from P presence (Chang
    et al., 2022) or diammonium phosphate along with potassium chloride fertilizers
    (Im et al., 2021). A range of these studies used XGBoost, ANN and SHAP methodologies
    to help drive water qualities up. Across other emerging water recovery technologies,
    ML has been applied to FO to predict the effects of membrane fouling (Im et al.,
    2021), performance optimisations (Aghilesh et al., 2021), water production output
    (Jawad et al., 2020a; Reddy et al., 2022), and performance declines (Ibrar et
    al., 2022) for wastewater and other water sources. Other FO ML studies examined
    ways to reduce concentration polarisations (Ibrar et al., 2022), improve water
    permeate flux predictions (Reddy et al., 2022; Jawad et al., 2020b), support selections
    on fertiliser draw solutions (Aghilesh et al., 2021), remove chemicals (Nam et
    al., 2022) and help predict fouling (Im et al., 2021). Consequently, ML could
    be used to expedite the commercial viability of emerging water and nutrient recovery
    technologies. 3.14. Robotics and urban farming automation Automation and robotics
    dominate the theme of IoT, Industry 4.0 and Agriculture 4.0 (Cheah et al., 2022;
    Yang et al., 2021b). Some studies have used automated robotic bins connected to
    the IoT to manage leachate waste (Gopikumar et al., 2021), with robotics and automation
    supporting: design and reuse of materials; upgrades; remanufacturing and recycling
    processes (Agrawal et al., 2022). These studies have primarily focused on the
    use of smart waste segregation bins for the efficient separation of valuable solid
    waste (Wilts et al., 2021), despite the division of CE automation into four areas
    covering: collection and logistics; business modes; data tools and machines; and
    waste treatment plants (Sarc et al., 2019) - studies have primarily focused on
    the machine and data tool components for organic SWM automation such as smart
    bins (Wilts et al., 2021), alternating controllers for WWTP nutrient loading predictions
    (Bernardelli et al., 2020), and IoT connected actuators for crop yield improvements
    (Alipio et al., 2017). Vasisht et al. (2017). used Microsoft’s Azure IoT “FarmBeats”
    to automate the collection of large quantities of data using low-cost drones,
    cameras and sensors. Drone paths were programmed and large quantities of data
    could be collected to train ML models to make accurate nutrient predictions. This
    data can then be relayed to the IoT and Big Data to improve supply chain management
    and crop yields (Shrivastava et al., 2021). Smart IoT connected drones (Fig. 14a)
    and farming equipment (Fig. 14b) for crop fertilisation, pollination and pesticide
    applications, tie in with the remote sensing data collection technologies (Fig.
    14c) that form part of the sensing layer for smart cities and will become crucial
    to automating large amounts of data collection and crop management processes.
    The smart farming industry is set to see rapid growth across the Asia-Pacific
    region, with forecasts suggesting 300% up from $AU647 million to $AU2.9 billion
    between 2020 and 2028, while globally, these numbers are expected to grow from
    $AU1.9 billion to $AU8.4 billion for the same period (Government, 2021). Smart
    drones and sensing equipment are expected to improve returns on investment for
    farmers while bridging gaps that might exist for nutrient SCCEs between cities
    and rural farms through IoT connectivity. Besides drones and sensing equipment
    for farms, data collection can be automated across WWTPs. The automation of data
    collection over the IoT can then be fed into ML programs that can then optimise
    chemical processes and lower operational costs for WWTPs (Uwamungu et al., 2022),
    with inexpensive renovations possible through software cloud WWTP upgrades and
    changes to its computing processors (Zhu et al., 2020). For example, an STM32
    controller used in the study (Zhu et al., 2020) costs $10 compared to that of
    a programmable logic controller which numbers in the several thousands of dollars
    (with WeChat Applet used as the online controller server) (Zhu et al., 2020).
    Automation can also come in the form of cobots – using robots connected to the
    IoT to aid human workers in the management of waste (Sarc et al., 2019). Additionally,
    the repackaging and handling of such waste will add further value to the nutrient
    recovery and redistribution process and lower overhead costs (ElFar et al., 2021),
    with the potential for higher recovery rates of valuable elements from waste (Álvarez-de-los-Mozos
    et al., 2020) and aid in the cleaning and safe maintenance of CE technologies
    (Daneshmand et al., 2022; Renteria and Alvarez-de-los-Mozos, 2019). The use of
    robotic arms for example in the separation of solid waste, could reduce unrecycled
    waste from ending up in landfills by ∼20% to a 99% degree of accuracy (Maiurova
    et al., 2022). For food organic waste, smart bin waste segregation studies have
    dominated this domain contrary to the use of robotic arms. WWTP automation and
    robotics have employed the use of sensors and actuators that react based on inputs
    via pH, temperature, chemical oxygen demand, flow velocity, pressure, gas, chlorine
    and E. Coli concentrations (Lal Karn et al., 2021). For Agriculture 4.0 and other
    smart farming practices; drones, actuators, sensors and robots have all been collaboratively
    explored. In urban settings, robots can help maintain urban green walls (Wilkinson
    et al., 2021) and hydroponic systems (Halgamuge et al., 2021). With the increase
    in automation for large quantities of data collection complementing the adoption
    of IoT systems and ML, the use of robots and other devices has time, energy and
    cost saving benefits for SCCE that can aid in the maintenance, recovery and deposition
    of nutrients. 4. Conclusion ML SCCE is a relatively new area of combining software
    learning models with the IoT to enhance nutrient management and recovery in urban
    environments. Studies on ML nutrient recovery for urine, membrane-driven AD reactors
    and within the context of prosumer digital economies are severely lacking. An
    explanation for this could be the emerging state of these technologies and the
    infancy of CE within smart cities. SCCE technologies are emerging and have not
    reached an acceptable commercial status due to its performance inefficiencies,
    high investment costs, uneconomical returns, and incompatibility with legacy buildings.
    Therefore, scalability focusing on increasing the value while minimising handling
    costs of nutrients is a solution. Surprisingly, studies on interactions between
    smart cities and farms have not been heavily researched, despite cities being
    epicentres of waste production that generate large quantities of recoverable nutrients.
    There is opportunity to drive end-to-end simulation, management, and design of
    nutrient CE principles between WWTPs, farms and smart city hydroponics using ML,
    BIM and digital twins, however, the lack of industry adoption of CE design principles
    and existence of robust databases for sustainable building materials are barriers.
    Other barriers - such as underfitting - can be solved through greater data democratisation
    by using more measurement IoT technologies across WWTP, farms and cities. This
    will improve ML training and prediction accuracies that will increase nutrient
    recovery plant reliability and maintenance, while minimising sacrifices on its
    performance and predictively manage crops to prevent losses, raise yield and supply
    nutrients as-needed. ML has the potential to improve the security of data and
    food supply chains. Blockchain traceability and transparency of waste-grown food
    are necessary towards ensuring absolute safety and growing its social acceptance.
    Lastly, there is a rapidly growing market for smart farming drones and hardware
    that will bridge the connectivity gap between hardware and ML IoT. Due to the
    massive quantities of data required for effective ML, data collection will be
    automated, while drones can help lower the labour intensity and costs of recovering
    and dispersing nutrients onto crops or urban hydroponics. The paper posits that
    the nutrient SCCE is an understudied area that holds strong potential in addressing
    the dire and impending nutrient deficiencies and forthcoming consequences that
    will affect the world’s feeding population. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    reducing the loss caused by sensor failures. Keywords: agricultural Internet of
    Things; sensors; fault diagnosis; deep learning 1. Introduction The Internet of
    Things (IoT) is widely used in various fields, such as intelligent healthcare
    [1], smart agriculture [2], smart transportation [3], the smart home [4], and
    the smart city [5,6]. The agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT) has been widely
    used in agricultural scenarios such as field planting, livestock and poultry breeding,
    aquaculture, facility horticulture, and agricultural product logistics traceability
    as an important development direction of “Internet +” agriculture to realize the
    comprehensive perception of the agricultural production process, intelligent decision
    analysis, and early warning, and finally achieve the goal of precision agriculture
    and intelligent agriculture. The Ag-IoT has been used for a long time in many
    countries, and the technology is relatively mature. The United States began to
    use computers for intelligent irrigation and production management in the 1980s.
    Ag-IoT coverage on large farms in the United States has reached 80%. In 2004,
    Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications proposed the U-Japan plan,
    which included Ag-IoT technology developed primarily by NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi,
    and Mitsui. China proposed the “Sensing China” strategy in 2009 [7], and related
    research and the application of Ag-IoT also began to develop rapidly. Sensors,
    the core of Ag-IoT, are primarily used to collect various data in the agricultural
    production process. Furthermore, sensors can be integrated with other systems
    to enhance automatic control capabilities. However, agricultural sensors are prone
    to frequent faults due to poor deployment environments and remote deployment locations.
    For example, when a temperature and humidity sensor is biased or drifts, the irrigation
    system will not work correctly [8]. If the sensor in the robot system fails, it
    may face paralysis [9,10]. Incorrect detection values of sensors will lead to
    wrong decisions in intelligent agriculture systems [11,12]. Unmanned aircraft
    may lose control or even crash due to problems with the gyroscope and accelerometer
    [13]. Due to the influence of the external environment, sensor aging is also a
    source of sensor failures, leading to incorrect decisions [14] and failure to
    transmit information normally [15]. In different application scenarios, sensor
    failures can cause significant human, economic, and environmental losses and reduce
    the quality of IoT service. Since Beard [16] proposed fault diagnosis technology
    in 1971, experts and scholars have conducted extensive research in sensor fault
    diagnosis. Figure 1 depicts the research progress of sensor fault diagnosis technology
    [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Early sensor fault diagnosis methods relied
    on experience and simple ways to pinpoint the location and cause of a problem,
    such as sensor redundancy, function redundancy, and characteristics tracking [27].
    Sensor redundancy is the use of multiple sensors to measure the same parameter,
    the linear combination of the measured values of several sensors is converted
    into an estimated value, and the final comparison of the measured value with the
    estimated value is used to determine whether faults occur. This method, however,
    raises hardware costs. Functional redundancy uses information from each sensor
    in the system to determine whether there is a fault via the relationship between
    sensors in heterogeneous and homogeneous locations. Characterization tracking
    determines whether the sensor values are within acceptable limits. Figure 1. Timeline
    of development in sensor fault diagnosis technology in Ag-IoT systems. With the
    widespread adoption of Ag-IoT and the rise of machine learning, a new method for
    sensor fault diagnosis has emerged. A fault diagnosis model that has been trained
    with a large amount of data has a faster and more accurate effect [28]. In particular,
    as deep learning exhibits powerful data representation learning and analysis capabilities,
    it can meet the requirements of high-order, nonlinear, adaptive feature extraction
    for sensor fault diagnosis [29]. A sensor fault diagnosis method based on Ag-IoT
    can overcome the limitations of early sensor fault diagnosis by fully using more
    technical support, such as machine learning, statistical analysis, and signal
    processing, to realize remote real-time online fault diagnosis, even without the
    presence of maintenance personnel. The system can diagnose itself and recover
    or isolate the corresponding fault, allowing the sensor network to continue operating
    normally after the fault occurs while improving the intelligent level of fault
    diagnosis [30]. This paper offers an overview of Ag-IoT sensor fault diagnosis
    technology. First, sensor networks and sensors are introduced, and the current
    state of sensor research is reviewed. The sensor fault is investigated using Ag-IoT
    characteristics. The common fault root causes, fault types, and sensor fault characteristics
    are discussed. The methods and strategies for detecting sensor faults are thoroughly
    examined. Finally, the future direction of sensor fault diagnosis development
    is discussed. 2. Background of Sensors and Sensor Networks in the Ag-IoT 2.1.
    Sensors and Sensor Networks Smart agriculture requires the deployment of various
    sensors on farmland, crops, animals, and agricultural equipment. High-quality,
    high-resolution, high-reliability professional agricultural sensors must be designed
    and developed to sense the physiological markers of agricultural production environments,
    animals, and plants. According to the different detection objects, sensors can
    be divided into many types, such as gas sensors, temperature and humidity sensors,
    illuminance sensors, nutrient element sensors, and so on. Sensor networks are
    broadly classified into two types: wired sensor networks and wireless sensor networks.
    Wired sensor networks do not meet the requirements of remote deployment areas,
    wide monitoring areas, and low cost due to the shortcomings of complex wiring
    and the high cost of wired sensors. In comparison, wireless sensor networks have
    the advantages of flexible installation and low cost, and they are being used
    in an increasing number of agricultural fields. The self-organization of a large
    number of wireless sensors forms a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). A WSN can remotely
    transmit data from various detection objects in the monitoring area to terminal
    users in real time and quickly. It can be deployed in remote areas to overcome
    wired limitations. A WSN consists of sensor modules, processor modules, wireless
    communication modules, and energy supply modules. The sensor module collects environmental
    information and converts the collected signal to digital analog; the processor
    module filters and processes the data; the wireless communication module sends
    the collected information to the sink node or base station; and the energy supply
    module is in charge of the entire wireless sensor’s energy supply, including power
    supply, solar power, and wind power. Wireless sensors are typically dispersed
    at random throughout the monitoring area. The collected data are transmitted multi-hop
    between nodes before being wirelessly transmitted to the base station [31]. With
    the advances in communication technology, many different types of wireless networks
    have emerged, as shown in Table 1. The deployment nodes of agricultural sensors
    can be adjusted to meet the various service requirements of agricultural applications.
    Table 1. Comparison of data transmission technologies commonly used in agricultural
    IoT. 2.2. Agricultural Internet of Things The world recognizes the IoT as the
    third wave of the world’s information industry after computers, the Internet,
    and mobile communication networks. It can realize a comprehensive network of people
    and people, people and things, and things and things. As agriculture enters the
    4.0 era, the current planting and breeding industry are showing the characteristics
    of scale and refinement through the integration of agriculture with emerging technologies
    such as the IoT, big data, artificial intelligence, etc., via various sensors
    to collect information, such as temperature, humidity, nitrate content in the
    soil, conductivity, and PH [37]. Monitoring and controlling essential factors
    that affect crop growth and yield can significantly reduce economic losses through
    the timely discovery of risks in the breeding process. The continuous emergence
    of intelligent agricultural equipment will promote the automation and intellectualization
    of agriculture. As shown in Figure 2, IoT technology is currently widely used
    in agriculture, including precision agriculture, livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses,
    fisheries management, and weather tracking [38,39]. Figure 2. Practical applications
    of IoT in agriculture. 2.3. Research Status of Ag-IoT Sensors The implementation
    of Ag-IoT systems is reliant on multi-functional intelligent sensors. The wide
    range of sensors includes agricultural environmental sensors, agricultural animal
    and plant life information sensors, agricultural product information sensors,
    and other agricultural sensors (such as position information and pressure information
    sensors). The primary function of agricultural sensors is to collect data on numerous
    agricultural factors, including temperature, humidity, light intensity, and gas
    concentration in the field planting industry; ammonia and carbon dioxide levels,
    air quality, temperature, and humidity in the livestock and poultry breeding industry;
    dissolved oxygen, salinity, carbon dioxide, and ammonium nitrogen in aquaculture;
    and temperature, humidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide in facility horticulture.
    In terms of principle and method, agricultural sensors based on an electrical
    sensing mechanism are primarily used for temperature and humidity sensing [40].
    Sensors utilizing a photoelectric sensing mechanism are mainly employed to measure
    light intensity, gas composition, and phenotypic object displacement. Sensors
    based on an electrochemical sensing mechanism are primarily used to detect temperature,
    humidity, and gas concentrations, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.
    However, at present, the intelligence and technological maturity of agricultural
    environment sensors are low. Although numerous companies are conducting this type
    of sensor research, only a few companies research animal and plant physiological
    information sensors due to technological and financial limitations. Table 2 displays
    representative agricultural sensor systems in the Ag-IoT. Table 2. Representative
    agricultural sensors in a variety of Ag-IoT applications. 3. Types and Characteristics
    of Sensor Faults Sensors in the Ag-IoT structure are prone to many faults during
    data acquisition and transmission. A sensor fault refers to a sensor whose sensing
    or transmitting data is significantly different from other sensor data; the data
    don’t conform to the expected normal behavior or are highly consistent with the
    defined characteristics of fault data [63]. According to the acquisition process
    analysis, agricultural sensors are typically deployed in unattended and harsh
    indoor or outdoor environments. Wireless sensors usually have limited resources
    such as power, memory, and computing resources. Long-term use damages the sensor
    module, power module, and other wireless sensor hardware, resulting in irreparable
    faults that prevent the sensor from collecting data normally. According to the
    transmission process analysis, the complex agricultural environment, such as crops,
    terrain, and greenhouse walls, impacts wireless sensor communication. Due to a
    fault in the agricultural wireless sensor communication module, external attacks,
    and limited communication capabilities, data transmission fails, and sensor data
    collected cannot normally be sent to the server [64]. 3.1. Types of Sensor Faults
    The hard fault and soft fault types are distinguished by the duration of the sensor
    fault. Hard faults are permanent faults that persist until the fault recovery
    phase. Soft faults are temporary faults that disappear after a certain period.
    Figure 3 depicts the classification of hard faults and soft faults. Figure 3.
    Types of sensor faults in agricultural sensor systems. 3.1.1. Hard Fault A hard
    fault refers to the damage or failure of the agricultural sensor’s hardware, resulting
    in a sensor fault. A hard fault prevents the sensor from collecting and transmitting
    data normally, including a transmitter circuit fault, receiver circuit fault,
    microcontroller fault, sensor circuit fault, and power fault. A sensor with poor
    circuit contact is highly susceptible to short-circuit faults. Circuit disconnection
    results in an open circuit sensor fault. The poor working environment causes sensor
    hardware to malfunction. Most of these faults are permanent and require the replacement
    of defective hardware or maintenance circuits. Researchers report that power supply
    failures are the primary cause of sensor data errors [65]. The primary factor
    limiting wireless sensors is the power supply [66]. Wireless sensors must operate
    for years or even decades after deployment, particularly when some nodes are deployed
    in remote locations, making it difficult to regularly meet the power maintenance
    requirements. A power failure causes the sensor to be unable to collect information
    correctly, or transmit data normally, and may even cause the failure of the entire
    agricultural sensor network. The energy consumption of wireless sensors is primarily
    attributable to monitoring, data transmission, and data reception. In the paper
    [67], the impact of power faults on WSNs is categorized into four groups: node,
    link, routing path, and global fault. A node fault may occur when the power supply
    falls below the node’s operating level. When a node’s power supply is insufficient,
    its communication range is diminished, resulting in a link fault. When one or
    more nodes have link faults, the WSN becomes less efficient, resulting in routing
    path faults. When node or link faults occur in key nodes, WSN communication is
    interrupted, resulting in a global fault. 3.1.2. Soft Fault According to the fault
    scheme, sensor soft faults can be divided into drift faults, bias faults, accuracy
    decline faults, stuck faults, and spike faults [68,69]. (1) Drift fault A drift
    fault refers to the measured value and the real value of the sensor changing with
    time. At this time, the output value of the sensor increases at a constant rate.
    Such faults must be diagnosed and restored in time, otherwise, significant measurement
    errors occur [47]. In addition, drift faults cause severe damage to chemical sensors
    and biosensors if they are not readily detected at an early stage and need to
    be diagnosed early [70]. (2) Bias fault A bias fault (offset fault) refers to
    a constant value added to the sensor measurement value, and the sensor output
    result deviates from the normal value [71]. When the manipulator sensor has a
    bias fault, it leads to poor regulation or tracking performance and even affects
    the stability of the control system. In addition, faulty data may lead to wrong
    decisions, making unnecessary component replacement or task termination in the
    system [72]. (3) Stuck fault A stuck fault is a sudden sensor measurement error
    with a constant measurement value. This flaw may vanish over time, but it will
    persist for a considerable time. The fault characteristics are evident and simple
    to identify [25]. Sometimes, the causes of a stuck fault are identical to those
    of other faults. For instance, a clogged pressure sensor causes a stuck fault,
    while a blocked flow sensor causes a decline in accuracy [73]. (4) Accuracy decline
    fault An accuracy decline fault indicates that the average value of the sensor
    measurement does not change, but the variance of the output value increases, resulting
    in a decline in measurement accuracy [74]. This fault frequently occurs in sensors,
    and early detection is crucial for monitoring. However, current research focuses
    primarily on drift faults, bias faults, and stuck faults, while accuracy decline
    fault research is scarce [75]. (5) Spike fault A spike fault refers to a large
    amplitude spike in the measured value of the sensor, which often occurs in sensors.
    One of the reasons is the loose connection within the sensor node [76,77]. When
    a fault occurs in sensors, the system makes wrong decisions, such as spike faults
    in livestock and poultry houses that exceed the set environmental threshold, causing
    fans, heaters, and other equipment to be turned on or off. 3.2. Characteristics
    of Sensor Faults (1) High spatial-temporal correlation The data collected by the
    sensor are a time series consisting of an ordered collection of measurement values
    collected at regular time intervals. Consequently, the influence of historical
    and future data should be considered during fault diagnosis. Moreover, since a
    large number of sensors of the same type are typically deployed in a particular
    area, there is a high spatial correlation between sensors, so other sensors should
    be consulted during the fault diagnosis process. (2) Frequent abnormal data Fault
    data include bias fault, drift fault, and so on, mainly caused by sensor faults
    or damage. The difference between abnormal data and fault data is small, but the
    duration is usually short. Because agricultural sensors are typically deployed
    in outdoor harsh environments, sudden changes in the environment can result in
    random changes, measurement, and recording errors, and thus make sensors produce
    outliers. (3) Different fault duration Due to extreme weather fluctuations or
    the influence of other organisms, the sensor may experience a brief period of
    faults. When such an error occurs, the hardware and software of the sensor are
    normal, and the error is quickly rectified. Due to the deterioration of sensor
    hardware and software or insufficient power, fault duration is lengthy, and most
    faults are permanent. Such faults cannot recover independently; fault diagnosis
    and recovery are required. 4. Strategies for Sensor Fault Diagnosis Based on the
    different fault diagnosis methods performed in the Ag-IoT system structure, fault
    diagnosis is divided into centralized and distributed methods. 4.1. Centralized
    Strategy The most common solution in agricultural sensor fault diagnosis is a
    centralized approach. The central node or base station diagnoses each sensor node’s
    condition. The central node’s limitless resources (such as batteries and computing
    power) lengthen the lifespan of agricultural WSNs [78]. A trained fault diagnosis
    model is stored in the central node that periodically sends requests to the network
    to detect the state of the entire sensor network and diagnoses and locates faulty
    sensors after analyzing agricultural sensor data. Lau et al. [65] proposed a centralized
    fault detection method for WSNs based on the Naive Bayes framework to detect sensor
    battery issues; the diagnosis process was not performed in each sensor node, thereby
    reducing battery load. Salah et al. [79] proposed a centralized policy sensor
    fault scheme based on SVM that performed fault diagnosis at the cluster head and
    utilized fewer sensor resources. This method has minimal hardware requirements
    for agricultural sensor nodes, requires no additional computing and memory resources,
    and extends the sensor’s service life. However, a large amount of information
    is sent to the central node, which causes network congestion and slows down detection
    speed; due to fault diagnosis at the central node, it is difficult to meet real-time
    requirements; in the process of data transmission to the central node or base
    station via multiple hops, the pressure on the sink node increases, consuming
    the sink node’s resources. 4.2. Distributed Strategy Due to the small number of
    base stations in agricultural scenarios, weak signals, and low network coverage,
    agricultural sensor data cannot be transmitted to the central node or base station
    in some areas, making it challenging to implement centralized fault diagnosis.
    In addition, the centralized fault diagnosis strategy increases network traffic,
    resulting in network congestion and an inability to meet real-time fault diagnosis
    requirements. The distributed fault diagnosis strategy effectively resolves this
    issue. Distributed fault diagnosis is located between sensor nodes, eliminating
    the need to send agricultural sensor data to a central node or base station for
    diagnosis and satisfying real-time specifications. Sana et al. [80] proposed a
    distributed sensor fault diagnosis system based on a machine learning algorithm,
    which implemented fault detection in the sensor and performed the fault diagnosis
    on the central node, thereby ensuring the real-time performance of the fault diagnosis
    and reducing the number of calculations performed on the sensor. The greater the
    number of decisions the sensor node makes, the less information is transmitted
    to the central node, thereby accelerating the detection rate. However, the hardware
    requirements of the sensor node are high, and the node for fault diagnosis requires
    specific memory, computing, and battery resources. The memory resources of wireless
    sensor nodes are on the order of kilobytes, and the operation speed is on the
    order of MHz. Conversely, due to the limited resources carried by the sensor nodes,
    the fault diagnosis method must meet the requirements of being lightweight and
    having high performance, allowing for fast and accurate diagnosis despite limited
    computing and storage resources without excessive battery consumption. Data-driven
    fault detection methods require fewer resources than model-driven ones [81]. Some
    researchers [82] investigated using lightweight fault diagnosis algorithms to
    reduce sensor resource consumption during the fault diagnosis procedure. 5. Intelligent
    Fault Diagnosis of Sensor Faults The purpose of sensor fault diagnosis is to detect
    the fault data in the sensor, and restore or isolate the faulty sensor so that
    the sensor can finally provide normal data to the user. Traditional fault diagnosis
    techniques mainly rely on manual judgment, and the experience and expertise of
    engineers determine the accuracy of judgment. However, with advances in science
    and technology, agriculture has entered the 4.0 era, and the data collected by
    sensors are multi-dimensional and large-scale, and the monitoring objects often
    have coupling relationships and affect each other. Relying only on manual machine
    fault diagnosis struggles to meet the current needs in terms of accuracy and real-time.
    In factory farming scenarios, users want an automated way to reduce labor costs
    and improve diagnostic accuracy. The introduction of intelligent fault diagnosis
    (IFD) technology is expected to achieve this goal. IFD refers to the application
    of machine learning theories (such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support
    vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs)) in machine fault diagnosis
    [83], adaptively learning machine fault diagnosis knowledge from the collected
    data, automatically establishing a relationship model between the collected data
    and the health state of the machine, and realizing the automation and intelligence
    of sensor fault diagnosis technology. This section divides the sensor fault diagnosis
    technology into three methods: model-based, artificial intelligence-based, and
    deep learning diagnosis-based, as shown in Figure 4. Relevant sensor fault diagnosis
    approaches are shown in Table 3. Figure 4. Classification of intelligent fault
    diagnosis methods. 5.1. Model-Based Fault Diagnosis Methods The model-based fault
    diagnosis method was proposed by Beard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    in 1971 [16] and refers to using knowledge of the system’s structure, behavior,
    and function to diagnose the fault of the system [84]. Based on the model, fault
    diagnosis methods are divided into three types: state estimation, equivalent space,
    and parameter estimation [85]. The approach consists of two main steps: residual
    error generation and residual error evaluation. This diagnosis method requires
    understanding the mechanism of the research object and establishing a mathematical
    model, using the system’s structure, behavior, or function to simulate the model,
    and then making a decision based on the difference between the actual measured
    signal and the model measured signal. By generating residual signals to achieve
    fault diagnosis [86], the occurrence of a fault can be detected by evaluating
    whether the resulting residual exceeds a threshold. Vasso et al. [87] designed
    a model-based distributed fault diagnosis framework for detecting and isolating
    multi-sensor faults in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The
    adaptive threshold framework ensures the proposed method’s robustness against
    modeling uncertainties and measurement noise. Zhang et al. [88] proved that a
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based sensor fault detection method is less
    efficient in fault detection under minor deviation fault conditions. Yu et al.
    [89] proposed a model-based fault diagnosis scheme that uses open-circuit voltage
    residuals and capacity residuals to deduce fault values of voltage and current
    sensors for battery fault diagnosis. Yan et al. [90] proposed a Cp_PLV model combining
    an unsupervised learning method with change point recognition. Experiments show
    that the predictive effect of the model is good and can fault diagnose the sensor
    in complex working environments. Due to the fact that the model-based fault diagnosis
    method employs fundamental knowledge for fault diagnosis, it has improved fault
    interpretability. It can also meet the real-time requirements of agricultural
    sensor fault diagnosis. In practice, however, the model is uncertain, and it is
    difficult to establish a model that corresponds to other agricultural sensors.
    It is challenging to ensure fault diagnosis accuracy with an unmatched model,
    which cannot detect the fault value and is not universal. 5.2. Artificial Intelligence-Based
    Fault Diagnosis Methods With the widespread adoption of Ag-IoT, the uncertainty
    and complexity of the sensor system have gradually grown, as has the difficulty
    of developing an accurate mathematical model. The artificial intelligence-based
    fault diagnosis method treats the system as a black box, does not need to understand
    the structure and principle of the system and the precise mathematical model of
    the diagnostic object, and uses a large amount of sensor system data for fault
    diagnosis [91]. The method relies primarily on real-time or historical data and
    comprises artificial intelligence algorithms and statistical data processing.
    The primary benefit of this method is that it does not require a precise system
    model, and it has been utilized successfully for agricultural sensor fault diagnosis.
    Common fault detection techniques based on artificial intelligence include statistical
    analysis, expert systems, and machine learning. 5.2.1. Statistical Analysis Methods
    The statistical analysis method primarily involves a sensor’s randomly distributed
    data collection. The sensor is deemed defective when the probability of the data
    instance generated by the model is extremely low. The primary components of this
    method are time series analysis and multivariate statistical analysis. The time
    series analysis method examines the characteristics of sensor data from a time
    series perspective, estimates the predicted value of the sensor data, and determines
    whether the sensor is faulty by comparing the difference between the predicted
    value and the actual value. Hao et al. [92] designed a module based on time series
    theory to detect sensor faults in the navigation system of autonomous mobile agricultural
    robots. Simple and effective, the time series method was able to explain the relevant
    results intuitively. However, agricultural sensors are typically deployed outside,
    where the environment constantly changes, causing the sensor data to fluctuate
    greatly and be prone to error. Due to the difficulty of a single sensor explaining
    the complexity of agricultural environments, multivariate statistical analysis
    methods that combine data from multiple sensors for fault diagnosis are crucial.
    Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [14], Partial Least Squares Regression
    (PLS) [93], and PCA [94] are the three multivariate statistical analysis methods.
    After establishing the probability statistics model, the model can effectively
    detect sensor system faults. The model is highly interpretable; however, when
    using time correlation to detect faulty data, a sudden change in the data distribution
    will reduce the time correlation and make sensor fault diagnosis more difficult.
    The statistical analysis method has the following drawbacks: the nonparametric
    statistical model struggles to meet real-time requirements; the parametric statistical
    model is ineffective in practical applications due to a lack of data distribution
    knowledge in the sensor system; the histogram does not take into account the relationship
    between multivariate data and only applies to univariate data. 5.2.2. Expert System
    Methods The method based on an expert system is used to diagnose faults based
    on the experience of experts and maintenance personnel involved in producing agricultural
    sensors. It is primarily divided into rule-based expert systems and expert systems
    with fuzzy reasoning. An expert system is a structured knowledge system that imitates
    human experts to solve problems in a particular domain. Expert system components
    include a knowledge base, a rule base, an inference engine, a human-computer interface,
    and an explanation facility [95]. The knowledge base is the key to ensuring the
    expert system’s accuracy, which comprises the operators’ theoretical and professional
    knowledge. The system operates as follows: the data to be diagnosed is input through
    a human-computer interface, the inference engine matches the current known conditions,
    information, and rules of the knowledge base, and the user is then presented with
    the conclusion of the matching rules [96,97]. Prasenjit [98] proposed a WSN fault
    node classification and management scheme based on fuzzy rules, which detected
    the sensor fault state and divided it into various categories to guarantee the
    reusability of fault nodes. Pooja et al. [99] proposed a hardware fault diagnosis
    model for sensor nodes based on a fuzzy inference system with three inputs, developed
    27 fuzzy rules based on the status of the transmitter, receiver, and battery,
    and categorized the nodes as normal nodes, end nodes, and dead nodes. This scheme’s
    detection accuracy and misdiagnosis rate have been enhanced. A mathematical model
    is not required by the expert system-based technique for determining what is wrong.
    It employs the rules and information we already possess to determine what is wrong
    with an agricultural sensor system. It has outstanding advantages in the application
    of nonlinear systems because it has good performance and strong learning ability
    in dealing with known faults. Nevertheless, there are still things that could
    be improved with this method: As more and more types of sensors are utilized,
    the complexity of the sensor system must increase. This makes it difficult to
    determine why the sensors are malfunctioning. The current expert systems for fault
    diagnosis lack universality and adaptability, and each system operates independently.
    This is extremely wasteful. Users are interested in the location and timing of
    agricultural sensor failures. 5.2.3. Machine Learning Methods There is no simple
    correspondence between fault types and fault characteristics due to the complexity
    and unpredictability of sensor systems. The fault diagnosis method based on machine
    learning can train support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (NN),
    and other machine learning algorithms using normal data and fault data, and then
    diagnose the fault of sensors. SVM is a machine learning algorithm that solves
    binary classification problems [100]; sensor fault diagnosis is based on small
    samples. Consequently, the SVM model is ideally suited for sensor fault diagnosis
    and has been widely implemented in the field [101,102]. Yang et al. [103] divided
    multiple fault combinations according to the correlation of faults. They developed
    multiple SVM models based on these fault combinations to combat the misdiagnosis
    caused by insufficient and unreliable training data in traditional SVM models.
    Each SVM model assigned positive and negative labels to fault samples, corrected
    various label combinations using DS theory, and then determined the fault type.
    Although the fault identification accuracy of this scheme has been enhanced, the
    DS-theory-based correction rate must be improved. Deng et al. [104] proposed OS-LSSVM
    for sensor fault detection, which solved the problem of LS-SVM lacking sparsity,
    enabled online fault diagnosis, and increased calculation speed. The SVM method
    primarily solves the quadratic programming problem; however, the calculation method
    based on quadratic programming restricts real-time performance and is unsuitable
    for online fault diagnosis. Han et al. [105] proposed an LS-SVM model that reduced
    the computational complexity by transforming the quadratic programming problem
    into a linear equation. The model’s execution time was reduced by 36.7% compared
    to the SVM model, and the diagnostic accuracy was also enhanced. In addition,
    Liu et al. [106] proposed a KNN-FSVM fault diagnosis scheme, which trained SVM
    by only selecting boundary data, thereby reducing the need for computing and storage
    resources. This was a solution to the problem that the computing time of SVM increases
    exponentially with the amount of data, as do the requirements for computing and
    storage resources. While traditional SVM models can diagnose systems with a small
    number of data samples, as sensor performance becomes more complex, the types
    of sensor faults increase, and the accuracy of the classification model decreases.
    Therefore, the SVM-based fault diagnosis method is not suitable for use alone
    in the current diversified agricultural production mode. ANN is a mathematical
    model that simulates the mechanism by which the nervous system of the human brain
    processes complex information based on the fundamental principles of neural networks
    in biology [107]. ANN is a nonlinear model primarily composed of neurons that
    are incorporated into three layers, referred to as the input layer, hidden layer,
    and output layer, with the ability to simulate any continuous nonlinear function
    and learn from samples, expressing the learned fault diagnosis knowledge with
    neural network connection weights, which has been utilized in the fault diagnosis
    of complex systems [108,109]. Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) [110] is
    currently the most widely used neural network model. Researchers created it to
    address the challenges of multi-layer neural networks. Hu et al. [111] employed
    BPNN for temperature sensor fault diagnosis. The model selected the most recent
    local data, reducing the computation required and enabling online detection. In
    order to eliminate data noise and improve the accuracy of neural network fault
    diagnosis, Shi et al. [112] incorporated wavelet denoising technology into the
    BPNN, which enhanced the BPNN’s fault detection rate. Guo et al. [113] proposed
    an EFMSAE-LSTM method for predicting the time series of mechanical failures, which
    can accurately predict the failure time series of most key mechanical components.
    Mariam et al. [114] performed fault diagnosis for HVAC sensors using a self-associative
    neural network and compared this technique to principal component analysis. Not
    only was the diagnostic accuracy of this method significantly enhanced, but it
    could also diagnose multiple sensors simultaneously. Precision agriculture is
    characterized by massive normal agricultural data and small sample fault data.
    The extreme imbalance of these data renders the neural network’s fault diagnosis
    method less stable; The parameters of the model need to be adjusted repeatedly
    to meet the requirements of the practical application, which requires good model
    training experience. Although machine learning-based fault diagnosis methods have
    high time and money costs in network training, they also require relatively large
    training data samples. However, considering the practical application of sensors
    in agriculture, the data collected is susceptible to many factors, such as weather,
    region, season, and changes in the growth stage of animals and plants. Especially
    for the current large-scale and industrialized farming pattern, it is difficult
    or even impossible to obtain accurate system models. Small changes in the system
    can lead to poor failure detection response. Therefore, compared with the fault
    diagnosis methods based on models and expert systems, the fault diagnosis methods
    based on machine learning have good generalization ability and wider applicability,
    which are suitable for application in the era of diversified and integrated agriculture
    4.0. 5.3. Deep-Learning-Based Fault Diagnosis Method With the advancement of hardware
    and algorithms and the exponential growth of data, fault diagnosis has shifted
    from machine learning to deep learning [115]. Deep learning, a subfield of artificial
    intelligence, is the newest data analysis and image processing technology. Compared
    with traditional statistical learning models, deep learning models have a stronger
    ability to extract underlying information from data. The structure of deep learning
    models is usually formed by multi-layer neural networks, which can be flexibly
    changed to meet different practical needs. In addition, multiple layers of data
    processing units are assembled to form a deep architecture. It has powerful learning
    capabilities and can extract features automatically from input data. Hierarchical
    features are represented by low-level features, which can efficiently and quickly
    solve complex problems and have good portability, making them suitable for sensor
    fault diagnosis. Autoencoders (AEs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Recurrent Neural
    Networks (RNNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the current deep
    learning models for sensor fault diagnosis. 5.3.1. Autoencoder (AE) An AE is an
    unsupervised learning neural network that uses the back-propagation algorithm
    to make the output value equal to the input value [116], which can effectively
    extract low-dimensional data features. Encoding and decoding are the two components
    of an AE. The encoder compresses the input into a representation of latent space,
    and the decoder reconstructs the information from the latent space representation.
    With the advent of deep learning, researchers have created additional AE model
    types. For instance, to extract abstract features from data, several AEs are stacked
    to form a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), and a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) was developed
    to improve the anti-noise capability of neural networks [117]. Under the premise
    of training on small data samples, AE can achieve efficient fault diagnosis when
    combined with other classification methods [118]. The use of AE for fault diagnosis
    has received considerable attention in recent years. Luo et al. [119] designed
    an AE-distributed fault diagnosis system with only three layers of the network,
    which was used for fault diagnosis in sensors, and the model was trained in the
    cloud to address the issue that deep learning methods consume a great deal of
    computing and communication resources. Jia et al. [120] proposed a normalized
    sparse AE model for intelligent fault diagnosis, learning various meaningful features
    from the input signal. The translation in-variant features were obtained in the
    feature layer, and then the fault was identified in the output layer, and the
    accuracy rate of the model test reached 99.92 percent. In addition, due to the
    model training phase, AE automatically extracts non-fault-related features, which
    hinders fault diagnosis performance. Wang et al. [121] proposed a supervised SAE
    model capable of extracting fault-related deep features and configuring fine-tuned
    network initial parameters. This method improved classification precision with
    fewer iterations. The local minimum problem exists in the traditional AE method
    for fault diagnosis. Through batch regression, hyperparameter optimization, and
    other techniques, the model can be made to closely resemble the actual working
    conditions of the sensor, which is advantageous for resolving this issue. Mallak
    et al. [122] propose a two-stage fault diagnosis method that uses an LSTM autoencoder
    to perform a separate fault detection stage in advance. This method can effectively
    catch rare faults. AE has the advantages of strong learning ability, simple structure,
    and easy training. However, traditional AE only uses a single-layer encoder for
    feature extraction, which struggles to extract deep features and has limited data
    processing capabilities. As the modern agricultural production process gradually
    presents the characteristics of modularization and specialization, it is suitable
    for application in distributed fault diagnosis and processing small samples of
    univariate data. 5.3.2. Deep Belief Network (DBN) A DBN is a probabilistic generative
    model of multiple Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Each RBM consists of only
    two layers of neurons, the visible layer and the hidden layer, which are connected
    by a symmetrical weighted connection matrix [123,124]. The visible layer inputs
    training data, whereas the hidden layer extracts features. In each RBM, the data
    vector is used to infer the hidden layer, which is then used as the data vector
    for the subsequent layer to improve the probability variation lower bound of the
    training data. As feature extraction is a crucial step in the diagnosis process,
    DBN employs an unsupervised greedy layer-by-layer method to obtain high-level
    feature representation, which can effectively eliminate the complexity and uncertainty
    introduced by manual feature extraction and enhance the intelligence of fault
    diagnosis [125,126]. In addition, DBN has the capacity to manage high-dimensional
    and nonlinear data, thereby resolving the issues of data dimensional disaster
    and inadequate diagnostic capability. Since methods like SVM and ANN can only
    detect faulty data but not faulty sensors [127], Mandal et al. [128] proposed
    a method based on DBN and the generalized likelihood ratio test. DBN was utilized
    to classify fault data and normal data, the faulty sensor was identified by the
    maximum deviation between the fault data and the average value of the normal data,
    and the quantity of fault data and the generalized likelihood ratio test determined
    the fault mode. However, this method only detected faults when the signal exceeded
    the threshold; therefore, other methods are required to detect faults when the
    signal was below the threshold. Due to the loss of potentially valuable information
    in the original data caused by the layer-by-layer feature compression of the DBN
    model, Wang et al. [129] employed the strategy of repeatedly stacking the original
    data during the training phase in order to fully extract the valuable information
    by extending the DBN model. Each RBM was trained with the original data so that
    the extracted features were highly correlated with the original data, and potentially
    valuable information was preserved. Compared to the conventional DBN model, the
    accuracy rate has been enhanced. DBNs can extract advanced features from large
    amounts of data and directly use raw signals to build end-to-end intelligent diagnostic
    models to reduce reliance on expert experience and known knowledge. They can fuse
    the time domain and frequency domain characteristics of each sensor signal and
    apply this to DBN training, which can not only realize fault diagnosis but also
    diagnose fault types. They are suitable for applications in advanced composite
    sensor systems. 5.3.3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) An RNN is a type of neural
    network that processes sequence data. Its most distinguishing characteristic is
    that the output of neurons is transmitted to the input of itself or other neurons.
    Its properties can connect the nodes between hidden layers, and the input of the
    hidden layer incorporates the input of the input layer and the output of the hidden
    layer at the time of its creation. This concatenated neural network structure
    is appropriate for time series data and can preserve data dependencies [130].
    Later, Hochreiter et al. [131] proposed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to improve
    the traditional RNN model to address the issue that RNNs are not good at long-term
    memory. Table 3. Development and application of intelligent sensor fault diagnosis
    approach.                              Due to the fact that sensor data are collected
    at various time points with a high temporal correlation, the RNN model has been
    extensively studied in sensor fault diagnosis. Azzam et al. [132] utilized RNN
    to model sensor nodes, node dynamics, and sensor node coupling to achieve sensor
    node fault diagnosis. This method had a lower early false alarm rate than the
    Kalman filter. Lei et al. [133] adopted LSTM for wind turbine sensor fault diagnosis.
    The method can be extended to multi-sensor fault diagnosis through data fusion.
    In addition, the method was robust under limited data conditions, and its performance
    was superior to SVM and other approaches. Long et al. [134] proposed an RNN-based
    satellite sensor fault diagnosis scheme. They combined the linear parameter change
    method with the based model method to improve the robustness of fault diagnosis
    and the accuracy of the scheme. To solve the overfitting problem of deep neural
    networks in fault diagnosis, Xia et al. [135] implemented dropout in the LSTM
    model to prevent overfitting and enhance the training process’s efficacy. Since
    deep learning automatically extracts features from the original data, there is
    no mapping between the extracted features and the fault mechanism. Although the
    deep learning model is suitable for resolving the big data characteristics of
    large-scale sensors, its training speed is slow and consumes computing resources.
    Therefore, the deep learning model is not typically executed directly on sensors
    but on edge nodes or the cloud. 5.3.4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) CNNs
    are a significant subfield of deep learning. A CNN has an input layer, a convolution
    layer, a pooling layer, a full connection layer, and an output layer. It is capable
    of auto-extracting features and is both robust and generalizable. CNN is currently
    used primarily for feature extraction of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
    image sequences [136]. Still, because CNN has the characteristics of lattice and
    convolution operations and is suitable for multisensor data processing, some researchers
    have introduced CNN to the field of fault diagnosis [137]. Debasish et al. [138]
    proposed a CNN fault diagnosis method to diagnose multisensor faults at the same
    calculation cost to reduce model training time and cost. Sun et al. [139] proposed
    a CNN-RF sensor fault diagnosis method, which converted the original sensor signal
    into a grey matrix image, and the CNN is used to automatically extract the features
    of the gray matrix image, reducing the loss of effective information and improving
    the accuracy Muneer et al. [140,141] proposed an attention-based deep convolutional
    neural network (DCNN) architecture to predict the RUL of turbofan engines. They
    used multivariate time information to extract features, which significantly improved
    the prediction performance of the model. Zhang et al. [142] replaced the conventionally
    used fully connected layers in traditional CNN with a multilayer pool classifier,
    thereby reducing the number of network parameters and the risk of overfitting.
    The method performed a fault diagnosis on the acceleration sensor, with high fault-diagnosis
    accuracy and low computing resource consumption. CNN’s ability to process two-dimensional
    and three-dimensional image data is its primary benefit. Muneer et al. [141] proposed
    a data-driven predictive model based on deep neural networks (DNNs), using sliding
    time window technology to prepare data, which does not require prior knowledge
    of prediction or signal processing. Currently, research in fault diagnosis focuses
    primarily on machinery, particularly rotating machinery, while research on sensor
    fault diagnosis is limited. Some researchers attempt to convert one-dimensional
    sensor data into a two-dimensional form, but this may destroy the spatial correlation
    of the original data and result in the loss of some error-related data. CNN is
    also suitable for processing large sample sizes but has a problem with overfitting
    small sample fault data. The aforementioned methods for fault diagnosis are highly
    accurate, but each has advantages and disadvantages. The model-based method for
    fault diagnosis is highly interpretable. It does not require a large amount of
    data, but the model is complex and highly professional, which is unsuitable for
    daily agricultural applications. The fault diagnosis method based on artificial
    intelligence does not require an accurate mathematical model, and the accuracy
    of the diagnosis is high. However, the model has high requirements for calculation,
    storage, and other resources and requires a large amount of historical data. However,
    In daily agricultural activities, many quantity monitoring systems tend to collect
    and store real-time data, and insufficient amounts of historical data may reduce
    the accuracy of the model. The fault diagnosis method based on deep learning overcomes
    the flaw of the manual feature extraction method based on machine learning, and
    the model accuracy is higher; however, the method for fault diagnosis based on
    deep learning has flaws. To ensure the accuracy of the fault diagnosis model,
    it must be debugged and simulated multiple times, which wastes a significant amount
    of human resources and requires more resources such as computation and storage.
    Table 4 displays the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Table 4. Comparison
    of advantages and disadvantages of intelligent fault diagnosis methods. 5.4. Edge
    Computing-Based Fault Diagnosis Method Edge computing is a new computing model
    that deploys computing and storage resources (such as Cloudlets, and fog nodes)
    to networks closer to mobile devices or sensors. IoT-based edge computing falls
    into three main categories: local devices adapted to specific definitions and
    good targets, local data centers providing significant data processing and storage
    capacity, and regional data centers closer to the data source. In response to
    the limitations of agricultural land, edge computing can be applied to work over
    long distances, and the processing of data generated by sensors through edge computing
    can improve response times, reduce the amount of communication transmitted to
    the cloud, and avoid latency problems in data processing [143]. Control monitoring
    of data using edge computing allows data consistency and integrity analysis, identification,
    and removal of erroneous data. When an edge device fails, the edge computing system
    can notify the user which component is at fault, which facilitates sensor fault
    detection. Sun et al. proposed a real-time detection algorithm based on edge computing
    and cloud computing to improve the average repair time by pre-processing the original
    video data when performing fault diagnosis on video surveillance systems [144].
    Li et al. point out that sensor-based data collection systems suffer from significant
    latency and data redundancy, and edge computing is often applied closer to the
    source of data generation, i.e., data processing is performed locally, sharing
    the reduced data redundancy and solving latency problems [145]. Since edge computing
    will control in real-time, monitor the process of data processing, and send the
    analysis results to the cloud, it is convenient for managers to view the working
    status of sensors in time and make judgments on whether the sensors produce faults.
    To solve some of the problems of wireless sensor data collection, wireless sensors
    are combined with edge computing to establish data collection algorithms. In wireless
    sensor networks, through edge servers, invalid data is filtered, sensing parameters
    are obtained, and the collected data is transmitted to the cloud or edge servers
    to improve sensor networks’ intelligence and computing capability [146], laying
    the foundation for its fault diagnosis. Akhtar et al. proposed that the data distribution
    of edge computing was heterogeneous and required distributed data processing and
    storage. On the basis of edge computing, they proposed High-Performance Computing
    (HPC), which can identify data anomalies by performing quality checks at the edge
    layer, which can help troubleshoot sensors to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
    Users can view, analyze, and operate the data stored in the cloud and use the
    machine learning tools stored in the cloud database to analyze the data and make
    judgments when the sensor is faulty [147]. 6. Challenges and Future Development
    Smart agriculture with Agriculture 4.0 at its core has become the current focus
    of agricultural development on a global scale. With the development of IoT, big
    data, wireless sensing, and other technologies, intelligent equipment in agriculture
    continue to increase, the types of faults are becoming more complex and diverse,
    and the demand for Ag-IoT-based fault diagnosis technology is rising. Some fault
    detection methods based on a single target can no longer meet the demand. First,
    it is necessary to consider the economic benefits and feasibility of the diagnostic
    system for farmers and try to ensure the system’s simplicity while ensuring that
    the diagnosis is correct. At the same time, the amount of information in the agricultural
    field is huge, which is a great test for the stability of any system. The main
    goal of future fault diagnosis technology is to achieve early detection and treatment
    of sensor faults while ensuring system stability. Therefore, we provide a summary
    of the fault diagnosis areas that will receive future attention. 6.1. Edge Computing
    Intelligent fault diagnosis requires high real-time performance and hardware resources.
    Practical issues such as network unavailability, full bandwidth, or insufficient
    sensor computing and storage resources are frequently encountered in agricultural
    scenarios, making it difficult for centralized and distributed fault diagnosis
    strategies to meet sensor fault diagnosis requirements. Edge computing is a remedy
    for the aforementioned issues. Edge computing allows faster response times and
    more secure data transmission and processing than other sensor fault diagnosis
    methods. At the same time, edge computing can be combined with deep learning algorithms
    to reduce model training time and make sensor fault diagnosis more efficient [148].
    Edge computing transfers a portion of the central server’s computing and storage
    resources to edge nodes and collects sensor data on the edge computing platform
    to develop fault diagnosis models. Unmanned plant protection machines and inspection
    robots are two examples of agricultural equipment that transports substantial
    resources. Consequently, using such equipment as a platform for edge computing
    does not increase costs and satisfies the requirements for fault diagnosis. 6.2.
    Satellite Communication Few base stations and low network coverage are characteristics
    of Ag-IoT, which prevents the wireless sensor node from sending data to the central
    node, using the centralized fault diagnosis strategy, and sending fault information
    to the central node using the distributed fault diagnosis strategy. In addition,
    agricultural sensors are frequently deployed in harsh environments, and environmental
    factors such as sudden changes can cause network disruptions and other problems.
    With the proposal of Starlink, people began to investigate the commercial application
    of satellite Internet and the use of satellite communication to solve the problem
    of no network in sensor deployment areas [149]. Satellite communication has the
    advantages of long communication distance, being unrestricted by natural conditions,
    and having high stability, which guarantees the network’s continuous availability
    in sensor fault diagnosis. 6.3. Hybrid Fault Diagnosis Model The sensor system
    in Ag-IoT is frequently dynamic, uncertain, open, vulnerable to attack, and concurrently
    susceptible to multiple faults. If only a single fault diagnosis method is used,
    issues such as low accuracy, poor generalization ability, and incomplete diagnosis
    arise, making it difficult to achieve accurate diagnosis results. The method for
    fault diagnosis based on the fusion of multiple technologies can be studied. Combining
    a model-based approach and deep learning can enhance a diagnostic system’s robustness,
    accuracy, and dependability while decreasing uncertainty. This method can not
    only expand the fault ability based on deep learning but also fully utilize the
    interpretability advantage of the model-based method, which aids technicians in
    understanding the fault type and origin. 7. Conclusions This paper reviews fault
    diagnosis technology in the context of artificial intelligence technology and
    big data. The concept of sensors and sensor networks in Ag-IoT are introduced,
    and common sensor fault types and fault diagnosis strategies in Ag-IoT are listed.
    In addition, the research and application status of three sensor fault diagnosis
    technologies are summarized: model-based, artificial intelligence-based, and deep
    learning-based. The methods are compared and their advantages and disadvantages
    are discussed. Through the analysis of this review, the following conclusions
    are drawn, and suggestions for future work are put forward. (1) Presently, sensors
    are usually deployed in harsh environments, which are extremely vulnerable to
    environmental impact, resulting in inaccurate data collection and irreversible
    impact on sensors. In the future, sensors will be further developed, less affected
    by the environment, and can use limited resources to work for a long time; The
    output format codes between different sensors have developed from the original
    disunity to the standardized format. (2) Deep learning has unique advantages,
    although the research in the field of sensor fault diagnosis is still in its infancy,
    it has a good development prospect. It is necessary to improve the system’s robustness
    to meet the changes in the conditions in practical applications. (3) The commonly
    used single-fault diagnosis methods often encounter many problems: resource limitation
    problems, data transmission problems, node optimization problems, data security
    problems, and so on. In the future, fault diagnosis methods based on the integration
    of multiple technologies can be studied, such as adding edge computing and satellite
    communication and combining expert systems and deep learning to shorten the training
    time by using known rules through transfer learning, which could improve the accuracy
    of sensor fault diagnosis and reduce the frequency of faults to ensure the stability
    and reliability of intelligent agricultural measurement and control systems. Author

    Abstract\nAccording to the United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals are framed\
    \ for improving rural health, hunger, poverty \nissues, environmental conditions,\
    \ and illiteracy globally. With the upcoming technology, there have been many\
    \ advances \nin the lifestyle of people all around the world. Comparatively, more\
    \ emphasis has been given to the development of urban \nareas than rural. The\
    \ sustainable development of a country depends on the growth of its rural areas.\
    \ Countless technologi-\ncal and theoretical models, projects, and frameworks\
    \ have been proposed and implemented to help overcome sundry issues \nand challenges\
    \ faced by rural people in quotidian life. New technological methods are deemed\
    \ to be the future of livability, \ntherefore; a technologically advanced solution\
    \ for sustainable rural development is called for. Blockchain Technology is the\
    \ \nnext step for innovation and development and it has far many applications\
    \ in sustainable rural development that are yet to \nbe discovered. The objective\
    \ of this paper is to explicitly review research conducted in rural development\
    \ to fill the undone \nwork in the future with better research ideas, to make\
    \ rural areas a livable and advanced place while also maintaining their \nintegrity\
    \ leading to sustainable development. To conduct such a review, a systematic research\
    \ methodology is applied follow-\ning regulations in the conduction of standardized\
    \ but explorative analysis. Within the timeline of 2010–2021, 112 papers are \n\
    carefully selected to perform the systematic review. This review will provide\
    \ a comprehensible as well as concise research \ncompendium for all applications\
    \ proposed, implemented, and possible in the future to realize the concept of\
    \ smart villages \nfor the development of rural areas using blockchain technology.\n\

    \ of a country partly depends on how well \nconnected are its rural areas to the\
    \ global chain and how \ntechnologically advanced they are. Rural areas as we\
    \ know \nof are geographical locations sited outside town or cities \nwith fewer\
    \ populations. Essentially, we also know it as a \nplace unprivileged of vital\
    \ necessities, stricken by poverty \n[1], and unemployment. For many years, rural\
    \ areas have \nbeen developing consecutively in Technology, Education, \nHousing,\
    \ Governance, Human rights. Accordingly, the \nworld’s rural population has dropped\
    \ from 66.389 percent \nin 1960–44.286 [2] percent in 2019 due to various trans-\n\
    formations. Years ago, people in rural areas were deprived \nof necessities such\
    \ as water, electricity, and education. \nEven getting a reliable source of electricity\
    \ was a strenuous \neffort. Moreover, female rights, reliable healthcare and sub-\n\
    sequently securing a job were more of a dream. According \nto the United Nations,\
    \ there can be seen a steady drop in \nthe percentage of people residing in rural\
    \ areas from 1960 \nto 2019 [3]. What was the core reason behind it? A general\
    \ \nexample of the reason can be migration, rural decline, demo-\ngraphic qualities,\
    \ natural disasters, and infrastructure: trans-\nportation or socio-economic.\
    \ These can further be exploited \ninto many explanations as to what leads to\
    \ those choices. \nRural–Urban migration itself directs catastrophic changes \n\
    in the environment and economy. Rural Decline is another \nconsequence of migration\
    \ that drains the area of services, \nbusinesses, and social capital forcing the\
    \ development of the \nFig. 1  Issues in rural areas\n2419\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ or probably diminish [4]. Even then, almost \nhalf of the world’s population\
    \ comes under rural areas and it \nconsists of many more issues than resolvable.\n\
    1.1  Background\nThis section explores the interdependent backdrops of the \n\
    rural area and a feasible solution through the concept of \nsmart villages. Sustainable\
    \ development goals with respect \nto Blockchain Technology are discussed in sub-Sect. 1.1.2\
    \ \nand a brief introduction on Blockchain Technology and \ndevelopment techniques\
    \ are mentioned in sub-Sect. 1.1.3.\n1.1.1  Rural Development\nSustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs) were framed for \nimproving rural health, hunger, poverty issues,\
    \ environ-\nmental conditions, and illiteracy globally. The present situ-\nation\
    \ of rural areas brings us to a list of issues (Fig. 1) that \ncan further promote\
    \ the eradication of rural areas from the \nglobal chain if not technologically.\
    \ Beginning with pov-\nerty which has been an issue unresolved regardless of the\
    \ \nvarious monetary schemes provided by the government \ndrives the young generation\
    \ out of the community to find \njobs to sustain daily needs. Many of them fail\
    \ to finish \neven high school, which leads to securing menial jobs in \nurban\
    \ regions. This brings us to the second issue in the \nrural community, illiteracy\
    \ [5]. Education that plays a vital \nrole in the overall development of humans,\
    \ as well as the \ncommunity, is often disregarded to fulfill contemporary \n\
    requirements such as money. In many cases, the parents \nexploit their children\
    \ into working on the farm or small \nfamily businesses.\nTypical issues in a\
    \ rural school can be enumerated as \nteacher’s absenteeism, unhygienic school\
    \ premises, and dis-\ntant schools, technologically backward, absence of school\
    \ \nrecords, inexperienced teachers, and teachers with false \ndegrees. Those\
    \ who get themselves educated, consider it \nbetter to get a job in urban areas\
    \ because of job opportunities \nand better pay which is at times difficult since\
    \ most villages \nlack communication between employees and job availability \n\
    [6]. Basic hygiene and pollution are other issues in rural \nareas that deplete\
    \ life expectancy and give birth to numer-\nous diseases. Many rural communities\
    \ do not have proper \nsanitation facilities, dumping grounds, or recycling plants.\
    \ \nNot having the basic facilities drives people into a lack of \npersonal hygiene\
    \ such as bathing, washing, and cleanliness \n[7]. Pollution of land and soil\
    \ is prevalent due to unhealthy \nsanitary practices. Hundreds of people still\
    \ live without \nwashing their hands leading to diarrhea, cholera, and the \n\
    death of children [8]. Acknowledging the fact that medical \npractitioners, physicians\
    \ are scarce on top of that reaching \na nearby multispecialty hospital takes\
    \ a lot of time [9]. The \nprimary activity of rural people is said to be agriculture.\
    \ \nIt is considered to be the basic source of income for the \ndwellers. Farmers\
    \ in many areas remain uninformed about \nthe recent advancements in agro-technologies.\
    \ The core \nreason for this incomprehension is the lack of broadband \nconnection\
    \ and incentives. Even though the Government \nprovides various monetary as well\
    \ as agricultural schemes, \nmore than half of the farmers fail to enroll in one\
    \ [10]. In \naddition to that from the consumer’s point, there is a whole \nheap\
    \ of issues relating to the certification of quality produce, \nimproper monitoring\
    \ of crops, traceability of farm produce, \nand unsustainable agro-activities.\
    \ Besides, the involvement \nof middlemen leaves the farmers with the minimal\
    \ price \nof agricultural produce [11]. Further, given the aspects of \ndaily\
    \ needs, approximately 940 million [12] people around \nthe world live without\
    \ access to electricity, most of which \nbelong to rural areas. In a generation\
    \ where electricity is \nthe basic need in every household, industry, medical\
    \ center \nwithout which the whole institution of Earth would come \nto a halt,\
    \ there are still people who do their daily activi-\nties without it [8, 9]. About\
    \ 1.7 billion [13] people in the \nworld are still unbanked. The banking facility\
    \ is essential \nfor financial assistance especially much needed to financially\
    \ \nexcluded dwellers of the rural community. However, due \nto unreachable banking\
    \ locations, time-consuming Banking \nprocesses, and in many cases lacking identity\
    \ proof con-\nstrains the adults from applying for a bank account further \nreducing\
    \ the chances of obtaining a loan or funding from \ngovernment schemes [14].\n\
    The concept of a smart village [15] is to develop a rural \narea using technology\
    \ as a medium. The biggest problems \nin rural areas are financial exclusion,\
    \ poverty, hygiene, and \neducation [16]. All the issues are interconnected and\
    \ co-\ndependent, such as due to poverty, children in rural areas fail \nto get\
    \ an education [17]. Due to illiteracy, the villagers do \nnot come to know about\
    \ various financial schemes. People \nseem to care very less about hygiene. Not\
    \ only the waste \nis disposed of incorrectly, but it is also burnt giving rise\
    \ to \nenvironmental pollution. Most of the time people do not \nfind encouragement\
    \ to learn how to properly discard waste \nmaterial, to get educated, or find\
    \ a solution to their financial \nproblems [18].\n1.1.2  Sustainable Development\
    \ and Blockchain\nThe development of an economically backward area without \n\
    jeopardizing the natural assets or future necessities is termed \nsustainable\
    \ development. According to the United Nations, \nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDG) [19] were adopted \nin 2015 for improving rural health, hunger, poverty\
    \ issues, \nenvironmental conditions, and illiteracy globally (Fig. 2). \nThe\
    \ sustainable development goals that balance the socio-\neconomic and environmental\
    \ factors are:\n2420\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nFor rural development, World\

    \ \ncommercialization, and agriculture business, agricultural \nextension, research,\
    \ and many other support activities \nalong with social protection and transportation\
    \ programs \nfor rural communities [2]. IFAD projects for eliminating \npoverty\

    \ in East Africa, Climate Risk Analysis in East \nand Southern Africa, Climate\
    \ finance gap examination for \nsmall-scale agriculture, etcetera [20]. The IEEE\
    \ smart vil-\nlage is an approach to empowering underserved communi-\nties, providing\
    \ the power, education, entrepreneur oppor-\ntunities. Following are the project\
    \ initiatives by IEEE \nSmart Village Initiative: Mural Net(MNAZ)- Broadband \n\

    \ consumers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, \nIndia [21].\nChallenges of achieving Sustainable\
    \ Development Goals \n(SG’s) in rural areas can be elucidated in terms of different\
    \ \nregions. As per the research [22], in Ukraine, control over \nthe large businesses\
    \ and their impact over the agribusiness \nstructures in addition to shrinking\
    \ the number of farms, \njeopardizing rural population, poverty, and fewer efforts\
    \ in \nsocial cohesion improvements or remote development are \nthe principal\
    \ challenges of achieving SDG.\nSimilarly, as per the methodology applied by the\
    \ author in \n[23], the major challenges faced by Romania over achieving \nSDG\
    \ are the Socio economic discrepancy among the rural \ndwellers’ lives as well\
    \ as the Environmental incongruity.\nA few of the Sustainable Development challenges\
    \ faced \nby the Iranian Rural communities as per the authors [24] \nare economic\
    \ setbacks, improper management, and under-\nplanned developments, environmental\
    \ factors, social con-\ncerns, and infrastructural challenges were determined.\
    \ \nOverall implications of the studies provide us with a con-\ncise picture of\
    \ significant challenges of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment goals in rural\
    \ areas.\nSustainability and blockchain both are the call for the \nfuture to\
    \ reduce cost, increase productivity, improving \nhealth, better environmental\
    \ state, and availability of food, \nwater, and sanitation. Blockchain holds the\
    \ ability for long-\nterm and inclusive progress in sustainable development and\
    \ \nto achieve SDGs.\n1.1.3  Blockchain Technology\nIn 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto\
    \ [25] (pseudonym) proposed \nBitcoin, its expansion was doubted. The rise of\
    \ Blockchain \nwas such unforeseen that some enthusiasts asserted it as the \n\
    biggest invention since the Internet [26]. Although W Scott \nStornetta and Stuart\
    \ Haber described the first cryptographi-\ncally secured chain of blocks in 1991,\
    \ it wasn’t until 2009 \nthat Blockchain was implemented as the public ledger\
    \ for \nbitcoin transactions by Nakamoto. For a substantial amount \nof time,\
    \ Blockchain technology was only preferred for a \ncryptocurrency (Fig. 3). However,\
    \ after the introduction of \nscripting language into the blocks by Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ \nto work as bonds, which are now known as Smart Contracts \nthe inventory of\
    \ applications widely opened. In his paper \nNakamoto proposed to create a peer-to-peer\
    \ form of elec-\ntronic cash that did not require a financial institution as an\
    \ \nintermediary and would be transferred directly between \none party and another.\
    \ He improved the double-spending \nFig. 2  Sustainable development \ngoals\n\

    \ \n1 3\nproblem in Digital Signatures by implementing timestamps \non the transaction\
    \ and hashing them onto the ongoing chain \nof hash-based proof-of-work which\
    \ changed the proof-of-\nwork if tampered with hence forming an immutable record.\n\
    Blockchain, even though it uses pseudonyms as account \nidentifiers, has four\
    \ key trust characteristics that eliminate \nthe need for third-party authenticators.\
    \ Firstly, a ledger in \nwhich after successful verification and authentication\
    \ the \ntransaction details are stored. Secondly, it is Secure since \nits transactions\
    \ are time-stamped and hashed to the previ-\nous blocks; it makes the blockchain\
    \ cryptographically secure \n(Fig. 4). Thirdly, the shared characteristic of involving\
    \ mul-\ntiple users provides transparency amongst all participants \nin the distributed\
    \ ledger. Lastly, its property of being dis-\ntributed eliminates operational\
    \ inefficiencies, provides more \nsecurity as the more the number of nodes the\
    \ more resilient \nit is towards attacks [27].\nThe complexity of the working\
    \ of blockchain can be \nsimplified by exploring the components that make up its\
    \ \narchitecture [28]. The main components can be enumer-\nated as Node, Cryptographic\
    \ hash functions, Transactions, \nAsymmetric-key cryptography, Ledgers, Blocks,\
    \ Miners, \nand Consensus (Fig. 5).\nNode: A device possibly a computer forming\
    \ the structure \nof a blockchain. A node is where the blockchain exists. Cop-\n\
    ies, as well as original records of the blockchain, are stored \nin a node. Classified\
    \ as Full node and Light nodes, where \nFull node is a server in a decentralized\
    \ network that contains \nthe Block chain’s block history, and Light nodes are\
    \ used for \nsimple payment verification such as a wallet that queries the \n\
    current status of a block.\nLedgers: A decentralized blockchain uses a ledger\
    \ for \nrecord-keeping. As it is decentralized, it keeps many copies \nof the\
    \ transaction including providing a copy to each user \nof their transaction.\n\
    Blocks: A block resembles a page in a record book \n(ledger). The first block\
    \ is called the generic block. A block \ncomprises a block header and block data\
    \ where the block \nheader consists of the history of the blockchain (previous\
    \ \nhash value, timestamp, size of the block, and nonce) and \nminers perform\
    \ hashing to validate the block, and block data \nkeeps the record of recent transactions\
    \ that are yet to enter \nthe blocks.\nCryptographic hash functions: A digest\
    \ or an algorithm \nthat takes up an arbitrary amount of data and produces a \n\
    hash value or hash which is an output of fixed size. It elimi-\nnates the use\
    \ of a password, instead uses enciphered text that \nprovides more security from\
    \ attackers.\nTransactions: A transaction is what the components work \nabout.\
    \ When two parties interact in blockchain, a transaction \ntakes place. Authorization\
    \ is required to approve a transac-\ntion between two parties. In a public blockchain,\
    \ the trans-\naction is inserted by consensus which happens when the \nmajority\
    \ of nodes validate the transaction.\nAsymmetric-key cryptography: It is public-key\
    \ cryptogra-\nphy that is used to enable certitude between the transacting \n\
    parties who are unsure about each other’s integrity. Asym-\nmetric-key cryptography\
    \ uses mathematically related keys to \nensure safety as well as the secrecy of\
    \ data. The public key \nand Private key, even though relative is used for decryption\
    \ \nand encryption, respectively.\nMiners: When two users create a transaction,\
    \ the miners \nvalidate that transaction in the block data before putting it \n\
    on the ledger. The average time it takes for a miner to mine a \nblock is 10 min.\
    \ Since miners use their energy and hardware \nto solve a block, they also require\
    \ an incentive for their work \nwhich is mostly paid in cryptocurrency.\nConsensus:\
    \ A consensus can be identified as a decision-\nmaking criterion. It makes sure\
    \ that all the nodes validate a \nblock and no such duplicity exists in the ledger\
    \ that hasn’t \nbeen agreed upon. The discussion involved in consensus is \nFig.\

    1 3\nused to solve identity-issue, clarify altercations, and estab-\nlish a similar\
    \ viewpoint between the participants by applying \na set of rules.\nEthereum:\
    \ introduced by Vitalik Buterin [29] addressed \nvarious limitations of the scripting\
    \ language in the block-\nchain. The platform is used to build and publish distributed\
    \ \napplications by using a programming language. It is said \nto be an improvement\
    \ over the blockchain structure. It pro-\nvides data-friendly services to all\
    \ and sundry no matter their \nlocation or background. Ethereum consists of full\
    \ nodes that \nrun the Ethereum Virtual machine to deploy distributed pro-\ngrams\
    \ such as smart contracts. Application development in \nblockchain can be done\
    \ through Ethereum which can also \ncall multiple other blockchain, protocols,\
    \ and cryptocurren-\ncies [30]. Ethereum uses the chain of global computers to\
    \ \noperate and runs smart contracts that are free of intermediar-\nies or third-party\
    \ censorships. Ethereum uses an incentive \nmechanism [31] to encourage programmers\
    \ who run the \nFig. 4  Blockchain technology diagram\n2423\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ to compensate for hardware and energy \nused in running decentralized digital\
    \ applications (dapps). \nThese incentives are called Ether which is a cryptocurrency\
    \ \nin the Ethereum protocol.\n1.1.4  Blockchain Development Platforms and Tools\n\
    To simplify the blockchain processes and to ease the devel-\nopment various tools\
    \ and programming languages have been \nintroduced.\n1.1.4.1 Ethereum Virtual\
    \ Machine (EVM) The executing \ncode and the Executing machine consist of an abstraction\
    \ \nwhich is referred to as virtual machines, and Ethereum vir-\ntual machines\
    \ increase the intended code execution chances, \nand the consensus is maintained\
    \ on it [32].\n1.1.4.2 Remix IDE Remix Integrated Development Envi-\nronment is\
    \ open-source software for web or desktop devel-\nopment. An intuitive and appealing\
    \ interface remix allows \nsmart contract development and Ethereum interaction\
    \ [33]. \nRemix IDE has multiple plugin options such as Web3 inte-\ngration, embedded\
    \ Web3, and Javascript for running the \ncontract locally. Solidity smart contract\
    \ programming lan-\nguage is used for development in Remix IDE.\n1.1.4.3 Smart\
    \ Contracts Simple programs stored on the \nblockchain comprise some predefined\
    \ conditions [34]. \nUpon meeting the conditions the contract is self-executed\
    \ \ngiving the edge of non-intermediary processes as well as \ntime efficiency.\
    \ Multiple programming languages are used \nto develop smart contracts for blockchain;\
    \ a few of them \nhave been discussed below:\n• Solidity [35]: A highly preferred\
    \ object-oriented design-\nbased, high-level language conveniently made for \n\
    developing smart contracts. Most of the solidity syntax \ninspiration came from\
    \ C ++ , Javascript, and Python pro-\ngramming languages. Solidity, along with\
    \ being the top \nsmart contract language focusing on EVM in certain also \nsupports\
    \ inheritance and user-defined types.\n• Vyper [36]: Highly influenced by python\
    \ and the sec-\nond-best after Solidity, vyper is based on three important \n\
    principles namely auditability to ensure the readability \nand understandability\
    \ of the code for the user, Security \nto ensure secure smart contracts, and Simplicity\
    \ of the \nlanguage and the implementation.\n• Yul [37]: An intermediate smart\
    \ contract development \nlanguage that includes the bytecode compilation accord-\n\
    ing to different backend needs. The main focuses of Yul \nare simplicity in bytecode\
    \ translation, understandability, \nand readability of the scripted programs.\
    \ Yul supports \nstack machines and is specifically tailored for them, \nwhole-program\
    \ optimization, and static type reference \nand value nature.\n1.1.4.4 Hyperledger\
    \ A Linux framework for blockchain \ndevelopment that provides standards and tools\
    \ for open-\nsource blockchain applications [38]. Hyperledger enterprise \nhelps\
    \ build permissioned blockchain solutions for busi-\nnesses and services. Under\
    \ the Hyperledger Framework, \nmultiple projects have been introduced:\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric: A modular permissioned and private \nframework for blockchain technology\
    \ used for develop-\ning solutions for businesses and private enterprises. Fab-\n\
    ric has a well updated smart contract interaction, faster \ntransactions, and\
    \ efficient data sharing.\n• Hyperledger Explorer: Explorer is a user-friendly\
    \ block-\nchain development web application tool. The interface \nprovides detailed\
    \ information about the blocks, trans-\nactions, network nodes, and the state\
    \ of the blocks. \nHyperledger Explorer uses visualization tools for repre-\n\
    senting the blockchain data in a user-friendly and read-\nable manner.\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Sawtooth: By separating the core system, \nthat is, specifying the business\
    \ rules without interact-\ning with the application domain is the main task of\
    \ \nhyperledger sawtooth. It supports the Practical Byzantine \nFault Tolerance\
    \ (PBFT) as well as the Proof of Elapsed \nTime (POET). The smart contracts can\
    \ be developed and \nrun on the platform without actually knowing the core \n\
    system’s design.\nFig. 5  Blockchain components\n2424\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\n• Hyperledger Caliper: A blockchain benchmark tool, the \ncaliper used\
    \ pre-defined uses cases to test the blockchain \nsolutions along with a test\
    \ result of its performance. Cali-\nper has a very proficient success rate for\
    \ testing the suc-\ncessful and failed transactions, provides the maximum, \n\
    minimum, and average latency of transaction and read \ndata for the test cycle.\n\
    Limitations of Blockchain are limited but cannot be disre-\ngarded [39]. From\
    \ the creation of the node to the validation \nby miners, Blockchain consumes\
    \ a lot of energy. Splitting of \nthe chain is another problem where a node does\
    \ not accept \nthe transactions in a new chain if it is operating to the old \n\
    software. The computing requirements increase as the block-\nchain grows. Since\
    \ all the nodes cannot provide the neces-\nsary capacity, the node breaks, and\
    \ the immutability and \ntransparency of the blockchain cease to exist.\n1.1.5\
    \  Blockchain for Smart Village Applications\nThe scenario in a typical village\
    \ is such, in terms of the \ninfrastructure most of it is inadequately built,\
    \ there exists \nschools and colleges but poorly maintained, poorly built \nhouses\
    \ with no constraints for disaster management. In \nterms of necessities, normal\
    \ villages lack stable electricity \nsupplies, or a secure income to support electricity\
    \ bills, and \nnon-purified water. People in villages are often neglected \nand\
    \ most of the dwellers don’t have any personal or national \nidentity. The healthcare\
    \ system in villages is simple and inef-\nficient which does not help during major\
    \ problems. Normal \nvillages lack any technological advancement and people \n\
    there live in history because of the lacking development. \nSustainable development\
    \ with the concept of smart villages \ncan give a secure and feasible future to\
    \ the villages.\nBeyond the conventional use of blockchain in finance \nusing\
    \ cryptocurrency, numerous applications can change the \nway we perceive digitization.\
    \ According to Kandaswamy \n[40], blockchain can have four types of initiatives:\
    \ block-\nchain disruptor, digital asset, efficiency play, and record-\nkeeper\
    \ (Fig. 6). With similar inventiveness some of the \nblockchain applications with\
    \ the concept of a smart village \ncan be enumerated as:\nHealthcare: Blockchain\
    \ with its record-keeping charac-\nteristics and smart contract with its privacy\
    \ and security has \ngreatly assisted the medical area by providing a solution\
    \ \nfor publicly or semi-private sharing of the medical data of \npatients. This\
    \ can help the researchers and students to elicit \na new solution or use it for\
    \ clinical trials [41]. The solution \nfor missing health documents or previous\
    \ clinic visit records \ncan be improved through blockchain. The potential of\
    \ Block-\nchain to store patient’s record on the ledger make it possible \nto\
    \ get treatment across the globe. Furthermore, the problem \nof counterfeit drugs\
    \ in the market can be resolved through \nthe traceability solution from blockchain\
    \ through which fake \nmedicines can be traced and removed from the supply chain.\n\
    International payments and insurance: Accelerated pay-\nment to international\
    \ locations is possible through block-\nchain technology. Several Bitcoin-operated\
    \ services make it \neasier to transfer money cross-border. The process includes\
    \ \nconverting the payer’s local currency into Bitcoin bypass-\ning the existing\
    \ banking infrastructure and then converting \nthat Bitcoin into the receiver’s\
    \ local currency. This saves the \ntrade cost and speeds up the transaction. Apart\
    \ from that, \nthe insurance industry can also be benefitted from block-\nchain\
    \ technology [42]. Blockchain can provide a transparent \nand trustworthy system\
    \ to overcome the challenges of the \ninsurance industry. Fraudulent claims, intermediary\
    \ payment \ntransactions, and big data handling are some of the many \nissues\
    \ faced by insurance companies. Blockchain can resolve \nthe issues through its\
    \ security and transparency provided by \nthe distributed ledger which also furnishes\
    \ the authentic-\nity of the participants. Besides, its characteristic of record-\n\
    keeping comes in handy with the huge amount of customer \ndata that is immutable\
    \ in the blockchain ledger. Additionally, \nby using the smart contracts real-time\
    \ data of the claims, \nreimbursements or payments can be fetched from multiple\
    \ \nsystems in no time.\nPersonal Identity Record-keeping: Identity is an integral\
    \ \npart of society that provides a unique character and sense \nof acceptability\
    \ in a country. However, physical forms of \nnational identity are not accessible\
    \ to many people around \nthe world. The absence of identity makes it difficult\
    \ for \npeople to participate in voting, banking, employment and \nlimits the\
    \ chances of access to the financial system. Here \nblockchain steps in by providing\
    \ identity solutions through \nFig. 6  Blockchain elements\n2425\nA Systematic\
    \ Literature Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\ndigital\
    \ identity. Additionally, self-sovereign identity arranges \noptions to store\
    \ one's identity on devices accessible across \nthe world [43].\nSupply chain\
    \ and logistics: Blockchain can bring great \nusability to supply chain management.\
    \ Procurement, trace-\nability, digital payments, and logistics are some areas\
    \ that \nhave benefitted from blockchain technology. The distributed \nledger\
    \ can reduce the sharing of operational data by provid-\ning a full view of the\
    \ sale/purchase data, accessible from \nany device. Fraud in the food supply chain\
    \ is prevalent in \nmany countries. Counterfeit products selling in the market\
    \ \nprove hazardous to the consumer. The Block chain’s QR \ntracking system along\
    \ with digitized physical products can \nbe used to track products from production\
    \ to delivery [44]. \nThis technology has started benefiting the agricultural\
    \ sec-\ntor to develop food safety and smart farming increasing the \nincome of\
    \ small farms and food producers.\nEducation: Keeping physical records and transcripts\
    \ can \nbe a hassle. This blockchain provides a solution for digitiz-\ning student\
    \ records, transcripts, and payment receipts [45]. \nDigital record-keeping can\
    \ benefit a student as it will be \nacceptable by universities across the globe,\
    \ free of manipula-\ntion, and handy. Blockchain can also be used to incentivize\
    \ \nstudents through a course credit system. The credit can be \ntranslated to\
    \ cryptocurrency, which can be further used as \nfee payment.\nBlockchain with\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT): Powerful \nunion of two futuristic technologies\
    \ makes machine-to-\nmachine transactions easier. The decentralized authority\
    \ \nof blockchain combined with the smart devices run by IoT \nallows a function\
    \ to autonomously execute without a central \nauthority [46]. Smart IoT run devices\
    \ can be implemented \non edge devices, reducing data transfer costs, and security\
    \ \nissues with the blockchain collaboration [47]. Blockchain \nintegration with\
    \ IoT can highly change the agricultural sec-\ntor. Supply chain traceability\
    \ could benefit the farmers in \neliminating the intermediaries through traceability\
    \ and RFID \ntag-based applications. Water, soil, climate, and other sen-\nsory-type\
    \ IoT devices can help in monitoring the agricultural \nactivities and gathering\
    \ the farm data and activities such as \ncultivation and livestock data in the\
    \ blockchain ledger. IoT \nwith blockchain will certainly revolutionize and transform\
    \ \nmany rural and urban sectors.\n1.2  Motivation and Major Contributions\nSustainable\
    \ Rural development starts with the participation \nof rural people in improving\
    \ their lifestyle. Without the peo-\nple working for their development, any implementation\
    \ or \nhelp is incomplete. Economic and technological sector links \nare important\
    \ for rural areas to develop. Along with that, a \nhealthy agricultural sector\
    \ improves the dweller’s linkage to \nthe global supply sector. By managing the\
    \ social, economic, \nenvironmental, and health objectives the development can\
    \ be \nfast-forwarded. There is a considerable amount of potential \nin rural\
    \ people which can be applied to employment issues, \nsocial disparities, E-governance,\
    \ women's rights etcetera. \nDeveloping rural areas can benefit nationally, economically,\
    \ \nand financially. This systematic literature review aims to pro-\nvide extensive\
    \ literature related to blockchain’s application \nin rural development and sustainable\
    \ living. A plethora of \nblockchain review papers available does not provide\
    \ a col-\nlective literature review of blockchain applications divided \ninto\
    \ different areas directed towards rural and sustainable \ndevelopment. Therefore,\
    \ clear and concise information can \nbe gained about blockchain’s work in improving\
    \ rural devel-\nopment providing scope for future research in this direction.\
    \ \nThe primary contributions are mentioned below:\n• A systematic review of relevant\
    \ literature for research \ntrends, key applications, and areas of implementing\
    \ \nBlockchain Technology for smart villages for sustain-\nable rural development.\n\
    • Identification of major issues in rural development and \nhow they can be addressed\
    \ using Blockchain Technology.\n• Exploration of the existing software, platforms,\
    \ and tools \nfor the implementation of Blockchain in Rural Develop-\nment.\n\
    • Identifications of the research gaps and future research \ndirections for applying\
    \ Blockchain Technology to Rural \nDevelopment.\nTo conduct a fair and precise\

    \ Review on Blockchain \nTechnology for Sustainable Rural \nDevelopment\nThe literature\
    \ review consists of the collective work of \nblockchain in rural development.\
    \ A total of 6 areas of \napplication were identified after careful extraction\
    \ of data \nand transformation globally namely: Agriculture, Bank-\ning, Environment,\
    \ Energy, Employment, and Healthcare. A \ndetailed discussion on the related work\
    \ is discussed in the \nsubsections.\n4.1  Agriculture\nIn the agriculture sector,\
    \ most of the application areas \nincluded supply chain traceability, facilitation\
    \ of smart agri-\nculture, and incentivization of services (Fig. 14). A detailed\
    \ \nsummary is given in Tables 5, 6, and 7.\n4.1.1  Supply Chain Traceability\n\
    The author F. Tian, [51] studied the integration of RFID \n(Radio-frequency Identification)\
    \ and blockchain technology \nin building the agri-food supply chain traceability\
    \ system. \nWith the help of blockchain technology, the information \nshared and\
    \ traceability is guaranteed. Apart from the sup-\nply chain, it also regulates\
    \ food safety and quality supervi-\nsion. This system can enhance the credibility\
    \ and reliabil-\nity of agri-food safety information. With the depletion of \n\
    an application cost, this system can effectively change the \ncurrent supply chain\
    \ to be more quality-enhanced and safe. \nSimilarly, Hua et al. proposed an agriculture\
    \ [65] provenance \nsystem based on blockchain featured by decentralization, \n\
    collective maintenance, consensus trust, and reliable data \nto solve the trust\
    \ crisis in the product supply chain. The \nsystem’s Target is to record information\
    \ related to the pro-\nduction supply chain: production, processing, storage,\
    \ trans-\nportation, and distribution of agricultural products. It also \nfacilitates\
    \ Recordkeeping from basic planting information \nto provenance records. The proposed\
    \ work solved the issue \nof the credibility of data and the difficulty of integrating\
    \ the \nsubsystem of each company.\nThe paper by Casado-Vara et al., [58] addressed\
    \ the issues \nof the current supply chain such as communication gaps \nbetween\
    \ vendors or the opacity of the origin of the product. \nThe author has proposed\
    \ a new model of the supply chain \nvia blockchain where all the members of the\
    \ supply chain \nsave all their transactions in the blockchain to ensure higher\
    \ \nsecurity. This model also enables a circular economy that \nis a make-use-recycle\
    \ model. With this model, all products \ncan be traced from their origin to their\
    \ sale and subsequent \nrecycling.\nFurther, Caro et al., [70] presented AgriBlockIoT\
    \ which \nis a fully decentralized blockchain-based traceability solu-\ntion for\
    \ agricultural food supply chain management. The \nproposed architecture based\
    \ on API includes a controller to \nconvert high-level function calls to corresponding\
    \ for the \nblockchain layer and blockchain itself which is the main \nFig. 10\

    blockchain can create transparent, fault-tolerant, immuta-\nble, and auditable\
    \ agri-food traceability records. The authors \nLi and Wang, [85] characterized\
    \ the research applications \nof blockchain in food supply traceability. With\
    \ the help of \nblockchain technology and various radiofrequency devices \ncan\
    \ be integrated to collect data from farms, deploy sensors, \nand create intelligent\
    \ contracts to implement server logic. \nThe new system can change the traditional\
    \ food supply sys-\ntem by making it more convenient, efficient, and trustable.\
    \ \nKim et al., [54] presented a theoretical, end-to-end, vis a vie \n“farm-to-fork”,\
    \ food traceability application named Harvest \nNetwork with the integration of\
    \ Blockchain technology and \nInternet-of-things. The process includes tracing\
    \ the prod-\nucts from processing, grading, transportation, temperature, \nand\
    \ contractual payment all with blockchain, IoT, and smart \ncontracts. This can\
    \ help consumers gain field-level insight \ninto the products. Lin et al., [63]\
    \ proposed an IoT and block-\nchain integrated self-organized, open, and ecological\
    \ food \ntraceability system. The proposed model consisted of trade, \nlogistics,\

    \ \ninformation about the product they buy with the help of a \ntrusted, self-organized\
    \ smart agriculture ecosystem.\nGalvez et al., [78] review the potential of blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology in guaranteeing traceability and authenticity in the \nfood supply\
    \ chain. The review included blockchain solutions \nto traceability problems.\
    \ It explained the use of a chronologi-\ncal distributed database to coordinate\
    \ individual activities. \nBy using a probabilistic approach to enable transparency\
    \ \nand verifiability without a central authority, enabling con-\nsensus on a\
    \ transaction to secure legitimate transactions, \nand time-stamped blocks providing\
    \ immutable records to \npreserve records the traceability issues were solved.\
    \ The \npaper also discussed the Block chain’s concept on the food \nsupply chain\
    \ which provides transparency, efficiency, secu-\nrity, and safety to the food\
    \ produce. According to Kamble \net al., [55], the supply chain practitioners\
    \ found a lack of \nefficiency and transparency which leads to constant threats\
    \ \nto formers and consumers. The system deployed the ISM \nmethodology to identify\
    \ Blockchain technology enablers \nin the agriculture supply chain. The findings\
    \ implied the \nacceptance of blockchain technology as an innovative tool to \n\
    ensure an efficient agriculture supply chain by the practition-\ners. To achieve\
    \ further traceability the farmers could cap-\nture relevant information about\
    \ the agricultural events onto \nthe blockchain to enable transparent and trusting\
    \ sources of \ninformation for the farmers. Kamilaris et al., [60] explored \n\
    how the food supply chain and agriculture were impacted \nby blockchain technology.\
    \ The stages of the supply chain \nwith blockchain technology has been identified\
    \ as (1) the \nprovider (2) producer, (3) processing, (4) distribution, (5) \n\
    retailer, and (6) consumer where a web application or device \ncan be used to\
    \ scan the item’s QR code to view its detailed \ninformation. Along with this,\
    \ the author explored various \nchallenges and benefits of the agricultural supply\
    \ chain \nand Blockchain’s collaboration. Salah et al., [66] proposed \na solution\
    \ of eliminating the third parties and centralized \nauthorities in the food supply\
    \ chain along with a security \nsystem for food traceability, transparent records,\
    \ and gov-\nernance of interactions and transactions between the users. \nThe\
    \ model entities are related to providing secure tracking \nof the product and\
    \ payment with Ethereum smart contracts. \nThus, the presented model for traceability\
    \ can be used to \ntrace and track the soybean supply chain. S. Missineo, [75]\
    \ \nproposed a model to secure storage origin provenance for \nfood data. The\
    \ proposed system aims to certify the produc-\ntion and the supply chain concerning\
    \ food local products \nby using Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. The\
    \ \nauthor aimed to ensure the authenticity of typical Sardinian \nproducts and\
    \ to sell them online or offline. The platform \nensured the consumer to check\
    \ the authenticity of the prod-\nuct before the purchase giving details on both\
    \ the production \nchain and supply chain. Jaiswal et al., [86] proposed mul-\n\
    tiple smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain \nfor decentralized\
    \ trading of food grains. The framework \nincluded Peer-to-peer trading, the security\
    \ of food grain \ndata, transparency, user anonymity, trust, and incentives as\
    \ \nkey features. The design of the framework consisted of four \ncontracts namely\
    \ food grain supply, bidding, trading, and \nutilization for the supply chain\
    \ management. Dong et al., \n[56] proposed a collaborative model of blockchain\
    \ and IoT \nin the agriculture sector. The data collection and transmis-\nsion\
    \ can be distinguished through a unique identity card \ngiven to each agricultural\
    \ product. All the environmental \naspects of the agricultural process can be\
    \ gathered at the \nsource. Along with that crop growth information, circulation\
    \ \nof the product using an RFID tag and distribution process \ncan also be recorded\
    \ and stored on the distributed ledger. \nA QR code attached to the product can\
    \ be scanned by the \nconsumer to view product information in details.\nFig. 14\

    \ \n1 3\nWithal, Madumidha et al., [145] proposed the use of \nblockchain technology\
    \ to maintain tamper-proof records, \navoid intermediaries and provide security\
    \ to the transac-\ntions which in turn reduces transaction costs and improves\
    \ \nthe quality of the products. The food products are labeled \nwith RFID tags\
    \ to maintain the supply chain. The author \nexplained the revolutionary changes\
    \ blockchain technology \ncan bring to the supply chains and how it can increase\
    \ the \neconomic conditions of a country by reducing corruption \nrates and increasing\
    \ the satisfaction of producers and con-\nsumers. Paul et al., [83] proposed a\
    \ way to eliminate inter-\nmediaries between farmers and consumers to provide\
    \ the \nright amount for the farm produce. The proposed system \nconsists of blockchain\
    \ nodes namely Supply companies, \nlandowners, markets, and farmers. The farmer\
    \ node sets the \namount after the agreement period, the market node collects\
    \ \nand stores crops and stops intermediaries from manipulating \nthe prices,\
    \ the landlord node collects the money from the \nland on lease, and the supply\
    \ company node sells extra agri-\ncultural products to the farmers. This platform\
    \ named KHET \nwhere all the nodes are interconnected through Ethereum \nblockchain\
    \ is beneficial for farmers, landlords, and markets.\nMusah et al., [62] main\
    \ objective in proposing the role of \nblockchain in Ghana’s cocoa beans food\
    \ supply chain was \nto evaluate the contributions made by applications of block-\n\
    chain technology in the supply chain. The system provides \na global traceability\
    \ platform, supply chain intelligence and \nvisibility, Africa cocoa village;\
    \ impact the investing for \nsmallholder farmer and uses Bean tracker. The author\
    \ care-\nfully studied the tools and platforms benefiting the cocoa \nbean production\
    \ and supply chain processes.\nAdditionally, Baralla et al., [146] proposed a\
    \ blockchain-\nbased generic agri-food supply chain traceability system \nfor\
    \ implementing the farm-to-fork model. In this system, \na QR code scan can allow\
    \ the consumer to reconstruct the \nproduct history to verify product health and\
    \ quality. The \nmain contribution of this article was the authentication and\
    \ \nverification of shared data’s integrity in supply chain man-\nagement. With\
    \ the help of this system, the involved operators \ncould identify any new participants\
    \ along with the supply \nchain which increased the degree of trust between organiza-\n\
    tions and individuals. Dakshayini et al., [87] proposed an \nintegrated model\
    \ based on Blockchain, big data, and cloud \nto efficiently manage crops that\
    \ achieve effective demand-\nbased decision support, simplified, transparent,\
    \ and secure \nagricultural supply chain. The proposed model has a higher \npercentile\
    \ of achieving demand and supply of crops which \navoids the farmer’s loss, catering\
    \ to consumer’s needs, pro-\nvides sustainable agricultural practices, reducing\
    \ middlemen \ninvolvement, and reducing price inflation problems. Saji \net al.,\
    \ [88] proposed a model to enhance the supply chain \nperformance by using a blockchain\

    \ Villages \n1 3\nnew markets. The system improved farming profitability \nand\
    \ endorsed the financial stability of cultivators. It also \nprovided health benefits,\
    \ reduced food wastage, eliminated \nmanipulation, and adulteration, and supports\
    \ the supply \nchain of agro-products. Saurabh and Dey, [69] identified the \n\
    potential divers of blockchain concerning the grape wine \nsupply chain. The smart\
    \ contract-based module was con-\nstructed to ensure trust between participants\
    \ during trans-\nactions. The proposed model enhanced the customization, \ncompetitiveness,\
    \ and usability of the supply chain.\nIqbal and Butt, [84] proposed a model to\
    \ save the farm-\ner’s crops from animals at night. A repelling and notifying\
    \ \nsystem (RNS) is installed in the field that receives signals \nduring an animal\
    \ attack. Human-safe ultrasonic waves are \nproduced by this RNS which drives\
    \ the animals away. This \nproposal also consists of a farm management system\
    \ that \nreceives the report regarding the hazards caused in the fields. \nThis\
    \ system enabled timely data delivery, efficient multi-hop \ncommunication, dependable\
    \ data transmission, and low-cost \ntechnology. Chun-Ting et al., [73] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-\nbased agricultural traceability service platform for tamper-\n\
    proof data storing and backup. The system design consists of \nData collecting\
    \ layer where IoT sensors collect environmen-\ntal data, the blockchain layer\
    \ takes data from the formal layer \nand sends them to blockchain nodes and later\
    \ to blocks, and \nthe application layer handles the requests to access transac-\n\
    tion data based on the transaction hash. Hegde et al., [81] \npresented different\
    \ ways of implementing blockchain with \nthe agricultural supply chain. With the\
    \ use of blockchain, the \nproducers can get data and income security, and keep\
    \ track \nof environmental changes that affect the crops. The trace-\nability\
    \ option provides clarity in any damage that occurred \nto the product and an\
    \ overall increase in efficiency can be \nachieved by producing only required\
    \ products hence reduc-\ning wastage. Peña et al., [89] presented a systematic\
    \ review \non blockchain in food supply chain management in Ecua-\ndor. According\
    \ to the review, most of the work was done in \nHyperledger composer, models for\
    \ business interactions and \nhuman interactions, Traceability, Security, and\
    \ Blockchain \nInformation.\nAdditionally, M. Kumarathunga, [57] after reviewing\
    \ \npresented the way to reduce transaction costs and improve \nfarmer’s involvement\
    \ in agricultural supply chains. To \nreduce transaction costs farmers can participate\
    \ in Infor-\nmation sharing, goal congruence, decision synchronization, \nincentive\
    \ alignment, resource sharing, collaborative commu-\nnication, joint knowledge\
    \ creation. Xu et al., [80] reviewed \nthe working principle of blockchain technology\
    \ in the agri-\nfood sector. Blockchain technology provided data transpar-\nency,\
    \ data traceability, food safety, and quality monitoring, \nand agriculture finance.\
    \ Additionally, food safety and qual-\nity can be secured by digitizing products.\
    \ According to the \nreview, blockchain revealed a better approach to the future\
    \ \nof the agri-food supply chain which is safer, healthier, sus-\ntainable, and\
    \ reliable. Mirabelli and Solina, [71] collected \nand analyzed the applications\
    \ of blockchain technology and \nits contribution to agricultural food traceability\
    \ issues. The \nreview showed that the usability of blockchain technol-\nogy in\
    \ the agricultural sector was still in the early stage. \nThe review highlighted\
    \ three main aspects namely starting \nproblem, area of interest, and contribution.\
    \ Blockchain can \nbe a valid way to minimize fraud and errors in agricultural\
    \ \nsupply chains by increasing the quality and safety of food \nproducts. Shahid\
    \ et al., [53] have proposed a complete solu-\ntion to the blockchain-based agricultural\
    \ and food supply \nchain. The paper aimed to provide an end-to-end solution \n\
    to the growing blockchain-based agri-food supply chains. \nFurther, it achieved\
    \ the following properties: accountability, \ncredibility, auditability, autonomy,\
    \ and authenticity. The sys-\ntem also acted as a better alternative to the existing\
    \ supply \nchain system by enabling a scalable and auditable system. \nAwan et al.,\
    \ [79] proposed a smart agricultural model as a \ntransformation to the traditional\
    \ agricultural supply chain. \nThe system consists of Seed seller, Farmer, Crop\
    \ buyer, \nProcessor, Crop storage, Distributor, Retailer, Customer. \nTo improve\
    \ the food supply chain’s productivity and reli-\nability the smart model was\
    \ proposed. The model allowed \nfarmers to enter and monitor the data in the plant.\
    \ The main \nobjective of this model was to provide equal opportunities to \n\
    the participants of the agricultural food supply chain. The-\njaswini and Ranjitha,\
    \ [64] proposed a model that explores \nthe problems faced by people in agriculture\
    \ production and \nits solutions based on blockchain technology. Blockchain \n\
    solutions for traceability of crops, disclosure of data, clarity \nin food production,\
    \ and authentic agricultural products was \nproposed by the author. This proposed\
    \ model ensured food \nsafety, benefitted farmers, and stakeholders.\nYadav et al.,\
    \ [67] reviewed the blockchain adoption bar-\nriers in the Indian agricultural\
    \ supply chain. The barriers \ncan be enumerated as Lack of proper government\
    \ regulation \nand regularity uncertainty, Huge resource, and initial capital\
    \ \nrequirement, security and privacy concerns, lack of interop-\nerability and\
    \ standardization, etc. Further, the barriers were \nmodeled using an integrated\
    \ ISM-DEMATEL approach \nwhich provided limited interpretative logic. W. Lin,\
    \ [59] \nprovided a survey to study the techniques and applications \nof blockchain\
    \ technology. The application categories of \nblockchain in agriculture are Provenance\
    \ traceability and \nfood authentication, smart farming data management, trade\
    \ \nfinance in the supply chain management, and other informa-\ntion management\
    \ systems. The paper also indicated possible \nfuture developments and applications\
    \ of blockchain. Dutta \net al., [61] reviewed articles related to blockchain\
    \ technol-\nogy’s integration with various supply chain operations. The \nbenefits\
    \ of Blockchain in supply chains can be enumer-\nated as Data management, Improvement\
    \ in transparency, \n2444\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nImprovement in response\
    \ time smart contract management, \nOperational efficiency, and Disintermediation,\

    \ the main supply chain functions were identified \nas supply chain provenance,\
    \ supply chain resilience, supply \nchain re-engineering, security enhancement,\
    \ business pro-\ncess management, and product management. The work also \nexamined\
    \ various challenges and impacts of blockchain in \nthe supply chain. Shahid et al.,\
    \ [77] proposed a solution for \na blockchain-based reputation system in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfood supply chain. The system model consisted of invoking \nsmart contracts\
    \ to provide reviews based on the services to \nthe providers. The reviews are\
    \ requested by buyers and the \nsellers’ review the transactions and perform other\
    \ transac-\ntions based on that. The system was proposed to maintain \nthe immutability\
    \ and integrity of the registered review. \nTorky and Hassanein, [82] presented\
    \ a comprehensive sur-\nvey on IoT and blockchain and their importance in devel-\n\
    oping smart applications. According to the review, crops \noverseeing, livestock\
    \ grazing, and food supply chain are a \nfew subsectors in precision agriculture\
    \ managed by block-\nchain platforms. Apart from that, a novel blockchain model\
    \ \nwas also proposed to use as an important solution for major \nchallenges in\
    \ IoT-based precision agricultural systems. The \nobjectives of Skender and Zaninović,\
    \ [74] in their paper \nwere to analyze blockchain technology’s overall perspec-\n\
    tive, investigate its potential in a sustainable supply chain \nto replace the\
    \ shortcomings in the traditional supply chain. \nThe traceability and transparency\
    \ in the agricultural supply \nchain can be improved with blockchain.\nTo better\
    \ understand the benefits and challenges and the \nperspective for sustainable\
    \ blockchain, the author provided \na conceptual framework. Borah et al., [68]\
    \ proposed a novel \nblockchain-based Farmer and Rely called FARMAR. The \nsystem\
    \ could provide fair prices and reduce duping by mid-\ndlemen. The assets can\
    \ be traced from farmers to consumers, \nreducing the artificial inflation of\
    \ prices. Ferrag et al., (2020) \n[76] reviewed the research challenges on IoT-based\
    \ agricul-\nture and its security and privacy issues. The rest of the paper \n\
    identified threat models against green IoT-based agriculture \nanalyzed the privacy-oriented\
    \ blockchain-based solutions \nand consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture.\
    \ \nEnescu and Ionescu, [52] proposed a model for farmers in \nthe agri-food sector\
    \ using blockchain. This system ensures a \ncredible supply chain for producers\
    \ and consumers, guaran-\nteed timely payments between the participants. The authors\
    \ \nproposed this system to provide transparency, security, and \ntrust in the\
    \ trading process. Chaudhari et al., [90] proposed \na framework for a secure\
    \ and transparent supply chain with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With\
    \ the help of this sys-\ntem, the farmers can get a fair price for their products.\
    \ This \ntransparent and tamper-proof supply chain system generates \na bill at\
    \ the end including the commissioning price as well as \nthe total price after\
    \ sold product hence benefiting the farm-\ners in knowing the selling and market\
    \ price. Xie et al., [91] \nproposed to construct a traceability framework For\
    \ fresh \nE-commerce agricultural product quality and safety based \non blockchain\
    \ technology. To access the key control points \nthe author used the FMECA (failure\
    \ model effect and key \nanalysis) to analyze the failure mode, impact, and hazards\
    \ \nin the traceability chain. This system can promote agricul-\ntural development\
    \ through decentralization, consensus trust, \nmaintenance, and reliable database\
    \ features.\nFurthermore, Li et al., [92] proposed a blockchain-based \nTraceability\
    \ of the fresh food supply chain With the help of \nbusiness process reengineering\
    \ (BPR). The overall traceabil-\nity architecture is based on key links’ product\
    \ quality data \nand participants’ transactions. The objective of this trace-\n\
    ability system was to ensure data integrity. Flores et al., [93] \nproposed a\
    \ model for decentralization of data and provide \ntraceability of agricultural\
    \ products with blockchain tech-\nnology. Using this method could guarantee transparency\
    \ of \nthe supply chain and other operations as well as the transac-\ntions involved.\
    \ Fernandez et al., [94] proposed a Blockchain-\nbased model to improve farmer’s\
    \ profits. The author aimed \nto improve the output primitives of the supply chain.\
    \ Farmer-\nto-consumer product tracking and cost were the main factors \nin improving\
    \ traceability in the supply chain. Cortez-Zaga \net al., [95] proposed a model\
    \ used in the Peruvian agricul-\ntural sector using blockchain. When using blockchain\
    \ it can \neliminate dependence on a central entity, provides integrity \nof the\
    \ process, transactions become irrevocable, secure, \nand private, and provides\
    \ transparency and immutability. \nG. Zhao, [96] presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that \nexplored the advances in the agri-food supply chain. The \npaper\
    \ also pointed out the challenge of the applications of \nblockchain technology\
    \ enumerated as storage capacity and \nscalability, privacy leakage, high-cost\
    \ problem, regulation \nproblem, throughput and latency issues, and lack of skills.\n\
    Land record maintenance using blockchain was also \nproposed by Bhorshetti et al.,\
    \ for easy maintenance of land \nrecords in real-time. The database proved to\
    \ be a non-failure \nsystem and the work provided intermediary-less land title\
    \ \ntransfer and processing between owners. This system pro-\nvided security,\
    \ transparency, and a broker-free land man-\nagement system [97]. The paper by\
    \ Thakur et al. presented \nthe issues related to land records maintenance, registration,\
    \ \nsettlements, and banks. The system ensured better land man-\nagement, lesser\
    \ fraudulent transactions while strengthening \nthe sustainable development goals\
    \ (SDG) and increasing the \nGDP of the country [98].\n4.1.2  Agriculture Security\
    \ System\nTse et al., [102] proposed food supply information security \nbased\
    \ on blockchain technology. The use of blockchain in \n2445\nA Systematic Literature\
    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nthis system can regain\
    \ the people’s trust in the food mar-\nket, the government can collect statistics\
    \ on various kinds \nof food, and adulterated and fake food in the market can\
    \ \nbe eliminated. This type of technology can benefit the cus-\ntomer, manufacturers,\
    \ and supervision departments of the \nfood supply chain. Wu and Tsai, [103] proposed\
    \ an intel-\nligent agriculture network security system by applying dark \nweb\
    \ technology to monitor packet transmission frequency in \norder to prevent DDOS\
    \ attacks. The system applied a dark-\nnet mechanism to identify anyone who attempts\
    \ to access \nblockchain data. It also incorporated IoT sensors to gather \ndata\
    \ regarding temperature, humidity, and soil. This model \nwas proposed to keep\
    \ track of the farms and cultivation fac-\ntors related to an environment and\
    \ to establish network secu-\nrity for IoT networks.\n4.1.3  Organic Farming\n\
    Reddy and Kumar, [101] presented the article based on the \nsustainability of\
    \ the food supply chain. The author's objec-\ntive was to achieve Fair Trading\
    \ and a circular economy with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With this framework,\
    \ the \nfollowing results but achieved: Automatic hashing for less \nelectricity\
    \ consumption, product malfunctioning and add \nalteration, the involvement of\
    \ middlemen, availability of \nfarming jobs, and facilitating development and\
    \ unity among \nfarmers. According to Basnayake and Rajapakse, [104], the \npurpose\
    \ of the research was to implement a Blockchain-\nbased solution to verify food\
    \ quality. The process included \nFarmers issuing a product contract to control\
    \ the quality of \neach product. For each deployment of the product contract,\
    \ \nit would return an address that was used to generate the QR \ncode to identify\
    \ the physical product. Lastly, Consumers \nwere also eligible to rate the product\
    \ quality to ensure trust.\n4.1.4  Smart Agriculture\nTo overcome remote monitoring\
    \ challenges and provide \nsecurity and privacy in agriculture, Patil et al.,\
    \ [105] pro-\nposed a lightweight architecture for smart greenhouse farm-\ning.\
    \ The model consisted of four groups showing the integra-\ntion of blockchain\
    \ with IoT namely (1) smart greenhouse, (2) \noverlay network, (3) Cloud storage,\
    \ and (4) End-user. This \nmodel can be used to successfully monitor the secure\
    \ trans-\nmission of greenhouse data. Umamaheshwari et al., [106] \nproposed a\
    \ model for Buying and selling crops and land. \nThe model used Ethers as a cryptocurrency.\
    \ According to \nthe paper, the recordkeeping of crops grown in the land was \n\
    useful to know the history of plantations in the land. With \nthe help of this\
    \ model, users were able to access real-time \ndata about crops, eliminate the\
    \ need for middlemen, and \nestablish a transparent and efficient system. Voutos\
    \ et al., \n[107] proposed the integration of IoT and smart contracts \nto develop\
    \ smart agriculture to deliver higher quality agri-\ncultural products. It also\
    \ focuses on improving the associ-\nated supply chain and logistics benefiting\
    \ the participants \ninvolved. The author discussed the factors of smart agri-\n\
    culture as soil factors, climate, sensors, research, supply \nchain, storage,\
    \ analytics, and smart contracts. Miloudi et al., \n[100] proposed IoT, Blockchain,\
    \ and Geospatial technology-\nbased Smart farming to manage the farming practices\
    \ more \nsmartly and sustainably. The system proposed smart farming \nmanagement\
    \ in 4 stages namely (1) Integrated blockchain \nwith IoT platform where various\
    \ IoT sensors apply analytics \nand sends data to the blockchain, (2) Blockchain\
    \ Working \nMethodology where data visibility is provided through smart \ncontracts,\
    \ (3) Integrating GIS with blockchain where the \ndata sent from IoT sensors are\
    \ improvised and accuracy is \nfacilitated through GIS geospatial tools, and (4)\
    \ certifying \nfarmers in blockchain stage facilitates authorities and privi-\n\
    leges to the farmers through smart contracts which could \ngreatly benefit farmers\
    \ and food production industry.\nFurthermore, Devi Et al., [108] Proposed a design\
    \ archi-\ntecture by merging IoT and BC for smart agriculture. The \nnodes involved\
    \ in the blockchain received the information \nfrom the sensors that were connected\
    \ to the things involved \nin the Smart Agriculture monitoring process. The design\
    \ \narchitecture enhanced the security and data transparency \nperformance of\
    \ smart agriculture. Vangala et al., [109] \nreviewed blockchain technology and\
    \ its information security \nschemes. The application areas covered by the authors\
    \ were \nagriculture monitoring, controlled agriculture/smart green-\nhouses,\
    \ food supply chain tracking, and precision farming/\nsmart farming. The review\
    \ also presented a thorough analy-\nsis of the security attributes, application\
    \ areas, advantages, \ndrawbacks, and competing schemes’ cost of computation \n\
    and communication. Branco et al., [110] proposed a con-\nceptual approach with\
    \ the integration of IoT and blockchain \nfor a mushroom farm distribution process\
    \ control system. \nThe proposed system allowed the collection of distributed\
    \ \ndata on the environmental factors contributing to mushroom \nproduction providing\
    \ collection, storage, and processing of \nmushroom farm data to be scalable,\
    \ immutable, transparent, \nauditable, and secure.\n4.1.5  Dairy Farming\nMisra\
    \ and Das, [111] presented a conceptual framework \nusing blockchain to bring\
    \ feasibility and efficiency in \nE-governance. The architecture consisted of\
    \ a service-\noriented architecture framework to store details of stake-\nholders\
    \ involved in user services on demand, a blockchain \narchitecture that would\
    \ allow stakeholders to authenticate \nand perform transactions on the ledger,\
    \ and digital identity \narchitecture to act as a regulator in the architecture.\
    \ With \na dairy farmer as a user or participant in the architecture \n2446\n\
    \ \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nwho would benefit from the transactions while\
    \ having vot-\ning rights and leadership entities in the system the author \n\
    conceptually explored the prototype of the dairy coopera-\ntive sector in India.\
    \ Similarly, Rambim and Awuor, [112] \nproposed a model for dairy farmers in Kenya\
    \ that explores \nthe potential use of blockchain technology in milk delivery\
    \ \nin rural areas. From the Naitiri Dairy farmers’ cooperative \n(NADAFA) in\
    \ Kenya, the author introduced a Milk Deliv-\nery Blockchain Manager (MDBM) which\
    \ is a decentralized \nplatform to automatically capture the quantity and quality\
    \ \nof milk delivered by the farmers. The delivery data stored \nin the blockchain\
    \ is immutable, cryptographically hashed, \nand digitally signed. The details\
    \ of delivery are accessible \nto the farmers. The NADAFA facilitates the system\
    \ and pro-\nvides payment to the dairy farmers on time. The consortium-\nbased\
    \ network provides leveraging blockchain solutions for \nfarmers.\n4.1.6  Livestock\n\
    Under Livestock monitoring, Alonso et al., [113] worked on \nimportant trends\
    \ in the applications of IoT and edge comput-\ning paradigms in the smart farming\
    \ field. This helps produc-\ners to optimize processes, provides the origin of\
    \ the product, \nand guarantees the quality to its consumers. The state of \n\
    dairy cattle and feed grain can be monitored in real-time by \nusing artificial\
    \ intelligence and blockchain technology. This \nis to ensure the traceability\
    \ and sustainability of different \nprocesses of farming. The implementation of\
    \ smart farm-\ning contributed to the reduction of data traffic and reliable \n\
    communications between IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. \nAccording to Hang et al.,\
    \ [114], the uncertain data qual-\nity of analysts’ data can be solved through\
    \ blockchain. The \nproposed structure brings scalability, off-chain storage,\
    \ pri-\nvacy, and high throughput as advancement to the previous \nversion. Various\
    \ IoT data is fetched from fish farms such \nas temperature, water level, oxygen,\
    \ and PH data. The data \nstorage can be a database or cloud and end-user can\
    \ view \nthe fish farm’s detailed information through smart devices. \nLeme et al.,\
    \ [147] proposed a novel infrastructure based on \nthe integration of cloud storage\
    \ and blockchain technology \nto monitor the overall health of livestock. The\
    \ components \nof the architecture can be named as (1) Administrator, (2) \nUsers,\
    \ (3) Cloud service, and (4) blockchain network. With \nthe help of RFID tags\
    \ attached to the cattle, various entities \ncan be monitored to ensure that cattle\
    \ go through necessary \nprocedures. Yang et al., [115] proposed a novel method\
    \ to \nensure traceability and authenticity in the livestock supply \nchain using\
    \ blockchain. The model uses RFID-sensor-based \nlivestock monitoring in the food\
    \ industry where the sen-\nsors augment the physical tracking and solved the RFID’s\
    \ \ninherent computational capacity limitation by using cloud \nservices. The\
    \ data is then made accessible to the end con-\nsumer through Block chain’s transparent\
    \ ledger.\n4.1.7  E‑Agriculture\nThe analysis proposed by Li et al., [116] Investigated\
    \ the \nconvenience of sustainable electronic agriculture based on \nBlockchain\
    \ technology and analyzed the application likeli-\nhood and challenges of Blockchain\
    \ in the agricultural field. \nThe authors selected 5 villages with similar development\
    \ \nrates in china and Blockchain technology was applied using \ndata statistics\
    \ to the sustainable e-agriculture for exploring \nits convenience. Results showed\
    \ that sustainable electronic \nagriculture based on Blockchain Technology brought\
    \ great \nconvenience to the farmer’s sales, increasing by 25% on \naverage compared\
    \ with traditional electronic agriculture. \nSong et al. [117], to improve the\
    \ biased point of view, higher \ninitial costs, and lack of transparency and trust\
    \ proposed a \nsystem for providing sustainability in the current agri-food \n\
    supply chain. The paper discussed blockchain adoption in \nrural areas and relative\
    \ energy consumption from supply and \ndemand perspectives.\n4.1.8  Agriculture\
    \ Monitoring\nArshad et al., [99] proposed a private blockchain-based \nsecure\
    \ access control for agriculture to monitor climatic \nparameters. Private Blockchain\
    \ access control (PBAC) was \nused to guarantee secure communications where a\
    \ user usu-\nally goes through initialization, authentication, and revo-\ncation.\
    \ The farms monitoring system consists of the login \nphase, system setup phase,\
    \ user/farm professional registra-\ntion phase, password authentication and session\
    \ key agree-\nment phase, update or change phase, and addition of node \nphase.\
    \ The whole system stores access records and lessen \nthe computational and communication\
    \ overhead. Forbye, \nN. Bore, [118] proposed a model to improve the shortcom-\n\
    ings of existing digitized farming models through the AG-\nWallet System (AGWS).\
    \ The AGWS design consisted of (1) \ndigitizing the far demand–supply, (2) The\
    \ farm information \npipeline was to ensure secure storage and validate events\
    \ \nreceived from IoT, and (3) data analytic services that make \nthe information\
    \ visible to the participants. The system pro-\nposed by Osmanoglu et al., [119]\
    \ uses a blockchain-based \nyield estimation solution. Farmers can share the farming\
    \ \nplans for the upcoming harvesting season with other par-\nticipants, or learn\
    \ from other’s plans to review their plans. \nSmart contracts can be employed\
    \ by participants to share \ntheir yield commitments. The author improvised a\
    \ censor-\nship-resistant, tamper-proof, and immutable public ledger of \ntime-stamped\
    \ transactions.\n2447\nA Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain Technology\
    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n4.1.9  Farmers\nTalreja et al., (2020) [121] proposed\
    \ a farmer’s portal with \nthe help of blockchain technology and python to preserve\
    \ the \ncontract of trade between farmers and consumers. The farm-\ner’s portal\
    \ is a way to access farm activities. The proposed \nwork enhanced the degree\
    \ of participation, reduced inter-\nmediary cost, simplified process, provided\
    \ ease of selling \ncrops, and greater efficiency. The immutability of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology fortified farmers for getting a fair price for their \ncrops and\
    \ reduced operational costs. Abraham and Kumar, \n[120] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ data security system to \npreserve farmer’s data. The proposed work was based\
    \ on a \nprivate-permissioned blockchain for controlled participation, \nhyper\
    \ ledger fabric to support smart contracts, and system \ndesign to safely store\
    \ farm data. The widened blockchain \ndata helps farmer’s data to be accessed\
    \ by other participants \nwhich can allow the government to sanction schemes based\
    \ \non farmer’s data. Topart et al., [122] proposed an interoper-\nable ecosystem\
    \ of farmer’s consent management. The model \nused a permissioned blockchain to\
    \ allow only a specific \ngroup of people to access the services. The immutability\
    \ of \nconsent allows the data to be non-manipulative, distributed, \nsigned transactions,\
    \ and transparent. The consent verifica-\ntion for each data allows only valid\
    \ users to request data. \nThe model was proposed to respect the privacy, security,\
    \ \ntransparency, and consent of the farmer’s data.\n4.1.10  Incentivization\n\
    Blockchain has been using incentive mechanisms since bit-\ncoin to incentivize\
    \ miners, but recently many authors have \npresented ways of promoting work for\
    \ a reward. Incentives \nto promote sustainable agricultural practices by Giaffreda\
    \ \net al., [123]. Objectives include savings and increasing \nmarket value plus\
    \ monitoring the use of water in the fields. \nFarmers have been relying on satellite\
    \ data as it is a cheap \nsource of agricultural services. With the use of LPWAN\
    \ net-\nworks, accuracy in fields is increased along with a tensiom-\neter-a sensing\
    \ unit that is used to wirelessly communicate \nthe data related to the humidity\
    \ of the soil and a mini-meteo \nstation that is used to measure temperature,\
    \ air humidity, and \nair pressure. Smart contracts record the transactions from\
    \ the \ncalculated results in the cloud and release the incentives to \nthe farmer\
    \ according to their deal with the stakeholder. The \nproposal includes EnvCoins\
    \ as the incentives, which can be \nfurther used to buy technologies for sustainable\
    \ agricultural \npractices, for cash, or investment. Esmaeilian et al., [124]\
    \ \nproposed an incentive mechanism for green behavior such \nas waste disposal,\
    \ using re-furbished products, purchasing \nenergy-efficient products, saving\
    \ energy, recover, repair, \nand maintain. The tokens gained from sustainable\
    \ behav-\nior can be further used to access services on blockchain. \nIncentivization\
    \ can ameliorate some of the environmental \nissues in rural areas with the help\
    \ of rural people by moti-\nvating them to clean the areas. OpenLitterMap by S.\
    \ Lynch, \n[125] uses geospatial analysis to geotag various types of \nlitter.\
    \ It uses LitterCoins as an incentive mechanism for the \nproof of work. This\
    \ is to motivate people to submit correct \ndata. It also rewards for uploading\
    \ litter images from a new \nlocation. Apart from plastic and other homogenous\
    \ litter, a \nproposal to eliminate solid waste from small municipalities \nin\
    \ return for a reward is given by França et al., [148]. The \nprovision was to\
    \ change the original system from attack risk, \ndata loss, power outage, and\
    \ other such problems. The new \ndigitized system proves to be a handier as it\
    \ is in the form of \na mobile application. The reward for selling solid waste\
    \ to \nthe collecting agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocurrency sent \nto the\
    \ seller’s virtual wallet. This initiative led to comput-\nerization gains, information\
    \ integrity, and the use of crypto-\ncurrency. Additionally, in [128] D. Zhang,\
    \ worked on a simi-\nlar solution to efficiently use rural waste in incentivizing\
    \ \nrural people. The process includes the installation of smart \nbins and when\
    \ they are full, the collection trucks will swap \nthe waste for a digital coupon\
    \ which the farmer can use to \neither get agricultural products from the waste\
    \ to the energy \nplant or cash them. Blockchain makes it an easier process to\
    \ \ntransfer and record data faster with maximum transparency. \nOther applications\
    \ of incentives for waste include Recereum, \nSwachhCoin, Plastic Bank, 4New,\
    \ and OILSC [129].\nThe motivational incentive mechanism can also transform \n\
    the way medical data is shared for research and diagnosis. In \nthe paper by Zhu\
    \ et al., [126], the authors gave a solution to \nactuate people into sharing\
    \ medical data by providing them \nrewards for doing so. The rewards system is\
    \ based on the \naccess provided by the owner of the medical file. Through \n\
    Smart contracts, a trusted payment money flow can be \ndevised between the third\
    \ party and the owner. The Shapley \nvalue was considered for the revenue distribution\
    \ of medi-\ncal data sharing and to study the impact of consensus on \nthe miner’s\
    \ income. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism \nfor the accident alert system,\
    \ proposed by Devi and Pamila, \n[127] is another blockchain-based medical application.\
    \ \nAccording to the authors, most of the accidents occurs near \nrural places\
    \ where medical help is unreachable on time. To \neliminate the privacy issue\
    \ of the nearby user who receives \nthe accident report, a blockchain-based incentive\
    \ method \nis implemented for the user who receives the accident alert \nto send\
    \ the location of the victim to a close-by emergency \nservice. Then the message\
    \ initiator gets rewarded incen-\ntives for alerting about the accident. A similar\
    \ report system \nmobile application for anonymous reporting is proposed by \n\
    Zou et al., [130] in which reporting any incident can earn \npeople rewards. The\
    \ design goal of the author was to imple-\nment an anonymous report system, to\
    \ provide privacy to the \nperson who reports, without having to give their personal\
    \ \n2448\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\ninformation to the system. This model\
    \ induces incentive \nnamed Rcoins to whoever published the report information,\
    \ \nthe repliers, and the consenting miners. The Blockchain and \nKudos by Sharples\
    \ and Dominigue, [131], a reward-based \npermanent solution as the digital record-keeping\
    \ model. The \nauthor proposed the use of blockchain to store digital certifi-\n\
    cates, achievements, and credits. Stored as a public record \nit can be accessed\
    \ by the institutions or the student online. \nThe model uses Kudos an educational\
    \ reputation currency \nas a reward. The reward can be earned through uploading\
    \ \ncertificates on the blockchain, passing a test, or on course \ncompletion.\
    \ Another application of blockchain-based incen-\ntive system is EduCTX by Turkanović\
    \ et al., [132] which \nis proposed to globally enable the higher education credit\
    \ \nplatform. For potential stakeholders such as educational \ninstitutions, companies,\
    \ and organizations a unified view \nof student’s higher education credits and\
    \ grading system \nis placed on the global ledger through blockchain. ECTX \n\
    tokens will be credited based on the completion of courses \nwhich will act as\
    \ proof of completed courses.\n4.2  Environment\nIn the environment sector, the\
    \ most emphasis was given \non blockchain applications in Natural hazards, Water,\
    \ and \nWaste management in rural areas (Fig. 15). A detailed sum-\nmary is given\
    \ in Table 8.\n4.2.1  Waste Management\nFrom the articles proposed, in D. Zhang,\
    \ [128] the author \nworked on a similar solution to efficiently use rural waste\
    \ \nin incentivizing rural people. This framework is based on \nChina’s Yitong\
    \ system which is waste to energy plant for \nagricultural waste and the use of\
    \ blockchain to provide digi-\ntal coupons or cryptocurrency in return for waste.\
    \ The author \nproposed the use of a web application to use a QR code \nscanner\
    \ when the waste is collected from a smart bin, also \nencouraging segregation\
    \ of agricultural waste and residential \nwaste. The serves receive the weight\
    \ of waste, lodges it on \nthe global ledger, and the coupon is rewarded based\
    \ on the \nweight. Apart from plastic and other homogenous litter, a \nproposal\
    \ to eliminate solid waste from small municipali-\nties in return for a reward\
    \ is given by França et al., [148]. \nThe provision was to change the original\
    \ system from attack \nrisk, data loss, power outage, and other such problems.\
    \ The \nnew digitized system proves to be a handier as it is in the \nform of\
    \ a mobile application. The reward for selling solid \nwaste to the collecting\
    \ agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocur-\nrency sent to the seller’s virtual wallet.\
    \ This initiative led to \ncomputerization gains, information integrity, and the\
    \ use of \ncrypto-currency.\nLatif et al., [133] have addressed the smart waste\
    \ manage-\nment system with the integration of IoT and blockchain. The \nproposed\
    \ model included identification of waste material, \ntrace location, send to trash,\
    \ categorize waste, transfer waste, \nrecycling, and decision-making process.\
    \ The sensor nodes \nin the model were used for waste identification, and adding\
    \ \nnew blocks and the admin and waste management offices \nwere responsible for\
    \ collecting, executing recycling, and \ndelivering products. The recyclable wastes\
    \ are transformed \ninto useful products and share with the customers and send\
    \ \nthe non-recyclable wastes to the trash.\nFig.15  Blockchain applications \n\

    \ smart contracts execute the claims to the farm-\ners. Deployment of the system\
    \ can ensure water supply in \nrural areas and accessibility of insurance in case\
    \ of droughts \nor floods.\n4.2.3  Water Management\nThe intelligent smart watering\
    \ system proposed by Munir \net al., [135] is a blockchain-based system for the\
    \ smart \nconsumption of water. The system uses IoT for capturing \nreal-time\
    \ environment conditions such as soil moisture \nlevel, light intensity, air humidity,\
    \ and air temperature. The \nmain focus of the proposed system was to develop\
    \ a healthy \necosystem while efficiently using water in plantations and \ngardening.\
    \ Forbye, A water control system to efficiently \nmanage and coordinate the use\
    \ of water in irrigation com-\nmunities is proposed by Bordel et al., [136]. The\
    \ prosumer \nenvironment in the model is composed of a rule definition \nmodule\
    \ where users can create irrigation recipes using ECA \n(Event-Condition-Action)\
    \ rules. These rules are executable \nand easily transformed into other programming\
    \ languages. \nInputs are taken by a transformation engine, to create, com-\n\
    pile, and deploy a set of Smart Contracts coding all the irri-\ngation and management\
    \ logic. Finally, irrigation recipes are \nexecuted by an execution engine, which\
    \ invokes deployed \nSmart Contracts to interact with the infrastructure. From\
    \ \nthe perspective of Dogo et al., [137] proposed convergence \nof IoT and Blockchain.\
    \ Objectives of smart water solutions \ninclude smart measuring and monitoring\
    \ across the water \ndistribution, enhanced security, better analysis of the gener-\n\
    ated data, and enhanced revenue and efficiency.\nSimilarly, Hassija et al., [138]\
    \ proposed a drone-mounted \nbase station in the tactile internet environment\
    \ based on \nblockchain. The drone-mounted small cell station was based \non a\
    \ Permissioned peer-to-peer blockchain. To take strategic \ndecisions, a game\
    \ theory model was deployed. The deci-\nsion was based on user association; transmit\
    \ power level, \ndrone speed, and altitude. Additionally, smart contracts can\
    \ \nadd parameters and conditions based on requirements. The \nmodel’s results\
    \ showed that the low network areas can expe-\nrience better bandwidth with the\
    \ proposed system.\nFurther, the proposed model by Pincheira et al., [139] pre-\n\
    sented a trustless water management system-based software \narchitecture. The\
    \ system proposed presented a decentralized \nwater management system that could\
    \ incentivize virtuous \nbehavior in agricultural practices. Smart contracts were\
    \ used \nfor their intermediary-less characteristic. The authors also \nimplemented\
    \ a cross-platform software library to allow con-\nstrained devices to interact\
    \ with blockchain directly. The \nFig. 16  Blockchain applications \nin Smart\

    Enescu et al., [140] proposed a study on the use of photovol-\ntaic energy. The\
    \ paper showed the use of photovoltaic panels \nto power a power plant for the\
    \ improvement of abandoned \nland. According to the authors, photovoltaic panels\
    \ can eas-\nily pump water and is a more appropriate use of solar energy. \nBlockchain\
    \ can help reduce the intermediary distributors \nhence making the selling and\
    \ buying of energy more profit-\nable. Additionally, Kulkarni and Kulkarni, [141],\
    \ consider-\ning the lack of electricity in rural India, proposed a model to \n\
    solve rural electrification problems. The model introduces \npeer-to-peer energy\
    \ trading through blockchain suitable for \nsmall and remote micro-grids. A reliable\
    \ and profitable elec-\ntricity supply can be obtained through micro-grids. Smart\
    \ \ncontract-based meters allow transparency in the daily usage \nof energy used\

    4.3.2  Renewable Energy\nLevi-Oguike et al., [142] have presented the challenges\

    \ energy efficiency as an advancement to the sub-\nSaharan Africa environment.\
    \ In the case study performed \nby the authors, the following factors affected\
    \ its use to a \nlarge extent in sub-Saharan Africa: Employment and edu-\ncation,\
    \ displacement and resettlement, financing the tech-\nnology, regulatory provisions,\

    4.4  Banking\nIn the banking sector, most of the solutions were about \nissues\
    \ in banking availability in rural areas, loan sanctions \nto under-documented\
    \ people, and methods of transferring \nmoney (Fig. 17). A detailed summary is\
    \ given in Table 10.\n4.4.1  Loan\nGuo et al., [151] proposed a novel poverty\
    \ alleviation loan \nmanagement called the Loan On Blockchain (LoC). In the \n\
    LoC, the participating roles can be named as the Financial \ndepartment to check\
    \ the identity and application informa-\ntion of the participants, bank to provide\
    \ loan to the cus-\ntomer, Customer to provide identity and apply for loan, civil\
    \ \naffairs department to audit the customer identity and loan \napplications,\
    \ Regulator to monitor fund flow and inspect \nledger. This digital account model\
    \ was proposed for decen-\ntralized and centralized transfer of assets. Similarly,\
    \ Jain \net al., [152] presented a solution named Bit-score for credit \nscoring\
    \ for underprivileged (rural) people with the help of \nblockchain. The authors’\
    \ model used a self-sovereign model \nfor identity, distributed ledger storage,\
    \ credit score calcula-\ntion without any extra charges, and non-financial factor\
    \ for \nacquiring credit score. With bit-score being an improvisation \nover traditional\
    \ credit scoring techniques it makes the \ntransactions more transparent, decentralized,\
    \ secure, and \nintermediary-free.\n4.4.2  Mobile Money\nY. Hu, [150] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based digital payment \nsystem to deliver reliable services on\
    \ unreliable network \nservices in rural areas. The system management contract\
    \ \nto record account types, user balances to avoid forks dur-\ning disconnection\
    \ with the help of smart contracts. True \ntransparency can be obtained through\
    \ digitization and eco-\nnomic growth can be boosted in poor countries. Ghatpande\
    \ \net al., [149] proposed a way of moving Secure, interoperable \nmobile money\
    \ in sub-Saharan Africa (SIGMMA) to sup-\nport semi-offline payments through blockchain.\
    \ The model \nprovides unreachable areas a monetary transaction solution \nwithout\
    \ having to provide any identity proof while ensuring \ntrust between parties\
    \ along with not having to physically \nvisit any bank.\n4.4.3  Cash Transfer\n\
    Another proposal is to provide banking solutions to rural \nareas where a chit\
    \ fund system has been designed by Kumar \nand Sangal, [154]. Chit fund being\
    \ a traditional saving \nscheme in India is an easier way to have access to credit.\
    \ The \npurpose of this system is to remove geographical barriers \nFig. 18  Blockchain\

    \ Unlike other anonymous blockchain applica-\ntions, this system requires identity\
    \ registration. Unlike tradi-\ntional co-lateral systems, blockchain generates\
    \ credit history \nto prohibit manipulation. Lastly, Jaffer et al., [153] proposed\
    \ \na blockchain-based distributed system that is immutable and \nsecures the\
    \ transaction logs. The self-executing smart con-\ntracts were used to automatically\
    \ execute real-world con-\ntracts for auto disbursement of subsidies on meeting\
    \ spe-\ncific conditions. This system overcoming traditional cash \ntransfers,\
    \ and corruption and manipulation related to it can \nbenefit rural or deserving\
    \ people.\n4.5  Healthcare\nIn the healthcare sector, smart healthcare systems,\
    \ telemedi-\ncine, and privacy in medical data sharing to provide security \n\
    and transparency in the healthcare system between doctors \nand patients were\
    \ the commonly addressed areas in related \nwork (Fig. 18). A detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 11.\n4.5.1  Medical Data\nKaur et al., [157] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ electronic \nmedical record storage and management system. The pro-\nposed model\
    \ consisted of three main components: Domain \nexperts (doctors, lab technicians,\
    \ pharmacists, and drug \nmanufacturers), health insurance providers, and patients.\
    \ To \nensure the privacy of medical data which contains most of \nthe private\
    \ information blockchain distributed data storage \nfor heterogeneous data was\
    \ proposed having a single source \nfor data storage and access while providing\
    \ high security \nand privacy to the users and researchers. Similarly, Zhang \n\
    et al., [158] proposed secure and scalable clinical data shar-\ning using FHIR\
    \ Chain, a blockchain-based system meeting \nONC (office of the national coordinator\
    \ for health informa-\ntion technology) requirements. The technical requirements\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based clinical data sharing were verifying \nidentity and authenticating\
    \ all participants, Storing and \nexchanging data securely, consistent Permissioned\
    \ access \nto data sources, applying consistent data formats, maintain-\ning modularity.\
    \ FHIRChain facilitates clinical data exchange \nwhile maintaining ownership.\n\
    4.5.2  Telemedicine\nGuo et al., [161] proposed an ABE scheme to achieve \ndynamic\
    \ authentication and authorization with higher flex-\nibility and efficiency for\
    \ the Medical on Demand services \nin the telemedicine system. The system uses\
    \ a Consor-\ntium Blockchain managed by multiple authorities. Medi-\ncal examinations\
    \ are uploaded to the database provided \nby Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The\
    \ medical results are \ndownloadable from Cloud only by Medical specialists. All\
    \ \nthe data is stored in Blocks of Blockchain hence prevent-\ning any manipulation\
    \ in health records. Through this system \nindependence of choice should be provided\
    \ to the patient \nwhether they want to enroll, leave, or change access poli-\n\
    cies. Nusrat et al., [160] proposed a model of a telemedicine \nsystem for medical\
    \ care and security of data of rural people \nby using blockchain technology.\
    \ The system consisted of sta-\ntions for primary treatment tests while storing\
    \ data directly \nin the blockchain. This system ensured communication and \n\
    data privacy to doctors and patients while also giving reli-\nable medical care\
    \ and benefits to underserved (rural) people.\nForbye, Yong et al., [159] have\
    \ proposed a blockchain \nand machine learning system for vaccine supply chain\
    \ trace-\nability. The novel intelligent system based on the blockchain \ncan\
    \ be used for vaccine supervision in the vaccine supply \nchain. Additionally,\
    \ using smart contracts for the vaccine \nsupply chain can provide the following\
    \ advantages: detection \nof expired vaccines, vaccine information, and vaccine\
    \ coin.\n4.5.3  Smart Healthcare System\nMachine Learning holds the power to change\
    \ the perception \nof understanding and analyzing data and decision-making in\
    \ \nmultifarious sectors. Since, the blockchain with its decen-\ntralized network\
    \ focus on secure data sharing, its integration \nwith machine learning would\
    \ provide a very meticulous out-\ncome. Few of the ways through which blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with machine learning and benefit the healthcare system \nare\
    \ [162]:\n(a) Blockchain ledger with legitimate data collection can \nfeed the\
    \ machine learning models with highly accurate \nand dependable data.\n(b) Real\
    \ data can be used to train machine learning models \nto increase efficiency and\
    \ precision, therefore, saving \ncost and time.\n(c) Models can be trained to\
    \ give the same health advice \nto multiple patients with alike symptoms.\n(d)\
    \ Models can also be trained to give better clinical solu-\ntions to doctors based\
    \ on the patient’s symptoms.\n(e) Training the models on the patient history and\
    \ storing \nthem on blockchain ledger can predict outbreaks.\nFor implementing\
    \ the integration, Jain et al., [156] pro-\nposed an integrated model of blockchain\
    \ and machine learn-\ning to detect diseases. These models can be implemented\
    \ \nin a hospital or rural medical camps. The proposed system \nconsisted of IoT,\
    \ blockchain, cybersecurity, and machine \nlearning. Various components measure\
    \ basic parameters of \nthe human body such as weight, pulse, blood pressure,\
    \ and \nautomatically saved the data in the ledger. The system has \nthe potential\
    \ to expand medical parameters while making it \n2456\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\nadaptive. The complete system can collect, store, and ana-\nlyze the\
    \ data of the patient and benefit the doctors, patients, \nand medical institutions.\n\
    Similarly, Tripathi et al., [155] have proposed a safe and \nconvenient use of\
    \ medical data and its user through block-\nchain technology. The proposed work\
    \ is an improvement \non issues and challenges faced regarding security and pri-\n\
    vacy. The clinical data are recorded in the blockchain ledger \nwith access to\
    \ legitimate users only. For a doctor to access \na patient’s data a request has\
    \ to be made and only when \nthe patient approves the request does the data become\
    \ vis-\nible. The goal of this model is to provide secure and reliable \nservices\
    \ to insurance companies, drug supply chains, and \nmedical researchers. Lastly.\n\
    4.6  Employment\nThis application area mainly focused on employment vis-\nibility\
    \ and temporary employment for rural job security \n(Fig. 19). Therefore, the\
    \ following related research articles \nwere identified and a detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 12.\n4.6.1  Temporary Employment\nPinna and Ibba, [163] proposed\
    \ a decentralized employment \nsystem to process employment contracts with a fully\
    \ auto-\nmated and fast procedure. The model consists of a new job \noffer event\
    \ in which awaiting employers apply for jobs, an \napplication event where a smart\
    \ contract acquires the appli-\ncation request, a hiring event where the applicant\
    \ worker \nmeets the employer, a relationship event to enable the work-\ners to\
    \ check working situation and details, the workday event \nwhich describes the\
    \ maturation of workdays, a payment \nevent where the employee gets paid. The\
    \ transparent ledger \ncan make sure that the employment contracts were deployed\
    \ \nwith unchangeable information.\n4.6.2  Employment Visibility\nSimilarly, the\
    \ paper’s proposal by M. et al., [164] ensures \nsupply chain visibility to seamlessly\
    \ connect all stakeholders \nof the supply chain network who are a part of the\
    \ Blockchain \necosystem. The paper defined two modules in BC design: the \nSupply\
    \ module and the demand module. Supply module to \ncollect worker's data and smart\
    \ contracts to perform transac-\ntions through an application interface and store\
    \ them on the \nledger. Demand module to implement job allocation. The \naggregators\
    \ are given direct access to help track worker’s \ninformation from the ledger.\n\
    4.7  Existing Systematic Literature Reviews\nA tabular representation of a few\
    \ major existing works of \nblockchain in rural development has been done in Table 13.\
    \ \nThis table communicates the area of literature reviews, and \ntheir main contributions\
    \ in the review regarding blockchain \nin rural or agriculture.\nAn extensive\
    \ literature review was done in this section \nwhich portrayed the enormous amount\
    \ of work done in \nblockchain technology pertaining to rural development. All\
    \ \nthe functional areas and sub-areas were compared and dis-\ncussed in tabular\
    \ form. Multiple novel ideas and theories \nwere identified during the literature\
    \ review. At last, a small \ntabular representation was made for the existing\
    \ systematic \nliterature reviews and surveys in a similar area to identify the\
    \ \ndepth of the work done. In the upcoming sections, critical \nanalysis and\
    \ detailed discussion have been done based on \nthe literature study, followed\
    \ by the limitations of the survey \nand conclusion.\nFig. 19  Blockchain applications\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n5  Critical Analysis Existing Technologies \nand Discussion\n\
    Blockchain Technology possesses much competence and \nfuturistic hold towards\
    \ rural development. In this review, \nall possible applications of blockchain\
    \ that facilitated rural \ndevelopment were found, reviewed, compared, and summa-\n\
    rized. With Agriculture being the predominant application \nof blockchain, various\
    \ areas under it were analyzed that \nworked on the relief of agricultural issues\
    \ in rural areas.\nStarting with Supply chain traceability, the study showed \n\
    integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things \n[51, 54, 56, 58,\
    \ 63, 64, 69, 70, 73, 76, 82, 84, 85, 89, 100, \n145], Cloud computing [65, 87],\
    \ Big Data [87], and Geo-\nspatial Technology [100]. Among the papers discussed,\
    \ this \narea consisted of papers pertinent to tracing agricultural \nproduce\
    \ from the beginning of the process till it reached \nthe consumer. The range\
    \ of traceability options comprised \nall agricultural products as well as specifically\
    \ certain prod-\nucts such as soybean [60], grape wine [69], and cocoa beans \n\
    [62]. Furthermore, blockchain’s integration with IoT pro-\nvided sensing and sharing\
    \ of private data with blockchain \nwithout intermediary support. Additionally,\
    \ some proposed \nwork used QR codes [56, 60, 146] for viewing data directly \n\
    related to the attached product. Articles supporting IoT \ndevices were implemented\
    \ for tracing agricultural produce, \nencouraging circular economy, fault-tolerant,\
    \ and immutable \nAPIs. A few were reviews on agriculture traceability [53, \n\
    58, 60, 61] barriers [67], challenges [59, 71, 76] contribu-\ntion [80], IoT based\
    \ solutions, and future scopes [78, 96]. \nSome agricultural prototypes included\
    \ AgriBlockIoT [70], \nKHET [83], and FARMAR [68]. A few land record manage-\n\
    ment articles were also discussed that implied security and \nbroker-free methods\
    \ for land titling and transferring [97, 98]. \nMost of the platforms used were\
    \ Ethereum Smart Contracts, \nHyperledger, REST, JavaScript (Web3, node, angular),\
    \ Truf-\nfle Framework APIs, and MySQL and MongoDB for cloud \nstorage.\nWhile\
    \ traceability of agricultural produce is important, \nthe agriculture security\
    \ system is also a necessity. In this \nreview, the articles for agriculture security\
    \ systems included \nprevention of farm data from cyber-attacks using IoT [103]\
    \ \nand supervision of agricultural products and food informa-\ntion [102]. In\
    \ both the works acquired, it used Smart con-\ntracts and Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ respectively, along with \nIoT-based sensors for farm monitoring.\nOrganic Farming\
    \ as a part of agriculture application for \nsustainable farming and quality food\
    \ production included \ntwo articles for analyzing the effectiveness of supply\
    \ chain \n[101], and identifying product quality and transparency of \norganic\
    \ food supply chain using decentralized applications \nand QR codes for tracing\
    \ product data [104].\nTable 12  Comparison of blockchain applications in Employment\n\

    Furthermore, using smart methods to enhance the agri-\ncultural process was discusses\
    \ in the smart agriculture \nSect. 3.1.4 where farm controlling, recordkeeping,\
    \ improved \nlogistics, farm managing and improvising, and monitoring \nusing\
    \ Blockchain Technology and IoT [106–110] as well \nas cloud computing [105] and\
    \ geospatial technology [100] \nin some articles were covered. Most emphases were\
    \ given \ntowards improving the quality of farming and its man-\nagement while\
    \ providing utmost security to data. Mostly \nused platforms to implement the\
    \ proposed work were \nJavaScript(Node, Ganache, Truffle), Ethereum Smart Con-\n\
    tracts, and IoT-based sensors.\nApart from the supply chain in farming, the dairy\
    \ sector \nwas one of the application areas covered in the review com-\nprising\
    \ of E-governance in the dairy sector implemented on \nsmart contracts [111],\
    \ and quality and quantity assurance \nof milk with a delivery platform [112]\
    \ using Blockchain \nTechnology. In addition to the dairy sector, blockchain appli-\n\
    cations in livestock management using Blockchain Technol-\nogy [114], IoT and\
    \ Cloud Computing [113, 115, 147] to \nmonitor livestock, observe cattle using\
    \ RFID tags, storing \ndetailed information on fishes, along with livestock trace-\n\
    ability were discussed in the review. Integration with IoT \nprovided real-time\
    \ monitoring and traceability of livestock \nand its by-products in the supply\
    \ chain.\nSimilarly, to share informative farming data and tech-\nniques a review\
    \ on convenience analysis of the blockchain \nin agriculture [116], and exploratory\
    \ data planning and \nmanagement of agricultural food supply chain for sustain-\n\
    able development [117] was given to explore the work done \nin E-agriculture using\
    \ blockchain technology. Since one \nof the main motives towards implementing\
    \ blockchain in \nagriculture is to monitor the faring process and products \n\
    till it reaches the consumer, therefore, agriculture monitor-\ning section covered\
    \ farm monitoring system[99], a yield \nestimation system to share farming plans\
    \ implemented on \nsmart contracts [119], and an IoT based AG Wallet system to\
    \ \ntrack farm activity implemented using IBM enterprise block-\nchain platform\
    \ [118]. Penultimately, the application area was \ndivided into farmer Sect. 3.1.9\
    \ where blockchain’s reviews \nto facilitate farmers such as farmer’s portal to\
    \ capture farm \nactivities using HTML and Python [121], farmer’s data stor-\n\
    age to provide transparency for government scheme using \nsmart contracts [120],\
    \ and farmer’s data accessing using \ntheir consent [122] were discussed.\nLastly,\
    \ an overall blockchain application area covering the \nuse of incentives for\
    \ numerous activities was discussed in \nSect. 3.1.10. The review included a reward-based\
    \ system in \nreturn for solid waste [148], rural waste [128], anonymously \n\
    reporting an activity [130], reporting an accident [127], stor-\ning educational\
    \ records in ledger [132], green behavior [123, \n124], geotagging litters [125],\
    \ and to safely share medical \ndata [126]. The incentive mechanism works when\
    \ an activ-\nity is performed, therefore in return for good behaviors or \nactivity,\
    \ cryptocurrency-based tokens are rewarded that can \nbe stored in a blockchain\
    \ wallet. Most of the platforms used \nwere smart contracts while some of the\
    \ systems also used \nARK Blockchain, Laravel PHP, and JavaScript.\nLooking through\
    \ the applications of blockchain in rural \nareas, usage of blockchain in reinforcing\
    \ environmental \nconditions and changing people's outlook on preserving the \n\
    environment was the outcome of factors affecting rural peo-\nple as they were\
    \ much likely also related to environmental \nconditions. From this view, the\
    \ environmental application \nareas were discovered and discussed to be Water\
    \ manage-\nment, Waste management, and Natural hazards.\nTo begin with, under\
    \ Sect. 3.2.3 water management, \nsmart measuring and monitoring [137], smart\
    \ consump-\ntion [135], management [139], and control system [136] \nof water\

    \ system in return for waste collection and selling \n[128, 148], and waste management\
    \ [133] using Blockchain \nTechnology were discussed. Covered under the integration\
    \ \nof Blockchain Technology, Cloud Computing, and IoT, the \nimplementation used\
    \ smart contracts in the first two propos-\nals and UML, TLA + for the latter.\n\
    Lastly, as per the research criteria, only one article con-\ntributing to the\
    \ environment and natural hazards was dis-\ncovered and reviewed explaining the\
    \ insurance system for \ndrought-affected farms based on the farm data stored\
    \ in the \nblockchain ledger [134]. The model was implemented on \nNEO virtual\
    \ machine, smart contracts, and used Oracle \nserver as database.\nSimilarly,\
    \ from the challenges faced by rural people \nacquiring an electric line, energy-efficient\
    \ methods, to \nsecure, and transparent payments issues were covered and \nreviewed\
    \ under the energy section. The blockchain applica-\ntion areas in the energy\
    \ sector were discovered to be Renew-\nable energy and the Energy grid. With blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with renewable energy a smart contract-based energy \ntransfer\
    \ credibility system of biomass energy grid [143], \nand a case study of sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa and its challenges \nand adoption of renewable energy access were discussed\
    \ \n[142]. Whereas in the energy grid section, the blockchain’s \napplication\
    \ in providing peer-to-peer electrification with \nsecure payments, transparent\
    \ energy usage [144], and the \nuse of smart energy grids for farming and irrigation\
    \ using \nEthereum Blockchain [140] were reviewed.\nBesides, from the traditional\
    \ use of blockchain in Finance, \nthe banking solutions for rural people were\
    \ discussed in \nSect. 3.4. From the banking applications of blockchain, the \n\
    use of mobile money for semi-offline payments in sub-Saha-\nran Africa without\
    \ identity proof using a secure, interoper-\nable mobile money system [149], and\
    \ a delay-tolerant digital \npayment system based on Ethereum blockchain [150]\
    \ were \ndiscussed. A simpler way of getting a loan with the help \nof blockchain\
    \ is by using a hyper ledger fabric-based Loan \nOn Blockchain(LOC) system using\
    \ smart contracts [151], \nand a credit scoring system called Bit-score using\
    \ Ethereum \nBlockchain [152] were discussed. Finally, a Cash Transfer \narea\
    \ where a distributed system for automatic subsidy deliv-\nery and fund release\
    \ using JavaScript and Hyperledger com-\nposer [153], and a chit fund system based\
    \ on smart contracts \nto provide credit to rural people [154] were reviewed.\n\
    Under the Healthcare applications of blockchain, A Smart \nHealthcare System,\
    \ Medical Data sharing, and Telemedi-\ncine were the areas discovered. Under smart\
    \ healthcare, the \narticles reviewed were a smart model to detect diseases and\
    \ \nmeasure basic health parameters using Ethereum blockchain \nand Raspberry\
    \ Pi [156] and protected access to medical \ndata using smart contracts [155].\
    \ For the recordkeeping of \nmedical data and share it legitimately an electronic\
    \ medi-\ncal record storage management system based on ethereum \nand cloud storage\
    \ [157], and a permissioned clinical data \nsharing called FHIRChain using smart\
    \ contracts [158] was \nreviewed. Lastly, under Telemedicine, vaccine supervision\
    \ \nand traceability for safe vaccine supply [159], secure data \nstorage using\
    \ telemedicine system based on smart contracts \n[160], and a telemedicine system\
    \ to prevent health records \nmanipulation using Blockchain and Cloud Database\
    \ [161] \nwere the articles reviewed.\nAnother challenge faced by rural people\
    \ implemented to \nrecuperate from unemployment using blockchain technol-\nogy\
    \ was discussed in Sect. 3.6. Using smart contracts an \nemployment contracts\
    \ processing, handling, and safe pay-\nment system for temporary employment contracts\
    \ [163], and \na blockchain aggregator to perform worker data transactions \n\
    and employment visibility [164] were the works reviewed \nin this section.\n5.1\
    \  Limitations of Existing Works and Research \nGaps\nIn this section, the limitations\
    \ of the existing literature \nreview on blockchain in rural development along\
    \ with \na comparison of existing systematic literature reviews \nhave been discussed.\
    \ The comparison has been shown in \nTable 14, and a few research gaps have been\
    \ mentioned in \nthis section as well.\nWhile Blockchain technology is leading\
    \ in security and \ntransparency, providing ways of applying its technology in\
    \ \ndisparate areas its limitations and gaps can still be identi-\nfied in the\
    \ proposed and implemented work. While most \nof the work in agriculture is for\
    \ ensuring transparency and \ntraceability in the supply chain, there are far\
    \ more factors in \nagriculture that affect farmers and crops. Blockchain inevi-\n\
    tably uses excessive energy in execution, but its execution in \nrural areas may\
    \ become worrisome due to the lack of energy \nand load in those areas.\nCollecting\
    \ farm data and storing them on the ledger in \nsmall farms is easier. However,\
    \ in the case of big farms, the \ndata collection and integration may consume\
    \ much time and \nprobably manpower in accumulating and loading it in the \nledger.\
    \ Apart from that, IoT-based services require sensors \nas well as collecting\
    \ livestock DNA to trace them and load \ntheir information may cost a fortune\
    \ to small-scale farmers.\nTeaching the application usage to laymen, that too\
    \ unedu-\ncated farmers or rural people may become a troubling task. \nNot only\
    \ that, the availability of news of the latest technolo-\ngies is hardly accessible\
    \ to underdeveloped countries, intro-\nducing blockchain-based applications to\
    \ those areas may toil \nthe deployment and utilization.\n2460\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\nMistakes can prove disadvantageous to poor people\
    \ while \nmaking blockchain transactions. A lost private key or a mis-\ntakenly\
    \ added extra digit to the payment can cause irrevers-\nible damage.\nThereafter,\
    \ a data breach of medical data and inappro-\npriate access to medical histories\
    \ are some issues that may \ndecrease people’s trust in the blockchain-based healthcare\
    \ \nsystem for medical data privacy.\nSecurity threat is another limitation that\
    \ can affect any \ntype of application that requires recordkeeping. Here the \n\
    blockchain’s main characteristics may itself prove faulty to \nfind the intruder\
    \ as it gives total anonymity to users. With \nboth pros and cons, robust and\
    \ reliable technology can still \nbe deployed for many usages, making livability\
    \ easier and \npeople technologically advanced.\n5.2  Discussion\nMultiple issues\
    \ pertaining to rural areas have been addressed \nby authors with the help of\
    \ blockchain. Agriculture is the \nmost economic factor, solutions for blockchain-based\
    \ sup-\nply chain traceability provided secure, transparent, beneficial \nproduct\
    \ delivery. It also ensured timely payments to farm-\ners and quality products\
    \ to consumers. Banking solutions \nhave also been made easier with blockchain\
    \ technology, pro-\nviding remote banking solutions, credit and loan easiness,\
    \ \nand easy and transparent banking. Hygiene issues that led \nto many diseases,\
    \ generational disabilities have also been \ngiven a solution through blockchain\
    \ which also incentivizes \nrural people for participating in waste and water\
    \ manage-\nment. Rural electrification solutions were also proposed with \nblockchain\
    \ for people unable to obtain energy resources, \nbasic electrical amenities,\
    \ and expensive bills. People who \nwere unable to receive treatments, had to\
    \ travel long dis-\ntances for medical assistance, were also provided a block-\n\
    chain solution with which telemedicine, privacy to medical \ndata usage, and medical-on-demand\
    \ were made available. \nBlockchain has also been useful in providing employment\
    \ \nsolutions to the truly underserved, using a global chain \nfor employment\
    \ visibility, and secure payment for jobs \n[168–172].\nThe Systematic Literature\
    \ Review’s objective is to pro-\nvide information on the research proposed related\
    \ to block-\nchain in rural development to provide new research oppor-\ntunities,\
    \ extensive knowledge about each development area, \nand the possibility for future\
    \ development in rural areas. \nAfter distinctly reviewing every research article\
    \ variant areas \nof applications were identified relating to the development\
    \ of \nFig. 20  Blockchain Applications and their Areas in rural development\n\
    2462\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nrural areas with the help of Blockchain Technology.\
    \ Overall, \n6 disparate applications in rural development were picked \nout;\
    \ from which each of these applications has a total of 23 \ndivergent areas combined.\
    \ These areas contribute to all the \nresearch that has been done in the blockchain\
    \ in the rural \ndevelopment sector and are distributed across 37 countries \n\
    obtained from 6 journals and 1 web source ranging from \nthe years 2010 to 2020.\
    \ After searching through journals, \napplying more than 16 keywords, 112 articles\
    \ were found in \naggregate. From analyzing each article, the primary applica-\n\
    tion of blockchain was identified as agriculture with 67% of \nresearch articles\
    \ relative to blockchain in agriculture whence \n60% were associated with supply\
    \ chain traceability. About \n55% of those papers were from the Institute of Electrical\
    \ and \nElectronics Engineers (IEEE). Furthermore, in 112 research \npapers, 8\
    \ technologies were implemented with a total of 58 \nplatforms and tools combined.\n\
    5.3  Research Questions Addressed\nFrom the Research Questions defined (Table 3),\
    \ the follow-\ning inference can be made:\nRQ1 What are the main applications\
    \ and areas of imple-\nmenting Blockchain Technology in Rural Development?\nVarious\
    \ extensively researched applications are defined \nin Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\
    \ 11 and 12. These applications \ndefine the Blockchain’s applications in rural\
    \ development \nthat impact the rural areas, provide security, opportunities,\
    \ \navailability of resources, and a better lifestyle. The areas \n(Fig. 20) gave\
    \ extensive knowledge about the domains of \napplication-defined from several\
    \ research articles related to \nit.\nRQ2 What are the major issues in Rural Development\
    \ and \nhow they can be addressed using Blockchain Technology?\nNumerous issues\
    \ in rural areas are explained in Sect. 1.1.1 \nand the blockchain applications\
    \ for the eradication of those \nissues are addressed in Sect. 3.\nRQ3 What are\
    \ the targeted software, platforms, and tools \nfor the implementation of blockchain\
    \ in rural development?\nThroughout the applications, for implementation follow-\n\
    ing (Table 15) technologies’ integration, and software and \nplatforms were used:\n\
    RQ4.  What are the research gaps and future research direc-\ntions for applying\
    \ blockchain technology to rural \ndevelopment?\nFollowing the review, in agriculture,\
    \ most emphases were \nstated towards supply chain traceability and less or no\
    \ work \nin natural resource management, overproduction, yield stag-\nnation,\
    \ and international trade. In regards to the sociological \nfactor, research on\
    \ work belonging to blockchain develop-\nment for rural education, housing, women\
    \ empowerment, \ncrime reduction, brain drain, and craftsmanship is missing. \n\
    For the implementation of banking, healthcare, and many \nother applications the\
    \ required government and technologi-\ncal assist are still lacking. In some cases,\
    \ the research pro-\nposed could be administered only in the far future, therefore\
    \ \ncontemporary work was absent. Some more gaps and future \nresearch directions\
    \ are given in Sects. 4.2 and 6.1.\nThe research questions mentioned in Table \
    \ 3 are \naddressed in the following section (Table 16):\n6  Threat to Validity\
    \ and Limitation \nof the Survey\nWhile reviewing the issues in rural areas, blockchain\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n2.3. During exclusion, some articles were not considered\
    \ fit \nfor this review, were missed, or were not found. Six appli-\ncations were\
    \ considered in this review, there could be more \napplications that we couldn’t\
    \ figure or that couldn’t make the \ncut of criteria. A total of 23 sub-areas\
    \ of all the applications \nwere determined. Conclusively, as per our knowledge,\
    \ there \nwasn’t any systematic review that reviewed all the applica-\ntion areas\
    \ of blockchain technology in rural and sustainable \ndevelopment nevertheless\
    \ there could have been a few rural \nand sustainable development articles that\
    \ weren’t included \nin this review.\n7  Conclusion and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ Technology has presented a considerable amount \nof work in the rural sector.\
    \ While its implementation was \nfew, the ideology is enough to motivate people\
    \ into changing \nthe lifestyle of rural people leading to the overall country’s\
    \ \ndevelopment. In this systematic literature review, numerous \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology in sustainable rural \ndevelopment were discussed with\
    \ diverse areas in each \napplication. A comparative study of each application\
    \ in all \nthe areas pertaining to different approaches has been por-\ntrayed\
    \ with differing attributes elucidating the technology, \nprocess, and techniques\
    \ behind each article. The paper pro-\nvides extensive literature towards each\
    \ of the articles sorted \nafter applying the review process consisting of relevant\
    \ arti-\ncles and keywords. The primary findings of the systematic \nliterature\
    \ review were as follows:\n(a) From the review, we were able to identify common\
    \ and \nexceptional uses of blockchain technology that would \nhelp uplift the\
    \ rural community and lead to sustainable \nrural development.\n(b) Various distinct\
    \ approaches to implementing block-\nchain technology for rural welfare were discovered.\n\
    (c) Platforms and tools that would facilitate the use of these \napplications\
    \ for farmers and uninstructed agrestic peo-\nple were identified and reviewed.\n\
    (d) Blockchain’s integration with multiple powerful tech-\nnologies for rural\
    \ development was reviewed.\n(e) An overall idea for a collaborative approach\
    \ leading to \na smart village framework was constructed.\nThe gaps determined\
    \ from reviewing the articles broadly \nwould help researchers explore additional\
    \ as well as alter-\nnative utilization of blockchain technology for sustainable\
    \ \nrural development.\n7.1  Future Work\nBlockchain’s characteristics are exceptionally\
    \ conducive to \nsafety, privacy, integrity, traceability, efficiency, and trans-\n\
    parency in every area limited by such advantages. While \ndiverse blockchain applications\
    \ for the welfare of rural \ncommunity has been discussed nevertheless future\
    \ work \ncan comprise of facilitating applications in making use of \nblockchain\
    \ incentives for a collaborative framework incor-\nporating several services in\
    \ rural areas namely Smart Vil-\nlage. Blockchain technology in terms of providing\
    \ incentive \nmechanisms could lead to a better motivational unit in many \nareas.\
    \ Incentivizing rural or urban people for education, data \nsharing, green farming,\
    \ green behavior, and environment \nconservation are real future demands. Apart\
    \ from empha-\nsizing rural areas, blockchain’s integration with network-\ning,\
    \ cybersecurity, and digital advertising is also a future \ninsistence.\nFunding\

    Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in
    critical infrastructures, necessitates strict security and

    privacy standards. Owing to data proliferation, Cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely
    on computing platforms for the provision of services

    and resources. The futuristic “Beyond 5G” (B5G) enabled critical IoT infrastructures
    cannot run on centralized systems due to their

    security vulnerabilities that compromise the basic Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability
    (CIA) triad. Blockchain technology (BCT) is

    emerging as a key enabler in addressing IoT’s security challenges, and it is compliant
    with the Fog-IoT architecture. The Ethereum

    platform has ushered an unprecedented development in BCT by facilitating application
    development. Blockchain (BC) connects the

    users’ chain identity to the transactions associated with their tokenized digital
    assets and confers the ability to audit the system. The

    history of canonical transactions is recorded in an immutable fashion facilitating
    data tracking and deterrence of data repudiation. A

    Consensus mechanism (CM) governs the state transitions and the node behavior in
    building trust relationships between various entities

    in the absence of a central authority. Through Smart Contracts(SCs), distributed
    and trustworthy access control can be achieved for

    IoT systems besides enhancing automation. We argue that BCT adoption is inevitable
    in securing futuristic B5G enabled IoT critical

    infrastructures for ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control, authentication,
    communication, and data security. Various challenges

    are associated with their adoption, such as the rising cost of Ethereum and constraints
    in the IoT environment. To facilitate BC solutions

    for IoT security, the functionality of BCT must be complemented with other technologies
    such as Machine Learning (ML), Edge

    Computing (EC), and InterPlanetary Filesystem(IPFS).

    Keywords: Blockchain, IoT, Edge Computing, Consensus, Security, Privacy, Smart
    contracts, IPFS B5G, Access control.

    1. INTRODUCTION

    The industry is rapidly evolving into a holistic network

    of intelligent systems capable of making data-driven deci-

    sions. Many technologies have aided this transition, with

    IoT being at the core. IoT connects devices and couples

    them to the internet forming a CPS. IoT is at the center

    of intelligent applications in and outside the industry. IoT

    offers the remote control and monitoring of equipment

    and catalyzes data-driven automated decision and action-

    taking capabilities, resulting in increased system efficiency

    and throughput while lowering costs. IoT is causing a

    major upward shift in the revenue pool, and its growth

    can be assessed by the increase in the number of practical

    applications across regions.

    IoT enables a pervasive interconnection of virtual and

    physical objects for accelerated data sharing and collection.

    Sensing capabilities are embedded in intelligent devices

    such as smartphones, laptops, and fitness monitors, while

    intelligence is built into traditional sensors for extensive

    data monitoring. As per the Ericson report, by 2050, there

    will be 24 billion interconnected IoT devices [1]. The data

    streams are generated continuously with volumes reaching

    exabytes; thus, the data is referred to as IoT Big data. At

    present, Cloud Computing and Fog Computing are the most

    popular provisions to handle the high-end computing and

    storage demands of IoT big data [2].

    IoT aims to create intelligent, unified, fully distributed,

    secure, and cost-efficient systems. Reliable storage, data

    awareness, ease of access, scalability, and channel security

    are important parameters while adopting a wireless system.

    IoT systems come with inbuilt security measures that can

    be bypassed due to their intrinsic traits.Various factors are

    responsible for hindering the pace of IoT security. These

    include:

    1)

    Any end- end encryption technique employed to

    provide data security in networks is challenging to

    be embedded in IoT networks due to the constrained

    nature of the devices.

    2)

    IoT devices are lodged in uncontrollable, heteroge-

    neous, complex, open, untrustworthy environments,

    which magnify the attack space.

    3)

    Lack of standard architecture, a common address-

    ing scheme limits the integration and replication of

    security measures from other IoT systems.

    4)

    IoT is an ever-growing field, and the security features

    of constrained devices are not evolving at the same

    pace as the system itself.

    5)

    The adoption of computing platforms forces frequent

    transfer of data. Implementing robust cryptographic

    algorithms is expensive and increases the overall cost

    of the system.

    6)

    IoT systems communicate across different domains

    and require fine-grained Access control(AC) mecha-

    nisms for collaboration.

    Cloud and Fog platforms are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and

    fail to meet the demand for flexible cross-domain interop-

    erability across multiple systems with distributed resources.

    The Data Management (DM) systems are centralized and

    prone to hackers who can manipulate the database, thereby

    compromising data integrity. The overreliance on a central-

    ized database causes the “Single point failure” problem. The

    monetary transactions require the intermediation of a third

    party, which incurs verification costs and increases privacy

    concerns. These centralized architectures are prone to secu-

    rity threats that disorder the regular operation of systems.

    These include Denial of Services(DoS), Distributed Denial

    of Services(DDoS), Ransomware attacks, Eavesdropping,

    Side-channel attacks, Spoofing, Routing attacks, Man in the

    middle attack, SQL injection, and Phishing [3].

    With the advancement in B5G technology, IoT is set to

    transform the existing digital landscape, but its inadequate

    security features have limited its adoption. B5G mobile

    communication technologies aim to provide high-speed

    transmission network support and enormous access points

    to maximize IoT capabilities [4]. The security measures of

    such applications need enhanced security and efficient DM.

    BCT is emerging as a promising paradigm for bringing

    disruptions in IoT security and is highly compliant with

    the Fog-like system of architecture [5].

    BCT has created a paradigm shift by enabling trusted and

    anonymous transactions. BCT establishes trust between the

    communicating nodes, and the decision-making is based

    on CMs suitable in distributed environments. Owing to its

    unique propensities– Immutability, Transparency, Traceabil-

    ity, Resilience, and Encryption, the adoption of BCT is

    suitable for the realization of futuristic peer-peer, trustless

    applications. BCT supports tokenized assets, and the nodes

    in the network interact automatically without the interven-

    tion of any central authority. This increases the privacy of

    the network and eliminates the management cost.

    BCT is creating major reforms in IoT management and se-

    curity. The IoT transactions are encrypted and secured using

    digital signatures and cryptographic keys. BCT eliminates

    the security threats with a distributed CM and provides a

    Figure 1. Centralized Vs. BC-based IoT

    true system state upon which every legitimate user agrees.

    With the integration of BCT, IoT applications are becoming

    decentralized, transactions are trusted and anonymous, and

    cross-domain interaction is enhanced. The system security

    is increased through ownership records, encrypted trans-

    actions, distributed storage, consensus, and authentication

    mechanisms. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between a

    centralized and BC-based IoT system.

    There are multiple challenges concerning the BC integrated

    IoT systems, such as network complexity, limited band-

    width, computation capabilities, data diversity, scalability,

    and throughput. Conventional CMs consume huge amounts

    of resources to slow down the access rate of new blocks and

    protect the BC network from attacks, which is too expensive

    for resource-limited IoT devices. Further, the capacity of a

    new block is limited, and transactions per second (TPS)

    are usually limited to 20 to 30 TPS in Ethereum, rendering

    the system unable to respond to the influx of transactions

    [6]. With tradeoffs between adversity tolerance, latency,

    and energy consumption, research on IoT suitable CMs is

    growing.

    BC itself suffers from security and privacy issues. Imple-

    menting longer chains is challenging, and the SCs can prove

    to be a double-edged sword. The cost of Ethereum is rising

    continuously, making the storage and transactions expen-

    sive for large-scale adoption. The underlying technologies

    powering BCT consume high power and are not suitable for

    IoT. BCT can revolutionize IoT, but enabling technologies

    such as IPFS, ML and EC must be integrated with BC to

    outweigh its current limitations.

    IPFS is a distributed file system that can resolve BC

    –IoT big data problems. Instead of storing the data on

    the chain, IPFS hashes identifying the files are kept in

    the BC. The hash on the BC assures that the file has not

    been tampered with. File hashes can be used to link files

    to their owners and access rights.Solving complex puzzles

    such as Proof of work consumes a significant amount of

    CPU time and energy, making it unsuitable for resource-

    constrained IoT nodes. EC enables edge devices to carry out

    data resource incentive transactions and can be leveraged for

    performing consensus. Information hidden in IoT big data

    can be harnessed by feeding them to ML models, producing

    more generalized results on big data.The integrity of the

    data can be maintained by feeding trustworthy data to ML

    99

    through BC. Conversely, more security can be imparted into

    BC through ML.

    BCT is regarded as a promising technology for IoT because

    it provides significant solutions for decentralized networks

    that address trust and security concerns. Although BC

    outperforms centralized solutions in network security, BC-

    IoT integration is still in its early stages of adoption. Many

    challenges such as cost, compatibility, and privacy issues

    hinder the widespread adoption of BC security solutions

    in IoT. To realize the full potential of BC-based IoT,

    exhaustive research is necessary for exploring the enabling

    technologies for BC in lightweight( LW) environments.

    A. Objective and Contribution

    This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview

    of the potential and challenges of BC-based IoT security

    solutions and enabling technologies, open issues, possible

    solutions, and future research directions. There are four

    focal research points of our study, and are listed below-

    1)

    Firstly, to highlight the problems in centralized-based

    IoT solutions and understand why shifting to BC-

    based solutions is necessary.

    2)

    Since the robustness of a BC-based system is highly

    dependent on its underlying consensus mechanism,

    the aim is to conduct an in-depth comparative anal-

    ysis of CMs that are IoT suitable.

    3)

    Thirdly, to critically review the existing BC-based

    IoT security solutions in view of five IoT security

    tasks-

    a)

    Key Management and Access control.

    b)

    Device Authentication.

    c)

    Routing Security.

    d)

    Malware Prevention. and

    e)

    Data Protection and Secure Database Manage-

    ment.

    4)

    Fourthly, to highlight the open challenges in the

    BC-IoT integration and list out key future research

    directions.

    The main contributions of the paper are as follows:

    1)

    We have conducted a thorough survey of recent

    surveys(2019-early 2022) on BCT applicability in

    IoT. Other researchers may find this pool useful as

    a starting point for their research.

    2)

    We have discussed BC as a key enabling technology

    for IoT and three technologies that power BC-IoT.

    3)

    4)

    A primary literature review of the recent BC inte-

    grated IoT solutions in perspective of five specific

    IoT security tasks.

    5)

    We have discussed the cost analysis of IoT storage

    through SCs, network traffic modeling, SC vulner-

    abilities, BC transactional privacy, and other chal-

    lenges.

    6)

    We have thoroughly discussed the open issues and

    presented strong research directions.

    B. Paper Organization

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In

    Section 2, the scope of the survey is presented. Section

    3 presents the security vulnerabilities of six critical IoT

    applications and lays the rationale for moving toward de-

    centralized architectures. In Section 4, we briefly provide

    an overview of BCT, its architecture, and CMs. Section 5

    presents the highlights of the recent surveys (2019-early

    2022). Based on the study in section 5, we discuss BC as

    a key facilitator for IoT and technologies that accelerate

    BC adoption in IoT in Section 6. In Section 7, a detailed

    study of BC integrated IoT security architectures and a

    comparison of various CMs, their adoption, and tradeoffs

    is discussed. In section 8, a literature review of BC-based

    security solutions is presented. In section 9, we present a

    thorough overview of the challenges associated with BC

    adoption in IoT, point out the open issues and possible

    solutions, and suggest promising research directions

    2. Scope of the survey

    We begin our review with a study of the prevalent

    centralized IoT architectures and discuss their security vul-

    nerabilities. We identify five primary security tasks, evaluate

    them against centralized solutions, and determine their

    limitations and the need to shift to decentralized solutions

    such as Blockchain. We then discuss the fundamentals of

    Blockchain. The working of the SCs have been excluded,

    and instead, their security vulnerabilities and applicability

    has been discussed. Considering the vastness of BC appli-

    cability, especially in IoT security, we shortlist a pool of re-

    cent survey papers (2019-early 2022) and comprehensively

    highlight their key focal points. The research papers have

    been shortlisted based on keywords, the number of times

    cited, and relevance to one of the five domains- General

    IoT security, IoT suitable CMs, BC-based IoT applications,

    BC for B5G applications, and integration with Machine

    Learning and BC- Edge computing. Other researchers may

    find this pool useful as a starting point for their research.

    Based on our secondary survey, we broadly discuss the

    reason for merging BC with IoT, how BC is a key enabling

    technology for IoT and what technologies drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in

    IoT. We have discussed three enabling technologies for

    powering BC adoption in IoT- EC, IPFS, and ML. We

    then discuss the BC-IoT integration in great detail and

    present the technicalities of BC adoption in IoT. Since a

    BC network is only as good as its consensus, we conduct

    a detailed comparative analysis of CMs in light of IoT

    goals and related tradeoffs. Based on the study, we shortlist

    IoT suitable CMs and BC platforms. We then review the

    recent BC-based IoT architectures and evaluate them against

    the previously identified security tasks. We have filtered a

    subset of research papers(2018-early 2022) where the focal

    points are specifically the five IoT security tasks mentioned

    in subsection 1(A). Each paper’s experimental work and re-

    sults have been carefully studied, and the aim, architecture,

    pros, and cons of each solution have been comprehensively

    summarized. Finally, based on the literature review of BC-

    100

    IoT architectures, we thoroughly discuss the challenges in

    BC-IoT integration and present research issues and future

    research directions.

    3. Security vulnerabilities of Centralized IoT applica-

    tions:

    IoT’s centralized architecture has three major network

    components-a) End devices: These are devices with sensing

    and actuating abilities coupled to the CPS. They amass

    data in the environment that they are lodged in and take

    action. b) Gateways and Data acquisition systems (DAS):

    DASs acquire data from sensors, and the gateways enable

    the Device-Cloud interactions working on different network

    protocols. c) Computing platforms: The data is relayed

    to platforms that provide storage, processing, hardware,

    software, and analytical support to the system.

    A. IoT Goals

    IoT architecture must satisfy the following primary

    goals:

    1)

    Low Power consumption: IoT devices are con-

    strained and require low-powered communication

    protocols to increase the network’s lifetime.

    2)

    Adaptability: The addition of new devices, frequent

    changes in the network conditions, and mobility of

    devices are essential factors in an IoT network. IoT

    architecture must be flexible to changes that the

    network encounters.

    3)

    Interoperability: Heterogeneity is a prime character-

    istic of IoT data. Well-defined standards and middle-

    ware are necessary to ensure ubiquitous computing.

    4)

    Latency prevention: The data processing must be

    done in a timely manner, especially in critical ap-

    plication domains.

    5)

    Accuracy: The data must be consistent and accurate

    throughout the process. The veracity of the data must

    be ensured, and the communication should be non-

    lossy.

    6)

    Fault tolerance: The architecture must contain a

    distributed and decentralized system to ensure ro-

    bustness and resilience.

    7)

    Security protection: Data must be protected against

    malicious cyberattacks. The transmitted data must

    not be altered at any level.

    8)

    Privacy Preservation: The transmitted data must only

    be available to the users participating in exchanging

    information.

    9)

    Low cost: The overall cost of deployment, network

    communication, storage, and maintenance should be

    low. Affordability is an essential factor in making

    IoT a viable business paradigm.

    10)

    Scalability: IoT is an ever-growing field. New de-

    vices are added to expand the existing networks. The

    architecture must be flexible to the growth of the

    network

    1) IoT Security Goals

    An IoT network must satisfy the following security

    goals:

    1)

    Confidentiality: Data transmitted must be accessible

    only to authentic users. Encryption mechanisms must

    be employed to protect the data.

    2)

    Integrity: The data transmitted must be trustworthy.

    The data received must not be modified in an unau-

    thorized manner.

    3)

    Availability: The data must not be lost in transit. DoS

    must be avoided.

    4)

    Authenticity: The data must originate only from

    trusted sources only. The Authentication issue in-

    cludes the capability to identify the devices in the

    IoT-based system.

    5)

    Non-Repudiation: The data transfer must be bound

    by proof of data ownership. The sender and receiver

    must acknowledge the transfer of data and not deny

    it at a later stage.

    6)

    Authorization: This refers to granting permissions to

    access data or perform an operation on authenticated

    objects and persons.

    B. Security of Centralized IoT applications:

    The number of IoT applications has increased signifi-

    cantly as a result ofthe development of open-source cloud

    platforms, such as Azure IoT Suite, Amazon Web Services,

    and Oracle IoT. IoT is at the root of various critical applica-

    tion infrastructures such as Smart Home, Smart City, Smart

    Health, Smart Agriculture, Smart Retails, Supply Chain

    Management, Finance, Industrial Control Systems, Commu-

    nication Networks, Smart Grids, and Smart Transportation

    [7]. These applications generate personal and sensitive

    information, raising the need for secure DM. Centralized

    schemes are susceptible to attacks, and a hacker can modify

    the AC policies to gain control of the system. Decentralized

    schemes are necessary for securing IoT Applications. The

    centralized nature of the application is vulnerable to various

    security threats at all levels, as depicted in Figure 2. In this

    subsection, we discuss six critical application domains:

    Figure 2. Security attacks in IoT

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    101

    1)

    Smart city (SCT): SCT has Information and Com-

    munication Technology (ICT) at the core of its

    infrastructure. SCT provides several innovative and

    advanced services to its citizens to improve their

    quality of life. Intelligent information is provided

    to its citizens in real-time by fully enabling the

    control of the physical objects. Various SCT appli-

    cations include Healthcare, Smart buildings, Public

    safety, Smart Governance, and Smart agriculture.

    SCT faces large-scale security and privacy risks. The

    resource-constrained devices used, such as sensors

    and cameras which collect and share sensitive infor-

    mation, are very vulnerable to attacks by hackers.

    Most of the resource-constrained devices have no

    adequate security or privacy mechanism. The com-

    munication technologies used by IoT devices like

    RFID, NFC, WiFi, LPWAN (Low Power Wide-area-

    network), 6LoWPAN 3G,and 4G mobile technolo-

    gies are highly susceptible to attacks. The presence

    of multiple links between many system components

    exposes them to many security risks [8], [9], [10].

    2)

    Smart HealthCare (SHC): One of the major do-

    mains in the IoT-based infrastructure is SHC. Wear-

    able and mobile devices in IoT-based SHC have

    added tremendous value to the healthcare domain.

    SHC is responsible for making healthcare person-

    alized, more convenient, and efficient. The various

    applications of SHC include assisting diagnosis and

    treatment, health management, disease prevention,

    risk monitoring, virtual assistants, smart hospitals,

    and assisting drug research. SHC is highly vulnera-

    ble to security breaches and faces many malignant

    attacks, including privacy leakage, data tampering,

    and forgery. SHC deals with sensitive and personal

    data. The data collected through sensors are both

    static or have dynamic behavior. The breach of such

    data is considered a severe breach in data protection.

    The connected devices capture, aggregate, process,

    and then transfer the data to the cloud. These devices

    are vulnerable to tag cloning, spoofing, RF Jamming,

    and cloud polling. SHC has a centralized dataset that

    contains personal information such as family history,

    electronic medical records, and genomic data that

    must be secured from malicious software. Wireless

    networking technology deployed in the healthcare

    environment like Wi-Fi, BLE, and ZigBee results

    in an increased threat of eavesdropping, sybil, and

    sinkhole attacks [11], [12], [13].

    3)

    Smart Grid (SG): SG constitutes one of the most

    critical applications of the IoT. SG entails integrating

    the data communications network and the power

    grid to analyze the data collected from transmission

    lines, distribution substations, and consumers. The

    transmission and distribution of the power networks

    in SG are intelligently monitored at a fine granularity

    for high accuracy. Several IoT architectures have

    been proposed to be integrated with SG. Layer 1

    architecture consists of the Smart meters, Network

    Devices, and Communication protocol in the general

    three-layered architecture. Layer 2 contains devices

    responsible for receiving data at the central system.

    Layer 3 includes artificial intelligent systems to

    provide information to decision and billing systems.

    IoT-based SG as a cyber system faces security

    challenges at all three levels. The attacks can be

    categorized into four main types: Device attack, Data

    attack, Privacy attack, and Network availability at-

    tack. Authentication, user privacy, and data integrity

    are essential in SG. Only the intended recipients

    must access the data stored or transmitted. Secure

    authorization and control access is an important issue

    for IoT-based SG. Only a certified and authorized

    person should be granted the necessary access to

    perform any configuration of the smart meter [14],

    [15], [16].

    4)

    Smart Home (SH): An IoT-based SH refers to the

    environment of living that consists of highly intelli-

    gent and advanced automatic systems. Smart services

    are provided by various heterogeneous electronic

    devices networked together to provide smart ser-

    vices. An IoT-based SH performs various function-

    alities such as controlling and monitoring lighting,

    home temperature, appliances, intrusion detection,

    and energy management. Convenience and secu-

    rity are considered two key factors influencing the

    decision of the users in adopting IoT-based SHs.

    An SH must satisfy five security goals- Authenti-

    cation, Authorization, Integrity, Confidentiality, and

    Availability. SH faces many security-related issues

    owing to its basic architecture, such as eavesdrop-

    ping. An attacker can capture the traffic in infras-

    tructure among the different components of SH,

    thus violating confidentiality. The data captured can

    lead to an impersonation attack where an adversary

    masquerades as an authentic user and accesses IoT

    resources. DoS attacks can be performed by crafting

    malformed messages, resulting in provided service

    not processing the data properly, thereby compro-

    mising the availability [17], [18], [19].

    5)

    Smart Farming/Agriculture (SF/SA): IoT-based

    SF solutions refer to the system in which the crop

    field is monitored with the help of sensors, and

    the irrigation system is automated. The monitoring

    of the farm can be done from anywhere by the

    farmer. In IoT Smart Agriculture (SA), far advanced

    sensors are utilized, connected to the cloud via

    cellular and satellite networks. Thus the real-time

    data received assists in making effective decisions.

    However, there remain many security and privacy

    issues which are critical to the performance of

    SA/SF. Wireless sensors are used abundantly in SA

    to give up-to-date information to the farmer in real-

    time. Centralized systems store the information and

    have control over it, compromising the privacy of

    the system. Furthermore, communication plays a key

    role in SA/SF. The vulnerable nature of wireless

    102

    technology results in the interception of data packets.

    The data is susceptible to modification while relaying

    them to their destinations, compromising the CIA

    triad and leading to incorrect decision-making [20],

    [21], [22].

    6)

    Smart Transportation: With the rapid develop-

    ment in smart sensors, smart vehicles, and vehicular

    communication technology, the Internet of Vehicles

    (IoV) is proposed to be the future of the trans-

    portation critical infrastructure system. The evolu-

    tion of the IoV can be considered from its parent

    branch of IoT, with the focus on Vehicular Adhoc

    Networks. With sensors embedded in the vehicles,

    mobile phones, and the devices installed in the

    city, there is a possibility to offer an optimized

    suggestion of routes, easy parking reservations, eco-

    nomic street lightning, prevention of accidents, and

    autonomous car driving. Due to the dynamic nature

    of the vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to

    vehicle (V2V) communication, the real-time traffic

    state information measured and shared is essential

    in providing efficient and secure service in IoV.

    Since this communication is deployed in an open

    environment and topologies change over time, many

    vehicles enter the IoV system in a given time slot,

    making it challenging to identify and authenticate

    the legitimacy of each vehicle. This nature of the

    IoV network makes it difficult to ensure security and

    non-repudiation. As a result, the malicious attack can

    be easily launched to disrupt the services provided,

    leading to low traffic efficiency and compromising

    the safety of passengers. The high availability of

    IoV is important due to its safety-critical nature,

    which requires fail-safe, resilient, and fault-tolerant

    operations to be performed [23], [24], [25].

    C. IoT Security Tasks:

    The Security tasks can be broadly classified into five cat-

    egories spanning different IoT infrastructure levels. These

    include:

    1)

    Key and AC management: Only authorized person-

    nel must be given access to perform an operation or

    to access data. Fine-grained AC mechanisms must

    be devised in a heterogeneous environment, where

    cross-domain interoperability is a must.

    2)

    Authentication of Devices: It is a must that the

    legitimacy of every node participating in the network

    is proven to the root. The devices must also verify

    their data integrity and provide non-repudiation of

    the messages while interacting with other nodes.

    3)

    Data sharing and Routing security: IoT system pro-

    vides untethered access to information by transmit-

    ting data through uncertain and insecure channels.

    Securing the data and routing operation from cyber-

    attacks during transit is essential.

    4)

    Prevention against software failures: IoT systems

    are susceptible to Malware threats that can disrupt

    the entire functionality of the system. Adware, Ran-

    somware, Spyware protection is necessary to protect

    the IoT ecosystem.

    5)

    Secure and privacy-preserving data storage and man-

    agement: A central authority controls a centralized

    system that has complete control over the users’

    data. IoT systems require secure, tamper-resistant,

    and privacy-preserving database storage and man-

    agement.

    4. Blockchain Technology

    Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger consisting of a

    series of time-stamped blocks linked together through a CM

    forming a decentralized and distributed network [26]. A set

    of rules guides the transactions, and the system is free of

    any central authority. Instead, a peer-peer (p2p ) network is

    responsible for maintaining and updating the ledger. Con-

    ceived originally to prevent the “double-spending” problem

    in commercial transactions, the first widespread application

    of BC was the cryptocurrency Bitcoin’. However, since its

    inception in 2008, BCT has found applications in various

    other sectors such as Banking, Asset Management, Health-

    care, IoT security, Identity management, and Insurance [27].

    The World Economic Forum estimates that the BC would

    store 10 % of global GDP in the coming decade.

    Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that contains trans-

    actional records.The information that is contained in the

    ledger is in digital format. A large number of transactions

    are contained in the block of the BC.For every transaction

    that occurs in the BC, the author’s digital signature is re-

    quired, and every participant’s ledger is updated.By the very

    inherent design of the BC,the chain’s data is highly secure,

    which guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of the

    data.This generates trust without the need for some other

    third party. The validation and tamper-resistant transactions

    are managed by a large number of nodes[28].BC can also

    be described as distributed ledger technology that provides

    certificates to prove that information has not been tampered

    with[29].

    Four crucial technologies are guiding BCT. These include

    Hashing, Cryptography, Digital signatures, and Consensus.

    Hash function takes data of indefinite sizes as input and

    gives a value of definite size in the output. Even a minor

    change in the input leads to a completely different hash

    value. BCT is based on the SHA-256 hash function.The cor-

    responding hash is computed in the encryption block when

    a transaction is made, and the blocks are connected through

    the hashes [30]. For secure interaction, BCT employs

    public-key asymmetric cryptography [31]. Cryptography

    ensures confidentiality, accessibility, and integrity,assuming

    that the attack is computationally bound (the probability of

    which is high). Membership services governed by protocols

    maintain and manage the unique chain identity of the user.

    BCT uses a public key –private key mechanism for the

    identification of devices and signing transactions. A wallet

    contains information about public and private keys and

    tokenized digital assets associated with the client. Every

    transaction on the chain is digitally signed, thus associated

    with the on-record identity of the client.The CM governs

    network synchronization in the open network and ensures

    that the system verifies any transaction initiated. These

    four technologies enable the following in BCT-based open-

    access systems: [32]

    1)

    Decentralization:

    The

    transactions

    are

    validated

    without the interference of a central authority. The

    system is decentralized, and the information is dis-

    tributed and replicated across multiple nodes. The

    nodes agree upon the actual state of the ledger

    through a CM.

    2)

    Auditability: The records and transaction history on

    the chain serves as proof of ownership of the client’s

    digital assets and the transactions associated with

    them. The historical timestamp associated with the

    data is permanently stored in the BC.

    3)

    Integrity: The blocks are linked in chronological

    order with hashes. Thus, any malicious attempt to

    tamper with a block is readily detected.

    4)

    Transparency: BCs impart trust in a trustless environ-

    ment. A copy of the transaction information is visible

    to all the nodes. Any node can join an open BC

    system and access the network. The data is visible

    to everyone in the chain involved in the verification

    of transactions.

    5)

    Immutability:A record, once written, takes up a

    permanent place in the ledger. The ledger holds

    these records perpetually, imparting verifiability in

    the system.

    BCs are of 3 types- Public BCs, Private, and Consortium

    BCs. Public/ Permissionless BCs allow any user to join the

    network based on the consensus protocol, e.g., Bitcoin. Pub-

    lic BC has the capability of turning into a global network.

    A Private/Permissioned BC allows a specific set of nodes to

    be added to the chain providing a closed and more secure

    network [33]. Private BC is centrally controlled, and such a

    network is ideal for transmitting and sharing data within an

    organization. E.g., GemOS is a private BC. Finally, a hybrid

    approach that is partially centralized with lesser validators

    is called a consortium/Federated BC, where the control is

    distributed across a set of computers. Ethereum is a platform

    for building consortium BCs [34]. A comparison of the

    characteristics of the three types of BCs is depicted in Table

    I.

    A. Blockchain Framework:

    A Blockchain system has three layers- Data layer, Con-

    sensus Layer, and Application layer.

    1)

    Data Layer: Data layer governs the block creation.

    Secure identities are provided to each node, and

    dependence is created through network protocols.

    The network protocols govern the formation of p2p

    networks and secure transmission over links. The

    blocks contain two prime components- Chain of

    blocks and Transaction array.

    a)

    Chain of Blocks: BC is a distributed database

    containing a sequence of blocks that stores

    records of value and interest. Each block has a

    Block header(BH) and a Block body(BB). The

    BH stores the block version, which specifies

    the block validation rule set, a nonce which

    acts as a counter to verify the hash, a times-

    tamp to denote time, a Merkle root which

    stores the hash of all the underlying hashes

    of all the transactions in a cryptographic data

    structure called Merkle tree, the current block

    hash and the hash of the previous block. The

    BB contains the transaction data, an object

    recorded on blocks, organized by the Merkle

    tree [35].

    b)

    Transaction array: Every transaction is stored

    in the transaction array before adding it to the

    block. The transactions refer to exchanging

    value assets such as sending money, data,

    values, and messages. The basic skeleton of

    a Blockchain is shown in Figure 3.

    2)

    Consensus layer:This layer performs the core func-

    tionality of a BC system, i.e., bringing agreement on

    the system state in a trustless environment through

    consensus. The consensus is generally achieved by

    choosing a miner who packs the transactions into

    a new block and broadcasts it to the network.

    Figure 4 shows the steps involved in BC-based

    transactions. The four most popular BC CMs are

    Proof of Work(PoW), Proof of stake(PoS), Delegated

    104

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    Figure 3. A basic skeleton of Blockchain.

    Proof of stake(DPoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault

    Tolerance(PBFT). In PoW, the stakeholder(s)/miners

    compete to mine the block by calculating hashes

    until one node has the relevant value. In two

    nodes attaining the value simultaneously(rare) and

    the chain branches, the longest chain after the next

    block is taken as the real chain making the chains

    metastable. PoW requires complex computation and

    power resources. In PoS, a stakeholder/validator is

    chosen through a quasi-random process depending

    on his wallet credit, making the system run on low

    energy and computing resources but encouraging

    the nodes with nothing at stake to misbehave. In

    PBFT, the majority must agree on the network’s

    state, i.e., for a client transaction to commit, 2/3rd

    of the network must validate it. In DPoS, the nodes

    /delegates are chosen through voting to add a block

    to the root chain. In case of abnormal behavior

    by the delegate node, the other nodes can vote it

    out. However, the delegates are significantly less

    than the network and govern consensus, encourag-

    ing centralization. Some more CMs are Proof of

    Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance(DBFT), Proof

    of Burn(PoB), Proof of Capacity(PoC), Proof of

    Elapsed time(PoET), Dirted Acyclic graphs(DAG),

    Proof of Activity(PoA), Proof of Importance(PoI),

    and Leased Proof of Stake(LPoS) [36].

    3)

    Application layer: The Application layer provides

    interfaces for Distributed applications(DApps) that

    run on top of the BC system. At this level, SCs

    are integrated to guide the clauses’ execution with-

    out human intervention. SCs are digitized versions

    of paper-based contracts that allow terms reliant

    on decentralized consensus by self-execution [37].

    SCs are deterministic, autonomous, rule-based, and

    have unique addresses on the chain. The terms in

    the contract are converted into code that gets in-

    voked automatically in case of contract violation.

    SCs identify frauds and malicious attempts in the

    Figure 4. BC-based transactions.

    system, thereby increasing security. The results are

    deterministic and have high accuracy. SCs are in-

    voked independently and autonomously, mitigating

    the transaction costs by reducing human interference.

    Many BC communities are integrating interfaces for

    SCs, e.g., Ethereum provides a platform for writing

    SCs, written in a Turing complete language called

    Solidity [38].

    5. Related Surveys:

    IoT security is a vast domain, and many research and

    survey papers are available in the literature spanning various

    security aspects such as data encryption, intrusion detection,

    active attacks, passive attacks, device authentication, AC

    mechanisms, and channel security. AI and ML have comple-

    mented IoT security in recent times by providing improved

    real-time detection rates and attack detection accuracy. BC

    is a very recent addition to IoT security. BC addition to

    IoT is an up-and-coming solution to augment the pace

    of futuristic secure IoT networks. Due to the vastness of

    the domain and applicability beyond security, exhaustive

    survey papers are not available. Table II presents the recent

    (2019-2022) surveys available in the literature for BC-IoT

    integration. The surveys have been broadly classified into

    BC-based IoT Security, BC-based CMs for IoT, BC-IoT

    applications, BC-ML for IoT, and BC-EC integration. The

    focal points of each survey have been highlighted.

    6. Blockchain as a key enabling technology in IoT

    IoT is the focal point of enabling the pervasive inter-

    connection of virtual and physical objects that have sped

    up data sharing and collection. This capability makes IoT

    one of the essential architectures for providing services in

    various fields. This section discusses BC as a key enabling

    technology for IoT and the technologies that drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in IoT.

    1)

    Addition of BC features: BCT offers unique char-

    acteristics such as auditing capability, traceability,

    immutability, interoperability, accessibility, and ac-

    countability, which are imparted in IoT systems

    with its adoption. The IoT data streams from di-

    verse, heterogeneous environments are transformed

    into uniform coding. BC enables IoT and physical

    systems to collaborate through uniform access, fa-

    cilitating cross-domain interactions [77]. BCs enable

    fine-grained access mechanisms and SCs to prevent

    unauthorized access making the systems open to

    interactions from other physical systems. Further, BC

    has a 160-bit address space higher than IPV6, aiding

    it to be more scalable. The IoT data is stored as

    transactions permanently in an immutable fashion on

    the network. Every transaction initiated by a node is

    associated with the corresponding information. Any

    misbehavior or fraud can be traced back to the user

    imparting the audit capacity in the system, which can

    highly complement IoT verticals [65].

    2)

    5G and 6G enabled Industrial IoT: The advance-

    ments in faster communication networks are revolu-

    tionizing network services and making IoT systems

    faster. B5G technologies are key facilitators in inno-

    vating futuristic open access with low cross-domain

    barriers. The B5G systems need efficient communi-

    cation mechanisms with enhanced security, robust-

    ness, privacy preservation, and improved mobility.

    5Gs employ network slice brokers to enable media-

    tion between vertical service and resource providers.

    BC can operate independently in slices enabling

    secure and anonymous transactions [4], [78]. 5G ap-

    plications such as 5G-powered drones need security

    and enhanced privacy [79]. Various BC-based solu-

    tions have been presented for securing B5G and 6G

    systems. In [80], the authors present a BC sidechain-

    based decentralized hierarchical scheme for 5G to

    provide secure communication and authentication.

    The authentication is done at the edge of the network

    to reduce latency. In [81], the authors propose a BC-

    enabled clustered architecture for validating blocks

    in IoTs for B5G applications.

    3)

    Enhanced automation with SC applicability: With

    the help of SCs, BC is imparted with decision-

    making capabilities that drastically reduce human

    effort, and the applicability of IoT systems is in-

    creased [82]. The transactional clauses of SCs are

    digitized and tamper-resistant and cannot be mod-

    ified. SCs eliminate the need for an intermediator,

    minimizing management costs. SCs detect breaches

    and misbehavior in the system and automatically

    take decisions depending on the clauses pre-agreed

    upon by the system’s stakeholders. The decisions

    have higher accuracy and reliability and improve

    the overall security and efficiency of the system.

    SCs make distributed access decisions to enable

    legitimate users to query the BC and work better with

    data-driven interactions. SCs are deterministic and

    autonomous, thereby accelerating the inception of

    Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs). In

    IoT systems, SCs facilitate flexible AC, secure DM,

    prevent DDoS attacks, and provide secure identity

    management, strengthening security further.

    The three primary driving forces for BC-IoT adoption

    are:

    1)

    Edge computing: EC is a major driver for IIoT, and

    the integration of BCT into edge provides enhanced

    reliability, privacy, data integrity, reliable AC, and

    automated resource allocation. Conversely, the edge

    networks provide computational, storage, and side

    chain-based consensus facilities to IoT devices [70].

    Due to the constrained nature of IoT end-devices,

    they communicate data to the edge where the mod-

    erately intensive CMs and functions are done. The

    nodes store partial data such as time-stamp informa-

    tion to validate the authenticity of the other nodes.

    At the same time, the complex functions, strong

    CMs, and high storage requirements are offloaded

    to the edge. Various architectures have been present

    for BC-based edge computing. In [83], the authors

    propose a mobile BC-assisted IoT application con-

    sisting of Small cell base stations with mobile edge

    computing (MEC) deployed at them. In [84], the

    authors present a prototype for BC-based EC for

    mining and edge resource management for mobile

    BC. In [85], the authors present a DPoS based double

    auction cross-server edge resource allocation frame-

    work for mobile EC. BC functionality can be further

    extended for network management by designing BC-

    based Software-defined networks [32].

    2)

    Integration with ML: BCs provide secure data

    storage, and the outputs can detect anomalies in

    IoT systems [86]. The integration of ML and BCT

    in IoT can enable various tasks such as - secure

    storage of correct data, monetization of ML skill set

    through SCs, feeding correct data into algorithms,

    creation of better learning models through incentive-

    based competitive modeling, Making BCs secure

    from attacks, enabling automated signing of BC

    systems [71], [87], [88], [89]. In [90], the authors

    proposed a BC-assisted collective learning method

    to guide the secure exchange of learning results

    at the IoT edge. The model employs BC on the

    top of the edge devices where the nodes securely

    share learning results using BC-assisted collective

    3)

    IPFS powered BC for IoT: In critical IoT sys-

    tems, distributing data in a tamper-proof and trace-

    able manner is necessary. BCs provide the service,

    but they work inefficiently while handling big data

    considering the transactional processing limitations.

    IPFS can complement BC and provide a secure

    storage mechanism for IoT data. IPFS is a content-

    addressable, p2p version-controlled file system that

    can assist the formation of a decentralized IoT

    system [91]. IPFS, based on cryptographic hashes,

    is a potential alternative to address BC big data

    issues. BC is duplicated on multiple nodes; thus,

    most storage spaces are required without immediate

    use, particularly if the node operator does not need

    to examine every file saved on BC. With IPFS, BC

    only saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down

    the chain development drastically because hashes

    are typically less than the data they represent. For

    example, if SHA256 is employed, the on-chain stor-

    age required for a file of any size is lowered to 32

    bytes [92]. For any modifications in the content, the

    hash value changes each time. The authors of [93]

    offer a decentralized IIoT data management system

    based on BC and IPFS. The authors of [94] propose

    a network architecture that uses BCand IPFS to

    provide IoT data privacy. SCs perform AC in the

    proposed “modular consortium” architecture while

    also providing accountability for data owners and

    third parties to whom users grant access.

    7. Blockchain Integrated IoT systems.

    IoT aims to design a distributed system offering scalabil-

    ity, security, privacy, reliability, real-time data delivery, and

    high adaptability. With the rapid advancements in B5G, IoT

    systems are becoming faster, expanding over longer ranges,

    and requiring enhanced security solutions. BC has distin-

    guished intrinsic features of non-intermediation, immutabil-

    ity, data transparency, and tamper-resilience, which mitigate

    security concerns in an untrusted cross-domain open envi-

    ronment. BCs are envisioned as the future of open-access

    systems requiring distributed storage, efficient data and

    resource management, secure KM, and AC mechanisms. By

    design, a BC-based architecture can ensure confidentiality,

    integrity, availability, user control, and authorization in any

    system [95]. The integration of BC into IoT offers increased

    data trust, imparts verifiability, eliminates intermediation,

    provides transparency, and increases user control of the

    user data in the systems. IoT and BC’s collaboration can

    resolve the issues of data organization, data maintenance,

    communication security, intra-domain collaboration, and

    privacy in IoT. We shall refer to such systems as BC

    integrated IoT (BIIT) systems throughout the rest of the

    paper.

    A. Technicalities of Blockchain IoT integration:

    The world is moving towards becoming “smart” with

    IoT technology, necessitating more attention to data security

    and privacy concerns. IoT security solutions are typically

    complicated due to a lack of safe hardware and software

    design, development, limited resources, and established

    standards. Furthermore, the diversity of resources available

    in the IoT has hampered efforts to develop a comprehensive

    global strategy for protecting IoT systems at all levels. The

    main challenge is data management and securely providing

    services without compromising the privacy of the underly-

    ing personal information. One of the IoT security solutions

    is to develop a fine-tuned AC mechanism for data protection

    and privacy by ensuring that only authorized and authen-

    ticated users may access data. However, this is hindered

    by the vastness of the connected devices. Furthermore, the

    traffic created by the massive amount of data generated by

    these devices makes satisfying quality-of-service standards

    difficult. loT devices have low storage, computation power,

    and bandwidth restrictions.

    With all of the interactions between people, data, and

    devices, IoT promises direct connectivity between devices

    and data interchange. In the IoT economy, sensors and

    devices should be able to conduct monetary transactions

    in exchange for services without the involvement of a third

    party. With the introduction of the 5G network, transactions

    and exchanges will predominantly occur over the internet

    Figure 5. Interaction between IoT and Blockchain

    network, which billing and payment systems must account

    for. However, financial institutions can still not receive

    real-time information on pledged assets due to ineffective

    management for accessing, sharing, and analyzing asset

    information across stakeholders. There are no chattel asset

    tracking and monitoring systems capable of validating and

    quantifying chattel assets pledged for loans.

    BCT has the capability of bringing reforms in these sectors

    as it enables safe, immutable, and anonymous transactions

    using a decentralized distributed ledger system. BC-enabled

    loT systems can monitor and track chattel assets in transit

    or warehouses in real-time. The combined approach aids

    in the resolution and avoidance of unnecessary risks in

    the financial industry. Some attacks on loT systems can be

    addressed using BCT. BC research as a security mechanism

    has resulted in various transformative benefits that were

    previously unattainable or unavailable. Figure 5 depicts the

    interaction between IoT devices and BC platforms.

    Figure 6 illustrates a simple BC-based security level

    evaluation mechanism for IoT. The authors of [96] illustrate

    the steps involved in an IoT network based on BC. First,

    IoT device manufacturers pre-verify software that is loaded

    on IoT devices and create the whitelist. A SC is produced

    by combining a manufacturer’s whitelist and the agent’s

    initial agent hash value(IAHV) installed in an IoT device.

    IoT device manufacturers can access SCs via decentralized

    applications or internally through an Application Program-

    ming Interface(API). IoT device manufacturers use SCs to

    update the White List. Manufacturers use the whitelist SC

    to record the whitelist and IAHV of the agent installed in an

    IoT device in the BC. By inquiring about the information

    recorded in the BC via the whitelist SC, the IoT device

    can verify that the agent’s IAHV matches the device agent

    hash value of the installed agent. It validates that the agent

    has not been forged or fabricated by comparing it to the

    agent hash value stored in the BC; as a result, the security

    evaluation process of IoT devices via the agent may be

    trusted. The IoT device’s agent checks to see whether any

    for IoT.

    untrusted programs have been installed. The agent evaluates

    the security status of the IoT device and transmits it to

    the scoring SC. Manufacturers receive rewards in return for

    updating the whitelist SC.

    1) Recent proposed architectures:

    Two main features of the BCT include Trust and De-

    centralization [97], [98], [99]. By design, the data on a BC

    is secure and tamper-resistant, making it a key disruptor for

    IoT. BCs can be utilized to improve IoT in the following

    ways:

    1)

    Impart data integrity: The nodes in the BC have iden-

    tical copies of the ledger. When transactions occur,

    all network members are responsible for validating

    them, and once verified and stored in the ledger, the

    transaction cannot be manipulated or removed.

    2)

    More Addressing space than IPV6: BC addresses are

    160 bits long, while IPV6 addresses are 128 bits.

    When compared to IPV6, BC has higher addressing

    space (4.3 billion addresses).

    3)

    Trusted accountability: Every operation is docu-

    mented in the ledger; thus, it is possible to identify

    and trace all operations.

    4)

    Fault tolerance: Decentralized systems rely on mul-

    tiple separate components; they are more fault-

    tolerant. Because of the point-to-point decentralized

    structure, BC has no single node failure concern.

    5)

    Eliminating third-party liabilities: BC runs without

    third-party intermediaries and is free of any risks or

    dangers posed by third parties.

    The decentralized. peer-to-peer architecture is the most no-

    table characteristic of BCT. The distributed ledger contains

    Figure 7. Overview of Blockchain –based IoT architecture

    all transactions, and all network members must agree to

    approve the transaction. This feature enables the imple-

    mentation of end-to-end traceability. Data provenance was

    previously difficult to obtain, but it is now a possibility

    with the BCT’s distributed ledger option. Owing to these

    benefits, many BC-based architectures have been proposed

    for IoT; an overview of the same is provided in Figure 7.

    The authors of [100] propose the solutions to overcome

    the centralized solutions and security measures in IoT.

    The data-driven decentralized mechanism is used, which

    provides energy-efficient solutions for detecting attacks on

    the IoT-based Sensor Networks. In [101], the authors aim

    to facilitate the data searching and extraction of public and

    private BCs deployed at the MEC server of the 5G MEC

    smart grid. IoT device identifier is built as a BC explorer.

    In [102], the vulnerability of the massive data produced in

    IoT networks for smart transportation is solved by the BC

    and IoT, which provide a decentralized data management

    system. In [103], the authors propose using the Identity

    Based Encryption (IBE) algorithm to enhance health care

    data security.The BC-based IoT architecture uses IBE to

    provide enhanced security. In [104], the authors address

    the privacy, security, and scalability issues in a centralized

    system for IoT and resolve them with a lightweight archi-

    tecture for BC-based identity management. In [105], Mobile

    edge-cloud computation offloading is used in delay-sensitive

    IoT applications. An effective, trustworthy access control

    mechanism is introduced, which involves an advanced deep

    reinforcement learning algorithm using a double dueling

    Q-network. The work in [106] proposed using BC, SCs,

    and IoT devices to integrate different kinds of IoT devices

    in pre and post-harvesting agriculture segments. This work

    in [107] proposes the integration of the Software-Defined

    Network with the BC system. A BC-based architecture is

    used for proposing the new routing protocol witty cluster

    structure for the IoT networks.

    B. Tradeoffs in Consensus mechanisms for IoT suitability

    BIIT systems:

    Consensus is the principal mechanism that makes the

    BCs secure by design. A CM governs the rules that pivot

    on the network’s nodes to agree on the ledger’s true state.

    Consensus achieves trust in a heterogeneous, uncontrolled

    environment by providing a mechanism to validate the data

    communicated by the nodes in the network. CMs eliminate

    the central authority, validate the data communicated by

    the nodes in the network, establish trust among nodes and

    ensure a system state agreed upon by the network members.

    With the increase in BC-based applications, various CMs

    have been proposed and adopted by systems, but their adop-

    tion is met with challenges. The choice of the consensus

    algorithm significantly affects the network’s performance,

    and there exists a tradeoff between scalability, energy

    consumption, bandwidth requirement, network overheads,

    computation overheads, security, privacy, and latency.

    The robustness of a BC-based system is highly dependent

    on its underlying CM. The security provided by a CM

    is directly proportional to computational and bandwidth

    requirements, as is the case with PoW. IoT’s computational

    and communication abilities are bound by constrained re-

    sources; thus, applying a generic CM in IoT is difficult.

    Inter-domain cross consensus poses additional challenges

    [108]. Over the past few years, CMs have been customized

    particularly for LW environments. Since IoT networks are

    constrained, the CMs have been modified over the last

    few years to increase their suitability in LW networks.

    This, however, comes at the cost of compromising security

    and other factors. CMs with strong fault tolerance and

    immunity to attacks require the computation of intensive

    hash operations that consume energy, bandwidth, and other

    resources. CMs that work on low power do so at the cost of

    decreasing the network’s size or moderately compromising

    data integrity. An ideal CM for IoT would ensure increased

    decentralization, adversity tolerance, scalability, throughput,

    and decreased latency, energy consumption, storage, com-

    putation, and network overheads.

    A comparative study of the existing CMs in light of IoT

    goals is presented in Table III [109], [58], [55], [53] and

    [60]. The values High, Moderate, and Low under different

    columns(to different methods) are assigned based on dif-

    ferent criteria. For the energy consumption, computational

    resource requirements, storage overheads, and Throughput,

    the values are assigned bydirect comparison with PoW

    and IoT suitability. The numerical criteria for assigning

    latency values is Block creation time. For example, the

    block creation time in PoW is approximately 10 minutes,

    while it is only 4 minutes in PoC. Although the time is

    considerably lower than PoW, it is still not suitable for

    real-time IoT environments, and compared to other CMs

    that take only seconds, the time taken by PoC is high.

    Thus, the value “Moderate” has been assigned based on

    the combined criteria. DPoS can process 100,000 TPS, and

    the block is added in under 3 seconds to the chain, which

    is still not suitable for real-time IoT systems that require a

    block creation time of the order of milliseconds.

    While designing a new consensus algorithm for an LW

    system, the following tradeoffs need to be considered:

    1)

    Security and Computational requirements: Strong

    cryptographic methods provide high security and

    decentralization to the system, and improve data

    integrity and confidentiality but are computationally

    intensive and require high power systems for imple-

    mentation.

    2)

    Privacy and Latency: To achieve privacy, the adopted

    system should be free of a central authority, and

    the consensus should be achieved in a p2p fashion.

    However, private chains are adopted by systems that

    encourage centralization to decrease the system’s

    latency, thereby increasing privacy concerns.

    3)

    Convergence rate and Adversity tolerance: The con-

    vergence of the algorithm affects the adversity tol-

    erance of the network. For IoT real-time systems,

    for the consensus to converge faster, the number of

    nodes involved in consensus is decreased, making it

    easy to compromise the network and decreasing the

    system’s fault tolerance.

    4)

    Latency and Scalability: For cross-domain access,

    the number of validations to perform transactions in-

    creases, increasing the network overhead. To reduce

    latency in real-time applications, the number of the

    communicating nodes needs to be capped.

    5)

    Throughput and Scalability: As the network size

    increases, simultaneous communication attempts to

    access resources and Block addition increase con-

    siderably. This affects the system’s throughput sig-

    nificantly as more nodes access the limited resources

    of the system

    1) BIIT suitable Consensus mechanisms and Blockchain

    platforms:

    1)

    Hyperlegder Fabric with PBFT: Hyperledger fab-

    ric has a modular architecture and can create private

    chains. The system’s latency is less but is associated

    with significant network overhead, suitable for small

    private networks, limiting the network’s scalability.

    Hyperledger fabric is suited for private networks,

    works on PBFT, and has a pluggable CM. To achieve

    consensus, the majority of the nodes must agree

    on the block addition. For writing SCs, the frame-

    work supports the “Go” language and “Chaincode”

    [135]. The framework provides data confidentiality,

    efficient processing, and identity management and is

    suitable for low-scale IoT implementation.

    2)

    Hyperledger Sawtooth with PoET: Designed by

    Intel, this framework is suitable for low-powered

    systems. The nodes solve a hash problem, and

    the winning node is chosen randomly on a ran-

    dom waiting time using Intel’s softguard extension.

    The contracts on Sawtooth can be written in any

    language, and various CMs can be plugged into

    the same chain [136]. It usually employs PoET,

    which offers low computational requirements, High

    verification mechanism which decreases the conver-

    gence time and reduces latency in the system. How-

    ever, the framework suffers from storage and security

    problems and is prone to centralization. IoTa uses

    DAG, which minimizes the system’s network and

    transaction overhead [132]. The latency is low and

    has been specifically designed for IoT applications.

    Iota enables high throughput but does not support

    SCs and suffers from privacy issues.

    C. Security architecture of BIIT systems

    BCT is evolving as a key paradigm in addressing these

    issues of IoT. In BIIT systems, BC is added at the security

    level and works on a distributed consensus scheme where

    each IoT transaction is verified, and every message can be

    traced to the origin. BIIT systems work in a p2p distributed

    manner, and each entry is time-stamped. The data blocks

    are integrated using cryptographic hashes, and the Merkle

    tree stores all atomic transactions. The tree’s root hash is

    verified to secure all the transactions underlying it.

    To understand the BIIT system’s security mechanism, the

    Hyperledger fabric for IoT BC security architecture has

    been considered, consisting of five levels: [137]

    1)

    Perception layer: The IoT node layer collects the

    data from heterogeneous environments and is pre-

    processed, transformed, and stored on BCs.

    2)

    Network Layer: All nodes are given equal priority

    and transmit the data. Each node contains the data

    authentication protocol information and block net-

    work mode.

    3)

    Consensus layer: The layer works on the PBFT

    algorithm, suitable for constrained IoT environments

    because of less energy consumption and lower com-

    putational overhead.

    4)

    Smart Contract Layer: The SC layer stores contracts,

    incentive mechanisms, and other scripts. SCs are set

    up in the certification authority.

    5)

    Application Layer: The layer is responsible for col-

    lecting, storing, verifying, and processing the data

    blocks. The IoT application interface enforces the

    node transaction process and provides AC services.

    Mechanism: The devices are registered and granted AC

    rights which are defined in the SC. Various sensing devices

    collect data of various types and in varying formats. This

    data is pre-processed, and preliminary information is ex-

    tracted through a hash function and asymmetric encryption.

    The heterogeneity is removed by transforming the data into

    a fixed-length base to keep a uniform format. The data is

    time-stamped, stored in a block, and broadcasted to the

    whole network. The gateway nodes hash the data, storing

    the table in the block. The time-stamp archives the key

    block information such as the source, and digital signature,

    which imparts traceability. Any node can act as a miner to

    carry out authentication. A block node validates the received

    data according to the data structure, source, time-stamp,

    and other information. The data from a legitimate source is

    added in chronological order, and the transmission from

    a malicious node is restricted. The data is stored in an

    immutable fashion on the chain.The IoT transactions are

    verified using a PBFT consensus algorithm, ensuring that

    no false data is stored on the system. The SCs are triggered

    in case of an event, and the contract clauses are invoked to

    handle the misbehavior by one or more nodes. SCs enable

    cross-domain interoperability by implementing scripts for

    various states. The SCs also eliminate human/third-party

    intervention for invoking the rules in case of a malicious

    attempt. At the top, application services are provided, and

    access rules for cross-domain interactions are maintained.

    The architecture has five prime advantages-Improved secu-

    rity, increased cross-domain interoperability, data integrity,

    data traceability, and automated decision making.

    8. BIIT systems and IoT Security tasks

    More and more devices are being connected in the

    IoT application domains with advancements in sensing and

    actuating technologies. Verifying the legitimacy of the com-

    ponents for secure communication, authentication schemes,

    and secure routing protocols (RP) are essential criteria in

    IoT sensor networking. In Table IV, the literature study of

    the recently proposed security architectures of BIIT systems

    has been summarized vis-`a-vis security tasks identified in

    Section 3.3.

    A. Primary Study of the BC Solutions:

    In [138], the authors propose a BC-based distributed KM

    scalable architecture with fine-grained auditing capability

    for hierarchical AC. The architecture consists of 3 main

    components- A device layer containing the CPS devices,

    a BCT-based security access manager (SAM) network at

    the fog layer, and multiple BC networks on the cloud

    for KM. The user keys are secured and not under the

    control of a key generation center, and the information

    is instead stored on the SAMs, which act as the miners

    on the chain employing a PoW consensus algorithm. The

    information is offloaded to a BC-based cloud for access

    across multiple domains and reduces the blocks’ burden.

    The cross-domain operations are allowed after the cloud

    manager verifies it and sends it to the SAM. In the case of

    frequent accesses, the information is stored in the BC with

    the same deployment domain. The target difficulty in the

    model is 17 bits for a SAM device, and the average time

    consumption decreases with transaction collection time (Tc)

    with the assumption that there are enough power resources

    to carry out the verifications. The performance evaluation of

    the model for cross-domain operations shows that the time

    consumption in carrying them out is the same during each ½

    Tc period. The architecture provides fine-grained auditing,

    but its performance evaluation runs on various assumptions,

    such as that all the management domains have the same

    number of user equipment. The mining is done after the

    propagation procedure ends, and the SAMs have the same

    transmissibility to propagate transactions and mining time.

    In [139], the authors propose a theoretical architecture for

    BC-based AC mechanisms with enhanced trust mechanisms

    and increased portability. The architecture consists of 3

    prime layers- Resource layer (RL), BC layer (BL), and

    Application layer (AL). The model aims to formulate an

    AC mechanism for defending against attacks in an untrusted

    environment. The model adopts the PBFT algorithm for

    consensus, an endorser makes endorsements for the trans-

    action, and a transaction handler executes the chain codes.

    Users communicate with ALs through a client application

    for registration and requesting AC. BL is at the core and

    is deployed on every component in the private network.

    It consists of 3 components – web controller, transaction

    handler, and ledger. All the actions such as identity creation,

    executing access protocol creation, and resource creation

    happen in the BC. All the requests are saved in the BC in an

    immutable and non-resistant manner. The model’s security

    analysis shows resistance to AC message tampering until at

    least 1/3 nodes of the network is not compromised. The

    model is suitable only for the low-scale implementation

    and is compromised if the network complexity increases,

    creating latency and storage problems.

    In [140], the authors propose a BC-based AC mechanism

    for verifying IoT end-points and providing access tokens

    for querying resources. The architecture is gateway-based,

    where IoT devices communicate with the gateway instead

    of the internet, and conversely, any communication to

    IoT devices goes via gateways. The gateway serves four

    purposes- protocol bridge, AC, secure communication, and

    proxy BC. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) act as the

    gateway approver, vendor device authentication is done by

    the vendors, and the gateway acts as an authorization server.

    The AC state is distributed across all nodes and stored on

    the SCs. A trusted administrator does the SC deployment,

    and signing of ISPs and vendors. The AC is carried out in a

    few stages- gateway authentication done by an ISP, vendor

    authentication of devices by the owner under each domain,

    and the gateway handles outside requests by verifying and

    granting access requests. The outside requestors need to

    build secure channels with gateways before communicating

    to IoT for access. The ISPs are discredited in case of

    untrusted behavior, and the domain owner has complete

    control over the requests coming through the gateway. The

    model is evaluated over trust, security, and performance.

    The security analysis shows that the attacks can happen

    if the attacker leverages massive computational resources,

    which are costly or compromise the approvers, mitigated by

    using a certification authority for vendors. The architecture

    is centralized and needs a trusted intermediary. The authors

    argue that IoT systems cannot be entirely decentralized and

    employ trusted approvers for authenticating end-points. The

    architecture relies on ISPs to route traffic carrying security

    verifications, while BC provides validation.

    In [141], the authors propose an SC-based data sharing and

    AC mechanism for end-point communication in IoT devices

    to resolve trust issues. The proposed system consists of

    SCs for DM in an untrusted environment. Three SCs are

    used – Access control contract (ACC), Register Contract

    (RC), and Judge Contract (JC). ACC maintains the AC for

    any requester and oversees the overall communication AC

    and data sharing between IoT devices. RC is responsible

    for the authentication of requests and registers them. The

    behavioral analysis is done by JC, which checks the node

    for misconduct and generates alert messages. An ACC

    is invoked when an AC request is sent, and the request

    is forwarded based on the access permission level. After

    objects accomplish the request, the corresponding transac-

    tion is stored on the chain. The security analysis shows

    that the proposed system is open access and secure, and

    the trustworthiness is maintained throughout using SCs.

    The model is evaluated against cost and shows that ACC

    consumes more execution and transaction energy than other

    SCs.

    In [142], the authors propose a BC-based AC mecha-

    nism with secure delegation services, an integrated BCT

    network for eliminating a central delegation service, and

    event and query-based services. The device is assigned

    to a private group, and subsequent permissions are given

    through a delegation mechanism performed by a BC. The

    architecture consists of low-powered IoT devices, powered

    user devices with computation and storage capacity, an

    application manager for user interface and registration, an

    IoT manager for data filtering and query management, a BC

    Manager (BCM) for SCs and AC management. The BCM

    registers the IoT devices and deploys an SC for each device.

    BCM allows delegates to activate or deny the permission

    stored in the SC. The SC stores devices’ platform hashes

    and delegation policies. The BC miners verify before any

    permission activation. The proposed model is for private

    networks for increased throughput and reduced latency, but

    the model cannot be replicated on large-scale IoT systems

    without affecting the network performance.

    In [143], the authors propose a BC-based privacy-preserving

    and rewarding private data sharing scheme, a BC-based

    incentive mechanism for private data exchange.The data

    owner publishes private data and receives a payment anony-

    mously in the BC, while data consumers obtain licenses

    anonymously through SCs, where licensing technology en-

    sures access control for multi-sharing. The authors leverage

    Monero technology to ensure the untraceability and un-

    linkability of DUs while getting private data, ensuring that

    no one can develop a dat user behavior profile database.

    The authors incorporate the non-frameability characteristic

    into the anonymous incentive data sharing scheme. Honest

    data consumers can refute the frame up using a deniable

    ring signature without revealing their genuine identity. The

    authors present the security model, provide the formal secu-

    rity proof using the random oracle model, and demonstrate

    the model’s feasibility in real-time IoT architectures. The

    authors have proved the effectiveness of their technique and

    compared it to various undeniable ring signature schemes.

    The results reveal that the computational cost increases

    linearly as the number of ring members increases.

    In [144], the authors propose an efficient BC-assisted secure

    cross-domain device authentication mechanism, inducing

    inter-domain trust and privacy in IIoT applications. Identity-

    based signatures induce authentication in this mechanism,

    and privacy is induced by designing the identity manage-

    ment mechanism. The cross-domain authentication privacy

    perseverance also introduces a key negotiation mechanism

    to prevent eavesdropping on the insecure channel by negoti-

    ating session keys. The architecture consists of four layers.-

    Entity layer(EL), Agent layer(AL), BC Layer (BCL), and

    Storage Layer(SL). EL consists of a key generation center

    (KGC) and IIoT devices. KGC is responsible for the gener-

    ation of private keys for IIoT devices. AL consists of the BC

    Agent Server (BAS)and Authentication Agent Server(AAS).

    The model employs three types of authentication- Unilateral

    authentication, where users authenticate a device, Mutual

    authentication, where two devices authenticate each other;

    and cross-domain authentication, carried by KGC, BAS, and

    AAS. The domain-specific information is encapsulated into

    the consortium BC node in transactions and is acquired

    by other domains for authentication. The authentication

    agent server executes signature generation and verification

    operations on behalf of requesting devices. With an increase

    in the number of endorsing and validating nodes, the BC

    consensus time increases, introducing latency in the system.

    In [145], the authors proposed an out-of-band two-factor

    authentication scheme to prevent impersonation attacks on

    large-scale IoT devices using “device relationship” and

    BCT. The out of band performs the secondary authentication

    to distinguish home IoT devices from the malicious IoT de-

    vices. There are four components of the said authentication

    scheme- Authentication Subject(AS), which is any device

    that wants access to resources, Related Device(RD) that

    performs secondary authentication, BC that stores the ‘Re-

    lationship information’ for every authentication subject with

    the related device and Authentication Executor (AE) which

    coordinates the two factors out of band authentication. A

    relationship contract stores the mapping of AS address

    to ‘Relationship data’. When an AS requests access, AE

    retrieves the corresponding information from the BC, selects

    the RD in the AS neighborhood, and sends the correspond-

    ing action sequence. The corresponding RD invokes SC to

    send the verification result to BC, and finally, AE checks

    BC for verification results utilizing SC. The model has not

    been implemented on commercial IoT devices due to close-

    sourced hardware and software, and there are considerable

    CPU and memory overheads in the authentication stage.

    In [146], the authors propose a BC-based authentication

    mechanism for the low-power sensor nodes that are part

    of p2p networking using the sequence number of sensor

    nodes. This paper proposes verification through SHA 64-

    bit hash function to confirm confidentiality and integrity

    without compromising performance. The sink node(SN)

    assigns the sequence numbers by a broadcast-response-

    based mechanism for registering legitimate devices. The SN

    keeps a record of the other node’s identity in the form of the

    Ids, sequence number, and hash value; therefore, the sink

    detects a malicious node by verifying the sequence number

    and the hash value. A mutual level node authentication

    model is used where a node and its sequence number store

    all other nodes’ sequence numbers. The node identifies the

    particular node for communication, compares the corre-

    sponding sequence number, and verifies the message by

    comparing the transmitted hash value. Thus neighbors’ hash

    function detects a malicious node and secures the model

    from impersonation. However, as the network complex-

    ity increases, the sink node has to store many sequence

    numbers. Further, the sink node acts as a point of failure,

    and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow other

    malicious nodes to transmit the messages.

    In [147], the authors propose an authorization and au-

    thentication mechanism for LW IoT devices that improve

    the IoT network’s performance. The proposed mechanism

    is based on the public BC mechanism and uses a fog

    computing network to achieve the desired task. The system

    architecture is divided into two layers: the device layer

    and the fog layer. The device layer consists of the many

    low-powered and low computational devices responsible for

    generating the data in the network. The IoT devices can

    116

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    be grouped depending upon the customized functionality

    they perform. The fog nodes in a particular group perform

    the same functionality. On the other hand, the fog layer

    is a BC-enabled fog device connected to the internet for

    working together. The fog nodes perform the CM execution

    to validate the transactions and create the blocks. The

    mechanism proposes three phases -The initialization phase

    consists of registering the system and devices with the

    closest BC-enabled fog nodes. The device authentication

    phase involves authenticating the devices with the BC-

    enabled fog node by mapping the system ID, device ID, and

    public address. Device-to-device communication involves

    the secure transmission of the message between the same

    system’s fog nodes or different systems. Before the device-

    to-device communication, both the devices are authenticated

    by the BC-enabled fog node. After that, a block is created

    in the BC, and subsequently, a secure channel is established

    between the devices. However, this mechanism assumes that

    fog nodes and admin are trusted and that communication

    between fog devices and nodes is secure.

    In [148], the authors propose a node authentication model

    for the IoST(Internet of Sensor Things) based on the BC

    mechanism. The base station validates any node’s creden-

    tials whenever it performs any action in the network.The

    authors have employed identity authentication with PoA

    as the consensus approach to reduce computational costs.

    The miners are pre-selected, and following the authenti-

    cation request, the registered nodes are authenticated.The

    request contains IDNode(Node ID), MACAddrNode(MAC

    address), and ReputationNode(the reputation value assigned

    to a certain node based on its previous history in the

    network ), which are already stored on the BC. The au-

    thentication is carried out by comparing the credentials of

    nodes previously stored in the BC. The BC determines

    whether or not the credentials provided by nodes match

    the credentials currently stored in the BC. If the credentials

    match the information provided, the nodes are authenticated

    and broadcast as legitimate nodes. A SC is deployed on the

    base stations that track all the network transactions. The

    system model is predicated on two assumptions: Firstly,

    base stations are accepted as legitimate and provide secure

    services to consumers, and secondly, symmetric keys are

    securely transferred in the network.

    [149],

    based

    on

    BC-enabled

    fog

    nodes

    that

    inter-

    face with Ethereum SCs to authenticate users to access

    IoT devices.The major stakeholders include Administra-

    tors(responsible for controlling access permissions for IoT

    devices), End users(interested in requesting an IoT de-

    vice service), Fog nodes(for localized storage), and cloud

    servers(storing IoT data), all having direct access to SCs via

    an Ethereum client in the case of fog and cloud nodes, or via

    a front-end application/wallet in the case of administrators

    and end-users. IoT devices have unique Ethereum addresses

    (with public and private keys), but they lack connectivity

    and do not interact with SCs. The system interactions

    are divided into off-chain and on-chain. In the on-chain

    interactions, the admin constructs the SCs, registers the

    IoT devices, maps them to a fog node, and may grant

    end-users access to certain IoT devices. The SCs check

    the list of authorized users, and the user receives a SC

    acceptance token which it uses to authenticate itself off-

    chain. The authors have provided the security analysis of

    the architecture,but the cost analysis of utilizing Ethereum-

    based SCs is unaccounted for.

    In [150], propose a decentralized BC-based architecture

    with SCs to allow edge computing nodes to store IoT

    data and securely interact with one another.The archi-

    tecture is composed of 4 layers- Information aggrega-

    tion layer(consisting of IoT-like devices), Edge computing

    layer(consisting of edge devices with fair computation capa-

    bilities), Service supporting layer(responsible for provision

    of services), and Application layer.The collaboration with

    other edge computing nodes must first be certified by the

    edge computing nodes, which will result in the exchange of

    MicroCoins(introduced cryptocurrency) between members.

    The model uses a publish-subscribe mode, allowing users

    to access data across domains. The users or application

    developers first subscribe to the data publisher from the

    edge computing node pool for data exchange. The data

    publisher then supplies the subscription data and submits

    a transaction to the BC-enabled SC to manage the pre-set

    business model while providing the required data. The au-

    thors introduce a new CM called Proof-of-Edge computing

    to reach consensus among all edge computing nodes and

    avoid centralization. All corresponding operations must be

    documented in BC to obtain self and other domain audits.

    In [151], the authors propose integrating Network Function

    Virtualization(NFV), software-defined network(SDN), and

    BC to create a flexible and reliable routing architecture

    for IIoT. SDN and NFV are responsible for creating pro-

    grammable forwarding devices that create the network’s

    optimal routing policies. The controllers are secured using

    BCT and take decisions and collect the data from the

    nodes to detect mistrust. A secure path is acquired by

    adequately removing the malicious node from the IIoT

    network by periodic monitoring and collecting network

    data. Each controller has a distributed ledger, and malicious

    nodes are identified by calculating the network’s trust value

    during behavior authentication stored in the BCs. The

    synchronization reaches a consensus among various ledgers

    transmitted through a control channel. Different controllers

    handle routing requests through an access point. The exper-

    imental evaluation shows that the model outperforms the

    state-of-the-art systems in average delay over attacks and

    packet loss rate. However, the frequent calculations of trust

    values lead to substantial computational power, bringing

    overheads in the system, which must be addressed without

    compromising the model’s security.

    In [152], the authors propose a routing protocol for the

    wireless sensor network that uses BCT to make routing

    more efficient and secure. The nodes present in the network

    are treated as the coins, and the routing path for the message

    is treated as the transaction, which is subsequently added to

    the BC. Initially, all the nodes are owned by the sink and

    considered inactive, and the rest are active. When an event

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    117

    occurs, the nodes access the BC to find the optimal path to

    the sink. Dijkstra’s algorithm obtains the message’s optimal

    path by a cost function determined by signal and interfer-

    ence. This optimal path is the transaction to be added to the

    BC and transmit the message after eliminating malicious

    nodes detected by the BC security mechanism. The routing

    process is made secure by trusted cryptographic algorithms

    such as ECDSA224 and SHA512. While transmitting the

    message to the sink, the node seeks the ‘ownership’ of

    the path’s nodes transferred back after successfully sending

    the message. However, the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages. Complex calculations are involved in

    finding routes that increase the computational overhead and

    network cost.

    In [153], the authors propose a BC-assisted secure routing

    algorithm for a network based on 5G new radio for the

    swarm Unmanned Aircraft System(UAS) to prevent the

    disruptive attacks committed on UAS networking. The BC

    performs two main functions -Selecting the secure next

    hop for transmission of a packet from one to another

    and the authentication and verification of UASs. The BC

    distributed updated block digests to the whole swarm after

    a UAS is authenticated. The BC used is LW, which is

    different from the conventional BC distribution. Instead of

    using conventional mechanisms, the traffic status of UASs

    is leveraged to achieve a consensus known as Proof of

    Traffic(PoT). The neighborhood of UAS is decided based

    on the destination and record of the digest in BC, and each

    UAS in the swarm delivers packets to its neighbors with

    beamforming. The block digest records are checked so that

    the unauthenticated UAS are not chosen as hops. The attack-

    ers need the specific BC digest to launch an attack, which is

    computationally very expensive. PoT employs the passive

    broadcast for block synchronization, unlike conventional

    algorithms, which reduces the system’s overheads suitable

    for LW environments. However, the model assumes that the

    hackers cannot compromise a UAS in joining the swarm

    UAS networking. The untrusted UAS cannot recuperate

    the signal with side lopes leakage of beamforming without

    directional transmission.

    In [154], the authors propose a malware detection technique

    in IoT devices using Deep Learning (DL)and BCT, where

    SCs detect malicious applications. SC guides users’ and

    end-developers’ interactions, stores information about new

    apks, and enables tracking of malicious apps on the net-

    work. The malware features are shared and trained on DL

    models in android IoT devices. After the user uploads an

    app to the network, it is stored in an IPFS where the DL

    models extract features. The hash values obtained from the

    training models are stored in an immutable fashion on a BC

    network to prevent decompilation and repacking attacks by

    reverse engineering methods. When a user downloads a new

    app, the user sends the hash to the network for verification,

    where an SC decides whether the app is malicious or not.

    The model has been evaluated on 18,850 android appli-

    cations and 10,000 malware android packages and shows

    considerable efficiency. However, the analysis of bandwidth

    consumption by the IPFS based storage is not given, which

    is important, especially in the case of metered connections

    In [155], the authors propose a BC-based framework for

    detecting malware in mobile applications before down-

    loading. The model relies on dynamic and static analysis

    for detecting malware. The model uses two external and

    internal BCs. The internal private BC(IPB) contains feature

    extractors(FEs) to extend the dedicated internal private

    BC(DIPB). FE extracts information during the lifetime of an

    app. These features can be static, extracted from the file, or

    dynamic and extracted by monitoring the run time behavior.

    Each FE component is connected to a DIBP that tracks

    each app using the behavioral information. A dedicated

    external private BC(DECB) for each application contains

    scanning information of application versions. A determinant

    agent(DE) is part of the BC and based on the data in the

    BC, it classifies the app as malicious or not. DEs attach their

    decisions to DEPBs with relevant information. Although

    the dedicated BC for each app reduces the computational

    burden of one BC, it also increases the system’s overall

    complexity.

    In [156], the authors propose a distributed anti-malware

    protection mechanism to support a hybrid signature and

    anomaly-based detection model. When a new file is added,

    the users make a signed hash of the file corresponding

    hash is sent to the BC ledger. The verification is done on

    signature-based detection, and the system process and ports

    are checked for malicious activity. However, the signature-

    based verification suffers from detection evasion if the hash

    of the malicious file is changed. To avoid this, if the hash

    comparison does not match, a notification is sent to the

    users, and the system process and network ports are con-

    tinued to be examined. If any suspicious activity is found,

    the file is blocked from self-executing. The BC is updated

    with the hash of the malware file detected. This can prevent

    DDoS attacks where the malicious app may attempt to gain

    access to IoT devices. However, the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but not for resource-constrained IoT

    devices.

    In [157], the authors propose a three layer parallel dis-

    tributed architecture for storing and sharing IoT data-

    BC layer, Node layer, Distributed storage layer aimed to

    improve the scalabilty of BC-based systems. The data

    generated by IoT devices is encrypted, and the hash value

    of the data is generated and stored in the BC as its unique

    identity. BC is the system’s control layer and is responsible

    for validating transactionsand data access control and also

    provides a platform for SCs to support various applications.

    The raw data is encrypted locally and stored in multiple

    storage nodes across the distributed network using the

    Kademlia method so that the data host has no access to

    the original data. The encryption technique used is AES

    (Advanced encryption standard). The data owner adds a

    digital signature to the data block’s digest, allowing the

    data’s ownership to be authenticated. The efficiency analysis

    reveals that in a network of 2n nodes, retrieving any data

    requires a maximum of n steps.

    In [158], the authors propose a BC-based solution for the

    decentralized storage mechanism and secure data transmis-

    sion, in this case, a sensing image, in IoT networks. This

    paper proposes using an encryption algorithm for secure

    data transfer and an intelligent verification algorithm for

    data storage and signature verification. A blocking algo-

    rithm is employed for sensing an image, and an intelligent

    sensor divides the image using image sensing and block

    data partitioning. A public key generation algorithm is

    leveraged, and the smart image sensor securely transmits

    the key information to BC. The sensor signs the data

    blocks with different keys at different intervals and transmits

    the message to the server, where a signature verification

    algorithm is employed. If the signature is verified, the data

    block is stored. The theoretical analysis shows that the

    model is resistant to counterfeit, theft, replay, and DoS

    attacks. The BC uses only one public key to authenticate

    different blocks, reducing the cost, but the intelligent sensor

    calculates n+1 keys for n blocks and stores n keys.

    In [159], the authors propose a theoretical prototype of

    BC-based IoT architecture using a design science research

    approach. The approach aims to design a prototype for data

    center decision-making, simplicity, complete digitization,

    tamper resistance, heterogeneity, and authentication of BC

    data. The Raspberry Pi is configured as a client node

    for the Ethereum BC, containing the storage and compu-

    tational configuration layer. The model has three prime

    components- IoT data logger(senses the data), SCs (stores

    data, chain address of the devices, and records events),

    and the monitoring dashboard component(displays data to

    end-users, communicates with the SCs, and behaves as a

    mining node). The system considers Ethereum BC, where

    SCs are executed on a virtual machine to reduce costs. The

    accounts on Ethereum are classified as contract (contain

    balance and contract storage executed via a transaction sent

    to its unique address)and externally owned(refer to external

    agents and contain only balance). The prototype is designed

    for high data availability, parsimony, and modularity in

    IoT ecosystems essential for efficient DM, but the design

    encounters high operational costs and scalability issues.

    In [160], the authors propose a trusted DM scheme for

    sensitive data distribution and storage in EC. The ar-

    chitecture is divided into three layers- Edge device(Fog

    nodes), BC Network(to which data is committed), Edge

    nodes(provides services), and Cloud center layer(complex

    problem solving). BlockTDM is reliant on a multi-step mu-

    tual authentication scheme based on certificates. A modified

    PBFT - broadcast multi-signature-based CM is employed

    where a client commits the message to the endorsing

    pairs (EPs) and the management pair(PM). PM verifies the

    signature, the endorsing pairs simulate, and the result is

    broadcasted to an ordering service peer and delivered to

    the bookkeeper. A multichannel matrix-based architecture

    is considered for data protection for blocks on different

    channels and user-defined data encryption for interchannel

    security. The scheme employs Hyperledger Chaincode as

    an SC connected to the EPs and is invoked to process

    transactions and query over the protected BC data. SCs are

    designed for data of various kinds, such as multimedia and

    documents, to support specific block DM. The model is

    highly secure but has O(n2) communication complexity.

    In [161], the authors propose a BC and Deep reinforcement

    learning(DRL) based scheme for efficient DM to achieve

    high-quality data collection with limited mobile terminal

    (MT) energy resources and sensing range and secure data

    sharing in Industrial IoT. The model proposes collecting the

    data through a DRL approach fed to the BC network. The

    connection of each MT is validated, and data is encrypted

    using keys and digital signatures. BC integration ensures

    data security and reliability when MTs share data and

    prevents the systems from attacks. Multiple Ethereum nodes

    are distributed across a private chain that interacts with the

    SC deployed on the chain. A certification authority is set up

    to maintain the data’s reliability and authenticity to avoid

    fraudulent transactions by MTs. The model is tested on the

    severity of DoS and DDoS attacks, and it is that DDoS

    attacks have a 0.1 % worse impact than DoS attacks. The

    increase in MTs does not impact the network, but both

    the attacks affect the database as the transaction frequency

    increases affecting the data storage.

    1) Critical Analysis of the proposed architectures:

    The evaluation of these studied techniques reveals that

    a tradeoff exists between IoT security and other perfor-

    mance criteria. Most of the proposed frameworks have been

    carefully verified against several security metrics, but the

    cost issues for customers or businesses are not addressed.

    The model in [145] cannot be implemented on commercial

    IoT devices due to close-sourced hardware and software,

    and there are considerable CPU and memory overheads in

    the authentication stage. In the architecture presented in

    [146], the sink node has to store many sequence numbers

    as the network complexity increases. In [151], the frequent

    calculations of trust values lead to substantial computational

    power, bringing overheads to the system. In [152], complex

    calculations are involved in finding routes that increase

    the computational overhead and network cost. In [154],

    the analysis of bandwidth consumption by the IPFS-based

    storage is not given, which is important, especially in the

    case of metered connections. In [155], the dedicated BC

    for each app increases the system’s overall complexity. In

    [160], the model has a communication complexity of O(n2).

    Many architectures have ignored or not completely ad-

    dressed the issues of latency, scalability, energy consump-

    tion, computational power, or the security aspect of privacy

    leakage. Most methods restrict to a certain aspect of IoT

    security while ignoring the computational overheads of

    implementation on a large scale. The architecture of [139] is

    suitable for the low-scale implementation, but the network

    performance is compromised if the network complexity

    increases, creating latency and storage problems. The model

    is resistant to AC message tampering until one-third of

    the network is not compromised. The proposed model in

    [142] is for private networks and cannot be replicated

    on large-scale IoT systems without affecting the network

    performance. The architecture proposed in [144] suffers

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    119

    from latency issues when the number of endorsing and

    validating nodes increases. The design in [159] encounters

    high operational costs and scalability issues.

    The authentication, trustworthiness, and authorization in

    many BC-based architectures are achieved through SCs,

    introducing transactional costs. In [141], ACC consumes

    high execution and transaction energy. In [149], the security

    analysis is provided in-depth, but the cost analysis of

    utilizing Ethereum-based SCs is unaccounted for. Many

    architectures provide security but are not suitable in con-

    strained environments. In [156], the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but cannot be replicated for IoT

    devices.The architectures are not truly decentralized and

    run on some form of central scheme and are prone to

    security issues. In [146], the sink node acts as a point of

    failure, and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow

    other malicious nodes to transmit the messages. BC-based

    systems incur high storage costs too. In [161], the increase

    in MTs does not impact the network, but both the attacks

    affect the database as the transaction frequency increases

    affecting the data storage.

    Many architectures rely on assumptions that may not be

    practically true. The architecture presented in [138] runs

    on various assumptions, such as that all the management

    domains have the same number of user equipment, the min-

    ing is done after the propagation procedure ends, the SAMs

    have the same transmissibility to propagate transactions and

    mining time and that there are enough power resources to

    carry out the verifications. The architecture of [148] runs on

    the assumption that base stations are always legitimate and

    that symmetric keys are securely transmitted in the network.

    In [147], the mechanism assumes that fog nodes and admin

    are trusted and that communication between fog devices and

    nodes is secure. In [152], the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages.

    B. Security benefits of BIIT systems :

    Despite the limitations, there are significant benefits of

    BIIT systems. The information created by IoT frameworks

    is broadly significant and confidential, and BCT substan-

    tially increases the security in distributed networks. BIIT

    systems offer the following security merits:

    1)

    Data integrity and confidentiality: The transactions in

    BIIT systems are verified through a CM, and all the

    nodes have an identical copy of the ledger. The data

    and transactions are highly encrypted by leveraging

    cryptographic mechanisms intrinsic to the BC.

    2)

    Data provenance: BIIT systems offer traceability by

    keeping a historical record of the timestamp in the

    BC.

    3)

    Fault tolerance: In BIIT systems, the data is dis-

    tributed across multiple devices, and a single node

    failure does not disrupt the system’s functionality.

    This eliminates a single point of failure and makes

    the BIIT systems more robust than centralized IoT

    systems.

    4)

    Secure communication and resistance to attacks: CM

    prevents the malicious nodes from corrupting the

    system. Launching an attack requires leveraging high

    computational resources.

    5)

    Trust management: BCs bring trust in the commu-

    nicating nodes and, through SCs, provide rules that

    guide a user’s authorization. SCs invoke clauses in

    the event of mistrust and penalizes the user for the

    breach.

    6)

    Access control: BIIT systems provide uniform access

    across multiple IoT systems. In BIIT systems, the

    IoT device is coupled with a unique identifier, and

    efficient KM and AC mechanisms for interoperability

    are available.

    7)

    Removing third-party risks: BCs decentralize the

    structure authority and provide secure DM with a

    decentralized architecture. Thus, the data is not under

    the control of a private organization but distributed

    across a plurality of nodes.

    BIIT systems offer higher security than centralized IoT

    architectures. A comparison is given in Table V.

    9. Challenges, Open Issues, and Research Directions:

    BCT is emerging as a key paradigm for establishing

    trust, imparting security, auditing capability, and verifia-

    bility in systems. BIIT systems are secure but require a

    scalable architecture with sufficient throughput and low

    latency. IoT systems are constrained, and designing less

    intensive security measures for low-powered devices with

    low storage, computational, and network overheads are in

    progress. The constrained nature of IoT and other factors

    hinders the deployment of BIIT systems, briefly discussed

    below:

    1)

    Cost of IoT storage through SCs: In Ethereum SCs,

    the amount of computational work required to com-

    plete an operation in a transaction is measured in

    Gas units. The currency to pay for Gas units is Ether/

    gwei (1 gwei= 10-9 ethers). There is no fixed price

    set for the gas, and the sender enforces a gas limit

    in the transaction and specifies the gas cost. Miners

    mine the blocks which specify high gas prices. The

    price of Ethereum has risen from a single-digit USD

    value in 2015 to touching 2500 USD in 2021 [162].

    Suppose a transaction requires 100 million gas units

    with 1 gas unit set at 25 gwei; the corresponding

    price in dollars to complete the transaction would

    be 108x25x 10-9x2500=6250 USD. With more de-

    vices in the network, data storage complexity also

    increases. BCs store an immutable, permanent record

    of data, and with the increase in the nodes, the

    size of the chain also increases, which causes stor-

    age/memory concerns. Although BC eliminates the

    management costs in a system, it is considerably

    expensive to store data in a BC. Ethereum costs

    76000 USD per GB, which is very expensive for

    120

    IoT applications. The research is moving towards

    cost analysis and solutions for IoT storage through

    BC SCs. In [163], the authors investigate the storage

    costs of numeric data on BC through SCs. The data

    storage is conducted using two strategies. In scenario

    1, the data is stored in an array, and in Scenario

    2, the data is encoded into one variable using two

    methods- Encoding within SC and encoding outside

    SC. The experimental results show that encoding the

    data outside SC into one variable is cost-efficient

    compared to storing data in an array or encoding it

    into a variable within SC.

    2)

    Power consumption: IoT devices applyenergy-saving

    strategies such as “Sleep and Wake up” scheduling

    to increase the network lifetime. However, due to

    BC’s unique way of storing and continuous data

    processing, the energy consumed by such a system is

    considerably higher than conventional systems. The

    authors in [164] estimate the energy consumption of

    various cryptocurrencies. The processing power is

    measured in hash rates. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 and

    has a rated power network of 4291,366 KWwhich an

    IoT node cannot support. Mining is computationally

    expensive, which necessitates specialized machinery

    and massive quantities of electricity.It is challenging

    to run BC as a full node on IoT devices. Recent solu-

    tions suggest using edge computing to enable mobile

    devices to offload the mining work to the cloud.

    Edge computing can be incorporated to help mobile

    devices offload mining work to cloud resources.

    The authors in [165] propose a 4-layer BC-based

    framework for IoT where the devices and servers

    participate in BC via p2p communication. The end

    devices handle simple operations while more pow-

    erful servers support the complex operations in the

    top tiers at the edge/cloud.

    3)

    Network model in BC systems: The expansion of

    the BIIT system creates new requesting blocks. The

    requesting block and the state data must lead to

    a consistent system state, and the newer clients

    synchronize with the existing state. The majority

    of the BC-based traffic models are p2p. The au-

    thors of [55] categorize it into three types- Gos-

    sip Protocol, Kademlia Algorithm, and DAG. The

    gossip-based BCs offer relatively less latency and

    energy consumption but achieve data integrity at

    the cost of large message overheads [166]. The

    Kademlia algorithm works with lesser communica-

    tion overhead, and the resource location in DAG is

    guaranteed. Ethereum also employs p2p networking

    with no trusted intermediary. The nodes themselves

    act as the service and the service providers to en-

    sure data synchronization [167]. Ethereum follows

    a discovery protocol that allows the nodes to find

    each other. BlIT systems must satisfy consistency

    in an asynchronous network with reduced latency

    and increased security. The security of consensus

    depends on the underlying network. Studying the

    network extensively to determine what affects the

    performance of a p2p network is an important issue.

    In [168], the authors study the network structure

    of Ethereum by running a customized version of

    Ethereum’s Go client, GETH, for seven months.

    4)

    BC Security and Privacy vulnerabilities: BC-based

    systems provide high security to systems by making

    data tamper-proof. However, BC itself exhibits secu-

    rity vulnerabilities. The adversity tolerance is further

    reduced with modifications in CMs for LW environ-

    ments. Common security threats to BC include Pro-

    tocol attacks, Ellipse attacks, the chance of double-

    spending, Consensus protocol attacks, SC Vulner-

    abilities, Programming frauds, Private Key Leak-

    age, DDoS attacks, and other security issues[169],

    [170]. Employment of communication security pro-

    tocols such as Datagram transport layer security

    is resource-intensive and not suitable. Further, all

    transactions in the BC are transparent. By analyz-

    ing the patterns of transactions from a user, the

    anonymity of a user can be compromised and lead to

    potential front-running. For private communications,

    protocols such as Telehash or Whisper can be inte-

    grated. Privacy leakage can be countered through pri-

    vacy protection mechanisms such as Zero-knowledge

    proof, Attribute-based Encryption [171]. However,

    these cryptographic algorithms are highly resource-

    intensive and unaffordable in LW environments.

    5)

    SC Vulnerabilities: A fault in the SC could be caused

    by a simple typing error, a misinterpretation of the

    specification, or a more severe programming error.

    BC is irreversible, and a minor glitch has many

    ramifications for SC security and functionality. For

    example, the quantity of gas that the transactions

    contained in the block can utilize is limited to

    prevent the chains from growing beyond a point. If

    data is stored in variable-sized arrays and accessed

    through loops, the gas can get exhausted before

    committing a transaction. Miners are compensated,

    but the transaction is reversed. As a result, testing

    mechanisms for SCs is a critical problem. The test

    mechanism must inspect the SC on enough data

    for all malicious and non-malicious inputs before

    deployment to detect anomalies. Furthermore, be-

    cause IoT systems are distributed across multiple

    locations, retrieving data from various sources can

    cause the SCs to become overburdened. It’s difficult

    to fine-tune SCs for IoT LW applications. SCs are

    associated with a variety of other challenges. The

    legal enforcement of SCs, for example, is currently

    restricted. Dual integration of SCs with real-world le-

    gal contracts is one solution that has been proposed.

    6)

    IoT specific Consensus: The abilities of the existing

    CMs are limited when applied to IoT and have not

    been tested thoroughly. Conventional CMs, such as

    PoW, is resource-intensive and cannot run on IoT

    devices. Even a powerful IoT node such as Rasp-

    berry pi3 can only achieve 104 hashes per second,

    122

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    while a Bitcoin network can conduct around 1019

    hashes per second. Integration of full BC nodes in

    IoT is in the nascent stage. Malicious attacks on

    lightweight CMs with low adversity tolerance can

    prevent valid transactions. A potential solution is

    to limit the consensus to the edge / decentralized

    cloud, while IoT nodes save only the hash values,

    but this increases the storage overheads on the edge.

    Furthermore, the interoperability and authentication

    standards for edge devices are limited.

    7)

    Throughput, Latency, Scalability, and Network com-

    plexity:BC systems do not scale well if the network

    size increases massively. The network efficiency re-

    duces as the network scales up and more authen-

    tication requests are handled, leading to network

    congestion. The growth of the chain further leads

    to bandwidth problems. The mobility of IoT devices

    also affects BC performance. BCs are inherently

    latency tolerant, and the mining time is induced to

    secure the networks further, which is unacceptable

    in real-time IoT systems such as IoV. A poten-

    tial solution is to integrate IPFS, AI, and ML to

    complement the BC. Off-Chain solutions can be

    integrated to increase the transaction throughput.

    IoT big data is posing challenges in real-time data

    delivery. Integration of ML in BIIT systems for IoT

    Big data analytics is hindered by storage, latency,

    scalability, and other challenges. Further investiga-

    tion is required to analyze the overheads introduced

    in BC-IPFS integration. Normalization and compres-

    sion techniques explicitly designed for BIIT systems

    where BC power is leveraged are required.

    8)

    Compatibility and Adoption: BC is an emerging

    technology and lacks standardization laws. Access

    control legislation is an issue in public BCs. IoT data

    is heterogeneous, and the diversity of IoT devices

    implies the need for different network protocols. Pro-

    tocol conversions to enable smooth communication

    are especially costly in BIIT systems. The large-

    scale adoption of BIIT applications needs significant

    infrastructural changes. A generic BC-IoT architec-

    ture is needed to bridge the gap between IoT service

    providers and BC. IoT service providers must modify

    the underlying naming and discovery schemes to

    comply with the BC mechanism. Laws and regula-

    tions concerning information security govern the IoT

    domain, and many countries have strict legislative

    rules regarding cryptocurrencies.

    A. Research Directions

    We present the following research directions based on

    our thorough study of the domain.

    1)

    1. Cost reduction strategies: The rising cost of

    Ethereum is impeding the use of BC in IoT. More

    research into strategies to lower the cost of BC

    adoption in IoT is needed. Given IoT Big data’s con-

    cerns, more efficient data representations that allow

    low-cost SC operations require further investigation

    to make large-scale IoT-BC systems commercially

    viable.

    2)

    IoT-BC Traffic Models: Performing large-scale data

    collection and traffic analysis of growing-BC chains

    is an understudied topic due to large-scale simulation

    and time requirements. The security of the consensus

    protocols is based on the assumption of efficient

    p2p overlay network operations. More research is

    needed to understand the parameters that influence

    the properties of p2p networks.

    3)

    Testing Mechanisms for SCs: The voids in the

    SCs can expose BC security. SCs are vulnerable to

    mining pool attacks because they are open source

    to all parties involved. Once deployed, the SC is

    irreversible and cannot be repaired in the event of

    a virus or a hacking attack. Thus, validating and

    devising unerring testing mechanisms for SCs and

    running them on sufficient data is an important

    research direction.

    4)

    At the Edge Consensus: IoT devices have limited

    computational and networking capabilities; thus, run-

    ning BC as a full node is difficult. It is critical

    to protect IoT suitable CMs from attackers from

    gaining control of the majority of hash power. De-

    signing IoT suitable mechanisms with good adversity

    tolerance and low latency is an open issue and a

    strong research direction.

    5)

    Integration with computing platforms:Due to the

    constrained nature of IoT devices, Fog /Cloud

    servers are added at top tiers, storing the entire BC

    information for transaction validation. It is necessary

    to enable IoT devices to push transactions to the

    BC without centralized block endorsement groups.

    Designing architectures for such integration without

    compromising the security and privacy concerns is a

    strong research direction.

    6)

    Network Configuration: There is no standard archi-

    tecture for BIIT systems. Integration of the cloud

    and the edge at a higher level is critical. Config-

    uring BCs at the node, edge, and cloud levels and

    load balancing and network congestion control for

    addressing increased validation requests are open

    research issues.

    7)

    Convergence of BC and ML: BC-based systems

    can benefit from the addition of MLalgorithms. SCs

    can be used to create a reward-based mechanism

    for training ML models. The potential of ML-BC

    integration has yet to be fully realized, but it is a

    promising future direction.

    8)

    Convergence of BC and IPFS: With IPFS, BC only

    saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down the

    chain development drastically. Through SCs, BC can

    allow access-controlled file sharing and secure stor-

    age of cryptographic hashes of IPFS. It is crucial to

    analyze the latency introduced in the IPFS primarily

    due to the contact with BC and the consequences on

    LW operations.

    9)

    Securing BC and Transactional privacy: Pattern anal-

    ysis of transparent transactions exposes users’ pri-

    vacy. More research is needed to protect BC-based

    AC systems from security threats. Thus, a potential

    research direction is developing LW cryptographic

    algorithms for BCs to protect transactional and user

    privacy in BC-based IoT systems.

    10. Conclusion

    The disruptive attacks on IoT networks are predicted to

    be more severe in the future due to the advanced capability

    of B5G and 6G networks. The unique properties of BCT

    for enabling a p2p network with no centralized stakeholder

    controlling the system enable it to be a perfect security

    solution. BCs, through SCs, provide fine-grained AC by

    providing global functions of authentication, authorization,

    and KM, besides providing a distributed architecture for

    secure storage of hashes, verification rules, sensor data, and

    other information. However, IoT devices are constrained

    and require an LW implementation of CMs to bear the

    computational, storage, power, and network overheads. This

    paper presents a comprehensive comparison of BC solutions

    for IoT systems and concludes that BC can provide efficient

    KM and AC, node authentication, routing security, and se-

    curely store the domain-specific information. A detailed sur-

    vey of recent research on security enhancement, consensus,

    applications, integration with ML, and computing platforms

    is presented. We discuss IPFS, ML, and EC can facilitate

    BC as a crucial enabling technology for IoT. Through IPFS-

    enabled BCs, the growth of the chain is restricted by only

    storing hashes on the BC, and the AC list is maintained

    by SCs, enforced by the updated IPFS software. MEC is

    being considered to be a potential approach for achieving

    consensus for mobile users, facilitating BC applications in

    future mobile IoT systems.

    The convergence of BC and ML for IoT can enable ac-

    curate data analytics. 6G systems are expected to create

    a massive convergence of IoT, AI, EC, Quantum ML,

    and BCT for fast and secure systems that can support

    a plethora of devices. IoT systems are rapidly evolving,

    and as the number of network nodes grows, the tradeoffs

    between energy consumption, security, latency, throughput,

    and scalability become more complex. We conclude that

    BC and IoT technology have evolved separately and for

    futuristic IoT systems to reach their full potential, exten-

    sive research is needed in two domains- a) Blockchain as

    enabling technology in IoT and b)Enabling technologies

    for BC-based IoT. Challenges such as the rising cost of

    Ethereum, power consumption of IoT nodes, SC security,

    and legislation issues are hindering the large-scale adoption

    of BC-based IoT. Extensive research is needed on the

    parameters affecting the network properties, cost reduction

    strategies, encoding, traffic modeling, off-chain solutions,

    network configuration, transactional privacy, SC testing, and

    BC security, especially in LW environments.

    How to Cite this Article {} BibTeX Source Abstract: This paper presents intuitive
    directions for field research by introducing a ground-breaking IoT-ML-driven intelligent
    farm management platform. This study’s main goal is to address agricultural difficulties
    by providing a thorough, integrated solution. This work makes a variety of important
    contributions. By utilizing cutting-edge technology like IoT and Machine Learning
    (ML), it first improves conventional farm management procedures. Farmers now have
    the capacity to remotely monitor and regulate irrigation management thanks to
    sensor-based real-time data. Second, based on data gathered from agricultural
    fields, our machine learning model offers improved water control management and
    fertilizer use recommendations, maximizing production while minimizing resource
    usage. The suggested solution also uses blockchain technology to create a safe,
    decentralized network that guarantees data integrity and defends against threats.
    We also introduce energy harvesting technology to address the issue of continuous
    energy supply for IoT devices, which lessens the load on farmers by removing the
    requirement for additional batteries. We achieved 89.5% accuracy in our proposed
    machine learning model. The suggested model would provide a variety of services
    to farmers, including pesticide recommendations and water motor control via mobile
    applications and a cloud database. Keywords: Smart agriculture; machine learning;

    \ 65 \n \n \n \n \n[vi] \nABSTRACT \n \nDigital agriculture proposes to revolutionize\
    \ the processes of production, \nmarketing, and consumption within food systems\
    \ through the use of tools that collect, \nstore, analyze, and share information\
    \ digitally. While its proponents emphasize potential \nbenefits, such as improved\
    \ technical efficiency, resource allocation, and reduced \ntransaction costs,\
    \ the understanding of the risks and challenges associated with its \nimplementation\
    \ remains limited. \nThis qualitative study focuses on exploring the social and\
    \ ethical implications of \ndigital agriculture technologies and their specific\
    \ impact on small-scale farmers. Digital \nagriculture operates at the intersection\
    \ of technology and food systems, presenting a \ncritical challenge due to the\
    \ non-neutrality of technology intersecting with an already \nhighly concentrated,\
    \ centralized, and globalized food system. Understanding how these \ntechnologies\
    \ can effectively serve resource-limited small-scale farmers and prevent \nfurther\
    \ marginalization is urgent. \nThis study investigates the current state of digital\
    \ agriculture technologies \navailable in Colombia and analyzes the perspectives\
    \ of Colombian promoters regarding \nthe promises, dangers, and implications of\
    \ these technologies. The review of the \nColombian case reveals an emerging sector\
    \ with a variety of digital products and \nservices, driven by a mix of public\
    \ and private actors, including startups, medium-sized \nenterprises, and large\
    \ corporations. The perspectives of Colombian promoters \npredominantly align\
    \ with an optimistic narrative, emphasizing the positive outcomes of \nefficiency\

    \ applicable knowledge for academia, practitioners, and the \ncommunity alike.\
    \ Its aim is to empower those with less power and agency, especially \nsmall-scale\

    \ \nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION AND OUTLINE \n \nAgricultural digitalization is\
    \ inevitable; what is unknown is how dynamic and \ninclusive it will be.  \nECLAC,\
    \ FAO, IICA (2021:89). The Outlook for Agriculture and Rural Development in the\
    \ \nAmericas: A Perspective on Latin America and the Caribbean 2021-2022. \n \n\
    The newest agricultural revolution is happening today with promises to change\
    \ \norganization and relations along each step of the agri-food system and ultimately\
    \ \n“transform fundamentally” every part of it (Trendov et al., 2019: 2). The\
    \ multitude of \npossibilities for digital agriculture is impressive. It includes\
    \ farmers receiving specific \ntechnical advice on pests through mobile phones.\
    \ Farmers deciding where and when to \nuse fertilizers after considering data\
    \ provided by sensors. Farmers assessing damages \nafter natural disasters using\
    \ imagery captured by drones. Farmers making choices on \nwhen to sell and to\
    \ whom after considering marketplace data. Farmers fulfilling \nrequirements for\
    \ organic certification while using an app. Buyers verifying through \nblockchain\
    \ that small farmers are properly receiving the premium price they pay. \nConsumers\
    \ and farmers bargaining directly through marketplaces. Cooperatives using \n\
    current and historical aggregate data on their members’ farm productivity to understand\
    \ \nthe effectiveness of a specific intervention. While the benefits of this technology\
    \ are \nwidely recognized and promoted, its significant risks, albeit lesser-known,\
    \ are also \nsignificant and should not be overlooked. This research is about\
    \ the broader implications \nof these technologies for small farmers.  \nThe mainstream\
    \ narrative suggests that access to services provided by digital \nagriculture\
    \ will improve efficiency, profitability, and sustainability through a reduction\
    \ \nof transaction costs and an increase in allocative and technical efficiency\
    \ (Schroeder, \nLampietti & Elabed, 2021). In this view, data provided by digital\
    \ agricultural \ntechnologies will allow for a better allocation of physical,\
    \ natural, and human resources \n \n[2] \nwhile reducing transaction costs for\
    \ searching, contracting, monitoring, and \nenforcement. The narrative around\
    \ digital technologies is optimistic. In high-level \ndocuments —published by\
    \ the World Bank, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization \n(FAO), and the\
    \ Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)— \nthese technologies\
    \ are portrayed as a solution to tackle the global food shortage (Lajoie-\nO’Malley\
    \ et al., 2020). In media coverage and social media, agriculture’s digitalization\
    \ is \ndominated by positive arguments and emotions (Mohr & Höhler, 2023; Ancín,\
    \ Pindando \n& Sánchez, 2022). \nAcross the world, there is a skyrocketing interest\
    \ in this sector; global investment \nwent from $16.9 billion in 2018 to $26,1\
    \ billion in 2020 to $51.7 billion in 2021 \n(AgFunder, 2019; 2021; 2022). Nowadays,\
    \ all kinds of public and private actors are \nactively promoting and financing\
    \ the advancement of digital products and services. In \ndeveloping regions, the\
    \ increasing interest in these technologies combines efforts by \nseveral actors\
    \ united by the transformative promise of digital agriculture. For example, \n\
    since 2017, FAO and Telefonica —a multinational telecommunications company with\
    \ \nheadquarters in Spain— have worked together to leverage Telefonica digital\
    \ technologies \nby farmers in Colombia and Honduras (FAO, 2017). In 2020, the\
    \ Inter-American \nInstitute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) signed an agreement\
    \ with Precision \nAgriculture for Development (PAD) —a non-profit organization\
    \ co-founded by 2019 \nNobel Prize for Economics, Michael Kremer— to use their\
    \ proven model for mobile-\nphone-based agricultural extension across Latin America.\
    \ In May 2022, the IICA \norganized a Digital Agriculture Week with Bayer, Microsoft,\
    \ and the World Bank as co-\nsponsors; this was a space “to exchange and promote\
    \ ideas and thereby accelerate the \ndigital transformation of agriculture in\
    \ the Americas.” (IICA, 2022) \n \n[3] \nDespite a positive overall outlook on\
    \ digital agriculture, concerns about these \ntechnologies’ potential unintended\
    \ consequences and impacts are arising. Multilateral \npromoters such as the World\
    \ Bank Group (2019) have warned that digital technologies’ \nbenefits should not\
    \ be considered a panacea. FAO (Trendov et al., 2019) expressed that \nto maximize\
    \ opportunities and minimize risks in the development of digital agriculture,\
    \ \ngaps in policymaking and regulation, the economic and gender gap, the skill\
    \ gap, and the \n‘digital divide’ should be addressed. Multilaterals also are\
    \ concerned about the \nconcentration of knowledge, power, and revenue in the\
    \ hands of those who develop and \nown digital solutions and data and the potential\
    \ for exacerbating existing inequalities \n(World Bank Group, 2019; Trendov et\
    \ al., 2019; ECLAC, FAO, IICA, 2021).  \nSocial movements advocate for a better\
    \ understanding of the multiple \nimplications of digitalization. For instance,\
    \ the Nyéléni Forum on Food Sovereignty \nadvocates for transparency in identifying\
    \ the actors responsible for developing these \ntechnologies and their objectives.\
    \ This initiative seeks to reveal who controls the \ntechnologies and, consequently,\
    \ the right to utilize the generated data. Ultimately, the \nforum aspires to\
    \ use this information to shape the governance and regulation of these \ntechnologies\
    \ more effectively (Nyéléni Forum for Food Sovereignty, 2019). The Campo y \n\
    Agro Working Group is asking if large corporations will control the digitalization\
    \ process \nor if it will be governed in a more participatory manner (Via Campesina,\
    \ 2021). They \nplace the public interest and the welfare of the majority as top\
    \ priorities. ETC Group —a \nnon-profit organization monitoring the impact of\
    \ emerging technologies and corporate \nstrategies on agriculture— highlights\
    \ the risks of concentration in this sector and the \nconcern these new technologies\
    \ could disenfranchise vulnerable people while \nstrengthening people in positions\
    \ of power (Mooney, 2018; ETC Group, 2022).  \n \n[4] \nSocial scientists have\
    \ pointed out how paths of technologies could reproduce \nglobal asymmetries,\
    \ the imbalances of power related to decisions on data ownership, and \nthe lack\
    \ of policy interventions on digital technologies implications (Rotz et al., 2019;\
    \ \nRotz et al., 2019a; Bronson & Knezevicj, 2016; Bronson, 2019; Carolan, 2017;\
    \ Duncan, \n2018; Marquis, 2020; Klerkx, Jakku & Labarthe, 2019).  \nThese concerns\
    \ lie in the problematic intersection between technology and food \nsystems, where\
    \ digital agriculture takes place. On the one hand, technology is never \nneutral;\
    \ there are specific interests and intentions at all stages of the development\
    \ \nprocess, including how it is developed, by whom, who will use it, and how\
    \ it may be used. \nDigital technology’s means and ends are value-laden (Bronson,\
    \ 2022). On the other, \ndigital agriculture technologies are being introduced\
    \ into a food system that is highly \nconcentrated, centralized, and globalized\
    \ (Hendrickson, Howard & Constance, 2019). At \nthis intersection, the concern\
    \ is that introducing new technologies into an already \nunequal food system could\
    \ further marginalize vulnerable farmers while reinforcing the \npower of those\
    \ in privileged positions. Identifying and understanding the social aspects \n\
    tied to these technologies is the first step to ensure that technologies will\
    \ successfully \nserve small and limited-resource farmers. \nPaying attention\
    \ to these technologies’ implications is urgent, especially when \ninvestments\
    \ are skyrocketing and narratives surrounding them heavily showcase their \npositive\
    \ potential. Even though the scholarship considering the dynamics and impacts\
    \ of \ndigital agricultural technologies is growing (Rotz et al., 2019; Rotz et\
    \ al., 2019a; Bronson \n& Knezevicj, 2016; Bronson, 2018; Carolan, 2017; Duncan,\
    \ 2018; Marquis, 2020; \nEastwood et al.,2019) and advancing in the definition\
    \ of a research agenda (Klerkx et al., \n2019; van der Burg et al., 2019; Ingram\
    \ et al., 2022; Bellon-Maurel et al., 2022), their \nempirical work has focused\
    \ on North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, \n \n[5] \nleaving the\
    \ understanding of developing regions still unexplored. This dissertation \nresponds\
    \ to this gap and aims to offer a critical empirical view of the digital agriculture\
    \ \nsituation in Colombia.  \nThis research highlights the importance of localized\
    \ approaches, recognizes that \nthese technologies do not have the same impact\
    \ everywhere, and that the implications \nfor different actors and regions vary\
    \ in their urgency and importance. An understanding \nof where technologies are\
    \ situated in, designed in, and how they unfold in specific \ninteractions of\
    \ power structures, market and institutional arrangements, science and \nsociety\
    \ relationships, and rural development projects can lead to unraveling how and\
    \ \nunder which circumstances these technologies could fulfill their promise.\
    \ \n  \nResearch Aims and Research Questions \nThrough a qualitative inquiry,\
    \ in this dissertation, I explore the empirical \nsituation of available digital\
    \ agricultural technologies in Colombia and what implications \nit poses to small\
    \ farmers. This involves the following specific questions: \n1. What is the spectrum\
    \ of socio-ethical implications of digital agricultural \ntechnologies, and which\
    \ are can be relevant for small farmers in the Colombian \ncontext? (Chapter two)\
    \ \n2. What is the current state of available digital agricultural technologies\
    \ in Colombia \nand what are their potential implications for small farmers? (Chapter\
    \ three) \n3. What are Colombian promotors’ views on digital agricultural technologies’\
    \ \npromises, perils, and implications for small farmers? (Chapter four) \n4.\
    \ What must be considered in the Colombian context by multiple actors to ensure\
    \ \ndigital technologies support small farmers? (Chapter four) \n \n[6] \n \n\
    Pragmatism and political economy lens  \nThis dissertation is inspired by a commitment\
    \ to research that advances \nacademic scholarship, offers applicable insights\
    \ to practitioners and the community, and \nis useful for those facing less power\
    \ and agency. I used a pragmatic approach and a \npolitical economy lens in this\
    \ research.  \nPragmatism and political economy are significant traditions within\
    \ the Missouri \nSchool of Rural Sociology. In its beginnings, under the intellectual\
    \ leadership of William \nD. Heffernan, the Missourian School advanced on three\
    \ fronts: a) research as a \ncomponent of political action, b) fact gathering\
    \ as a starting point for the construction of \nknowledge and political statements,\
    \ and c) substantive democracy as the desired \noutcome of scientific investigation\
    \ (Bonanno, 2008). In this sense, the Missouri School \ntradition inspires this\
    \ work. I aim to support the problem framing on the implications of \ndigital\
    \ agricultural technologies, offering analysis and empirical evidence that can\
    \ be \nused to understand and influence the trajectories of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in \nplaces such as Colombia. \nPragmatism is a philosophical view\
    \ developed within American thought. \nDeveloped mainly by Holmes, Peirce, James,\
    \ and Dewey (Snarey & Olson, 2003), it \nconsiders that ideas are not absolute\
    \ truths looking to be discovered. Pragmatism \nsimultaneously rejects positivism\
    \ and anti-positivism because “to a pragmatist, the \nmandate of science is not\
    \ to find truth or reality, the existence of which is perpetually in \ndispute,\
    \ but to facilitate human problem-solving” (Powell, 2001, as cited by Pansiri,\
    \ \n2006). In this sense, the assessment of a theory is intrinsically tied to\
    \ its ability to solve \nhuman problems. Prasad (2021) summarizes four principles\
    \ at this philosophy’s core. \nFirst is the idea that there are no fixed foundations\
    \ to build on normative conclusions. \n \n[7] \nThe world is encountered and known\
    \ through an evolving, dynamic, and changing \nhuman experience and cognition.\
    \ Second, although normative conclusions cannot be \nachieved, there is a need\
    \ for provisional forms to solve actual problems that researchers \nshould embrace.\
    \ Third, these temporary forms should be judged by the specific \ncommunities\
    \ affected by those problems. And four is the relevance of the practical \nconsequences\
    \ of the theory. For pragmatists, considering the practical implications of a\
    \ \ntheory is the only way to assess it.   \nA political economy lens is useful\
    \ in the context of a pragmatist view. It offers a \nstarting point to analyze\
    \ social problems, paying attention to the structure and the \nhistorical, political\
    \ and economic forces behind them.  If we follow the Heffernan \nexample of fact-gathering\
    \ and building knowledge that reflects facets of problems shared \nby a specific\
    \ community, political economy offers a container to start with. This \ninterpretative\
    \ lens runs through my research and defines my decisions on qualitative \napproaches\
    \ and methods. A political economy approach presupposes that political and \n\
    economic factors are interwoven; in this view, political institutions, laws, and\
    \ power \nrelations affect economic decision-making and outcomes, and economic\
    \ conditions and \ndevelopment shape political structures and behavior. A political\
    \ economy lens helps to \n“see technology not as benign or neutral but as a reflection\
    \ of capitalism and an \ninstrument of power” (Dauvergne, 2020, p7). Through this\
    \ lens, I pay specific attention \nto identifying winners and losers —who is most\
    \ likely to obtain disproportionate benefits \nand who is not—, and the social\
    \ costs these technologies could impose on marginalized \ncommunities.   \nSeveral\
    \ food and agriculture scholars have used a political economy lens to \nexplore\
    \ the implications of technological developments in agricultural contexts and\
    \ \ncalled attention to specific aspects (Busch et al., 1991). In their view on\
    \ precision \n \n[8] \nfarming, Wolf and Buttel (1996) pay attention to the structure\
    \ of investments and the \nmodes of production that benefit from technologies;\
    \ they point out that these \ntechnologies emerged in a context where public sector\
    \ investments in agricultural \nresearch, extension, and information transfers\
    \ are decreasing worldwide, creating a \nspace where private firms can shape the\
    \ sector’s development and trajectories. They \nbring to the forefront how precision\
    \ farming benefits centralized agribusiness and \nsupports a monocultural production\
    \ practice. \nUsing the concept of Food Regime —a notion used in political economy\
    \ \nexplaining how the global food system is shaped by the interactions between\
    \ various \npolitical and economic actors— Prause, Hackfort & Lindgren (2020)\
    \ evaluate the \npromises of digitalization in the context of the third regime,\
    \ a period signed by a more \nmarket-oriented system and a promotion of an increased\
    \ liberalization of trade and \ninvestment in agriculture. They conclude that\
    \ digitalization is happening along the entire \nagri-food system and is bringing\
    \ into focus characteristics of a third regime, which allows \nagri-food companies\
    \ to use data to increase control over farmers. Using a similar \napproach and\
    \ promoting a dialogue between political economy and critical agrarian \nstudies,\
    \ Hackfort (2021) unpacks five patterns of inequality linked to digital technologies\
    \ \nin agriculture, namely, i) control over technology deployment, ii) distribution\
    \ of benefits, \niii) sovereignty over data and hardware, iv) inequalities in\
    \ knowledge and skills, and v) \ncapacity to define and solve problems.  \nUsing\
    \ a political economy lens, Rotz et al. (2019) reflect on the digitalization \n\
    process, and the winners and losers created. They warn that deploying these \n\
    technologies would reinforce the current political and economic trends characterized\
    \ by \nconcentration, market integration, and value majorly captured by powerful\
    \ actors. Their \nanalysis shows data governance and technology production as\
    \ the main challenges to be \n \n[9] \naddressed. They also suggest that open,\
    \ cooperative, and appropriate technology are \npotential pathways to advance\
    \ fairness in the production of digital data.  \nMethods  \nTo explore the empirical\
    \ situation of available digital agricultural technologies in \nColombia and their\
    \ implications for small farmers, I used case study research as a \nqualitative\
    \ approach. Case studies offer the possibility to address an event or entity with\
    \ \nidentifiable boundaries and provide an in-depth understanding of a specific\
    \ context (Yin, \n2009). Two main characteristics make Colombia an interesting\
    \ setting for this research. \nFirst, digital agriculture is a relevant promise\
    \ within the country, and the ecosystem of \nactors supporting it is flourishing,\
    \ but without being the regional leader (Viton et al., \n2019). Second, Colombia\
    \ has a complex socioeconomic dynamic including a post-conflict \nsetting, high\
    \ inequality rates, and a profound rural-urban divide which offers a rich \nscenario\
    \ to see tensions and clashes.  \nI adopted a broad definition of digital agriculture\
    \ which encompasses “any form \nof information and communication technologies\
    \ (ICTs) used in agriculture, either for \nautomated or non-automated decision-making\
    \ and practices” (Duncan, Abdulai & \nFraser, 2021. p139). This includes a wide\
    \ range of technologies, from basic mobile apps \nproviding information to advanced\
    \ systems that use data to control equipment. This \ndefinition was chosen because,\
    \ in countries like Colombia, the promotion of \ndigitalization in agriculture\
    \ encompasses a broad spectrum of technologies, ranging from \nsimple apps and\
    \ text messaging systems to cutting-edge innovations like blockchain, \nvirtual\
    \ reality, robotics, and A.I. systems for soil analysis. \nAbout Colombia \nColombia\
    \ is home to 48 million people, has 32 departments —the equivalent of \nstates\
    \ in U.S.—, and in 2021, reported an estimated GDP per capita of 6,100 USD (World\
    \ \n \n[10] \nBank, 2021). It is internationally well-known for being one of the\
    \ world’s most biodiverse \ncountries and the host of 10% of the global biodiversity\
    \ (Hanson et al., 2009). In \naddition, Colombia created a Peace Accord that in\
    \ 2016 ended an armed conflict that \nlasted 50 years.  \nAgriculture is vital\
    \ to Colombia's economy, food security, rural livelihoods, \nbiodiversity, and\
    \ social and political stability. In 2020, the sector accounted for \napproximately\
    \ 6.7% of the country's GDP, generated over $9 billion in revenue through \nexports,\
    \ and employed around 16.7% of the labor force (World Bank, 2021b). Colombia's\
    \ \ndiverse agricultural production, including staple crops and tropical fruits,\
    \ contributes to \nfood security (FAO, 2021). Approximately 30% of the population\
    \ resides in rural areas, \nwhere small-scale farming is predominant, with around\
    \ 80% of farms being smaller than \n5 hectares (World Bank, 2021a; FAO, 2018).\
    \ Colombia, as the second most biodiverse \ncountry in the world, has committed\
    \ to preserving its biodiversity through initiatives like \nthe National Biodiversity\
    \ Strategy and Action Plan (WWF, n.d.; Ministry of Environment \nand Sustainable\
    \ Development, 2012). The importance of agriculture in achieving social \nand\
    \ political stability is further highlighted by the 2016 peace agreement with\
    \ FARC, \nwhich included provisions for rural development and land reform (Colombian\
    \ \nGovernment & FARC, 2016). Promoting sustainable agricultural practices and\
    \ \nsupporting small-scale farmers is crucial for Colombia's long-term growth\
    \ and \ndevelopment. \nSmall farmers in Colombia play a vital role in the country's\
    \ economy, \ncontributing significantly to food security and rural employment\
    \ (FAO, 2019). Despite \ntheir importance, small farmers, typically operating\
    \ on landholdings of less than 5 \nhectares, often encounter numerous challenges\
    \ that hinder their productivity and \ncompetitiveness. Some of the most pressing\
    \ barriers include limited access to credit, \n \n[11] \ninadequate infrastructure,\
    \ insufficient technological resources, and a lack of training and \ntechnical\
    \ assistance. Furthermore, they are frequently subjected to volatile market prices\
    \ \nand often have weak bargaining power due to their small-scale production (Roa-Clavijo,\
    \ \n2021). \nColombia is a country with unequal living conditions between its\
    \ urban and rural \npopulations. Historically, rural poverty has been higher than\
    \ the urban and national \naverage. In 2010, rural poverty was 50.8%, compared\
    \ to 29.7% nationally and 22.9% in \nurban areas (DNP, 2011). The trend remained\
    \ similar in 2021, with rural poverty at \n31.9%, higher than the national average\
    \ of 27.7% and the urban average of 21% (DNP, \n2022). This poverty is reflected\
    \ in the lack of access to basic needs such as housing, \nservices, and education.\
    \ According to the 2018 National Population and Housing Census, \n14.28% of Colombians\
    \ lived with unsatisfied basic needs, with the average for rural \nhouseholds\
    \ being 30.48% compared to 9.53% for urban households (DANE, 2018). The \npoverty\
    \ in the country is accompanied by inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient,\
    \ \nwhich was estimated at 0.523 nationally, 0.510 in urban areas, and 0.455 in\
    \ rural areas \nin 2021 (World Bank, 2022). In the same year, 47% of the rural\
    \ population was \nconsidered poor, 45.3% vulnerable, and only 9.0% middle class.\
    \ \nThis poverty/inequality is one of the five interlinked challenges that face\
    \ \nColombia’s food system, which also includes persisting hunger and malnutrition;\
    \ \nexpansion of the agricultural frontier as a threat to biodiversity; tensions\
    \ behind the \nimplementation of the Peace Accord signed in 2016, and its first\
    \ point addressed in the \nComprehensive Rural Reform; and the battle for food\
    \ provisioning (Roa-Clavijo, 2021). \nCurrently, digital technologies are considered\
    \ an enabler of agricultural \ntransformation in the Colombian political arena.\
    \ In the National Development Plan \nproposed for 2022-2026 (DNP, 2022a), the\
    \ Colombian government includes several \n \n[12] \nangles within the pillar of\
    \ Human Rights to Food for the promotion of digital \ntechnologies for the agricultural\
    \ sector. In this national plan, digital technologies are \nconsidered tools for\
    \ enabling more and best food production; facilitators for the \nbetterment of\
    \ supply chains, leading to more efficient and secure value chains, benefiting\
    \ \nsmall farmers; and an instrument of logistics and infrastructure improvement\
    \ to reduce \nlosses of food production. Speaking specifically on the technological\
    \ extension to small \nfarmers, the Plan makes explicit the expectation of digital\
    \ technologies as an agent of \nchange,  \n“Se debe incentivar el uso intensivo\
    \ de datos y la adopción de tecnologías digitales \npara transitar hacia una\
    \ economía agraria e industrial intensiva en conocimiento, \nque facilite procesos\
    \ de reconversión productiva local y de trazabilidad del \ndesempeño de las\
    \ pequeñas unidades productivas”  \n[The intensive use of data and the adoption\
    \ of digital technologies should be \nencouraged to move towards a knowledge-intensive\
    \ agrarian and industrial \neconomy, which facilitates processes of local productive\
    \ reconversion and \ntraceability of the performance of small productive units]\
    \ (DNP, 2022a p.120) \n \nData collections and Data analysis procedures \nData\
    \ collection was conducted in three stages and included several data collection\
    \ \nforms between spring 2021 and fall 2022. \nIn the first stage, I did a literature\
    \ review to address question one —what is the \nspectrum of socio-ethical implications\
    \ of digital agricultural technologies? This review \nwas conducted using a snowball\
    \ approach. Initially, I reviewed the literature reviews by \nKlerkx et al., (2019)\
    \ and van der Burg et al., (2019); these were the most comprehensive \nreviews\
    \ available. Klerkx et al., (2019) used a snowball method and searched with the\
    \ \nword ‘digital agriculture’. van der Burg et al., (2019) searched with the\
    \ words ‘smart’, \n‘digital’ or ‘precision’ and ‘farming’ (or ‘agriculture’) in\
    \ combination with ‘ethics’. The \nsnowball was developed with three actions.\
    \ First, I checked the authors cited in their \n \n[13] \nliterature reviews,\
    \ focusing specifically on those whose research focuses on power, \nownership,\
    \ privacy, and ethics in the digitalization of agricultural production systems\
    \ \nand value chains. Second, I used Google Scholar to identify articles citing\
    \ these reviews. \nAnd third, I searched Scopus and Google Scholar using a combination\
    \ of words such as \n“digital agriculture” AND “social implications” OR “social\
    \ impacts” OR “ethical \nimplications” OR “ethical concerns” OR “ethical issues”\
    \ to find new sources. I analyzed \nthis information using matrices aimed at finding\
    \ patterns in the implications identified \nby the different authors. I chose\
    \ Google Scholar because its reach is wider —including \ntech reports and grey\
    \ literature— and allows for easier tracking of the authors who are \nciting a\
    \ particular article. This was important as I employed a snowball sampling \n\
    approach for conducting this search. The scope of Web of Science would be narrow\
    \ to \nstart this review.  \nIn the second stage, I gathered information related\
    \ to question two — what is the \ncurrent state of available digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in Colombia? I mapped the \ndigital agricultural technologies currently\
    \ available and the actors offering them. I \nemployed a multi-pronged strategy\
    \ which consisted of conducting web searches for \nvarious resources —including\
    \ Google News, Crunchbase, and the databases of FAO, \nCGIAR, and IICA— participating\
    \ in both in-person and virtual events focused on \npromoting digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in Colombia and conducting informal \nconversations with professionals\
    \ working in the field. I selected only technologies \nfulfilling two criteria:\
    \ i) they offer any technology related to the definition of digital \nagriculture\
    \ used (see annex 1), and ii) are available in the Colombian market regardless\
    \ \nof their owners’ place of origin; technologies that are still in the design\
    \ stage were \nexcluded. All technologies identified were organized in a matrix\
    \ containing: name, \nobjective, how it works, population target, name of the\
    \ seller, type of company, key \npartners, and website. Using the framework elaborated\
    \ from the literature review, I \n \n[14] \nanalyzed these technologies considering\
    \ three aspects: types of service, types of data and \ntypes of expected outcomes.\
    \ This source of information was useful to build a broad \nunderstanding of what\
    \ is being offered in the Colombian context. \nIn the third stage, I conducted\
    \ semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs \nand promoters of digital technologies\
    \ in Colombia to address questions three and four —\nwhat are Colombian promotors’\
    \ views on digital agricultural technologies? (question 3) \nand what aspects\
    \ must be considered to ensure digital technologies support small \nfarmers (question\
    \ four). Interviews were recorded (see interview protocol in annex 2), \ntranscribed\
    \ verbatim, and then coded inductively, using subquestions as a guiding \nframework\
    \ —perceptions of technology deployment promises, complexities, \nuncertainties,\
    \ and unforeseen impacts. With this bottom-up approach, I obtained \nthemes by\
    \ closely examining the interview transcripts and field notes, rather than relying\
    \ \non predefined theoretical frameworks (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008). \nOrganization\
    \ of the dissertation \nThis work is presented in five parts, including this introduction.\
    \ Chapter two \nreviews the literature on socio-ethical implications of digital\
    \ agricultural technologies. It \norganizes and synthesizes the main concerns\
    \ that social science scholars have identified \ntheoretically and empirically.\
    \ I present those aspects that are relevant in the context of \ndeveloping countries.\
    \ Chapter three offers a view of the composition of the products and \nservices\
    \ of digital agricultural technologies currently available in Colombia. I present\
    \ a \npanorama of the type of technologies available in the market, their potential\
    \ use and \nbenefits for farmers, and the actors behind them. Chapter four explores\
    \ the perspectives \nof Colombian promoters and entrepreneurs on the dynamic of\
    \ digital agricultural \ntechnologies, their opportunities, complexities, and\
    \ unforeseen impacts on small \nfarmers. Drawing on twenty-three semi-structured\
    \ interviews, I elicited their views on \n \n[15] \nthe role technology can play,\
    \ their perceptions of the complexities and uncertainties of \ntechnology deployment,\
    \ and their understanding of unforeseen impacts that \ntechnologies can have on\
    \ small farmers. \nIn the last chapter, taking the insights presented in chapters\
    \ two (literature), \nthree (mapping of the technologies in the market), and four\
    \ (perceptions of promoters), I \nrevisit the main questions and arguments proposed,\
    \ reflect on the current trajectories of \ndigitalization in Colombia and outline\
    \ areas for further research to ensure these \ninnovations support, rather than\
    \ marginalize, small farmers in Colombia.  \n \n \n[16] \nChapter Two: What Do\
    \ We Know And Need To Know \nAbout The Social Implications Of Digital Agricultural\
    \ \nTechnologies For Small Farmers? \n \n“If we can do something, such as push\
    \ technological frontiers outward, then \nshould we? And if we want to push those\
    \ frontiers outward, then what do we gain and \ngive up in doing so?” \nJames,\
    \ H. (2018:1). \n2.1 Introduction \nAdvocates and enthusiasts of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies highlight the \nmyriad benefits that these technologies offer.\
    \ According to Schroeder, Lampietti, and \nElabed (2021), digital agriculture\
    \ can increase efficiency, profitability, and sustainability \nby enabling technical\
    \ and allocative efficiency and lowering transaction costs. The \nargument is\
    \ that digital technologies provide data that allows a more efficient allocation\
    \ \nof resources, reducing the costs associated with searching, contracting, monitoring,\
    \ and \nenforcement, resulting in increased profitability and a more sustainable\
    \ environment. In \nthis light, digital services offering weather or market information\
    \ through an app could \nreduce the time used by farmers to obtain information\
    \ and make decisions; or a \nblockchain-based platform could allow traceability\
    \ across a value chain, facilitating \ncommunication, assessment, and contracting.\
    \ For others, the impacts of these \ntechnologies are broader. Rolandi et al.,\
    \ (2021) used a broad spectrum to propose a \ntheoretical grid with four impact\
    \ domains —economic, environment, governance, and \nsocial—, fourteen areas of\
    \ impact, and sixty-one outcomes of digitalization.  \nWhile both approaches indicate\
    \ that digital technologies’ potential outcomes are \nmanifold and contribute\
    \ to present digitization as an opportunity that willing people can \nseize, they\
    \ are a limited lens to see the digitalization process.  Both views —one heavily\
    \ \nfocused on efficiency and another on an extensive range of outcomes— lack\
    \ \n \n[17] \nconsideration of the forces surrounding the implementation of digital\
    \ technologies and \ntheir impact on social relationships across manifold aspects\
    \ related to farmers' activities. \nThese views seem to align with an apolitical\
    \ view of technology, resonating with the old \nValue-Neutrality Thesis, which\
    \ argues that technology is morally and politically neutral, \nneither good nor\
    \ bad (Miller, 2021). This apolitical perspective, criticized by many \nscholars,\
    \ fails to acknowledge the intricate network of power dynamics that influence\
    \ \ntechnological benefits’ design, utilization, and distribution or to identify\
    \ the problematic \nintersection between technology and food systems. As summarized\
    \ by Bronson \n(2022:p16) a view that  understands technology as apolitical and\
    \ free of politics and \ninterests, “abstracts these technologies from the social\
    \ means of their production.” \nMany voices, including social scholars (e.g van\
    \ der Burg et al., 2019; Rotz et al., \n2019; Hackfort, 2021), social movements\
    \ (Nyéléni Forum for Food Sovereignty, 2019; \nVia Campesina, 2021; Mooney, 2018;\
    \ ETC Group, 2022), and multilateral organizations \n(World Bank Group, 2019;\
    \ Trendov et al., 2019; CEPAL, FAO, IICA, 2021) are discussing \nthe potential\
    \ risks and unexpected social consequences that digital technologies may \nbring\
    \ to disadvantaged actors in agriculture and the food sector. They are concerned\
    \ \nabout how the process unfolds, who is leading it, and how the worst consequence\
    \ could \nbe a potential exacerbation of existing inequalities for the smallest\
    \ farmers. However, the \nlist of topics is too general to capture nuances, making\
    \ it inadequate for informing \npolitical debates or guiding the actions of those\
    \ shaping or contesting the process.  \nConsidering this gap, this review essay\
    \ aims to offer to applied scholars and \npractitioners a practical view to understand\
    \ key questions on digitalization in agriculture \nand to organize the main socio-ethical\
    \ implications that might be considered when \npromoting digital agricultural\
    \ technologies. This essay presupposes the need to consider \nhow power is expressed\
    \ along digitalization and the importance of localized approaches; \n \n[18] \n\
    it recognizes that these technologies do not have the same impact everywhere and\
    \ that \nthe implications for different actors and regions vary in their urgency\
    \ and importance. It \nresults from a review of academic and grey literature guided\
    \ by these subquestions,  \ni) \nWhat is under the Digital Agriculture umbrella?\
    \ \nii) \nWhat are narratives and assumptions on Digital Agriculture? \niii) \n\
    What are socio-ethical implications of digital agricultural technologies?  \n\
    iv) \nHow to open possibilities for a different digitalization in agriculture?\
    \ \nv) \nWhat do we need to know? \nThis review essay was conducted using a snowball\
    \ approach. Initially, I reviewed \nthe literature reviews by Klerkx et al., (2019)\
    \ and van der Burg et al., (2019); these were \nthe most comprehensive reviews\
    \ available. Klerkx et al., (2019) used a snowball method \nand searched with\
    \ the word ‘digital agriculture’. van der Burg et al., (2019) searched with \n\
    the words ‘smart’, ‘digital’ or ‘precision’ and ‘farming’ (or ‘agriculture’) in\
    \ combination \nwith ‘ethics’. The snowball was developed with three actions.\
    \ First, I checked the authors \ncited in their literature reviews, focusing specifically\
    \ on those whose research focuses on \npower, ownership, privacy, and ethics in\
    \ the digitalization of agricultural production \nsystems and value chains. Second,\
    \ I used Google Scholar to identify articles citing these \nreviews. And third,\
    \ I searched Scopus and Google Scholar using a combination of words \nsuch as\
    \ “digital agriculture” AND “social implications” OR “social impacts” OR “ethical\
    \ \nimplications” OR “ethical concerns” OR “ethical issues” — “agricultura digital”\
    \ AND \n“implicaciones sociales ” OR “impactos sociales” OR “implicaciones éticas”\
    \ OR \n“preocupaciones éticas” OR “ethical issues”—  to find new sources. I conducted\
    \ a search \nfor results in English and Spanish. I analyzed this information using\
    \ matrices aimed at \nfinding patterns in the implications identified by the different\
    \ authors. I found in total 52 \narticles that were relevant to this research.\
    \ Many of those come from fields as Social \nStudies of Science, Agriculture Innovation,\
    \ and Ethics. \n \n[19] \nThis paper is organized into three parts. First, it\
    \ introduces what is included \nwithin the “digital agriculture umbrella”, the\
    \ narrative behind it, and assumptions \nbehind some groups of digital technologies.\
    \ Second, it organizes the socio-ethical \nimplications in the academic literature\
    \ in two interlinked groups: aspects preventing \naccess and related to the design\
    \ of these technologies; and elements related to the \ngovernance of these technologies.\
    \ It closes with a discussion of what is missing and a \nneed to know for advancing\
    \ in a digitalization aware of its implications and responsible \nwith it.  \n\
    \ \n2.2. What is under the Digital Agriculture umbrella? \nAgriculture 4.0, digital\
    \ agriculture, e-agriculture, smart farming, FoodTech and \nAgtech are some names\
    \ scholars and industry people use to talk about digital \ninnovations in agriculture\
    \ and food production. These names often overlap in their \nmeaning, scope, and\
    \ innovations included. Despite their differences in naming, in \ngeneral terms,\
    \ all these refer to the “digitalization of agriculture,” a process under which\
    \ \nall sorts of activities conducted to produce, commercialize, and consume food\
    \ use at \nsome point digital technologies (Klerkx et al., 2019). \nSimply put,\
    \ digital technologies are “tools that collect, store, analyze, and share \ninformation\
    \ digitally, including mobile phones and the Internet” (World Bank Group, \n2019).\
    \ This broad definition of digital technologies allows the inclusion of previous\
    \ \napproaches. For example, the information and communication \ntechnologies\
    \ -ICT- included computers, the internet, mobile phones, radio, and \ntelevision\
    \ (Flor and Jimenez, 2015) and was formed under the umbrella of e-agriculture\
    \ \nor ICT4D, mainly used to transmit information to farmers. Precision Agriculture\
    \ \nincludes technologies such as drones, autonomous vehicles, GPS guidance, robots,\
    \ \n \n[20] \nsensors, soil sampling, and automated hardware and software helping\
    \ to have more \ncontrol over farming activities. Smart farming steps forward\
    \ and integrates new \ntechnologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), and Geographic \nInformation Systems (GIS), allowing the collection,\
    \ integration, and visualization of data \n(Lytos et al., 2020). These technologies\
    \ and the development of Big Data techniques and \nmethods open the possibility\
    \ of capturing massive volumes of data, varied, contextual, \nand accessed in\
    \ real-time, and running advanced analytics useful for predictive modeling \n\
    and decision-making, boosting productivity and efficiency (Wolfert et al., 2017).\
    \ The \ncomplexity and sophistication of these technologies make them potentially\
    \ “game-\nchanging technologies that can dramatically affect the way food is produced,\
    \ processed, \ntraded, and consumed” (Klerkx and Rose, 2021). Using a broad definition,\
    \ all these \ntechnologies have a place under the digital agriculture umbrella.\
    \  \nCategorizing the wide range of digital technologies used by farmers can include\
    \ \nthe degree of technological sophistication involved, their place in the commodity\
    \ chain, \nor the specific service it offers to farmers. Using a lens focused\
    \ on the level of \ntechnological complexity, Trendov et al., (2019), in a report\
    \ by FAO, identified five \nsegments of digital technologies in agriculture: (1)\
    \ mobile devices and social media, (2) \nprecision agriculture and remote sensing\
    \ technologies, (3) big data, cloud, analytics and \ncybersecurity, (4) integration\
    \ and coordination systems such as blockchain, financing \nand insurance systems,\
    \ and (5) intelligent systems such as deep learning, machine \nlearning and artificial\
    \ intelligence. This approach acknowledges the variety of \nsophistication within\
    \ these technologies but does not consider overlapping use when \naddressing specific\
    \ digital products and services. Dashboards such as the Digital Agrihub \n—developed\
    \ between Wageningen University and Research (WUR), GSMA, Grameen \nFoundation,\
    \ and the Netherlands Advisory Board on impact investing— show how digital \n\
    products simultaneously use several technologies. For example, the Tumaini Mobile\
    \ \n \n[21] \nApp, developed by the CIAT to identify major banana diseases worldwide,\
    \ is accessed \nthrough a mobile application and uses machine learning, big data,\
    \ cloud-based services, \nfield sensors, and diagnostics equipment. \nPaying attention\
    \ to the place that specific technologies have along the steps of the \nfood commodity\
    \ chain, Prause, Hackfort, and Lindgren (2020) identified 280 specific \nproducts\
    \ and services already available on the global market and grouped them into 20\
    \ \ncategories. These categories include data-based insurance, precision agriculture\
    \ \nequipment, farm robotics, digital marketplaces, and digital commodity chain\
    \ traceability \nand transparency tools. This classification shows how technologies\
    \ can be used across \nthe value chain but does not reflect their dynamic nature.\
    \ \nFocusing on what specific digital technologies offer to farmers, Porciello\
    \ et al., \n(2021) discussed nuances of four types of services, namely, advisory,\
    \ farm tools, financial \nservices, and market linkages. They used this classification\
    \ in their scoping review to \nshow the interactions between specific types of\
    \ services and particular outcomes. For \nexample, within digital advisory and\
    \ extension services, particularly under general \nagronomy, they found seventeen\
    \ studies offering positive evidence on changes and \nincome and two showing negative\
    \ changes. Within digital financial services and \ninsurance, three studies showed\
    \ positive changes in income and one with nil outcomes. \nThe open dashboard where\
    \ Digital Agrihub shares innovative digital agricultural \nsolutions uses a similar\
    \ taxonomy comprising five categories —advisory, market linkage \nand e-commerce,\
    \ supply chain management, finance, and ecosystem support. This way \nof addressing\
    \ technologies offers a structure to organize specific digital products and \n\
    services that can combine technologies and deliver particular services to specific\
    \ actors \n(e.g farmers, extensionists, consumers). This approach is more nuanced\
    \ and valuable for \nconceptual and practical purposes and enables a localized\
    \ conversation on how these \n \n[22] \ntechnologies operate, and under which\
    \ conditions can fulfill their promised benefits, and \nfor whom.     \nTable\
    \ 1 includes an overview of the digital products and services under the Digital\
    \ \nAgriculture umbrella. The primary sources for this overview are the taxonomy\
    \ used by \nPorciello et al. (2021) and the Digital Agri Hub (2022), and the digital\
    \ products and \nservices technologies portrayed in reports published by international\

    \ World Bank (Schroeder et al., \n2021) and the open dashboard published by Digital\
    \ Agri Hub (2022). \n[ 23 ] \ns\n \n \n[24] \n2.3 What are narratives on Digital\
    \ Agriculture? \nThe narrative discussed by multilateral organizations and in\
    \ news articles around digital \ntechnologies is mainly optimistic, technical,\
    \ and holding the “feed the world” imperative. In \ngeneral, the rationale is\
    \ that digitalization is going to support efficiency, productivity and \nsustainability,\
    \ three aspects required in a world expecting food demand to increase by 2050\
    \ \nlinked to a new expected two billion more people in the world’s population\
    \ —up from 7.7 billion \nin 2019 (UN, 2019)— and currently suffering from food\
    \ waste, production constraints due to \nclimate change. Carolan (2017), in their\
    \ interviews with farmers and regional food system \nentrepreneurs, learned that\
    \ at the heart of their reasoning to promote digital technologies is the \n“feed\
    \ the world” narrative, expressed in the concern to feed 9 billion people in the\
    \ near future. \nIn a similar vein, in a review of high-level documents published\
    \ by the World Bank, the U.N. \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the\
    \ Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD), Lajoie-O’Malley\
    \ et al., (2020) identified that in these documents these \ntechnologies are portrayed\
    \ as a solution to tackle the global food shortage, accompanied by a \npossibility\
    \ if increasing yields, incomes, and a reduction of harmful inputs.  \nIn social\
    \ media and materials published by international development organizations, \n\
    these emerging technologies are presented as a means to achieve technical and\
    \ practical \noutcomes. Analyzing how digitalization in agriculture is portrayed\
    \ in German media, Mohr & \nHöhler (2023) evidenced that 59% of the arguments\
    \ in their sample were pro-digitalization, \n23% were contra, and 17% were neutral;\
    \ the most frequent pro arguments are work facilitation, \nreduced fertilizer\
    \ and/or pesticide use, environmental protection and sustainability, higher \n\
    yields, and opportunities and possibilities. In a similar analysis covering tweets\
    \ in English on \nthe digital transformation of the agri-food sector, Ancín, Pindado,\
    \ and Sanchez (2022) found \nthat 80% of the sample showed a connection to positive\
    \ emotions and a link with topics related \nto sustainability and climate change.\
    \ In a critical discourse analysis on how precision agriculture \n \n \n[25] \n\
    and smart farming were portrayed on English spoken news and Twitter, Duncan et\
    \ al., \n(2021:1190) concluded that “the PA [precision agriculture] discourse\
    \ tends to not to be explicit \nabout managing political changes or ensuring just\
    \ food distribution, nor is it concerned with the \ntypes of foods that needed\
    \ to be produced to ensure sustainable and nutritious diets”. In a \ndocument\
    \ analysis of materials published by international development organizations on\
    \ digital \nagriculture for the African case, Abdulai (2022) observed that narratives\
    \ were positive and \nfocused on seven expected outcomes —bridging agricultural\
    \ information and knowledge gaps, \nproductivity gains and on-farm efficiency,\
    \ food security, climate change resilience, employment \nopportunities, gender\
    \ empowerment, and livelihoods improvements. His work highlights how \nthe rhetoric\
    \ of digitalization in this region continues on the path of the Green Revolution\
    \ and \nthat “the potential effects of digitalization, as presented in the narratives,\
    \ extends, and entrench \nthe pro-poor Green Revolution rhetoric of ‘technology\
    \ saviourism’ in Sub-Sahara” (p.9).  \nThis portrayal focused on the technology’s\
    \ technical aspects and promoting “feed the \nworld” narratives rather than examining\
    \ its political or social implications is not new. Similar \npositive claims were\
    \ made about the Green Revolution (GR) and genetically modified (GM) \ncrops (Brooks,\
    \ 2005). As it is well-known, the GR technologies were presented as a strategy\
    \ to \nimprove food crop productivity growth through new pest-resistant seed varieties\
    \ (Kilby, 2019; \nPingali, 2012). Regarding GM, the proposition was that utilizing\
    \ genetically modified crops \nresistant to pests would result in decreased input\
    \ usage, heightened yields, and the \nestablishment of more sustainable farming\
    \ practices that necessitate less off-farm work \n(Dguidegue, 2019).  Amidst the\
    \ mainly positive narratives, several negative impacts were \npointed out (Klepek,\
    \ 2012; Shiva, 2016). \nPaying attention to the narrative surrounding digital\
    \ agriculture is crucial. Narratives \nmatter: narratives and discourses construct\
    \ aspects of the world and reflect values and \nworldviews (Fairclough, 2017).\
    \  Far from being neutral, techno-optimism reflects specific values \n \n \n[26]\
    \ \nand imaginaries, is useful for specific outcomes, and is instrumental in constructing\
    \ visions of \nfutures, influencing regulations, modes of governance, and ways\
    \ of public engagement (Bain, \nLindberg & Selfa, 2020). As IPES-Food (2016) stated,\
    \ the “feed the world” narrative is one of the \nfactors serving the reproduction\
    \ of industrial agriculture, characterized by industrial-scale \nfeedlots supplied\
    \ by crop monocultures and chemical fertilizers to produce an abundance of \n\
    relatively cheap highly-processed foods;  in a context of a concentrated food\
    \ system, dominant \nactors in the current food system structure —big firms, large-scale\
    \ retailers, and international \norganizations— exert discursive power while shaping\
    \ knowledge, framing narratives, and \ninfluencing policy to adopt approaches\
    \ favorably with their problem-framing.  \nScrutinizing narratives around digitalization\
    \ is pivotal to comprehending the potential \nimplications of these technologies\
    \ on small farmers. Adopting an excessively optimistic, \nuncritical, and apolitical\
    \ stance toward digitalization can undermine our ability to hold \nbusinesses\
    \ and institutions accountable. \n \n2.3.1 What are assumptions on digital agricultural\
    \ technologies by types of \nservice? \nA palpable linear optimism holds several\
    \ assumptions in the description of how specific \ndigital technologies can serve\
    \ farmers. Three examples offer illustrations. Providers offering \ndigital advisory\
    \ usually indicate that smallholder farmers can use mobile devices to access \n\
    several pieces of information —e.g weather forecasts, market research, and planting\
    \ \ntechniques— to make better decisions to improve productivity (see, for example,\
    \ Development \nGateway, 2021). This narrative assumes a direct relationship between\
    \ reduced transaction costs \nand the possibility of making decisions based on\
    \ information. It is vital to consider that not all \nfarmers can make better\
    \ decisions based on better information, as making different decisions \nrequires\
    \ mobilizing resources that may not be available or that require household or\
    \ community \nagreements regarding labor and access (Yager et al., 2019). \n \n\
    \ \n[27] \nSellers of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors placed\
    \ on livestock to monitor \ntheir health, location, and behavior, indicate multiple\
    \ benefits, including detection of illness, \nimproved breeding, enhanced animal\
    \ welfare and reduced labor costs.  These promised benefits \nare not for every\
    \ farmer, only farmers who manage large-scale livestock operations and have the\
    \ \ncapital to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support IoT technology,\
    \ can use this \ntechnology and obtain benefits —e.g Vence (2023) is a virtual\
    \ fencing, livestock management \nsystem for cattle designed operating only operations\
    \ with over 500+ cattle. Marketplace \npromoters claim their platforms can connect\
    \ farmers to multiple new buyers, offering better \nprices and flexibility while\
    \ cutting out intermediaries. For example, Agri Marketplace, founded \nin Europe,\
    \ connects farmers to industrial buyers across the globe, while Frubana is a Latin\
    \ \nAmerican company that promises to connect fruit and vegetable farmers with\
    \ restaurants. \nHowever, not all farmers may have access to these connections.\
    \ Farmers with market options \nlocated near roads and other infrastructure are\
    \ more likely to participate in digital marketplaces \nand benefit from them.\
    \  \nIn sum, despite the assumption of general benefits, not all farmers can use\
    \ all digital \nproducts and services, or reap their potential benefits even with\
    \ access. A small-scale producer \nwith limited land may not see a significant\
    \ improvement in access to better market pricing or \nweather information. This\
    \ improved access may not translate into improved benefits, as their \nproductivity\
    \ challenges may stem not from inefficiencies, but rather from land size or market\
    \ \ndistance. As noted by Lioutas “digitalization of agriculture is also a function\
    \ of farm size” \n(2021:2).    \n \n \n \n[28] \n2.4 What are Socio-ethical implications\
    \ of Digital Agricultural \nTechnologies? \nIn the context of a bright narrative\
    \ about digital agriculture coming from all corners, \nscholars are growing emergent\
    \ literature analyzing these technologies’ implications and \nunintended consequences\
    \ (e.g., Rotz et al., 2019, 2019a; Bronson, 2022; Jakku et al., 2019; \nHackfort,\
    \ 2021; Fielke, Taylor & Jakku, 2020; Ayris & Rose, 2023).  \nThemes and categories\
    \ often overlap and range across diverse scales of analysis. For \ninstance, Hackfort\
    \ (2021) unpacks five patterns of inequality linked to digital technologies in\
    \ \nagriculture, namely, i) control over technology deployment, ii) distribution\
    \ of benefits, iii) \nsovereignty over data and hardware, iv) inequalities in\
    \ knowledge and skills, and v) capacity to \ndefine and solve problems. Ayris\
    \ & Rose (2023) identified ten ethical concerns for agricultural \nrobotics, including\
    \ trust and data, health and safety, cybersecurity, employment, energy use, \n\
    economics and performance, loss of farmer control, animal welfare, and connectivity.\
    \ Ingram et \nal., (2022) conducted a prioritization exercise to identify priority\
    \ research questions concerning \ndigital agriculture in the UK; their results\
    \ cover data governance, data management, enabling \nuse of data and technologies,\
    \ understanding benefits and uptake of data and technologies, \noptimizing data\
    \ and technologies for performance, impacts of digital agriculture, and new \n\
    collaborative arrangements. Ingram and Maye (2020) asked about the implications\
    \ of \ndigitalization for agricultural knowledge processes, farmers’ knowledge\
    \ and decision-making, \nand farmers’ knowledge networks. Lioutas et al., (2019)\
    \ identify key questions about using big \ndata in farming, including data ownership\
    \ and privacy. van der Burg et al., (2019) identify three \nthemes in the current\
    \ ethical discussion about smart farming: data ownership and access, \ndistribution\
    \ of power and impacts on human life and society. In a scoping study, McGrath\
    \ et al., \n(2023) identify trends in the literature, including work-life balance\
    \ on the farm, changes in \nskills, roles, and identities, and data ownership,\
    \ power, and security.  \n \n \n[29] \nA practical way to see this large spectrum\
    \ of topics is by considering the intersection \nbetween salient factors related\
    \ to who has access to these technologies; and factors associated \nwith how these\
    \ technologies are governed. The dynamics and possibilities happening in this\
    \ \nintersection lead to different outcomes; changing how digital products and\
    \ services are designed \nand governed can lead to different outcomes.  Of course,\
    \ these two, interactions and outcomes, \ndo not occur in a vacuum but in a broader\
    \ context, where the many facets of power have an \ninfluence. Considering how\
    \ different facets of power influence digitalization is also a key \ncomponent\
    \ in influencing the trajectories of digitalization. \nRoscigno (2011:353) explain\
    \ power in terms of social relationships; in this view, power \ncan be seen as\
    \ “an unequal relation, or inequality, based on personal attributes, institutional\
    \ \npositioning, and statuses that are defined, codified and acted upon within\
    \ historical and cultural \ncontexts.” In his summary, power has a reciprocal\
    \ and asymmetrical character, and the relative \npower of an actor is expressed\
    \ in relation to and in interaction with. This unequal relation can be \nseen\
    \ at different levels. Shackleton et al., (2022) summarize four theoretical approaches\
    \ and \nilluminate how power can be seen. The actor-centered approach (e.g, Weber’s\
    \ tradition) \nconceptualizes power as a resource or capacity that actors (i.e.,\
    \ individuals, groups, or \norganizations) wield to impose their will on others,\
    \ often resulting in zero-sum conflict and \nalliances; conflicts and alliances\
    \ are essential channels of expression, research, and analysis for \nactor-centered\
    \ power. In contrast, the institutional approach (e.g Ostrom’s tradition) centers\
    \ \npower on formal and informal rules, norms, and organizations and its possibility\
    \ to shape \npatterns of social behavior and resource access. The structural approach\
    \ (e.g Marxist tradition) \ntakes a critical view of power by situating it within\
    \ the broader political, cultural, and economic \nstructures that constrain actor\
    \ agency and reinforce social inequalities and injustices. Finally, \nthe discursive\
    \ approach draws on Michel Foucault’s influential work to understand power as\
    \ a \nproductive force that shapes social norms and individual subjectivities\
    \ through knowledge, truth \nclaims, and narratives, with individuals and institutions\
    \ acting as instruments of power. These \n \n \n[30] \nfour approaches are not\
    \ mutually exclusive and can be used to provide a more comprehensive \nunderstanding\
    \ of power facets. \nThe graphic 1 present the broader context, shaped by power\
    \ facets, and the interactions \nbetween factors related to who has access to\
    \ these technologies and factors associated with how \nthese technologies are\
    \ governed. Social outcomes from technologies can be identified at the \nintersection\
    \ of these two factors and in dialogue with power facets. \n \n \nFigure 1. Dimensions\
    \ shaping the digital technologies outcomes \n  \n2.4.1 Factors shaping access:\
    \ Who is included and who is not? \nThe digital divide —generally understood as\
    \ the unequal access populations worldwide \nhave to the Internet and digital\
    \ technologies— is one of the main concerns when discussing \ndigital technologies’\
    \ development. Reports published by multilateral organizations, including \nthe\
    \ World Bank Group (2019), Trendov et al. (2019), and CEPAL, FAO, IICA (2021),\
    \ \nconsistently highlight that a lack of infrastructure and related capabilities\
    \ are one of the main \nreasons why farmers are not able to fully benefit from\
    \ digital technologies. However, the \n \n \n[31] \nquestion of who is included\
    \ and who is not covers a complex and pluralistic range of aspects and \nrequires\
    \ a multilayered and intersectional perspective. \nThe gap in access \nThe first\
    \ layer of the digital divide—lack of infrastructure to support digital technology\
    \ \naccess— is widely known and worrisome. For example, estimations regarding\
    \ access to 5G \ncellular networks —the latest generation of mobile broadband\
    \ allowing the fastest speed for data \ntransfer— show that in 2025 access in\
    \ the United States will be 55%, but for Low and Middle-\nIncome Countries, it\
    \ will only be 7%. The 2025 estimate for 4G is better at 52% for these \ncountries\
    \ (GSMA, 2020; 2020a). Data from the 2021 agricultural digitalization index \n\
    (Schroeder et al., 2021) show this gap more dramatically. In the availability\
    \ subindex, \nmeasuring the share of farmland in a country with mobile coverage,\
    \ Israel scored 95.9, Australia \n84.6, New Zealand 90.3, the United States 87.6,\
    \ Honduras 42.9, Uganda 33,7, Mexico 33.6, \nBrazil 30.0, Argentina 26.3, Nigeria\
    \ 22.3 and Bolivia 18.1. This well-known gap between North \nand South countries\
    \ helps to say something that is not surprising; some countries are better \n\
    positioned to unfold digital technologies and pursue their benefits; this unequal\
    \ scenario results \nfrom historical processes and the history of the development\
    \ project (McMichael and Webert, \n2020).  \nEvidently, these gaps between regions\
    \ are not limited to just the North and South, and \ndifferences in infrastructure\
    \ availability do not solely cause them. Two examples illustrate the \nprevalence\
    \ of multiple urban-rural gaps within developed and developing countries. In the\
    \ \nUnited States, the percentage of rural Americans having access to or owning\
    \ home broadband, \nor a smartphone, tablet, or desktop is consistently lower\
    \ than suburban and urban Americans; \nonly 72% of rural Americans have access\
    \ to a laptop, while 80% of urban Americans own one. \nThere are also differences\
    \ among racial and ethnic groups. In the United States, black and \nhispanic adults\
    \ are less likely than white adults to have a traditional computer or home \n\
    \ \n \n[32] \nbroadband (Vogels, 2021; Atske and Perrin, 2021). In more dramatic\
    \ contrast, in Colombia, the \npercentage of rural households owning a desktop\
    \ computer is 5,9%, and a tablet is 1,6%, while it \nis 32,3% and 9,3%, respectively,\
    \ in urban households. The reasons for not having these devices \ninclude high\
    \ prices, 47% rural and 51% urban; lack of interest,32,5% rural and 33.8% urban;\
    \ and \nlack of knowledge about its use, 18,7% rural and 12,3% urban (DANE, 2019).\
    \  \nWhile the lack of access is crucial, it is not the only gap worthy of attention\
    \ when \naddressing digital technologies. The digital divide is a multifaceted\
    \ phenomenon with three \nlayers. First, differences in access and availability\
    \ of information and communications \ntechnologies; second, sociodemographic factors\
    \ influencing people’s decision to use or not use \navailable technologies; and\
    \ third, an uneven capacity to benefit from the access and use of \ntechnologies\
    \ (Ragnedda and Gladkova, 2020). A comprehensive view of the digital divide must\
    \ \nconsider inequalities in access, competencies, and capacities to obtain benefits.\
    \  \nThe gender gap and data gap \nRijswijk (2022) note that in addition to this\
    \ well-known gap in access, another two gaps \nare crucial when discussing digital\
    \ technologies in agriculture, the gender digital divide and the \ndata divide.\
    \ The gender digital divide refers to the gender differences in access to these\
    \ \ntechnologies; these differences reflect the many limitations women face in\
    \ the offline world, \nincluding limited access to education, traditional gender\
    \ roles, unequal distribution of resources \n—e.g land, credit—, limited access\
    \ to infrastructure and laws limiting women’s rights and \nopportunities. In this\
    \ sense, the gender digital divide reflects an extensive social, political, and\
    \ \ncultural process where women have unequal access to resources and opportunities.\
    \  \nThe gender gap in mobile ownership and usage varies across regions. For instance,\
    \ \naccording to the Mobile Gender Gap Report 2022 (Shanahan, 2022), in Nigeria,\
    \ as of 2021, the \n \n \n[33] \ngender gap for mobile ownership1 was 5%, with\
    \ 92% of men and 88% of women owning a \nmobile phone. The situation was milder\
    \ in Mexico, with a 2% gap, and chronic in Pakistan, with \na 33% gender gap for\
    \ mobile ownership. Similarly, the gender gap for mobile internet use was \n35%\
    \ in Nigeria, with 54% of men and 34% of women owning a mobile phone, 38% in Pakistan\
    \ \nand 3% in Mexico. The ownership of different types of phones also varies by\
    \ gender and has its \nimplications since individuals who possess a smartphone\
    \ are considerably more inclined to be \nknowledgeable about mobile internet and\
    \ utilize it than those who possess a basic or feature \nphone. As reported in\
    \ the same study, by 2021, 34% of women and 22% of men in Nigeria \nowned a basic\
    \ phone, while 18% of women and 17% of men owned a feature phone; furthermore,\
    \ \n32% of women and 51% of men in Nigeria owned smartphones.  \nCinnamon (2019)\
    \ offers a nuanced view of this divide and argues that the data divide can \n\
    be seen within three data divides, i) data access, ii) data representation inequalities,\
    \ and iii) \ncontrol over data flows. Data access refers to the extent data exist,\
    \ is available, and is reliable. \nData representation implies that when data\
    \ is produced, choices are made involving specific \nworldviews. Finally, data\
    \ control inequalities refer to those asymmetric relationships between \nthose\
    \ having data —collecting, storing, and mining— and those whose data is collected\
    \ \n(Andrejevic, 2014). \n \nThe gaps in capabilities, motivations and opportunities\
    \   \nPaying attention to the level of single digital technology, McCampbell et\
    \ al., (2022) \ndeveloped and tested an approach to grasp individual factors for\
    \ the specific case of phone-\n \n \n1 In the Mobile Gender Gap Report,  mobile\
    \ ownership is defined as follows: “a person who has \nsole o main use of a SIM\
    \ card (or a mobile phone that does not require a SIM) and uses it at least once\
    \ a \nmonth” (2022, p17). \n \n \n[34] \nbased digital tools for agronomic advice.\
    \ This user readiness framework is built on behavioral \nsciences and considers\
    \ three elements to define an individual’s capacity to use a particular \ndigital\
    \ technology —capabilities, motivations, and opportunities. Capabilities are related\
    \ to the \nindividual’s psychological and physical capacity to use digital technology;\
    \ physical skills include, \nfor example, the capacity to use a smartphone; psychological\
    \ capabilities include e-literacy and \nthe capability to understand interrelations\
    \ between different phone functions. Opportunities \nrefer to external factors\
    \ —social and physical— making it possible to use digital technologies; \nsocial\
    \ opportunities include farmer’s mindset, social cues, cultural norms, and values;\
    \ examples \nof operational categories are cultural norms on how men and women\
    \ access technologies. \nPhysical opportunities refer to having time, resources,\
    \ or access to a location affording access; \nexamples include time and financial\
    \ resources to own and use a digital device and network \navailability. Finally,\
    \ motivation is linked to ‘all those brain processes that energize and direct\
    \ the \nuse of a digital technology’. These processes can be self-conscious and\
    \ include the intention of \nusing digital tools or beliefs about barriers or\
    \ pressures. They can also be automatic, including \nimpulses and reactions, such\
    \ as the desire to become digitally connected.  This approach offers \nan applied\
    \ lens to consider the several interlinked social and individual factors preventing\
    \ or \npromoting the use of a specific technology; it also helps to situate the\
    \ role that infrastructure can \nplay.  \nA multiscale approach to gaps \nThese\
    \ gaps are not binary and interact among them at different scales. Rijswijk (2022)\
    \ \nuses the conceptualization of Amartya Sen (2000) on social exclusion to offer\
    \ a perspective \nbeyond a dichotomic notion of inclusion/exclusion. According\
    \ to this framework, there are \nunfavorable forms of inclusion, for example,\
    \ when inclusion benefits are not evenly distributed \nbecause of deeply unequal\
    \ terms of participation or when “the outcome of being included is then \nthe\
    \ same as being excluded”.  Along the same line, exclusion is not monolithic and\
    \ can be \n \n \n[35] \nconstitutive, instrumental, active, and passive; Constitutive\
    \ exclusion results from societal \nstructures and norms that disadvantage certain\
    \ groups, while instrumental exclusion is \nintentional exclusion used to achieve\
    \ a specific goal. Active exclusion involves deliberate actions \nthat exclude\
    \ certain groups, while passive exclusion arises from inaction or neglect.  \n\
    Rijswijk (2022) employs these various ways of inclusion/exclusion, three gaps\
    \ —digital, \ngender, data—and three scales —single digital technology, a digital\
    \ innovation package, and a \ndigital agricultural system— to show how analysis\
    \ varies across scales. For example, when \nanalyzing a single digital technology,\
    \ the most critical divide is access to data; there are \npossibilities for subordinated\
    \ inclusion or constitutive exclusion. On the other hand, when \nreferring to\
    \ a digital innovation package, the most likely divide is data representation,\
    \ while \ninclusion can be illusive, and exclusion could be constitutive and instrumental.\
    \  \nIn sum, the question of who is included and who is not is far from being\
    \ black and white; \nit is not a matter of choosing specific individuals or groups\
    \ to “include” in a digitalization \nprocess. A key thing to remember is that\
    \ many factors reinforce inequalities regarding digital \ntechnologies —access\
    \ to infrastructure, gendered access, and access to have a voice on how \ntechnologies—\
    \ and inclusion efforts can be empty or misleading to a false sense of participation.\
    \ \n \n2.4.2 Factors on technologies governance: Who governs technologies and\
    \ \nhow?    \nBroadly understood, governance in digital technologies revolves\
    \ around how \nrelationships and interactions are organized, structured, and regulated\
    \ (Gorwa, 2019). \nGovernance of digital technologies can include aspects such\
    \ as data privacy, cybersecurity, \nintellectual property rights, accessibility,\
    \ and regulatory compliance. It also involves addressing \nthe technology’s social,\
    \ economic, and ethical implications and how it can impact different \nstakeholders.\
    \ \n \n \n[36] \nWhen paying attention to the governance of single digital technologies,\
    \ a large set of \npractical questions can be placed: who can make choices and\
    \ how these decisions are made; who \ndesigns and who is consulted; who are users\
    \ defined and approached; what is the rationale for \nmaking money; how farmers\
    \ development is envisioned; what are the decisions on price; how \nfuture scenarios\
    \ and potential economic, social and environmental implications are addressed;\
    \ \nwhat are the definitions on data ownership and privacy and how are enforced,\
    \ among many \nothers. Answers to each of these questions reflect specific values\
    \ and interests, and according to \nhow these aspects of governance are defined,\
    \ it empowers certain actors or disempowers others. \nBelow I summarize aspects\
    \ of governance that present a practical opportunity for those \nwho develop technologies\
    \ to reflect on how their approaches are situated; and for users to hold \nthose\
    \ developers accountable.  \n \nData and its challenges on ownership, access and\
    \ privacy \nData is the blood of the digital economy. Data is used and generated\
    \ on-farm and off-\nfarm. According to Maru et al., (2018), in a report published\
    \ by GFAR, GODAN, and CTA, there \nare four data streams for farming. Data created\
    \ and compiled on the farm to be used solely on \nthe farm makes up the first\
    \ stream. It is denominated “localized data” and includes information \non soil,\
    \ seed, fertilizer use, sowing date, production practices, and water use. Data\
    \ generated \nand acquired off the farm for use at the farm forms the second stream.\
    \ This “imported data” \nincludes market prices and climatic information analyzed\
    \ and tailored for use on-farm by a third \nentity that owns, manages, and controls\
    \ this data. Data generated and compiled on the farm for \noff-farm use comprises\
    \ the third stream; it is called “exported data” and can be gathered by \nfarmers\
    \ or by using advanced tools. This on-farm data is typically processed, clustered,\
    \ or \nmerged with other information generated elsewhere, and various actors use\
    \ it to make decisions. \nGovernments can target services and subsidies; banks\
    \ and insurance companies can offer \n \n \n[37] \ntargeted services and products;\
    \ researchers can design and conduct specific projects. Finally, \non-farm and\
    \ off-farm data for use off-farm make up the fourth stream. It is called “ancillary\
    \ \ndata” and includes, for example, government statistical and research data\
    \ on agriculture.  \nEach kind of data brings challenges and nuances. In the imported\
    \ data, there are \nconcerns about availability, accessibility, and usability.\
    \ On the exported data —localized data \nshared with others—, privacy, ownership,\
    \ and monetization are the pressing topics (Maru et al., \n2018). This is an ongoing\
    \ conversation in the political arena, and there are no final solutions yet. \n\
    It is a topic worthy of consideration because, as stated by Schroeder et al.,\
    \ (2021:5) in a report \npublished by the World Bank on the digital transformation\
    \ of the agri-food system, “laws \naddressing the ownership of data from digital\
    \ agriculture are frequently either missing or \ninadequate.” \nThose with access\
    \ to and ownership of data are in a different position to make choices \nand profit\
    \ from this economy.  Many critical scholars (van der Burg, Boggardt and Wolfert,\
    \ \n2019; Bronson, 2018; 2022) have raised questions about data ownership, access,\
    \ and privacy.  \nvan der Burg, Boggardt, and Wolfert (2019) show how data privacy,\
    \ ownership and \ncontrol are interlinked topics whose interaction exhibits risks\
    \ and uncertainties.  They reflect \nhow farm data — localized data by Maru et\
    \ al. (2018)— is commonly viewed as trade data rather \nthan personal data; and\
    \ how it is being produced and used in a context lacking of clear \nregulations\
    \ and in an environment marked by unequal relationships. The authors illustrated\
    \ \nthese risks with two examples. Firstly, input suppliers such as seed providers\
    \ may use data \nanalyses to offer farmers different prices or terms based on\
    \ their predicted yield or other data \npoints, which could lead to potential\
    \ price discrimination. Secondly, the presence of large \ncompanies such as Monsanto,\
    \ which provides simultaneously smart farming technologies, data \nanalysis algorithms,\
    \ and recommendations to farmers while also selling inputs such as seeds, \n \n\
    \ \n[38] \ncreates a situation where the company has privileged access to farmers’\
    \ data, which can be \nexploited to gain an unfair competitive advantage.    \n\
    Bronson (2018) offers more illustrations putting the lens on big data. This big\
    \ data refers \nto large and voluminous amounts of data gathered from digital\
    \ communication devices, \norganizing it into computer-stored datasets, which\
    \ can be analyzed through computer \nalgorithms. This data is not only localized\
    \ data, but it covers all four steams of farming data and \ncan include climate\
    \ and weather data; soil data, including pH, nutrient content, and moisture \n\
    levels; crop data, including yield, growth patterns, and pest infestation; livestock\
    \ data, including \ngrowth rates, feed intake, and health information; machinery\
    \ and equipment data, including \nusage patterns and maintenance history; market\
    \ data, including pricing and demand trends; \nfinancial data, including input\
    \ costs, labor costs, and profitability; satellite imagery and aerial \ndrone\
    \ data; social media and consumer data, including food preferences and purchasing\
    \ \nbehavior; and sensor data from IoT devices, such as moisture sensors or temperature\
    \ sensors in \ngreenhouses. Bronson (2018) stresses that big data can be sold\
    \ to third parties to be mined with \nunknown goals, which can be more corporate\
    \ and less societal. She is also concerned with large \ncorporations accessing,\
    \ owning and profiting from data that farmers help generate; she argues \nthat\
    \ this concentration can lead to a digital lock-in, benefiting larger corporations\
    \ more and \nsmaller producers less.  \n \n2.4.3 How to open possibilities for\
    \ a different digitalization in agriculture? \nRose and Chilvers (2018), Eastwood\
    \ et al., (2019), and Bronson (2019) have suggested \nthat Responsible Innovation\
    \ offers a way to foresee potential impacts and shape the trajectories \nof digital\
    \ agricultural technologies. This approach —with roots in different research traditions,\
    \ \nincluding innovation studies, science, technology and society studies, ethics\
    \ and governance and \nregulation studies (Koops, 2015)— can be defined as ’a\
    \ new approach towards innovation, in \n \n \n[39] \nwhich social and ethical\
    \ aspects are explicitly taken into account and economic, socio-cultural \nand\
    \ environmental aspects are balanced’ (Blok & Lemmens, 2015: 20). \nAccording\
    \ to the framework developed by Stilgoe et al., (2013), responsible innovation\
    \ \nincludes four dimensions, anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness.\
    \ Within this \nview, anticipation focuses on complexities and uncertainties,\
    \ identifying possible future \nscenarios and potential economic, social, and\
    \ environmental implications associated with digital \nagricultural technologies.\
    \  Reflexivity refers to “holding a mirror up to one’s own activities, \ncommitments\
    \ and assumptions, being aware of the limits of knowledge and being mindful that\
    \ a \nparticular framing of an issue may not be universally held.” (Stilgoe et\
    \ al., 2013: 1571). In this \nlight, this includes an assessment of developers’\
    \ motivations and assumptions; in practice, it \nmight imply the creation and\
    \ engagement of codes of conduct. Inclusion involves engaging a \ndiverse range\
    \ of stakeholders and incorporating their perspectives and concerns into the \n\
    innovation process; it opens the participation to public and stakeholder voices\
    \ on innovation’ \nends and means. Finally, responsiveness involves adapting the\
    \ innovation process based on \nfeedback and insights from stakeholders and the\
    \ wider community and considers the capacity to \nchange direction, react, and\
    \ answer to societal needs. \nSome scholars are using this framework to analyze\
    \ specific cases. For example, Eastwood \net al ., (2017) used it to assess a\
    \ smart dairying project in New Zealand and to draw lessons that \ncan be applied\
    \ to smart farming more generally. Ayris & Rose, (2023) used it to frame the socio-\n\
    ethical implications described in the literature on autonomous robots in agriculture.\
    \ Legun and \nBurch (2021) used the anticipation dimension of this framework to\
    \ analyze how apple orchard \nproducers in New Zealand engage with the prospects\
    \ of AI robotics. This dimension was useful \nfor understanding how farmers’ expectations\
    \ and strategies are shaped by various factors and \nhow they evolve over time.\
    \ Bronson (2019) used this framework to analyze the views of \ntechnology designers\
    \ and to elicit how inequity is present in the design of digital farming \n \n\
    \ \n[40] \ninnovations. Building on the responsible innovation framework, Long\
    \ et al., (2020) developed a \ntool that helps sustainability-focused start-ups\
    \ in agriculture, food, or energy to identify socio-\nethical issues systematically.\
    \ McCampbell et al., (2022) combined Responsible Innovation, \nHuman-Centered\
    \ design, and a digital rights framework to analyze a pilot project using a digital\
    \ \nextension to control and prevent a banana disease in Rwanda. Fleming et al.,\
    \ (2021) used this \napproach to frame a participatory foresight exercise with\
    \ stakeholders in the Australian context; \nthe four scenarios identified created\
    \ a space for a conversation on the implications of digital \ntechnology development.\
    \ Bellon-Maurel et al., (2022) used this framework to build “a research \nagenda\
    \ to foster an agroecology-based digitalization of agriculture” at INRAE, a French\
    \ national \nresearch institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment. These examples\
    \ show the potential of \na responsible innovation lens to open up conversations\
    \ about digitalization’s future and analyze \ncurrent digital products and services.\
    \   \n \n2.5 What do we need to know?  \nScholars and multilateral organizations\
    \ are concerned about the potential exacerbation \nof inequalities and the consequence\
    \ of power relationship shifts. These warnings derive from the \ninteraction of\
    \ the complex context where technologies are developed —the predominance of \n\
    industrial agriculture, the concentration of power and the expectation of cheap\
    \ food (IPES-\nFood, 2016), and how these technologies are being governed —by\
    \ big and private actors using \ndata as new means of control in a context of\
    \ lack of public policy.   Prause et al., (2020) warn \nthat digital technologies\
    \ deepen control and value extraction in the current organization of the \nfood\
    \ system, a third food regime (McMichael, 2009) characterized by neoliberal, free-market\
    \ \npolicies and the dominance of large corporations. These relevant warnings\
    \ need to be \nconsidered to move forward on a path that can change how digitalization\
    \ is occurring.  \n \n \n[41] \nThrough the blueprint that critical scholarship\
    \ is building on digitalization in agriculture, \nwe know that digital technologies\
    \ pose several socio-ethical questions about their expected and \nunforeseen implications;\
    \ also, we know that different scales —single digital technology, a digital \n\
    innovation package, and a digital agricultural system (Rijswijk, 2022)— embrace\
    \ specific \nchallenges that need to be identified and analyzed. However, there\
    \ are still many things that we \ndo not know, and we need to promote agricultural\
    \ digitalization that benefits small farmers \nworldwide.  \n \nTrajectories in\
    \ different regions, types of production and types of crops  \nWe need to know\
    \ how digitalization unfolds in low and middle-income countries. As \nnoted by\
    \ Klerkx et al., (2019), McCampbell et al., (2022), Hackfort (2021) and McGrath\
    \ et al., \n(2023), few critical studies on digital agriculture focus on these\
    \ regions. Empirical work has \nfocused on New Zealand, Australia, North America,\
    \ and Europe. Only a few analyses consider \nempirical evidence on Africa and\
    \ Latin America through a critical lens (see some examples on \nAbdulai , 2022;\
    \ McCampbell et al., 2022; Steinke et al., 2022). This understanding of how \n\
    digitalization is being promoted will need evidence across scales, addressing\
    \ how it is unfolding \nin different types of production, crops, and farmers.\
    \ In Latin America, for example, there is a \ngrowing ecosystem of digital technologies\
    \ for agriculture that are being mainly described by \nmultilateral organizations\
    \ (Loukos and Arathoon, 2021; Viton et al., 2019; Sotomayor et al., \n2021) and\
    \ some scholars are analyzing with a lens of adoption and limitations (e.g Puntel\
    \ et al., \n2022; Silveria et al., 2022; Bolfe et al., 2020). But still, our understanding\
    \ of what is occurring \nwithin countries, in specific products and across types\
    \ of production is scarce. Latin American \ncountries produce a diverse range\
    \ of agricultural commodities, e.g coffee, cocoa, beef, bananas, \nand avocado,\
    \ using different configurations of labor and in contexts with differentiated\
    \ power \n \n \n[42] \nstructures, market and institutional arrangements, and\
    \ rural development projects; because of \nthis diversity an approach looking\
    \ into particular cases is required.  \nThis empirical evidence will help address\
    \ and offer nuanced perspectives on the \nquestions posed by van der burg et al.,\
    \ (2019), who propose to explore the advantages and \ndisadvantages of different\
    \ power distributions in relation to goals, distribution of burdens and \nbenefits,\
    \ sustainability of farms,  autonomy of farmers and consumers, and the meaning\
    \ of \nvalues such as fairness, justice, just distribution, transparency and trust.\
    \ \n \nUnderstanding the different stages of tecnological developments and its\
    \ potential \noutcomes \nThe umbrella of digital agricultural technologies is\
    \ extensive and covers many \ntechnologies, varying in complexity. Despite the\
    \ hype, not all technologies are at the same level \nof market readiness or maturity\
    \ across sectors —e.g, according to FAO (2022), while robotics, \nIoT and data\
    \ analytics in livestock are closer to scaling, they are more at a prototype level\
    \ in \naquaculture. A deep understanding of the nuances —regarding what specific\
    \ technologies do, in \nwhich crops, in which region, and what outcomes— would\
    \ lead to better critics and more \nfocalized interventions. Beyond a categorization,\
    \ paying attention to the heterogeneity of \nagricultural technologies is needed,\
    \ as Stræte et al., (2022:p9) exemplify, “what works well for \ntechnologies for\
    \ goats follows different development trajectories than that for cattle, or round\
    \ \nbales, for that matter”.   \n \nInteractions of digital agriculture with ecosystemic\
    \ challenges   \nDespite narratives on digital agriculture mention sustainability,\
    \ this is more of a \nsuperficial connection since the discourse is overly focused\
    \ on technical and economic benefits. \n \n \n[43] \nConsidering that agriculture,\
    \ food production, and deforestation are three major drivers of \nclimate change\
    \ (IPCC, 2019), it is imperative to understand how digital agricultural technologies\
    \ \nimpact environmental challenges, such as deforestation and consumption of\
    \ natural resources. \nIt is not the analysis of using digital technologies for\
    \ environmental purposes, which is a \ndifferent line of inquiry, but how the\
    \ different types of digital agricultural technologies used in \nfarming or livestock\
    \ have measurable outcomes in environmental terms. Some work has been \nadvanced\
    \ by Green et al., (2021), but still much more is needed to explore through empirical\
    \ \ncases.  \nMore nuanced knowledge of how digital agricultural technologies\
    \ operate will offer \nevidence to contest dominant narratives of the benefits\
    \ of this digitalization and would inform \nsharper efforts of accountability\
    \ on their development.  \n \n2.6 Conclusion \nThe aim of this review essay was\
    \ to provide practical insights for applied scholars and \npractitioners who sought\
    \ to understand the key elements of digitalization in agriculture. It \ncovered\
    \ a range of topics, including an overview of technologies within the digital\
    \ agriculture \numbrella, the narratives surrounding them, socio-ethical implications,\
    \ and possibilities for \ndeveloping a more inclusive and responsible approach\
    \ to digitalization. The essay emphasized the \nimportant point that technology\
    \ is never neutral. Factors such as who developed it, who used it, \nand how it\
    \ was used were all influenced by the interests and goals of decision-makers,\
    \ as well as \nthe resources and possibilities available to those considered users.\
    \  \n  Because digital products and services are neither neutral nor objective;\
    \ conversely, they \nare embedded in power networks and arrangements, it is crucial\
    \ to approach digitalization with a \ncritical eye and a focus on inclusive and\
    \ responsible development. \n \n \n[44] \nChapter Three: Digital Agriculture In\
    \ Colombia: What Is \nAvailable, By Whom, To Where Is It Leading? \n3.1 Introduction\
    \ \nAs in many countries in which the agricultural sector is essential for the\
    \ economy and \nlivelihoods, Colombia is interested in the potential use of digital\
    \ technologies in agriculture. This \nis explicit in the National Developing Plan\
    \ proposed for 2022-2026, where digital agricultural \ntechnologies are essential\
    \ for creating technologically advanced supply chains, sustainable \nproduction\
    \ systems, and e-commerce, supporting efficiency, security, traceability, and\
    \ \ntransparency in commercialization processes that benefit small farmers. In\
    \ this Plan, these \ntechnologies are means to facilitate a “transition towards\
    \ a knowledge-intensive agricultural and \nindustrial economy, which facilitates\
    \ local productive reconversion processes and traceability of \nthe performance\
    \ of small productive units.\" (DNP, 2022 p.120). Amidst the expectations \nregarding\
    \ these technologies, it is unclear whether Colombia's current configuration of\
    \ digital \nproducts and services is moving toward meeting these expectations.\
    \ This study aims to provide \nan overview of the products and services of digital\
    \ agricultural technologies currently available \nin Colombia and to examine their\
    \ possible trajectories. \nDigital agricultural technologies are anticipated to\
    \ change relationships within food \nsystems by affecting the production, distribution,\
    \ and consumption processes (Trendov et al., \n2019; Schroeder et al., 2021).\
    \ Scholars have pointed out the positive, negative, and uncertain \nchallenges\
    \ and opportunities associated with digitalization, including, in general, the\
    \ potential \nexacerbation of inequalities (Hackfort, 2021; Rotz et al., 2019,\
    \ 2019a) and affectations along \nmany factors, including trust, health and safety,\
    \ sustainability and environment, regulation, \ndata, employment, and economic\
    \ impacts (Rose et al., 2021; McGrath et al., 2023). Despite the \nhigh expectations\
    \ generated by digital agriculture and its many nuances, little empirical \nresearch\
    \ has been conducted to understand how digital agriculture unfolds within countries,\
    \ \nparticularly developing countries (Klerkx et al., 2019; McCampbell et al.,\
    \ 2022).   \n \n \n[45] \nUnderstanding the configurations of available digital\
    \ products and services —actors \ninvolved, services offered, and types of target\
    \ farmers— is crucial for both scholars and \npolicymakers. By understanding the\
    \ configurations of available digital agricultural technologies \nin Colombia,\
    \ scholars can contribute to research and knowledge production that addresses\
    \ the \ncountry's unique challenges and opportunities in agriculture related to\
    \ rural inequality and the \nchallenges of biodiversity conservation and climate\
    \ change. Practitioners can enable better \ndecision-making for promoters, prioritize\
    \ conversations that need to occur based on the \npotential impacts of technologies,\
    \ and make better investment allocations to inclusively and \nresponsibly promote\
    \ digital agriculture.  \nThis study is situated in the growing literature on\
    \ the social and ethical implications of \ndigital agricultural technologies (van\
    \ der Burg et al., 2019; Rotz et al., 2019; Bronson, 2022; \nAyris & Rose, 202).\
    \ To conduct the analysis, I used service types as the basis (Porciello et al.,\
    \ \n2021). For each service type, I investigated the type of data involved (Maru\
    \ et al., 2018) and \nexpected results (Porciello et al., 2021; Rolandi et al.,\
    \ 2021). I also consider the potential \npatterns of inequality from the deployment\
    \ of digital agriculture (Hackfort, 2021). This \napproach allows for a nuanced\
    \ exploration of what technology does and the types of results that \ncan be expected.\
    \ In this way, the analysis captures specificity and informs scholars, civil society,\
    \ \npolicymakers, and entrepreneurs interested in participating in how digital\
    \ agricultural \ntechnologies unfold in a particular territory. \nThis study contributes\
    \ to the nascent literature on Latin America by examining the \nconfiguration\
    \ of digital agriculture in a particular Latin American country. Currently, reports\
    \ \ndeveloped by multilateral organizations have mainly described the digital\
    \ agriculture situation \nand offered insights into why it is relevant and how\
    \ it is configured in different countries. For \nexample, the Inter-American Development\
    \ Bank and its Innovation Laboratory (IDB LAB) \npublished reports describing\
    \ the situation of the agtech entrepreneurial ecosystem. These \n \n \n[46] \n\
    include Viton et al., (2019), who offer a bird’s eye view of the sector's size,\
    \ innovations, and \nperformance by country; according to this review, in 2018,\
    \ 5 percent of the 457 start-ups in \nLatin America working on new agriculture\
    \ technologies were in Colombia. It also includes the \nwork of Loukos and Arathoon\
    \ (2021), who offered market mapping, identification of trends, and \nrecommendations\
    \ for the digital agriculture ecosystem after examining 131 digital agricultural\
    \ \ntools used in Latin America.  Other studies have focused on specific technologies\
    \ and countries. \nIn a report by the IICA, Grasso (2022) explored the blockchain\
    \ situation for Latin American \nagriculture and identified 29 blockchain solutions,\
    \ including one from Colombia. Some studies \noffer insights into specific countries,\
    \ such as Argentina (Munoz et al., 2021) and Honduras and \nHaiti (Strategic Impact\
    \ Advisors, 2022, 2022a); however, a critical perspective that considers \nsocial\
    \ implications is missing. In this sense, this study is an exploratory endeavor\
    \ to critically \nunderstand what is available in the Colombian digital agricultural\
    \ technology market.  \nThis study presents a panorama of the types of digital\
    \ products and services available in \nthe Colombian market, their potential uses\
    \ and benefits for farmers, and the actors behind \nthem. These results arise\
    \ from a mapping exercise conducted with secondary information, \nguided by the\
    \ following sub-questions: (i) What initiatives currently promote digital agricultural\
    \ \ntechnologies in Colombia? (ii) Which products and services of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies \nare currently available in the Colombian agricultural context?\
    \ (iii) What types of actors sell \nthem, and to whom? (iv) What implications\
    \ can be anticipated for small-scale farmers?  \nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized into three parts. First, it introduces a \nframework to analyze the\
    \ configuration of digital technologies available in the market, focusing \non\
    \ the specific type of service offered, potential outcomes, and particular social\
    \ implications that \ncould arise. Second, it provides a background of the Colombian\
    \ case and introduces data \ncollection and data analysis procedures. Finally,\
    \ it discusses results of the current configuration \nof digital technologies\
    \ in Colombia across five types of services: Digital Advisory & Extension, \n\
    \ \n \n[47] \nDigitized Farm Tools, Digital, Financial Services, Digital Market\
    \ Linkages, and Supply chain \nmanagement. The chapter concludes with a discussion\
    \ of potential pathways derived from these \nconfigurations, their implications\
    \ for small farmers, and aspects to consider for making this \nconfiguration more\
    \ inclusive.  \n \n3.2 A Framework for analyzing digital agricultural technologies\
    \  \nTo understand the configurations of digital agricultural technologies available\
    \ to farmers \nin Colombia, I used service types as the backbone and added three\
    \ layers: types of data, expected \nresults, and patterns of inequality. Below,\
    \ I introduce these elements: \n \nService Types and expected outcomes \nPorciello\
    \ et al., (2021), Digital Agri Hub (2021), and Loukos and Arathoon (2021) use\
    \ a \ncategorization of services offered by digital agricultural technologies.\
    \ Service types allow for an \nunderstanding of the specific social relationships\
    \ that may be affected by digital technologies, \nthe actors involved, and the\
    \ risks and uncertainties that can arise. The five types of services \noffered\
    \ to farmers through digital products and services are i) advisory, ii) farm tools,\
    \ iii) \nfinancial services, iv) market linkages, and v) supply chain management\
    \ (Porciello et al., 2021). \nEach of these categories is broad and can contain\
    \ subcategories that add nuances to each type of \nservice (Loukos and Arathoon,\
    \ 2021). Table 2 offers a summary of these service types and \npotential subcategories;\
    \ I selected those subcategories that are particularly relevant to \nColombia's\
    \ situation.   \n \n \nTable 2. Service Types, subcategories, and expected outcomes\

    \ 48] \ns\n \n \n \n[49] \nTypes of data \nAccording to Maru et al. (2018), agriculture\
    \ has four distinct data streams. First, \"localized \ndata,” consists of information\
    \ generated and collected on the farm for exclusive on-farm use, such \nas soil\
    \ composition, seed types, fertilizer usage, planting dates, farming techniques,\
    \ and water \nconsumption. The second is \"imported data,\" which involves data\
    \ gathered off-farm and applied \non-farm. These data include market prices and\
    \ weather information, which are analyzed and \ncustomized for on-farm applications\
    \ by a separate entity that owns, oversees, and regulates the \ndata. The third\
    \ is \"exported data,\" which includes data gathered and organized on the farm\
    \ for \noff-farm utilization. These data can be collected by farmers themselves\
    \ or through sophisticated \ntools, and are typically processed, grouped, or combined\
    \ with other data from various sources, \nenabling different stakeholders to make\
    \ informed decisions. Governments can direct services and \nsubsidies, financial\
    \ institutions and insurance providers can offer specialized services and \nproducts,\
    \ and researchers can devise and execute targeted projects. Finally, the \"ancillary\
    \ data\" \ncomprised both on-farm and off-farm data used for off-farm purposes.\
    \ Each data type presents \nseveral challenges. According to Maru et al. (2018),\
    \ localized and exported data share challenges \nin privacy, ownership, monetization,\
    \ and monopoly, and imported data have access challenges in \nterms of availability,\
    \ accessibility, and usability.  Table 3 illustrates the types of data that can\
    \ \npotentially be found and used for each type of service.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \n \nPotential patterns of inequality   \nThere are many social and ethical\
    \ aspects to pay attention to when considering the impacts \nof digital agricultural\
    \ technologies. Hackfort (2021) described five patterns of inequality linked to\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture.  \nIn the first one —inequalities in\
    \ control over technology deployment— the main factors \nshaping it are the relevant\
    \ role that big ag and tech corporations play to control technology \ndevelopment,\
    \ technical lock-ins that limit farmers' options and the lack of interoperability\
    \ —this \ninability of different systems, devices, or software applications to\
    \ communicate, exchange, and \nuse information effectively with each other hinders\
    \ seamless data exchange and integration, \nlimiting the potential for efficient\
    \ decision-making and optimal resource management in \nagricultural practices.\
    \  In the second pattern —the unequal distribution of benefits— the concerns \n\
    are that innovation focuses on capital-intensive approaches that favor large-scale\
    \ agricultural \noperations; the disparity in access to digital infrastructure\
    \ exacerbates the divide between urban \nand rural farmers; and asymmetry in financial\
    \ risks, where farmers face significant risks while \n \n \n \n[51] \ntechnology\
    \ providers gain advantages from utilizing data provided by farmers at no cost.\
    \  In the \nthird pattern, —uneven sovereignty over data and hardware— the concern\
    \ is that technology \nproviders dominate data storage, imbalances in bargaining\
    \ power put farmers at a disadvantage, \nand private licensing agreements and\
    \ legal restrictions that can prevent farmers from accessing \ntheir farm data\
    \ and may even prohibit self-repair of hardware. In the fourth pattern, — \ninequalities\
    \ in knowledge and skills— the worrisome elements are unequal digital literacy,\
    \ a \ngrowing dependency on providers of big-data and the disadvantage that farmers\
    \ with fewer \nresources can have to hire skilled employees.  Finally, in the\
    \ fifth pattern —unequal problem \ndefinition and problem-solving capacities—\
    \ aspects causing concern are the relevance of \nproductivist solutions to structural\
    \ problems and the fixation on fixation on technological \nsolutions detract from\
    \ alternative approaches.  \n   \n3.3 Context \nAgriculture is vital to Colombia's\
    \ economy, food security, rural livelihood, biodiversity, \nand social and political\
    \ stability. In 2020, the sector accounted for approximately 6.7% of the \ncountry's\
    \ GDP, generated over $9 billion in revenue through exports, and employed about\
    \ 16.7% \nof the labor force (World Bank, 2021b). Colombia's diverse agricultural\
    \ production, including \nstaple crops and tropical fruits, contributes to food\
    \ security (FAO, 2021). Approximately 30% of \nthe population resides in rural\
    \ areas, where small-scale farming is predominant, with around 80% \nof farms\
    \ being smaller than five hectares (World Bank, 2021; FAO, 2018). The importance\
    \ of \nagriculture in achieving social and political stability is further highlighted\
    \ by the 2016 peace \nagreement with the FARC, which includes provisions for rural\
    \ development and land reform \n(Colombian Government & FARC, 2016). Promoting\
    \ sustainable agricultural practices and \nsupporting small-scale farmers are\
    \ crucial for Colombia's long-term growth and development. \nHistorically, rural\
    \ poverty has been higher than the urban and national averages. In 2021, rural\
    \ \n \n \n \n[52] \npoverty was 31.9%, which is higher than the national average\
    \ of 27.7% and urban average of 21% \n(DNP, 2022).   Table 4 presents an illustration\
    \ of the general indicators for this sector. \nSmall farmers in Colombia face\
    \ significant challenges in accessing infrastructure and \nother resources relevant\
    \ to productivity, including low yields, insufficient resources to improve \n\
    their main activities, such as irrigation systems, agricultural practices, and\
    \ industrial machinery, \nand poor access to agro-climatic information. (Lopez-Barrera\
    \ et al., 2022; Martinez et al., 2016) \nAccording to Katz et al. (2021), in a\
    \ report commissioned by the Ministry of \nTelecommunications and Bogota Chamber\
    \ of Commerce, the adoption of mature digital \ntechnologies is still low among\
    \ companies in the agricultural sector; only 57% of employees use \nthe Internet\
    \ for their work, and the sector has limited development in supply chain and \n\
    distribution channels. For instance, only 24% of companies in the sector purchase\
    \ inputs online \nand only 27% use the Internet for their sales. The slow digital\
    \ transformation of the sector is due \nto several barriers and risks, such as\
    \ resistance to change, limited budgets, lack of clear \nresponsibility, and lack\
    \ of resources. Moreover, the sector faces challenges such as poor \nbroadband\
    \ coverage in rural areas, lack of training in technological and administrative\
    \ areas, and \nlow adoption of advanced technologies, such as the Internet of\
    \ Things, robotics, and artificial \nintelligence. \nTable 4. Illustrative data\

    \ \nThis qualitative study examined the Colombian configuration of available digital\
    \ \nagricultural technologies. It explores the following questions: (i) What initiatives\
    \ currently \npromote digital agricultural technologies in Colombia? (ii) Which\
    \ products and services of digital \nagricultural technologies are currently available\
    \ in the Colombian agricultural context? (iii) What \ntypes of actors sell them,\
    \ and to whom? (iv) What implications can be anticipated for small-scale \nfarmers?\
    \ \nIn this study, I used a broad definition of digital agriculture. Following\
    \ Duncan, Abdulai \n& Fraser  (2021. p139), here digital agriculture encompasses\
    \ \"any form of information and \ncommunication technologies (ICTs) in the agricultural\
    \ field, either to make automated or non-\nautomated decisions and practices\"\
    . This can include anything from simple mobile apps that \nprovide information\
    \ to farmers to advanced automated systems that use data to control the \nequipment\
    \ and devices. This broad term encompasses all the forms of digital technology\
    \ used to \nimprove the efficiency and productivity of agricultural operations.\
    \ I made this decision because, \nin developing countries such as Colombia, initiatives\
    \ promoting the digitalization of agriculture \ncover a large spectrum of digital\
    \ technologies, including less advanced technologies (e.g., simple \nmobile apps,\
    \ text messaging systems, soil moisture, temperature sensors, and human-operated\
    \ \ndrons) and cutting-edge innovations such as blockchain, virtual reality systems,\
    \ robotics, and \nartificial intelligence systems for soil analysis, among others.\
    \     \n \nSearching strategy \nI used a combined search strategy. I conducted\
    \ web searches for different resources (see \nTable 5), conducted in-person and\
    \ virtual participant observations in specialized events \npromoting digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in Colombia, and had informal queries with \nprofessionals working\
    \ there. During web searches, when possible, for the nature of the source, I \n\
    \ \n \n \n[54] \nused a list of keywords drawn from various lists of technologies\
    \ (Prause et al., 2020; Trendov et \nal., 2019) (see Annex 1). During the search,\
    \ I combined “agricultura digital” (Spanish for digital \nagriculture\") and Colombia,\
    \ and the name of technologies with Colombia and “productores” and \n“pequeños\
    \ productores” (Spanish for producers and small producers\"). The search was conducted\
    \ \nbetween September 2020 and May 2022. An update was performed in March 2023.\

    \  \n \nDuring this search, I also identified initiatives with an active national\
    \ scope during 2022 \nand the onset of 2023.  \n \nData selection and organization\
    \ \nInitiatives were included if they are active during 2022 and the onset of\
    \ 2023 and are \ncompletely focused on digital agriculture, or at least a major\
    \ component. Digital products and \nservices were included when fulfilling three\
    \ criteria: i) fitting into the list of technologies, ii) \nhaving headquarters\
    \ in Colombia or being marketed in the country by international companies, \n\
    and iii) already in the market — I exclude technologies in the design stage. \n\
    \ \n \n \n[55] \nAll digital products and services identified were organized in\
    \ a matrix considering the \nname, objective, how it works, population target,\
    \ name of the seller, type of company, key \npartners, and website. Using the\
    \ zoomed-in framework presented in the previous section, I \nanalyzed these digital\
    \ products and services considering three aspects: types of service, types of\
    \ \ndata, and types of expected outcomes. \nInitially, 139 digital agricultural\
    \ products and services that met three predetermined \nselection criteria were\
    \ identified. To complete the analysis matrix, a thorough review of each \norganization's\
    \ website, social media presence, and available news articles was conducted. In\
    \ some \ninstances, it was observed that only general information was present\
    \ on the website, with no clear \nindication of the most recent update or current\
    \ availability of the service. Under such \ncircumstances, social media channels\
    \ and news articles were examined in greater detail to \ndetermine whether the\
    \ product or service remained in the market. Entries were removed from the \n\
    results when the information was insufficient or when the product or service did\
    \ not have a direct \napplication for farmers. A total of 43 of the 139 initially\
    \ identified entries were eliminated from \nthe final analysis. The 93 digital\
    \ products and services identified were illustrative, considering \nthat Viton\
    \ et al. (2019) found 23 digital products for Colombia and Loukos and Arathoon\
    \ (2021) \nfound 131 for Latin America.  \nChallenges and Limitations \nThis study\
    \ primarily relied on information sourced from the official websites of each \n\
    company and general news outlets. However, it is important to acknowledge that\
    \ the content \navailable on these platforms is directly generated by the respective\
    \ companies themselves, with \nthe purpose of conveying specific messages that\
    \ promote the sales of their products or services. \nConsequently, while such\
    \ information is valuable for obtaining a broad understanding, it may not \nsufficiently\
    \ capture the intricacies underlying business decisions and the associated business\
    \ \nmodels. \n \n \n \n[56] \n \nTo gain a deeper comprehension of these aspects,\
    \ it is recommended to conduct specific \ncase studies that delve into the individuals\
    \ responsible for decision-making processes, the \nmethodologies employed, and\
    \ the underlying rationale. However, given the scope of this research, \nthese\
    \ nuanced analyses fall outside its purview. \nThis study provides a non-exhaustive\
    \ overview of digital products and services currently \navailable in the Colombian\
    \ agricultural market based on observations made during a specific time \nframe.\
    \ Although digital technology is a fast-paced market, this review of available\
    \ technologies \nallows us to identify patterns and trends in the current digital\
    \ agriculture market and advance the \nconversation of their potential trajectories.\
    \ \n \n3.5 Findings \n3.5.1 What initiatives currently promote digital agricultural\
    \ technology in \nColombia?   \nAlthough Colombia is not the Latin American leader\
    \ in digital agriculture, it is among the \ntop five countries, with most digital\
    \ innovations unfolded in regional technologies (Viton et al., \n2019). The interest\
    \ in promoting these technologies seems mainly present at the national level,\
    \ \nwith public and private endeavors calling for the sector's development and\
    \ looking for projects \nreaching farmers nationwide. Below is a panorama of projects\
    \ with an extensive range in 2022 \nand/or unfolding by the beginning of 2023.\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[57] \nPromoting National Digital Extension \nPublic\
    \ agricultural digital extension service: In October 2021, the public Rural \n\
    Development Agency2, started a pilot to offer a public agricultural digital extension\
    \ service. This \nservice was presented as a “strategy to expand coverage, supplement\
    \ in-person services, and \nprovide small-scale farmers with access to information,\
    \ resources, markets, financing, and \ntraining\" (EPSEA UTP and ADR, 2023: p4).\
    \ The service combines WhatsApp with calls, text \nmessages, podcasts, and videos\
    \ (Agencia de Desarrollo Rural,2021). This initiative, executed by a \npublic\
    \ university, took a top-bottom approach, and defined the value chains to be considered\
    \ and \nthe users to reach at the local level based on regional dialogues with\
    \ public entities and priorities \nwritten on the Regional Plans for Agricultural\
    \ Extension and the Comprehensive Strengthening \nPlans per Producer. According\
    \ to their indicators, the program included 57 value chains —12 \nlivestock and\
    \ 45 agricultural— in 30 of Colombia’s 32 departments. The project targeted 187.981\
    \ \nfarmers, of whom approximately 52% were women.  At the end of 2022, the program\
    \ was \nsuspended, while waiting for guidelines to be offered by the new government,\
    \ which started \noperations in August 2022. By February 2023, the future path\
    \ of this service was still unclear. \nStill, the team was working on finishing\
    \ knowledge management of the process, learning, and \nidentifying good practices\
    \ (A. Londoño, personal communication, February 1, 2023). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    2 Public entity under the branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\
    \ in charge \nof managing, promoting, and providing financial support for agricultural\
    \ and rural development aimed at \ntransforming rural areas and executing programs\
    \ with regional impacts. \n \n \n \n[58] \nPutting together open and public data\
    \ for agriculture in Colombia \nTwo public entities, IDEAM3 and AGROSAVIA4, have\
    \ been developing open information \nservices to improve decision-making to enhance\
    \ productivity and competitiveness.  IDEAM \ndeveloped the app “Mi Pronóstico”\
    \ to offer access to real-time information on weather forecasts, \nsatellite images,\
    \ and early warning alerts (IDEAM, 2017). AGROSAVIA has seven open \ninformation\
    \ systems that focus on different stakeholders and needs. For example, ViMaZ is\
    \ a \ngeospatial application that displays agricultural information for the Zulia\
    \ irrigation district in a \ndepartment; HornillApp helps users without specialized\
    \ knowledge to estimate the dimensions \nand economic value of an efficient thermal\
    \ panel for sugar cane production; Más Bienestar is a \nfree application designed\
    \ to evaluate and improve bovine well-being in specialized dairy systems; \nand\
    \ M.A.P.A is a technological tool that helps increase local capacity for making\
    \ decisions to \nimprove crop system adaptation to climate change and climate\
    \ variability (AGROSAVIA, 2023).  \n \nDigital technologies in the National Development\
    \ Plan \nIn the National Development Plan proposed for 2022-2026, the Colombian\
    \ government, \nruled by Colombia’s first leftist leader, includes several angles\
    \ within the Human Rights to Food \npillars to promote digital technologies for\
    \ the agricultural sector (DNP, 2022). Their views on \ndigital technologies are\
    \ summarized in the following statement:  \n“El uso intensivo de datos (monitoreo\
    \ y seguimiento de cosechas y de producción, \nresultado de la adopción de tecnologías\
    \ y cumplimiento de estándares, aceptaciones y \nrechazos de posibles compradores,\
    \ entrada a segmentos de compras públicas) y la \nadopción de tecnologías digitales,\
    \ permitirá transitar hacia una economía agraria e \n \n \n3 Institute of Hydrology,\
    \ Meteorology, and Environmental Studies, is responsible for producing and \n\
    disseminating information related to hydrology, meteorology, and environmental\
    \ studies. \n4 Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research, aims to promote\
    \ scientific knowledge and \ntechnological innovations in the agricultural sector.\
    \ \n \n \n \n[59] \nindustrial intensiva en conocimiento, que facilite procesos\
    \ de reconversión productiva \nlocal y de trazabilidad del desempeño de las pequeñas\
    \ unidades productivas.” \n [The intensive use of data (monitoring and tracking\
    \ of crops and production, \noutcomes of technology adoption and compliance with\
    \ standards, acceptance and \nrejection by potential buyers, entry into public\
    \ procurement segments) and the adoption \nof digital technologies will allow\
    \ for the transition towards a knowledge-intensive \nagricultural and industrial\
    \ economy, facilitating local productive reconversion processes \nand traceability\
    \ of performance of small production units] (DNP, 2022 p.121) \n \nIn other sections\
    \ of this national plan, digital technologies are presented as tools for \nenabling\
    \ more and better food production; facilitators for the betterment of supply chains,\
    \ \nleading to more efficient and secure value chains, benefiting small farmers;\
    \ and an instrument \nof logistics and infrastructure improvement to reduce losses\
    \ of food production. Speaking \nspecifically on the technological extension to\
    \ small farmers, the plan makes explicit the \nexpectation of digital technologies\
    \ as an agent of change. The plan was presented in February \n2023 and is currently\
    \ undergoing a review by the Colombian Congress. Until May 2023, they \nhad to\
    \ study, analyze, and approve the document, which will then become a National\
    \ Law.    \n \nLinking digital agriculture to climate action \nSustainable Agricultural\
    \ Colombia is a 5-year project with funding of US$99,9 million, \naiming to reduce\
    \ the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate threats to minimize\
    \ their \nimpact on the competitiveness of the Colombian agricultural sector.\
    \ This project, which began in \nNovember 2022, is financed through a combination\
    \ of financial resources from the \nDevelopment Bank of Latin America, the Government\
    \ of Colombia, agricultural research \ninstitutions (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT,\
    \ CYMMIT, and CIPAV), and agricultural producer \nassociations in Colombia, as\
    \ well as resources from both loans and concessional funds (grants) \nfrom the\
    \ Green Climate Fund (Colombia Agropecuaria and Sostenible, 2023). \n \n \n \n\
    [60] \nThe main objective of this project is to enhance the resilience of agricultural\
    \ production \nagainst climate-related risks, mitigate their negative impact on\
    \ the competitiveness of the \nColombian agricultural industry, and ensure consistent\
    \ and high-quality food supply through \nthe reinforcement of climate risk management.\
    \ This will also contribute to reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions and harmful\
    \ effects of agricultural production. It comprises three components: i) \ndigital\
    \ agriculture and climate services to modernize agricultural extension services\
    \ with an \nemphasis on adaptation and mitigation; ii) genetic improvement, crop\
    \ management techniques, \ntechnological options, and scaling to increase resilience\
    \ and promote low-carbon agricultural \ndevelopment; and iii) innovative and inclusive\
    \ business models through modernized innovation \nsystems and a more committed\
    \ financial sector. The project is anticipated to directly benefit \nover 619,691\
    \ individuals, comprising 194,871 rural producers and their respective families,\
    \ and \nindirectly benefit approximately 347,996 producers. The project is targeting\
    \ 8 crops, including \nrice, sugar cane and panela sugar cane, coffee, livestock,\
    \ corn, musaceae and potato. The digital \nagriculture component aims to reach\
    \ 126,394 farmers, 1,532 technicians, and nine crops across \n139 municipalities\
    \ (Colombia Agropecuaria and Sostenible, 2023). By March 2023, the project \n\
    was completing its team and conducting regional workshops to socialize their aims\
    \ and scope. \n \n \n \nAgrifood tech innovation hub  \nAgcenter was launched\
    \ in late 2022 in Medellin (Antioquia) as an agrifood tech \ninnovation hub, “seeking\
    \ to energize the ecosystem in Colombia, encourage ecosystem \narticulation through\
    \ connections between actors, promote the development of global solutions \nfor\
    \ the sector, attract talent and investment, and accelerate agrifood entrepreneurship”\
    \ (Agtech, \n2023, para. 1). Agcenter aims to become a national and Latin American\
    \ hotspot for companies, \n \n \n \n[61] \npublic entities, investors, and all-size\
    \ farmers, to develop initiatives to accelerate digital \ninnovations by startups,\
    \ facilitate investment, and promote open innovation.  \nThis hub was conceived\
    \ by Ricardo Jaramillo, the founder of two initiatives focused on \nthe agriculture\
    \ sector, including a virtual marketplace where farmers could buy all kinds of\
    \ \nagricultural inputs, and a company focused on the organization of specialized\
    \ agricultural \nevents. The idea was pitched and became a collective project\
    \ led by the Antioquia government, a \nlarge private NGO promoted by leading companies\
    \ in Medellin, and the largest public university \nin the department (S. Henao,\
    \ personal communication, November 2, 2022).  Agcenter started \noperations with\
    \ an approved seed capital of USD 673.000 donated by the provincial government\
    \ \nof Antioquia. By 2027, this hub aims to accelerate at least 200 startups,\
    \ connect more than 300 \nto the corporate market, and have a fund with an increase\
    \ of more than $70 million and an \ninvestment of more than $400 million, among\
    \ other projects (Agronet, 2022). By March 2023, \nthis hub had conducted its\
    \ first business acceleration program and selected 25 companies across \nthree\
    \ topics: foodtech, agtech, and animaltech. \n \nInitiatives promoting networking\
    \ \nNetwork for Extension workers  \nThe Linkata is a network of extension workers\
    \ and technical assistants in Colombia. It \nwas created in 2012 by AGROSAVIA\
    \ and the Ministry of Agriculture. Linkata aims to hold a \nspace for interaction,\
    \ discussion, and participation of the sector's technical assistants and \nextension\
    \ workers, and to achieve and strengthen the service of technical advisory in\
    \ the benefit \nof small farmers. Currently, the community comprises forty-four\
    \ (44) groups that respond to the \nproductive chains of the Ministry of Agriculture\
    \ and Rural Development (Cruz and Perdomo, \n2019). Today, this network contains\
    \ more than 7.000 active members.  \n \n \n \n[62] \n \nCreating a professional\
    \ guild \nIn June 2019, a WhatsApp group called Agtech Colombia was created by\
    \ civil society \ngroups as a collaborative strategy for coordinating and implementing\
    \ actions to develop the \nAgriFoodTech ecosystem. In its description, the group\
    \ presents itself as an Agtech ecosystem \ngroup, home to representatives from\
    \ the private sector, public sector, multilateral entities, civil \nsociety, farmers,\
    \ associations, startups, media, financial and impact sectors, agribusiness \n\
    associations, agriculture and food, and academia. The group hosts three working\
    \ tables focusing \non governance, technology and competitiveness, fair trade,\
    \ and rural development. Since June \n2022, I have joined the WhatsaApp group\
    \ and have followed its evolution. By the end of March \n2023, 265 people —including\
    \ entrepreneurs, consultants, professionals, public servants, and a \nfew leaders\
    \ of farmers' organizations— were part of this group that shared news, relevant\
    \ \ninformation, and specific questions on products and services, such as where\
    \ to find drones or \nbuyers to commercialize avocado.  By March 2023, the group\
    \ promoted a series of virtual and \nin-person meetings among their members, mainly\
    \ those localized in Bogotá, Colombia´s capital, \naiming to position and consolidate\
    \ the Agtech Group “as an enabler for the use and \ndiversification of technology\
    \ in the Colombian rural areas, as a space for institutional influence \nwith\
    \ the aim of generating productive impact, food security, and economic development’\
    \ \n(Agtech Group, 2023, p6). The group plans an in-person event in July 2023\
    \ to boost the work \nbeing developed in the working tables, define communication\
    \ with the Bogota Secretary of \nEconomic Development, and formalize their work\
    \ as a professional guild with a strategic plan to \nguide their future actions.\
    \  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[63] \nCreating an annual space for gathering \nExpoAgrofuturo\
    \ is a fair that takes place in Medellín every year and is an event focused \n\
    on the agricultural sector, the most important for Colombia, and with projection\
    \ to Latin \nAmerica. This fair is \"the place where supply and demand meet in\
    \ all business segments and for \nall ecosystems of the sector\" (Expoagrofuturo,\
    \ 2023, para.2). For the past couple of years, \nExpoAgrofuturo has promoted conversation\
    \ and visibility of digital technologies in agriculture. \nSince 2022, the same\
    \ organizers have been promoting Agstar as a platform to foster connections \n\
    between different actors focused on integrating innovations in the agri-food sector.\
    \ In its \nactivities, Agstar holds start-up competition, a business roundtable,\

    \ instance, \nSimpleAgri, a Colombian company, offers medium-sized farmers and\
    \ agroindustry services that \nenable the planning, scheduling, and execution\
    \ of agricultural production systems. It focuses on \ncosting, traceability, data\
    \ collection throughout crop growth phases, and production and harvest \nquality\
    \ management through recommendations from technical assistance visits to farms.\
    \ \nSiomaApp, a Colombian company, offers the banana industry a mobile app, which\
    \ is a precision \nagriculture ecosystem that can monitor the quality of georeferenced\
    \ fieldwork using \nphotographic records. Climate FieldView is a service provided\
    \ by Bayer that allows the \ncollection, transmission, and analysis of agronomic\
    \ data from all farm tasks. Galápp is a service \ndeveloped by a Colombian startup\
    \ aiming to facilitate small farmers’ capture of information on \nfarms, including\
    \ harvest, tasks, sanitary controls, input application, and sales; this app works\
    \ \nwithout the Internet and is designed for small and medium farmers.  \nThe\
    \ service focused on smart packaging is called Nukak and was developed by the\
    \ same \ncompany that launched SiomaApp. Nukak is a scale with an integrated control\
    \ system that \norganizes the exact boxes for export. According to their brochure,\
    \ using this digital product, an \nexporter can save $20,000 USD annually for\
    \ a 100-hectare farm by avoiding an excess weight of \n237 grams. Their main clients\
    \ were the banana and palm companies. \n \n \n \n[67] \n \nDigital Market Linkages\
    \ \nSixteen digital products and services offering a marketplace or e-commerce\
    \ platform \nwere identified. Ten (62% of 16) are digital marketplaces that bring\
    \ together multiple sellers to \noffer buyers a broader range of agricultural\
    \ products and services. The other six offer e-\ncommerce platforms focused on\
    \ direct sales from a single company that aggregates the \nproduction of small\
    \ and medium producers.  \nDigital marketplaces have two types of connections:\
    \ connecting farmers with input \nsellers and connecting farmers with buyers of\
    \ their produce. In the first case, some services are \nfree for buyers, while\
    \ others are initially free for sellers but later charge a commission for sales.\
    \ \nThe inputs for purchase are seeds, fertilizers, farm equipment, and animals\
    \ such as cows and \nhorses. In the second case, the business model can vary.\
    \ For example, SiembraCo employs an \napproach centered on virtual crop planting.\
    \ This enables customers to finance the virtual \nplanting of crops, and upon\
    \ harvest, they can consume the produce, donate it, or sell it on the \nsame platform.\
    \ On the other hand, Comproagro allows buyers to communicate and buy directly\
    \ \nfrom farmers their current produce.  \nE-commerce platforms also have specific\
    \ nuances. Two platforms seem more specialized: \nPetalii sells superior quality\
    \ floral products to national and international markets, and Mucho \nsells products\
    \ related to the sustainable use of biodiversity.  On the other hand, TuPlaza,\
    \ \nGuineo, and Frubana commercialize the production of small-scale producers\
    \ to urban centers, \nconnecting them with households, restaurants, and neighborhood\
    \ stores.   \nDigital Advisory & Extension \nThree digital products and services\
    \ offering farmers and technical assistants information \non weather forecasting,\
    \ pests and diseases, and market prices were identified. These products \nare\
    \ provided by public, private, and nonprofit actors using different types of technologies\
    \ to \nreach their users. \n \n[68] \n \nCenicafe, the research branch of the\
    \ National Federation of Coffee Growers5 (FNC), \nprovided Agroclima in 2011.\
    \ This web-based agroclimatic platform delivers open information \nrelated to\
    \ weather forecasting and identifies the most suitable months for coffee planting.\
    \ This \ninformation is shared daily and includes current and historical data.\
    \ This free service targets \ncoffee growers of all sizes and utilizes historical\
    \ data from the Cenicafe.  AGROSAVIA offers Dr \nAgro, a mobile application sharing\
    \ with extensionists workers, technical assistants, and farmers \ninformation\
    \ for identifying pests, diseases and nutritional deficiencies in potato, cotton,\
    \ tomato, \nmango, and rubber crops. It is based on scientific information reviewed\
    \ and curated by \nAGROSAVIA and can be used without internet access. \nAgrodatAI\
    \ offers Don Tulio, a free WhatsApp chatbot that provides farmers with data on\
    \ \nweather, prices, price forecasts, and best-selling prices for any product\
    \ or location. Farmers can \nsubmit written inquiries, and the bot retrieves responses\
    \ from public data. However, it remains \nunclear whether this information is\
    \ accurate or reliable.  \nDigital Financial Services \nEight digital products\
    \ and services offering some financial assistance to farmers were \nidentified.\
    \ These were created to facilitate farmers' access to financing through different\
    \ \noperational models. One model is crowdfunding, where farmers structure their\
    \ project and post \nit on the platform to look for micro-funding from other individuals;\
    \ this is the model of Agrapp \nand Agroune, which facilitates the exchange between\
    \ farmers and investors. Another model is \nthe direct offer of customized financing\
    \ services for farmers. For instance, Agricapital offers \ninvestments between\
    \ USD 1.000 and 5.000 for rural young and women without credit scores, \nbut with\
    \ productive projects running.  GrowBank provides a line of credit for agricultural\
    \ \n \n \n5 Created in 1927, National Federation of Coffee Growers is a non-profit\
    \ trade organization, \ninternationally well-known within the coffee world, in\
    \ charge of representing and defending the interests \nof Colombian coffee producers\
    \ at the national and international levels. \n \n[69] \n \nactivities after a\
    \ thorough risk evaluation. The last model is supplied by Produce Pay, which \n\
    offers funding up to 12 months before harvest and a marketplace to facilitate\
    \ the sale of the \nproduce.  \nAgRisk and IncluirTec offer financial companies\
    \ and insurers risk assessment services \ntailored to the needs of farmers, supporting\
    \ the emission of a rural loan within the offers of \nthese companies.  \nFinally,\
    \ the National Federation of Coffee Growers (FNC) developed Coffee Growers' \n\
    Smart ID, a service that offers access to banking services to coffee growers members\
    \ of the \nfederation. This product is a savings account with access to ATMs for\
    \ electronic payments that is \nalso used to channel government subsidies. \n\
    Supply chain management \nThe six identified digital products and services provide\
    \ platforms to support the \ninteractions of several actors in one or more value\
    \ chains. For example, Cultivando Futuro \naimed to align supply, demand, and\
    \ investment by creating Colombia's “largest supply \ncalendar.” They expect to\
    \ map what is being offered by farmers and what is being requested by \nconsumers\
    \ to generate data and provide access to details on how products are needed in\
    \ the \nmarket.  TraceCoffe, CoffeAgenda, and COLCO are value-chain-specific.\
    \ TraceCoffee, a \ntechnology company founded by Colombians in Silicon Valley,\
    \ offers traceability along the \ncoffee value chain using the Internet of Things\
    \ and blockchain to gather information at each \nproduction and commercialization\
    \ step. CoffeAgenda, founded in Colombia, provides registers \nand monitoring\
    \ for coffee during the productive process, post-harvest, and export.  COLCO:\
    \ The \nColombian Cocoa Control System, developed by the British Embassy in Colombia,\
    \ applies \nsatellite technologies to support the interaction between cacao farmers\
    \ and producers to \nimprove quality and yield in the pre-and post-harvest phases\
    \ of the cacao supply chain.  \n \n \n[70] \n \n3.5.3 What types of actors sell\
    \ them, and to whom? \n \nNational and international actors, including public,\
    \ private, social, and international \ncooperation entities, constitute the providers\
    \ of digital products and services for the agricultural \nsector in Colombia.\
    \  \nDigitized Farm Tools \nAll the companies in this category are private companies\
    \ of varied size, including, \nstartups, and medium and large companies. 56% of\
    \ providers are Colombian; the remaining \nproviders consist of international\
    \ startups and large companies originating from Chile, Israel, \nMexico, the United\
    \ States, Germany, and Brazil. The available descriptions do not explicitly \n\
    state whether the products are targeted at small-scale farmers; based on their\
    \ features, these \nproducts and services appear to be geared toward farmers with\
    \ larger land areas who require \nmonitoring and evaluation of their agricultural\
    \ processes more efficiently. \nDigital Market Linkages \nEight out of the ten\
    \ identified marketplaces services in this category are provided by \nnational\
    \ organizations, including startups and social companies; they are mainly located\
    \ in \nmajor cities; only three out of eight were founded by entrepreneurs in\
    \ departments such as \nCasanare, Boyacá, and Tolima, which are not very prominent\
    \ as others where the major capitals \nare located.  All have partnerships with\
    \ different actors, including business accelerators, media \noutlets, international\
    \ cooperation, large NGOs, universities, chambers of commerce and \ncompanies\
    \ selling agricultural inputs. The other two marketplaces are provided by international\
    \ \ncompanies, one from the United States (Agromovil with USAID and private foundations\
    \ as key \npartners) and one from Brazil (Orbia with solid partnerships with Bayer\
    \ and Yara). These \nmarketplaces seem oriented to all kinds of farmers who know\
    \ how to navigate these interactions \n \n[71] \n \nmediated through digital platforms\
    \ and are close enough to their potential buyers to sell the \nproduct in a profitable\
    \ way.  \nRegarding the six e-commerce platforms, headquarters are all in major\
    \ cities, and only \none is oriented to national and international markets.  All\
    \ seem oriented to small farmers. For \nexample, Petalli aggregates 50 small flower\
    \ producers; and Mucho sells the produce of different \nfarmers association. \
    \ \nDigital Advisory & Extension \nThe three primary technical assistance providers\
    \ are of national origin. Agroclima is \ndeveloped by Cenicafé, a research center\
    \ affiliated with the biggest coffee association of farmers. \nDr Agro is a product\
    \ of Agrosavia, a public organization. AgrodatAI is a spin-off created by two\
    \ \nprivate companies, one specializing in geographic information systems and\
    \ the other in project \ndesign for agricultural chains. They all seem to target\
    \ small and medium farmers with some \ninternet access. Dr Agro is the only one\
    \ available for use offline and focusing on technical \nassistants. \n \n Digital\
    \ Financial Services \nSeven of the eight financial services identified are provided\
    \ by national private \ncompanies, including startups. The other one (Produce\
    \ Pay) is a US-based startup with a \npresence in Canada, the United States, Mexico,\
    \ Colombia, Peru, and Chile.  \nSupply chain management \nApproximately half of\
    \ the services in this category originated from international sources. \nTwo of\
    \ them are associated with companies based in the United States, while the third\
    \ pertains \nto an initiative developed through international cooperation from\
    \ the United Kingdom. As for \nthe national services, they are headquartered in\
    \ various Colombian cities, including Bogotá, \n \n[72] \n \nJardin (Antioquia),\
    \ and Popayán (Cauca). In this instance, it is not explicitly stated that these\
    \ \nservices are targeted towards small-scale producers, but rather towards producers\
    \ in general. \n \n3.6 Discussion and Conclusions \n \nThis qualitative study\
    \ explored the configuration of digital agricultural products and \nservices available\
    \ in Colombia in 2022 and early 2023. The results showed that Colombia has an\
    \ \nemergent and varied range of digital products and services for different processes\
    \ required by \nproducers, such as on-farm activities, market connections, financial\
    \ services, supply chain \nmanagement, and digital technical assistance. However,\
    \ the distribution across these categories \nis uneven, with a higher prevalence\
    \ of products and services focused on on-farm activities (65% \nof the total),\
    \ followed by marketplaces and e-commerce platforms (17%), financial services\
    \ (9%), \nsupply chain management initiatives (6%), and, to a lesser extent, technical\
    \ assistance (3%). \nDifferent private and public actors are the providers of\
    \ these services, including startups and \nmedium and large companies. The use\
    \ of types of service allows a nuanced view of this \nconfiguration, evidencing\
    \ the different stages of advance and emphasis within them.   \nAlthough there\
    \ is a wide range of products within the category of digitized farm tools, \n\
    including precision agriculture tools, there is a noticeable dispersion in offerings\
    \ and a \nparticular emphasis on those producers who are already engaged in production\
    \ intensification \nactivities or have sufficient production volumes to invest\
    \ in these tools. Given the expected \noutcomes of using these technologies (table\
    \ 2), it can be suggested that if these benefits are \nrealized, such as increased\
    \ efficiency, reduced labor costs, and improved resource management, \nthey will\
    \ be concentrated among these types of producers, potentially widening the gap\
    \ with \nsmaller producers or those with less access to resources. This is coherent\
    \ with concerns being \npointed by Rotz et al., (2019) and Duncan et al., (2021)\
    \ who warn that these technologies can \ndeepen the gaps between farmers. \n \n\
    [73] \n \nAn important issue for future research concerning this type of service\
    \ is the lack of clarity \non the policies surrounding the use of localized information\
    \ by these technologies. The \ninformation provided on the websites of these organizations\
    \ does not clearly demonstrate a \nstance on how they manage individual farmer\
    \ data. This issue should be considered in future \nresearch since, as Schroeder\
    \ et al., (2021) mention, “laws addressing the ownership of data from \ndigital\
    \ agriculture are frequently either missing or inadequate.”  (p.5). In the case\
    \ of Colombia, \ndata ownership in the rural sector is still a highly uncertain\
    \ matter that needs to be further \naddressed to support and serve small farmers.\
    \ \nMarketplaces and e-commerce platforms coexist in the market linkages category,\
    \ each \npresenting different power dynamics. On the one hand, marketplaces promote\
    \ direct \ncommunication between buyers and sellers, yet this mainly benefits\
    \ farmers with better access \nto resources and a closer connection to digital\
    \ activities. The e-commerce model allows \norganizations to aggregate supply\
    \ and sell it, preventing producers from managing customer \ncontacts directly;\
    \ the e-commerce approach seems to better serve producers who are more \ndistant\
    \ from the market or have fewer resources since the company assumes inventory\
    \ and \npayment activities. However, it also highlights the need for better accountability\
    \ from platforms \noffering these services to ensure transparency in their marketing\
    \ processes. \nIn the financial services category, there was an interest in facilitating\
    \ access to financial \nservices for small producers. With a few exceptions, most\
    \ platforms are oriented towards \nserving small producers, who have less access\
    \ to credit and financing. Like the previous \ncategory, there are issues regarding\
    \ data management that require further exploration, \nparticularly on how each\
    \ of these companies manages the data collected from their users and \nhow this\
    \ data is or is not used to make other decisions regarding access to resources\
    \ or \nsubsidies. The experience of the National Federation of Coffee Growers\
    \ shows how a trade \norganization can develop a digital service to benefit its\
    \ members by facilitating both the \n \n[74] \n \npayment for coffee sales and\
    \ access to public resources. This case is possible due to the \nleadership and\
    \ significant role the Federation plays in the country. It is necessary to explore\
    \ \nunder what conditions other trade associations could also develop a financial\
    \ service like this in \npartnership. Based on the information available on the\
    \ websites of these organizations, it is \ndifficult to determine the geographic\
    \ coverage of these services. As the sector is primarily driven \nby startups,\
    \ it is challenging to establish the continuity of these services over time, which\
    \ \nresemble financial innovations aimed at accessing specific communities. Future\
    \ research should \nanalyze the success or failure of these startups and their\
    \ business models in achieving national \nreach with their operations. \nAlthough\
    \ the mapping of products offering digital advisory indicates just a few services,\
    \ \nthe review of initiatives promoting digital agriculture shows a significant\
    \ emphasis on digital \nextension, driven mainly by the public sector with the\
    \ national digital extension system and the \nopen information platforms being\
    \ generated by IDEAM and AGROSAVIA. The existence of the \nLinkata network reflects\
    \ that is a critical matter that counts with engaged actors but lacking a \nstrategy\
    \ combining this large number of actors in the Linkata network with the endeavors\
    \ \nlooking that digital technical assistance reaches a national scale in a coordinated\
    \ fashion. \nFinally, in supply chain management, the identified platforms are\
    \ still in a very early \nstage, and the question remains open as to what types\
    \ of actors will be able to access these \nservices, which are highly focused\
    \ on providing traceability and transparency throughout the \nchain. It is also\
    \ important to note that several of these platforms were oriented towards coffee\
    \ \nand cocoa, two very important crops for the country. On the one hand, coffee\
    \ is a historically \nsignificant crop for the country, in which Colombia is an\
    \ international reference. On the other \nhand, cocoa is considered the \"crop\
    \ of peace\" and has gained great relevance in the country \nfollowing the signing\
    \ of the peace agreement, as many post-conflict initiatives have been \ndedicated\
    \ to financing small producers for the establishment of cocoa crops. \n \n[75]\
    \ \n \nRegarding the inequality patterns proposed by Hackford, several comments\
    \ can be \nmade. First, the first pattern of inequality focused on inequalities\
    \ in control over technological \ndevelopment, particularly in the predominant\
    \ role of large agricultural and technology \ncorporations, does not seem to be\
    \ fulfilled in the Colombian context, given that the actors \ndriving the digital\
    \ agriculture ecosystem are varied, and there is high participation of startups\
    \ \nwith a wide network of allies to develop their operations. Second, regarding\
    \ the unequal \ndistribution of benefits pattern, it is mainly evident in the\
    \ category of digital tools for the farm, \nwhere innovations are primarily aimed\
    \ at benefiting larger producers or producers better \nconnected to the market.\
    \ Third, regarding the pattern of Uneven Sovereignty over Data and \nHardware,\
    \ it is an uncertain issue. The country is in a very early stage concerning the\
    \ \nmanagement of data generated by producers, and a deeper analysis of current\
    \ licensing \nagreements for the use of technologies, mainly focused on digital\
    \ extension or supply chain \nmanagement, is required. \nForth, in the pattern\
    \ of inequality in knowledge and skills, there is a clear lack of skills to \n\
    navigate the available information. For example, Doctor Agro, developed by Agrosavia,\
    \ is aimed \nat agricultural extension workers with a higher technical preparation\
    \ to navigate the \ninformation available on the platform. Finally, in the last\
    \ pattern on Unequal Problem \nDefinition and Problem-Solving Capacities, there\
    \ is a prioritization of solutions focused on \nincreasing efficiency and productivity.\
    \ In the products and services reviewed, no reference was \nfound to alternative\
    \ approaches such as agroecology or regenerative agriculture. Only in the 5-\n\
    year initiative driven by CIAT is there a concern for climate-smart practices.\
    \ \nThis study faced a relevant limitation. Many of these companies’ websites\
    \ lack specific \ndescriptions of their services, making it difficult to determine\
    \ if they are active. It is also \nchallenging to determine if the information\
    \ is up to date; tracking their social media does not \nalways yield recent updates\
    \ to understand if they are still in operation. While this presented a \n \n[76]\
    \ \n \nlimitation for this research, it also highlights how this sector operates;\
    \ startups create a \n\"minimum viable product\" which, in the case of advisory\
    \ & extension and market linkages \ncategories, may be simply a website describing\
    \ the service offerings. To overcome this challenge, \nfuture research must combine\
    \ other search techniques and information triangulation methods, \nwhich may be\
    \ more time-consuming and costly. \nThis study shows that Colombia has unique\
    \ characteristics in its digital agriculture \necosystem and, therefore, should\
    \ develop a research agenda that addresses them. It shows that, \nas indicated\
    \ by some scholars (Klerkx et al., 2019; McCampbell et al., 2022), it is urgent\
    \ to \ndeeply explore the particularities of each configuration of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies across \ndeveloping countries.  This understanding is essential\
    \ to build relevant research agendas that \nrespond to the country-level needs\
    \ —as has been done in other countries (e.g Bellon-Maurel et \nal., 2022 in France)—\
    \  but also to the issues that are more pressing in each country, for example\
    \ \nthe importance of digital financial services in reaching small-scale producers.\
    \ These nuanced \nand critical views can empower stakeholders within each country\
    \ to lead the type of \ndigitalization that is most needed in the agricultural\
    \ sector.   \n \n \n \n[77] \n \nChapter Four: The Promotors Of Digital Agricultural\
    \ \nTechnologies: What They Say About Its Promises, Perils, And \nImplications\
    \ For Small Farmers? \n \nIntroduction \nDigital agriculture is the application\
    \ of different types of digital technologies in the \nagriculture field and across\
    \ food systems. Known as Agriculture 4.0, e-agriculture, smart \nfarming and Agtech,\
    \ it conforms a broad sector promising to support global food systems, \nmaking\
    \ them efficient, profitable, and sustainable (Schroeder et al., 2021). The implementation\
    \ \nof this wide repertoire of hardware, software, and platforms (e.g sensors,\
    \ drones, robots, \nblockchain, cryptocurrencies, internet of things, artificial\
    \ intelligence, and the subsequent \namount of data generated) is intended to\
    \ change how farmers manage people, processes, \nanimals and land; how producers,\
    \ middlemen, traders and consumers relate among them; and \nhow decisions on production\
    \ and commercialization are made (Klerkx et al., 2019; Trendov et \nal., 2019).\
    \  \nOur understanding of how this emergent sector is evolving is still fragmented\
    \ and biased \nto what is happening in developed regions such as the United States,\
    \ New Zealand, Australia, \nand Europe (McCampbell et al., 2022; Hackfort, 2021).\
    \ Understanding how digital agriculture \ndevelops in developing countries and\
    \ what the perspectives of key stakeholders are essential to \ndiscern what is\
    \ common and specific in the development of these technologies worldwide. In \n\
    sum, these diverse views will reveal the different types and trajectories of digital\
    \ agriculture. \nThis qualitative study explores Colombian promoters' perspectives\
    \ on the dynamic of \ndigital agricultural technologies, their opportunities,\
    \ complexities, and unforeseen impacts, \nparticularly for small farmers. The\
    \ questions guiding this exploratory study are i) How do they \nenvision digital\
    \ agricultural technologies' role in Colombia? ii) How do they understand the\
    \ \ncomplexities and uncertainties of these technologies' deployment in the country?\
    \ iii) How are \n \n[78] \n \nthey considering the unforeseen impacts of these\
    \ technologies? Answers to these questions offer \ninsights to inform a conversation\
    \ on how digital agricultural technologies are being designed, \ndeveloped, and\
    \ deployed and the potential trajectories of these technologies in the country.\
    \ This \nstudy aims to contribute to the scholarship on the social implications\
    \ of digital agriculture; \nexploring the views of promoters and entrepreneurs\
    \ in Colombia, a population that has not been \nstudied, offers a window to comprehend\
    \ what is the situation in the country. \nI am using a qualitative inquiry for\
    \ two reasons. First, this approach directly explores \nnarratives by digital\
    \ agriculture promoters working in Colombia by identifying their \nperceptions,\
    \ assumptions, motivations, and explicit objectives. Considering the lack of \n\
    information available, semi-structured interviews enable the collection of details\
    \ on the \nrationale behind these endeavors and elicit a response concerning the\
    \ implications of their \ntechnologies. Second, this is a unique population within\
    \ the spectrum of actors promoting and \ndeveloping these technologies.  \nThis\
    \ paper continues to present the background and methods. Then I present the \n\
    findings and discuss how aspects highlighted by the interviewees relate to the\
    \ literature on \nnarratives on digital agriculture and their expected outcomes.\
    \ \n \n4.2 Background \nNarratives on digital agricultural technologies   \nThe\
    \ mainstream narrative surrounding digital technologies in agriculture is \npredominantly\
    \ optimistic and technical, emphasizing the potential to address the global \n\
    challenge of feeding the world as the population is projected to increase by 2\
    \ billion by 2050 \n(Lajoie-O’Malley et al., 2020). Digitalization is often portrayed\
    \ as a solution to address global \n \n[79] \n \nfood shortages, enhancing yields\
    \ and incomes and reducing detrimental inputs (Mohr & Höhler, \n2023; Ancín et\
    \ al.,2022).  \nHowever, this view on digital technologies is not the only one.\
    \ In an analysis of social \nmedia and public websites, Glaros et al., (2023)\
    \ identified three framings underpinning digital \nagri-food system transformations,\
    \ namely Productivity through Precision (PtP), Enhancing \nFarmers’ Rights through\
    \ Technological Sovereignty (TS), and Traceability through Tech-Enabled \nDisruption\
    \ (TTD). These three framings illustrate the different approaches that different\
    \ actors \ncan have over the same matter. \nIn the PtP, digital technologies are\
    \ crucial in improving predictability and control at the \nfarm level, ultimately\
    \ contributing to higher global yields and sustainable profits for farmers. By\
    \ \nleveraging digital data, farmers can refine their decision-making process,\
    \ which can either \ncomplement or replace their intuition for determining optimal\
    \ practices. This viewpoint \nunderlines the need for individual farmers to embrace\
    \ digital technologies to maximize yields and \nprofits. \nThe TS framing highlights\
    \ the potential challenges digital technologies pose to farmer \nautonomy while\
    \ emphasizing the need for these tools to address diverse farmer needs and support\
    \ \nagroecological practices. It focuses on the importance of governance structures,\
    \ open and \nparticipatory processes in technology development, and sharing, to\
    \ ensure equitable benefits \ndistribution. By placing farmers and farming communities\
    \ at the center of digital agri-food system \ntransformation, this framing foster\
    \ farmer autonomy, community organization, and legislative \nchange, considering\
    \ the needs of both individual farmers and farmer collectives. \nFinally, the\
    \ TTD framing aims to enhance supply chain transparency, improve market \nefficiencies,\
    \ and meet evolving consumer demands. Industry news outlets and think tanks \n\
    highlight the system-wide benefits of adopting digital technologies for transforming\
    \ local and \nglobal supply chains. Technologies like blockchain and e-commerce\

    \ \n \n[ 81 ] \ns\n \n \n[82] \n \n \nColombian digital agriculture  \nColombia\
    \ has an emergent ensemble of actors, public and private initiatives, and digital\
    \ \nproducts and services promoting digital agriculture. An exploratory review\
    \ found 93 products and \nservices currently available (see chapter three). The\
    \ current offer in Colombia is skewed toward \ndigitized farm tools (65%), including\
    \ sensors, drones, satellite imagery, and farm management \nplatforms. Other services\
    \ offering digital products are market linkages —e-commerce and \nmarketplaces—\
    \ (17%), financial services (9%) providing access to financing, supply chain \n\
    management (6%), and digital advisory and extension (3%).   \nInitiatives promoting\
    \ digital agriculture are diverse. They include the pilot of a public \nprogram\
    \ to deliver digital extension service across the country using WhatsApp, information\
    \ \nservices on weather forecasts, satellite images, and early warning alerts,\
    \ the inclusion of \ntechnologies as enablers for the rural sector in the National\
    \ Development Plan proposed for \n2022-2026, a 5-year and US$99,9 million project\
    \ including digital technologies to reduce the \nvulnerability of agricultural\
    \ production to climate threats, networks of extensionist workers, \nentrepreneurs\
    \ and a regional agrifood tech innovation hub recently launched.  \nDespite the\
    \ variety of initiatives and the numerous actors working in this sector, the \n\
    country still lacks a common vision regarding the future direction of digital\
    \ agriculture, the \nchallenges it poses for the nation and aspects that must\
    \ be considered to ensure that digital \nagriculture benefits the various groups\
    \ of producers present in Colombia. A common vision \nwould trace a common goal\
    \ —equity along agrifood systems, environmental sustainability, food \nsecurity,\
    \ and climate change adaptation— and encourage collaboration among different \n\
    stakeholders, enabling a better allocation of resources supporting research, innovation\
    \ and \ndissemination of technologies. This exploratory study provides empirical\
    \ evidence to advance in \nthat direction. \n \n \n \n \n[83] \n \n \n4.3 Methods\
    \ \nThis exploratory study examines the narratives of Colombian entrepreneurs\
    \ and \npromoters on opportunities, complexities, and unforeseen impacts that\
    \ digital agricultural \ntechnologies pose for small farmers. Specifically, it\
    \ analyzes i) views on the role technology can \nplay, ii) perceptions on complexities\
    \ and uncertainties of technology deployment, iii) \nunderstandings of unforeseen\
    \ impacts that technologies can have on small farmers.   \nI used a qualitative\
    \ inquiry approach and conducted semi-structured interviews \n(Creswell & Poth,\
    \ 2018) to explore perceptions, assumptions, motivations, explicit \nunderstandings,\
    \ and objectives of digital agriculture promoters in Colombia. In this research,\
    \ an \nentrepreneur is defined as someone who leads on a full-time basis, a commercial\
    \ initiative —\nstartup, organization, or project—developing and deploying a specific\
    \ digital agricultural \ntechnology through the rationale of a business model.\
    \ A promoter is a person or an organization \ncontributing to the expansion of\
    \ digital technologies by supporting or funding entrepreneurs, \noffering advocacy,\
    \ developing knowledge, or unfolding initiatives to increase the use of these\
    \ \ntechnologies in the agricultural sector. Due to the scope of this study, I\
    \ only interviewed \nentrepreneurs and promoters with operations in Colombia.\
    \  \nWithin the scholarship addressing digital agricultural technologies from\
    \ a social \nstandpoint, there is an interest in hearing the voices of actors\
    \ participating in this field. In the \nNorth American context, Bronson (2019)\
    \ conducted 22 unstructured interviews with designers \nof smart farming technologies\
    \ to identify the values at the core of their practice; Carolan (2017) \nand Duncan\
    \ (2018) conducted in-depth interviews (18 and 33, respectively) with North \n\
    American farmers and retailers to understand farmers’ perspectives on socio-technical\
    \ changes \nderived from these technologies. In Europe, Van der Burg et al., (2022)\
    \ conducted 33 semi-\nstructured interviews with experts on A.I. robots for agri-food\
    \ on their views on the values, \nethical questions, and conflicts perceived.\
    \ There is an evident absence of views from Latin \n \n \n[84] \n \n \nAmerican\
    \ entrepreneurs and promoters. This study contributes to this field by echoing\
    \ these \nvoices and perceptions. \n \nData collection  \nI used two strategies\
    \ to identify people working in this sector. First, a desktop search \nlooking\
    \ into reports, news, and related events in Latin America; this process helped\
    \ me \nunderstand the scope, size, and characteristics of this sector and to identify\
    \ relevant actors. \nSecond, I used a snowball strategy, starting with professional\
    \ contacts working on projects \nfocused on the development of rural areas. As\
    \ an outcome of both approaches, I created a list of \nthirty potential interviewees\
    \ that were sampled purposefully looking for promoters and \nentrepreneurs actively\
    \ working in the sector. Specifically, I aimed to interview entrepreneurs \nwith\
    \ technologies in pilot phases or already in the market. For promoters, I selected\
    \ those \nworking actively to expand this sector. I sent direct emails to thirty\
    \ and have a response from \ntwenty-one.  \nConsidering their leadership and board-level\
    \ positions within their organizations, these \nactors can be considered elite\
    \ interviews (Harvey, 2011). Elite interviewing is “the use of \ninterviews to\
    \ study those at the ‘top’ of any stratification system” (Jupp, 2006). Schedule\
    \ these \ninterviews was challenging, because these actors have busy schedules,\
    \ and they don’t prioritize \ntalking to unknown or previously unfamiliar researchers.\
    \ I had to be persistent and use my \nnetworks to access to this person. Also,\
    \ I had to find the most appropriate way to get to their \ninbox and transmit\
    \ the objectives and relevance of this research. Finally, I spoke with co-\nfounders,\
    \ managers, and directors, all of whom identified themselves as experts in their\
    \ \nrespective fields. In some cases, certain interviewees extensively discussed\
    \ their backgrounds \nand career paths, which had an impact on the duration of\
    \ the interview. The interviews typically \n \n \n[85] \n \n \nlasted between\
    \ 45 and 60 minutes, but when such descriptions arose, the length extended to\
    \ 90 \nto 120 minutes. \nI conducted twenty-three semi-structured interviews with\
    \ entrepreneurs and promoters \nof digital agricultural technologies based in\
    \ Colombia between March 2021 and March 2023. \nTable 8 presents a summary of\
    \ the interviewees. The interviews were in Spanish —the \nresearcher’s and interviewees’\
    \ mother tongue. Two in-person interviews were conducted, and \nthe rest were\
    \ through virtual channels.   \nThe interview protocol fostered a conversation\
    \ around five open-ended topics: i) \nactivities developed in the sector; ii)\
    \ characteristics of technology being unfolded or promoted, \niii) opinion on\
    \ the relevance of digital technologies for agriculture in Latin America, iv)\
    \ vision of \ndigital technologies’ future, vision of unintended consequences,\
    \ and v) perceptions on ideas \nposed by responsible innovation frameworks. I\
    \ included a question on the responsible \ninnovation framework and its four dimensions\
    \ —anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and \nresponsiveness— since this has been\
    \ suggested by some scholars as a way to foresee potential \nimpacts and shape\
    \ the trajectories of digital agricultural technologies (Rose and Chilvers, 2018;\
    \ \nEastwood et al., 2019; Bronson, 2019). This ample approach has roots in different\
    \ research \ntraditions, including innovation studies, science, technology and\
    \ society studies, ethics and \ngovernance and regulation studies (Koops, 2015).\
    \ Responsible innovation can be defined as ‘a \nnew approach towards innovation,\
    \ in which social and ethical aspects are explicitly taken into \naccount (…)\
    \ and economic, socio-cultural and environmental aspects are balanced’ (Blok &\
    \ \nLemmens, 2015: 20).  \nData analysis \nI transcribed verbatim the recordings\
    \ of the interviews and coded them inductively and \ndeductively. First, I read\
    \ each interview and start an open coding, allowing themes and \ncategories to\
    \ emerge from the data itself. Later, I did deductive coding, using as a lens\
    \ my sub \n \n \n[86] \n \n \nquestions —views on the role technology can play,\
    \ perceptions of complexities and uncertainties \nof technology deployment, and\
    \ understandings of unforeseen impacts that technologies can \nhave on small farmers.\
    \  I analyzed each transcript and created descriptive labels for each topic. I\
    \ \norganized all the themes under the structure of my sub questions.    \n \n\
    Positionality  \n \nThe impetus behind this study stems from my positionality\
    \ as an engaged researcher, \nwhich has shaped the design, analysis, and interpretation\
    \ of the findings. My academic \nbackground encompasses a synthesis of business\
    \ management and social sciences, while my \nprofessional trajectory encompasses\
    \ entrepreneurial endeavours and consulting engagements \nwith large companies\
    \ and private social organizations. This amalgamation of theoretical training\
    \ \nand practical experience has fostered a pragmatist perspective (Creswell and\
    \ Poth, 2016) that \nprioritizes the practical implications of my research. It\
    \ also has provided me with access to a \nnetwork of people in leadership positions\
    \ working in agriculture and in market access for \nfarmers. This network was\
    \ crucial and opened the possibility to develop elite interviews. \n \n \n \n\

    \ \n \n[88] \n \n \n4.4 Findings \nThis qualitative research shed light on Colombian\
    \ promoters' perceptions of \ndigital agricultural technologies' opportunities,\
    \ complexities, and unforeseen impacts on \nsmall farmers.  \n \n4.4.1 Views on\
    \ the role technology can play. \nSimple and sophisticated technologies are included\
    \ in digital agriculture. \nThe interviewees shared a view that within digital\
    \ agriculture there are many \ntechnologies varying in complexity. It includes\
    \ less advanced or sophisticated \ntechnologies, such as Whatsapp and messages\
    \ delivered through cellphones, sensors, \ndrones, and tools to analyze soil health,\
    \ weather, humidity, cloud computation, \naugmented reality, artificial intelligence,\
    \ blockchain, and exponential technologies, \namong others. Two promoters from\
    \ an International Research Center offered a structure \nto analyze these technologies;\
    \ for them, a salient aspect of these technologies is that are \nuseful for collecting,\
    \ analyzing and disseminate information. In this sense, all tools \nsupporting\
    \ these aspects, regarding their degree of complexity can be included.  In the\
    \ \ncollecting phase, there are active and passive ways for data collection. Active\
    \ ways \ninclude the direct collection of farm information through tools such\
    \ as apps, google \nforms or ODK forms. Passive ways include data collected by\
    \ remote and non-remote \nsensors, capturing different types of farm information.\
    \ In the phase of analysis, there are \nalso a variety and degrees of sophistication,\
    \ ranging from descriptive statistics to data \nanalytics, big data, machine learning\
    \ and artificial intelligence. Finally, in the phase of \ndissemination, they\
    \ include all means useful for dissemination, including radio, email, \nweb platforms,\
    \ applications and text messages. \n \n \n[89] \n \n \nAs summarized by one of\
    \ these promoters from an International Research \nCenter: \nOriginal – “Uno puede\
    \ decir que todas las herramientas con sus distintas \nvariedades de complejidad,\
    \ que puedan colectar, analizar y diseminar, \nentrarían dentro de esto, desde\
    \ lo menos sofisticado hasta lo más \nsofisticado” .  P12 \nAuthor translation\
    \ – “One could say that all tools, with their different \nvarieties of complexity,\
    \ that can collect, analyze, and disseminate data, \nwould fall under this category,\
    \ ranging from the least sophisticated to the \nmost sophisticated.” \n  \nAlthough\
    \ some actors focused mainly on on-farm technologies, others stressed \nthat digital\
    \ technologies could serve many purposes along value chains, beyond the farm.\
    \  \n \nThe main benefits revolve around efficiency and productivity.   \nFive\
    \ main themes were common to the interviewees when considering the \nbenefits\
    \ provided using digital technologies —efficiency, productivity, access to \n\
    information to support decision-making, monitoring and traceability, and access\
    \ to \nmarkets. Many explained a causal chain linking these benefits with an increase\
    \ in \nincome. For example, the Manager of the funding operations of the agricultural\
    \ portfolio \nfor a European Cooperation Program in Colombia, illustrated in this\
    \ way: \nOriginal – “Con estos datos que se están dando un productor puede lograr\
    \ \nmejorar su rendimiento, abrir mercado y de esta manera mejorar lo que \nllega\
    \ a su casa en términos de ingreso” P3 \nAuthor translation – “With this data\
    \ that is being provided, a producer \ncan improve their yield, open up new markets,\
    \ and in this way, improve \nwhat comes to their home in terms of income.” \n\
    \ \n \n \n[90] \n \n \nIn the case of traceability, it is presented by many as\
    \ something requested and \nappreciated by the buyers and final clients, and as\
    \ an enabler to enter new markets. \nExamples include coffee growers being able\
    \ to share the stories behind the product, \nwhere and when was harvested, and\
    \ by whom, which are appreciated by international \nand specialized customers.\
    \  Others stressed that traceability also is useful for farmers to \novercome\
    \ information asymmetry. An entrepreneur selling blockchain-based technology \n\
    to ensure traceability in the coffee sector (E2) indicated that he created this\
    \ digital \nservice because he realized that “farmers are not connected as an\
    \ equal stakeholder (…) \nthey are not receiving the same information that big\
    \ coffee is using”. He argues “with our \nplatform, they're connected as equal\
    \ stakeholders”. For another entrepreneur, the \nfounder of a marketplace, access\
    \ to information is the first crucial step because it enables \nfarmers to establish\
    \ a direct interaction with actors with whom they would traditionally \nonly have\
    \ a mediated relationship through intermediaries.  \nOriginal – “Lo primero es\
    \ que (el productor) encuentre información, que \nparece muy básico, pero no tienen\
    \ información. Entonces, al encontrar \ninformación, encontrar los proveedores,\
    \ poderse contactar directamente \ncon ellos, hacer las solicitudes de cotización\
    \ directamente con los \nproveedores, pues yo creo que es el primer paso que le\
    \ genera valor” E7 \nAuthor translation –“The first thing is (for the producer)\
    \ to find \ninformation, which seems very basic, but they don't have information.\
    \ \nSo, by finding information, finding suppliers, being able to contact them\
    \ \ndirectly, and making requests for quotations directly with the suppliers,\
    \ \nI think that is the first step that generates value for them”. \n \nNone of\
    \ the interviewees offered data or empirical evidence to illustrate how \nthese\
    \ benefits operate in particular settings, crops, regions, or type of farmers.\
    \  \n  \n \n \n \n[91] \n \n \n4.4.2 Perceptions of the current situation of Digital\
    \ Agriculture in \nColombia \nThe sector is emerging and lacking coordination\
    \ \nThere is a common understanding that the digital agriculture sector in Colombia\
    \ \nis emergent. Despite the various initiatives and pilot projects developed\
    \ by public \nentities, private companies, international cooperation organizations,\
    \ and research \ncenters, participants indicate that there is a lack of concerted\
    \ action or communication \namong the companies and different actors promoting\
    \ the sector. Another participant \nmore acutely indicated that “there is no such\
    \ thing as a digital agriculture ecosystem in \nColombia.” \nIn addition to the\
    \ lack of coordination among the actors in the digital agriculture \nsystem, a\
    \ lack of communication between public actors focusing on information \ntechnologies\
    \ and those specializing in rural development was mentioned, as they seem to \n\
    have different conversations but with a great opportunity for convergence. \n\
    A senior researcher from a national research center focused on agriculture noted\
    \ \nthat significant steps are being taken from the research side, as technology\
    \ development \nand experiments are being carried out that allow the scientific\
    \ offering of digital \nagriculture to be materialized for different sectors.\
    \ Other promoters highlighted the work \nthat has been done by the public sector\
    \ to provide open information that is available for \nothers to develop digital\
    \ products and services, including databases on climate and \nworkspaces for articulation\
    \ among actors such as the agroclimatic tables; these tables \nbring together\
    \ farmers, researchers, extensionists, representatives of government \nentities,\
    \ non-governmental organizations, and other relevant actors in the agricultural\
    \ \nsector, allowing them to exchange information and knowledge about climate\
    \ and its \ninfluence on agricultural production. \n \n \n[92] \n \n \n \nA need\
    \ for improving technical skills and knowledge about rurality. \nThere are diverse\
    \ perspectives on the lack of technical skills or knowledge about \nrural areas.\
    \ On the one hand, some promoters highlighted the lack of analytical skills \n\
    among agricultural engineers and technicians, who are not being trained in universities\
    \ \nto perform data analytics using, for example, flexible programming languages\
    \ like R, \nPython, or PHP. With this deficiency, their role in supporting the\
    \ interpretation of data \nfor decision-making becomes very limited. On the other\
    \ hand, there is a lack of \nintegration between technological and agricultural\
    \ knowledge. An entrepreneur stated \nthat although there are experts in data\
    \ science and experts in agriculture, there are no \nindividuals who have knowledge\
    \ of both topics leading to inadequate analysis of \nagricultural information.\
    \ As stated by one entrepreneur, \nOriginal – “Yo diría que hay un problemita\
    \ ahí escondidito, y es que \nmucha gente llegó a agricultura digital, pero nunca\
    \ estuvo con lo \nanterior. Entonces, no solo en el manejo, sino en la interpretación\
    \ de las \ncosas. Hay mucho mal manejo de la información, terriblemente malo.”\
    \ \nE8 \nAuthor translation – “I would say that there is a little problem hidden\
    \ \nthere, and it is that many people came to digital agriculture, but they were\
    \ \nnever involved in the previous practices. So, not only in the management \n\
    but also in the interpretation of things. There is a lot of mishandling of \n\
    information, terribly bad.” \n \nIn the same vein, a promoter pointed out that\
    \ one of the characteristics of the \nsector is that many of the technological\
    \ solutions are being designed by technology \ndevelopment companies in a top-down\
    \ approach without considering the farmers who \nwill ultimately be the users,\
    \ their needs, and their conditions of use and access to the \ntechnology. \n\
    \ \n \n[93] \n \n \n \n Large associations are crucial but their role is contested\
    \     \nNearly half of the interviewees highlighted the importance of guilds and\
    \ how \nsectors such as coffee, rice, cereal, legumes, sugar cane, and oil palm\
    \ are in a better \nposition for the development and implementation of digital\
    \ agriculture technologies. On \nthe one hand, it was noted that these guilds\
    \ have a higher level of organization, which \nallows them to develop efforts\
    \ more cohesively with research centers, cooperation \nentities, and the public\
    \ sector. On the other hand, these guilds have large-scale \nproducers who, having\
    \ large extensions, have the need and vision to use these \ntechnologies to optimize\
    \ their activities in the field. \nHowever, other interviewees do not share such\
    \ a positive vision of guilds as \nfarmers' associations and federations. Two\
    \ entrepreneurs noted that farmers \norganizations like associations and federations\
    \ are managed politically. In the case of \nassociations, one entrepreneur stated\
    \ that they are managed by a small number of \npeople, sometimes from the same\
    \ family, as an exercise of power over resources. In the \ncase of federations,\
    \ another entrepreneur indicated that they have become marketers of \nproducts\
    \ and inputs but are not bringing technological advances to their members or \n\
    promoting technological development. Instead, they become an obstacle to the \n\
    articulation between technological entrepreneurs, technology providers, and farmers.\
    \ \n \n4.4.3 Perceptions of complexities and uncertainties of technology \ndeployment\
    \ in rural Colombia \nUpon investigating the particularities of the Colombian\
    \ context that contribute to \nthe complexity of the digital agriculture sector,\
    \ the interviewees highlighted factors \n \n \n[94] \n \n \nrelated to both the\
    \ institutional support structure for the agricultural industry and the \ninfrastructure\
    \ characteristics, as well as the intrinsic features of the producers \nthemselves.\
    \ \nA weak technical assistance system \nEntrepreneurs and promoters concurred\
    \ that the country possesses a rather frail \ntechnical assistance system. It\
    \ is noted that the existing agricultural technicians are \ninsufficient to meet\
    \ the farmers' needs, due to the limited number of technicians \navailable, the\
    \ geographic dispersion of the country's producers, and the characteristics of\
    \ \nthe access routes to the farms. Others indicate that a problematic issue with\
    \ technical \nassistance is its close association with “casas comerciales” —commercial\
    \ establishments \nselling agricultural inputs. This relationship creates a situation\
    \ in which the advice \nprovided by technical assistance is not entirely autonomous\
    \ but is instead influenced by \nthe sales requirements of these commercial establishments.\
    \ \n \nLack of digital infrastructure \nAll interviewees mentioned the barriers\
    \ to accessing technology that exists in the \ncountry. On one hand, there are\
    \ challenges in accessing the internet in various parts of \nthe country, which\
    \ limits the implementation of many of these technologies. On the \nother hand,\
    \ this situation compels technology promoters to adjust their products and \n\
    services so that they function offline or in accordance with connectivity limitations.\
    \ \nFurthermore, there is a discussion about the deficiencies in the ownership\
    \ of \ntechnological devices, such as smartphones. Many of the producers in Colombia\
    \ only \npossess low-end mobile phones (commonly referred to as “Teléfonos flecha”\
    \ —feature \nphones), which have limited memory and constrain the possibility\
    \ of interacting with \n \n \n[95] \n \n \nmore sophisticated applications that\
    \ are entirely online or require substantial storage \nspace on the phones. \n\
    \ \nLack of education and risk aversion in small farmers  \nThe majority of entrepreneurs\
    \ pointed out that the educational backgrounds of \nsmall-scale producers limit\
    \ their access to and engagement with technology. First, their \nlow level of\
    \ schooling was mentioned; most possess the ability to read and write at a very\
    \ \nbasic level, if at all. Second, the lack of technical education was highlighted,\
    \ as evidenced \nby their unfamiliarity with soil fertility conditions and the\
    \ behavior of pests or diseases, \nwhich impacts their productivity. Third, four\
    \ of the interviewees indicated that the \nproducers have a high aversion to change,\
    \ and therefore resist trying new technologies. \nAccording to one entrepreneur,\
    \ these characteristics explain why agribusinesses manage \nto utilize digital\
    \ technologies while small-scale producers do not.   \nOriginal – “Todo lo que\
    \ no sea agroindustria es un sector muy atrasado \npor múltiples factores. Uno,\
    \ por temas de escolaridad, el hecho de que \nno sepas escribir y leer, pues no\
    \ te permite hacer uso de esta tecnología. \nDos, porque no hay educación de Buenas\
    \ Prácticas Agrícolas (BPAs), si \ntú tampoco sabes BPAS nada haces con estas\
    \ plataformas. Estas \nplataformas están diseñadas para que tú, montes BPAs, por\
    \ lo tanto, sigas \nese plan de acción si tú no tienes una educación técnica de\
    \ cultivo \ntampoco haces nada. Tres, si no tienes una educación de costos \n\
    financiera no haces nada; y cuarto, el manejo de tecnologías hoy en día \ntodo\
    \ el mundo cree que la tecnología es un WhatsApp y la tecnología no \nes solo\
    \ un WhatsApp.” E8 \nAuthor translation – “Everything that is not agribusiness\
    \ is a very \nbackward sector due to multiple factors. One, is education issues;\
    \ the fact \nthat you don't know how to read and write, does not allow you to\
    \ make \nuse of this technology. Two, there is no education on Good Agricultural\
    \ \nPractices (GAPs); and if you don't know GAPs, you won't be able to do \nanything\
    \ with these platforms. These platforms are designed for you to \nimplement GAPs,\
    \ therefore, you must follow a plan of action, and if you \ndon't have technical\
    \ education on cultivation, you won't be able to do \nanything. Three, if you\
    \ don't have financial education on costs, you won't \n \n \n[96] \n \n \nbe able\
    \ to do anything; and fourth, the management of technologies \nnowadays, everyone\
    \ believes that technology is WhatsApp, and \ntechnology is not just WhatsApp.”\
    \ \n \nA combination of problems: low productivity, high costs, generational gaps,\
    \ \nmiddlemen \nAll interviewees pointed out various interrelated factors that\
    \ describe the \nstructural problems affecting small-scale farmers, who, on average,\
    \ own one or two \nhectares of land. These issues include low productivity, lack\
    \ of technical knowledge, high \ninput costs, youth migration from rural to urban\
    \ areas, the absence of an agricultural \npolicy with an agri-food system focus,\
    \ and intermediaries who dictate the terms of \nexchange. All these factors interact\
    \ and amplify each other, leading to significant \ndisparities between various\
    \ producer groups and considerable complexities and \nchallenges when developing\
    \ digital products and services. For many of the interviewees, \nthis combination\
    \ of problems represents the primary obstacle to the development of \ndigital\
    \ agriculture in the country.  As described by the Founder of a small innovation\
    \ lab \nfocused on rural sector,  \nOriginal – “No hay un proceso de productividad\
    \ alta, porque se crean \nsofismas idea de lo que es bueno en la tierra, claro,\
    \ hay unos \nconocimientos técnicos, campesinos, indígenas tradicionales, muy\
    \ \npositivos, pero también la naturaleza del país, la violencia, desarraigo,\
    \ \nlos bajos precios, el alto costo de los insumos, la alta intermediación, los\
    \ \naltos circuitos, los malos precios de compra hacen que el producto se \nencarezca\
    \ que no sea competitivo.” E3 \nAuthor translation –“There is no process of high\
    \ productivity, as \nmisconceptions arise concerning what is beneficial for the\
    \ land. Of \ncourse, there are positive traditional technical, peasant, and indigenous\
    \ \nknowledge systems, but the country's nature, violence, uprooting, low \nprices,\
    \ high input costs, significant intermediation, extensive circuits, \nand poor\
    \ purchase prices all contribute to an increase in product costs, \nrendering\
    \ them non-competitive.”  \n   \n \n \n[97] \n \n \n \n4.4.3     Understandings\
    \ of unforeseen impacts that technologies can \nhave \nThe perspectives on the\
    \ unanticipated consequences of technology in Colombia \nwere diverse among the\
    \ interviewees. Three distinct outlooks were identified: technology \nas neutral,\
    \ no discernible impacts yet, and the consideration of multifarious \nimplications.\
    \ \nTechnology is neutral \nA promoter from the public sector highlighted that\
    \ negative implications arose \nfrom the manner in which technology was utilized,\
    \ as the technology itself was neutral. \nIn their words,  \nOriginal – “Yo diría\
    \ que las tecnologías todas per se son buenas, es el \nuso que se le dé a esas\
    \ tecnologías las que pueden causar problemas.” E3 \nAuthor translation — “I would\
    \ argue that all technologies, per se, are \ninherently beneficial; it is the\
    \ application of these technologies that can \npotentially lead to problems.”\
    \ \n \nIn a related context, albeit from a distinct perspective, a promoter asserted\
    \ that \ntechnology embodies a black box, possessing the potential for both beneficial\
    \ and \ndetrimental applications. \nNo impacts yet  \nFour promoters and one entrepreneur\
    \ conveyed that they did not discern any \nunfavorable impacts arising from the\
    \ utilization of technology. The promoters noted that \nthey might potentially\
    \ recognize such implications during the implementation of their \npilot projects\
    \ or as these initiatives underwent scaling up. \n \n \n[98] \n \n \n \nMultifarious\
    \ implications    \nThe remaining promoters and entrepreneurs acknowledged one\
    \ or more facets \nthat could give rise to undesirable consequences. Among these\
    \ are the monopoly on \naccess to information, issues related to data ownership\
    \ and privacy, the loss of \nknowledge on the part of producers, and asymmetry\
    \ in the capacity for action among \ndifferent groups of producers. \nMonopoly\
    \ on data or access: Numerous promoters mentioned that the \nprimary concern is\
    \ the possibility that certain actors could exercise a monopoly on \ninformation\
    \ or access to technology. This concentration of information or supply would \n\
    result in small producers being unable to reap the benefits, as the prevailing\
    \ intention \nwould be to \"conduct business at the expense of the producers.\"\
    \ \nData privacy and ownership: Promoters from the private sector and \ninternational\
    \ cooperation emphasized the importance of data and the current lack of \nawareness\
    \ regarding its relevance and potential applications. One promoter pointed out\
    \ \nthat the rural population does not comprehend the value that information can\
    \ hold, \nwhich is why they still share data on production costs and productivity,\
    \ without \nunderstanding how other actors might exploit this information. The\
    \ same promoter \nindicated that certain sectors, such as the flower industry,\
    \ recognized the importance of \ndata and were thus more cautious when sharing\
    \ it. Another issue pertains to data \nownership: interviewees note that there\
    \ is no clear consensus on how this ownership \nshould be established or through\
    \ which mechanisms it should be protected. \nData bias: One researcher identified\
    \ bias in data representativeness as one of \nthe main issues concerning data.\
    \ This promoter illustrated that feeding a model with a \nlimited dataset results\
    \ in a representation bias, causing the recommendations to be \n \n \n[99] \n\
    \ \n \nunbalanced and skewed by the content of the training dataset used by the\
    \ application. In \nthis case, reflexivity on the part of developers is required\
    \ to ensure that this bias is \novercome. \nLoss of knowledge: Four promoters\
    \ indicated that they perceived a risk of the \nloss of ancestral and traditional\
    \ knowledge that might not be compatible with technified \npractices. In this\
    \ regard, the concern is that technology could promote alternative forms \nof\
    \ knowledge that displace ancestral knowledge or render certain manual labor \n\
    unnecessary, thereby resulting in the loss of manual labor techniques. \nAsymmetry\
    \ in the capacity for action among different groups of \nproducers: Interviewees\
    \ highlighted various aspects that fell within this category. One \nentrepreneur,\
    \ the co-founder of an NGO that offers digital technology skills, pointed out\
    \ \nthat a significant risk is that new players entering the market that provide\
    \ technological \nproducts and services to small producers become new intermediaries\
    \ and capture more \nvalue than they actually offer to small producers. This entrepreneur\
    \ noted that she \nobserved some individuals charging for the use of technologies\
    \ that are free, such as \nGoogle Maps. This situation is reinforced by small\
    \ producers' lack of knowledge about \ntechnologies and their uses. A promoter\
    \ leading rural development in a large NGO \nexpressed concern that technological\
    \ solutions may widen the gaps between those who \nhave access to information\
    \ and those who do not, consequently increasing market \nasymmetries and exacerbating\
    \ exclusion within the supply chains.  \n \n \n \n \n \n[100] \n \n \n4.4.4 How\
    \ to ensure digital technologies benefit Colombian small \nfarmers  \nWhen the\
    \ respondents were queried regarding the elements that ought to be \naddressed\
    \ to enhance the digital agriculture ecosystem in Colombia in such a way that\
    \ it \ncould benefit small-scale producers, they indicated the following. \n \n\
    Promoting collective action \nThe associativity among stakeholders was the first\
    \ aspect mentioned by more \nthan half of the respondents. This associativity\
    \ encompasses both producers, insofar as \nimproving their associativity increases\
    \ their collective bargaining power, and the \npromoters themselves, including\
    \ trade associations, international cooperation agencies, \nand research centers,\
    \ which are currently undertaking efforts independently and have \nnot yet converged\
    \ on a common work agenda. \nFacilitative Public Policy \nThe participants concur\
    \ with the importance of a public policy that promotes and \nsupports the sector;\
    \ however, they are not in favor of developing regulations that would \nconstrain\
    \ its growth. Instead, they mentioned the significance of fostering a public policy\
    \ \nthat bridges the gap between supply and demand and provides producers with\
    \ the \nnecessary infrastructure to utilize digital agriculture technologies.\
    \ \nPromoting Technical Assistance \nFour promoters underscored the significance\
    \ of enhancing the extension team \nthat supports the producers. One of them discussed\
    \ the importance of returning to the \nwritings of the extension itself, which\
    \ combined professionals from various disciplines to \n \n \n[101] \n \n \nachieve\
    \ comprehensive support, mindful of the social, environmental, and productive\
    \ \ndimensions that surround the lives of producers. \nBoosting business models\
    \ reaching small farmers \nThe promotion of business models that primarily aim\
    \ to include small-scale \nproducers is related to collective action among stakeholders\
    \ who promote and develop \ntechnologies. Currently, technological offerings are\
    \ mainly geared towards large \nproducers who have the capacity to afford the\
    \ prevailing prices of digital services and \nproducts. Some respondents highlighted\
    \ the need to develop innovative business models \nthat cater to the requirements\
    \ and payment capabilities of small-scale producers. One \nentrepreneur emphasized\
    \ that small producers should be approached through \ninstitutional means, that\
    \ is, with the support of local governments and regional \nadministrations, to\
    \ create conditions that enable access for small-scale producers. \nOffering services\
    \ according to the actual needs of small farmers \nAnother aspect highlighted\
    \ concerns regarding the use of the digital technology \ncurrently available in\
    \ the country. In this regard, it is not necessary to adopt cutting-edge \ntechnologies\
    \ but to seek the optimal combination of low-cost technologies and offline \n\
    services that are presently accessible and can benefit the largest number of producers.\
    \ \n \n4.5 Discussion and conclusions  \nThis study aimed to explore the perspectives\
    \ of promoters and entrepreneurs in \ndigital agriculture in Colombia regarding\
    \ their views on the current situation, \ncomplexities, and unforeseen aspects\
    \ that affect the development of the sector. The \nfindings of twenty-three interviews\
    \ with various stakeholders reveal that the respondents \nhold a broad vision\
    \ of digital agriculture, considering a wide range of technologies, from \n \n\
    \ \n[102] \n \n \nsimple ones such as WhatsApp to sophisticated ones such as machine\
    \ learning, artificial \nintelligence, and blockchain. There is also a consensus\
    \ among respondents regarding the \nprimary benefits derived from these technologies,\
    \ including efficiency, productivity, \naccess to information as support for decision-making,\
    \ traceability monitoring, and \naccess to markets. The respondents indicated\
    \ that the digital agriculture sector in \nColombia is emerging and still lacks\
    \ coordination among its actors. This is in line with \nthe studies about digitalization\
    \ in agriculture in Latin America, that show that Colombia \nmarket is growing\
    \ but still is far from the regional leaders is not the regional leaders —\nBrazil\
    \ and Argentina.  \nParticipants reflected on the contextual conditions that drive\
    \ digital technology \nadvancement in the country, including lack of technical\
    \ skills, the contradictory role of \nlarge producer associations, the lack of\
    \ digital infrastructure, and various problems \naffecting the rural sector, such\
    \ as low productivity, high input costs, generational gaps, \nand the role of\
    \ intermediaries. These factors, which mainly affect small producers, \nsuggest\
    \ that, in this emergent sector, small producers may not receive the best benefits\
    \ \nexpected from these technologies. \nExamining these results considering conceptual\
    \ discussions on digital \nagriculture, it was found that the promoters' vision\
    \ in Colombia is closely related to the \npredominant and most optimistic narrative\
    \ of the positive results in efficiency and \nproductivity that can be achieved\
    \ by producers using these technologies. Reviewing the \nframing suggested by\
    \ Glaros et al. (2023), it is found that the visions of Colombian \npromoters\
    \ align mainly with the first framework called Productivity through Precision\
    \ \n(PtP) and to a lesser extent with Traceability through Tech-Enabled Disruption\
    \ (TTD), \nfocused on transparency in the chains to increase market efficiency.\
    \ There was no \nevident link with the framing focused on Enhancing Farmers’ Rights\
    \ through \n \n \n[103] \n \n \nTechnological Sovereignty (TS).  This is relevant\
    \ because TS framing cares about \ngovernance structures, open and participatory\
    \ processes in technology development, \naspects lacking in Colombia, and crucial\
    \ to promote equitable digitalization. \nRegarding the implications of the technology\
    \ that should be considered, this \nstudy finds three different perspectives regarding\
    \ its impacts. At one extreme, some view \ntechnology as being morally and politically\
    \ neutral. The next group has not yet identified \nthe impacts, which indicates\
    \ a lack of anticipation and reflexivity, two of the principles of \nresponsible\
    \ innovation. In the third group, a varied range of factors should be considered\
    \ \nwhen implementing technology. These factors include data monopolies, data\
    \ access \nmonopolies, data privacy, data ownership, data biases, potential loss\
    \ of knowledge, and \nasymmetry in the capacity for action among different groups\
    \ of producers. It is \ninteresting to note that these factors are all associated\
    \ with power, as they present \nunequal relationships based on attributes, status,\
    \ or position in the social structure. \nConcern for data or access monopolies\
    \ indicates the existence of income inequality and \nactors with the capacity\
    \ to hoard resources. Concern about the loss of farmers' \nknowledge is associated\
    \ with the possibility of imposing research agendas and \ntechnological developments\
    \ that privilege forms of production more typical of larger \nproducers or technified\
    \ agriculture. These three perspectives demonstrate that digital \nagriculture\
    \ promoters do not correspond to a monolithic group; on the contrary, there \n\
    are diverse nuances and perceptions regarding the role of technology and the factors\
    \ that \nmust be considered for its promotion. It is crucial to acknowledge these\
    \ diverse \nperspectives to facilitate discussions and collaborative efforts towards\
    \ promoting digital \nagriculture in the country. Understanding the perception\
    \ of what technology is and can \ndo is vital for achieving a certain level of\
    \ accountability in this regard. \n \n \n[104] \n \n \nThe findings of this study\
    \ show that while there is common and widespread \noptimism about digital technologies\
    \ in agriculture, which is shared at an international \nlevel, nuances can be\
    \ observed when reviewing the perceptions of promoters within the \nsame country\
    \ that respond to the specificities of each territory. For example, in the \n\
    interviewees’ comments, the role of agricultural input vendors is highlighted\
    \ as a key \nactor because they are very close to the producer, but at the same\
    \ time with an \naccompanying agenda that may be influenced by their sales objectives.\
    \ In particular, this \naspect responds to the characteristics of Colombian agriculture,\
    \ the high intermediation \nrates, and the difficulties that producers face in\
    \ accessing information. In this sense, \npromoting responsible and inclusive\
    \ digitalization in Colombia requires a deeper \nunderstanding of the unique challenges\
    \ surrounding the agricultural sector, the views \nand interests of their actors,\
    \ and the potential and limitations of the current rural public \npolicy.  \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n[105] \n \n \nChapter Five: Concluding Remarks \n  \nThrough this\
    \ qualitative study, I explored the literature on the social and ethical \nimplications\
    \ of digital agriculture technologies, as well as the empirical situation of what\
    \ \nwas happening in Colombia. I chose to conduct my research on this topic because\
    \ I \nbelieve it holds significant conceptual potential in terms of uncovering\
    \ what these new \ndigital technologies are capable of and understanding the implications\
    \ and unintended \nconsequences they may have for both agri-food systems and the\
    \ livelihoods of small-\nscale farmers worldwide. I also believe it is an urgent\
    \ matter from a practical standpoint, \nas it is mobilizing a wide array of actors,\
    \ both familiar and unfamiliar with the agri-food \nsector, and is driving various\
    \ types of public and private actions that will affect the \nlivelihoods of people\
    \ who dedicate their lives to food production and ecosystem \nprotection.  \n\
    The literature review presented in chapter two allowed me to develop a \nframework\
    \ that acknowledges the non-neutrality of technology, the central role of power,\
    \ \nand its manifestation in both the factors that shape access and those involved\
    \ in the \ngovernance of technologies. This applied framework recognizes the importance\
    \ of \nunderstanding the different types of services offered by digital technologies\
    \ and the \nvarious moments associated with their design, access, and governance.\
    \ This \ncategorization acknowledges the diverse social relationships in which\
    \ producers are \nembedded and offers practical utility for analysis and intervention\
    \ by scholars, \npractitioners, and other stakeholders interested in promoting\
    \ digital agriculture that \nbenefits all actors, including the smallest and least\
    \ resourced. \nApplying this framework to the reality of Colombia (chapters three\
    \ and four), I \nfound a variety of actors, initiatives, and ways of doing things\
    \ unfolding in this Latin \n \n \n[106] \n \n \nAmerican country, which warrants\
    \ the construction of a research agenda focused on the \ncountry's characteristics,\
    \ its equity challenges, and the emergence of the digital \nagriculture ecosystem.\
    \ Through conversations with promoters and entrepreneurs of \ndigital agriculture,\
    \ I identified three current ways of approaching the implications of \ntechnology:\
    \ technology is neutral, no implications have yet been identified, and there are\
    \ \nmany implications, ranging from the risk of monopoly, privacy and data ownership,\
    \ \nalgorithmic bias, and asymmetry in the capacity for action among different\
    \ actors. This \nfinding suggests a need in the literature to understand how different\
    \ actors construct \nthese visions of social implications and how conversations\
    \ on accountability, monitoring, \nand assessment can be fostered among digital\
    \ agriculture promoters with different \nvisions of its implications and possibilities.\
    \ \nThis research analyzed secondary information from digital agriculture promoters\
    \ \nand entrepreneurs, as well as data from 23 elite-interviews.  One aspect brought\
    \ to light \nby this research, conducted through the lens of political economy,\
    \ is the indispensable \nconsideration of the relationship between structural\
    \ dynamics that engender inequity \nand constraints in accessing resources, and\
    \ the actual capabilities of technologies. Thus, \nit becomes imperative to challenge\
    \ the apolitical narrative that posits technology \nintegration as inevitably\
    \ yielding heightened efficiency, productivity, and profit for all. \nThis narrative\
    \ merely perpetuates existing structures and reinforces the simplistic notion\
    \ \nthat technology alone generates changes divorced from material and institutional\
    \ \ncontexts. Such a view of digitization hampers our ability to perceive that\
    \ access, in and of \nitself, is insufficient. It is important, but insufficient.\
    \ Transforming information access \ninto tangible efficiency or productivity requires\
    \ paying attention to other factors, such as \nmarket access, property rights,\
    \ land size, production types, extant capital, as well as \nindividual capability\
    \ and motivation. These days, teeming with misinformation and \nexcessive wide\
    \ access to superficial information, the critical need to discern information\
    \ \n \n \n[107] \n \n \nsources and cultivate the capacity to discriminate amidst\
    \ the deluge of daily information \nbombardment has become abundantly clear. \n\
    We must challenge and reshape this narrative to engender a dialogue about the\
    \ \nstructural and agency-level conditions requisite for advancing toward a form\
    \ of \ndigitization that spurs transformation and reaps benefits for historically\
    \ marginalized \ncommunities. This endeavor will enable us to expand our imaginative\
    \ horizons and \nfoster alternative institutions, incentives, and business models.\
    \ \nAnother salient finding arising from this study pertains to the importance\
    \ of \nemploying a lens of specificity when assessing the offerings of digital\
    \ agricultural \ntechnologies. Not all digital technologies serve identical purposes\
    \ for all individuals, nor \ndo they possess equal potential for reshaping the\
    \ status quo within diverse communities. \nIn certain circumstances, when material\
    \ and relational conditions are favorable, mere \naccess to new information can\
    \ engender positive transformations. In contrast, the ability \nto effectively\
    \ act upon novel information necessitates additional material changes, such \n\
    as access to credit or access to a better-linked network. This plethora of tangible\
    \ \npossibilities underscores the need for comprehensive case studies that enhance\
    \ our \nunderstanding of the potentialities and limitations of technology across\
    \ varying \ncontextual landscapes. \nBased on this exploratory research, I identify\
    \ two elements that are still missing \nfrom our understanding of digital agriculture\
    \ and merit in-depth exploration. First, a  \nperspective exploring links with\
    \ the environment. Currently, the conversation on digital \nagriculture technologies\
    \ is developing separately from the conversation on digital \ntechnologies addressing\
    \ environmental issues (e.g., deforestation control, fauna and \nflora inventories).\
    \ One possible avenue for further investigation is to understand the \ncollaborative\
    \ spaces and tensions that arise from these technologies, both those more \n \n\
    \ \n[108] \n \n \noriented towards productivity and those focused on reducing\
    \ environmental impact or \nconducting inventories of environmental features.\
    \ Secondly, there is a need for research \nthat critically and practically addresses\
    \ the specific challenges posed by particular digital \nproducts and services.\
    \ The problem-solving sociology perspective can serve as a source \nof inspiration\
    \ to advance in this direction. \nIn a context where investments in digital agriculture\
    \ are continuously growing, \nalong with interest in its potential outcomes, this\
    \ research demonstrates that it is urgent \nto have a better understanding of\
    \ the particularities of Latin American and African \ncountries. It is important\
    \ to know the actual and concrete offerings of various digital \nagriculture services\
    \ in these countries, as the current literature is insufficient for \nanalyzing\
    \ the implications these technologies will have in these nations. The concerns\
    \ \nthat exist in developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia\
    \ are not \nthe same as those pressing in these countries. Considering the real\
    \ implications for \npeople's lives that the promotion of digital agriculture\
    \ services and products may have, it \nis necessary for applied research to serve\
    \ better decision-making and understanding of \nthe institutional arrangements,\
    \ power relations, and resources at stake in each location. \nAs an applied researcher,\
    \ I harbor the belief that a remarkable opportunity lies \nbefore us to reshape\
    \ the trajectory of digitization within the realm of agriculture. The \npresent\
    \ investigation was undertaken with the purpose of offering organized and lucid\
    \ \nconcepts, as well as evidence, capable of nourishing the ongoing conversation\
    \ amongst \nthose dedicated to leveraging digitization as a deliberate means of\
    \ enhancing the \nlivelihoods of rural producers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[109] \n\

    \ \n \nVITA \nJenny Marcela Melo Velasco was born in Bogotá, Colombia (1982) and\
    \ grew up in \nCali, where she finished high school education with an emphasis\
    \ in gerontology. She \ngraduated from the Universidad del Valle in 2005. In this\
    \ public university, she obtained \na degree in Business Management. Since the\
    \ beginning of college, Jenny has been \ninterested in understanding how to promote\
    \ inclusion and fairness using the business \nsphere of influence. This interest\
    \ guided her professional path as an applied researcher \nand practitioner. \n\
    Between 2009 and 2011, with the support of a scholarship from the Organization\
    \ \nof American States, Jenny studied a Master’s in social sciences at the Universidad\
    \ \nNacional de La Plata (Argentina). After returning to Colombia, she worked\
    \ as an \nindependent researcher and consultant in different places in Latin America,\
    \ \nconceptualizing and executing knowledge management processes, combining academic\
    \ \nand practitioner perspectives for all-size companies, developmental organizations,\
    \ \nNGOs, and small farmers’ organizations. In 2018, with the support of a Fulbright-\n\
    Pasaporte a la Ciencia scholarship, Jenny started a PhD in Rural Sociology at\
    \ the \nUniversity of Missouri. She is now specializing in rural settings, particularly\
    \ in \nunderstanding and practically promoting inclusion and fairness for small\
    \ farmers \nthrough market exchanges and the implementation of technology. \n\
    Starting in 2021, Jenny co-founded Huella Delta, a social enterprise supporting\
    \ \nrural organizations to establish fair and inclusive links with the market\
    \ while advancing \nconservation goals. Huella Delta has worked in Colombia, Peru,\
    \ and Mexico. She is \nproudly the first generation to obtain a doctoral degree\
    \ in her whole family, achieving \nthis milestone in 2023. \n"

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction
    IoT has enabled the connection of an increasing number of devices to the Internet.
    Additionally, modern IoT technologies make it possible to sense and control almost
    anything online. IoT is a useful innovation, but it can also pose a serious cybersecurity
    risk to vital infrastructure. Given that there may be many security flaws in the
    entry points, there is a significant potential risk to cyber security in this
    case. A hole in the company''s quality chain could leave the whole thing vulnerable
    to security breaches and open the door for potential attackers. To defend the
    countries'' vital infrastructures, these significant cyber-security risks must
    be specifically avoided. As IoT programs are utilised more regularly, security
    problems grow [1]. When Advanced technologies are used in vital facilities, serious
    cyber-security problems invariably arise. Cyberattacks on crucial infrastructure
    would result in catastrophe. Destructive scenarios include turning off a hospital''s
    electricity, changing the temperature of a nuclear power plant''s cooling towers,
    and using smart automobiles'' inmotion functions. Critical national infrastructures
    are increasingly being targeted by hackers who want to commit cybertheft, cyberespionage,
    harassment, disruption, and cyberterrorism. Even a cyber-attack mostly on facilities
    of another country might be used to justify going to war. Consequently, an important
    subject for securing a nation is cyber-security. A nation''s or organization''s
    physical systems may be destroyed, their control may be transferred to a third
    party, they may become dysfunctional, or the privacy of individuals'' data may
    be compromised through cyberattacks. This article examines cyber-attacks on critical
    infrastructures, focusing in particular on research completed between 2008 and
    2019. Cyberattacks on various critical infrastructures were categorised, and the
    harm done to the systems by these attacks was exposed [2]. The losses that these
    systems will cause, which are crucial for nations, are also priceless monetarily.
    Therefore, methods to lessen or stop these attacks are covered. This essay''s
    remaining sections are organised as follows. This section also looks at a timeline
    of recent attacks. In this context, steps that can be undertaken to lessen or
    stop cyberattacks on crucial infrastructures are looked at. SECTION II. Literature
    Review There are many benefits and uses for AI, including safety. Given the present
    fast expansion of cybercrime and the proliferation of devices, machine-learning
    and artificial intelligence can assist stay by automating detection capabilities
    and responding more quickly than traditional software or human-driven systems,
    up with hackers. The advantages and applications of using AI in defence are discussed
    above. Artificial intelligence may help in the monitoring of cyber risks and potentially
    risky behaviour. This is an area where AI can really help, as traditional software
    systems struggle to keep up with the massive quantity of new diseases that are
    created every week [3]. AI systems are made to recognise viruses, do multivariate
    regression, and even the simplest objects, types of malware and ransomware attacks
    to prevent them from infect the system. This is done by applying complex algorithms.
    Improved predictive intelligence is provided by computer language, It collects
    expertise for itself by researching about cybercrime in books, journals, and studies.
    This can include details on recently found anomalies, malicious programs, and
    defences. Hackers are trend-followers, thus what they consider to be popular regularly
    shifts. AI-based cybersecurity products have the ability to give the most updated
    stats about regional and global dangers, improving the formulation of crucial
    priorities based not only on the likelihood that systems will be hacked but also
    on the most common methods of doing so. The majority of internet traffic nowadays
    is made up of bots, which could be dangerous. Bots could be a serious problem,
    from exploiting private accounts to creating false accounts and stealing data
    [4]. Automated threats cannot be defeated by manual responses alone. AI and machine
    learning enable the ability to distinguish between beneficial and dangerous users
    and bots, as well as to fully understand web traffic. The processing of enormous
    amounts of data is made easier by AI, which also helps cybersecurity teams change
    their strategies in reaction to shifting threat environments. Businesses can utilise
    behavioural patterns to distinguish between a harmful atypical trip and an ordinary
    user trip. By using this information, we can ascertain the reason why they visited
    the page, giving us the upper hand over hazardous bots and defeating them. AI
    can help secure all of the remote-working technology that is quickly increasing.
    Although they primarily rely on signatures, VPN services and antivirus programs
    can assist guard against online malware and virus attacks [5]. It''s possible
    that the antivirus application wasn''t maintained or the software developers were
    unaware if virus categorization are behind schedule. As a result, signature defence
    may be able to stop an attack even if a new type of malware is found. Endpoint
    security powered by AI adopts a novel approach by building a foundation of conclusion
    of the course through an ongoing learning cycle. AI is able to recognise anomalies
    and take the appropriate action, such as alerting a technician or moving to a
    safe location in the event of a virus assault. Instead of waiting for signature
    updates, this provides proactive threat avoidance [6]. Fraudsters attempt to access
    internal systems, leaving a digital trace known as invasion signatures. Security
    experts collect huge data of digital footprints to help identify loopholes and
    specific attack methods for future usage. If a large enough database of fingerprint
    and assault behaviours is made available, an artificial intelligence system can
    be trained to recognise breaches in real time. For instance, getting into electronic
    equipment like laptops, recorders, and other devices that have an internet connection
    is one of the finest ways to exploit. The default login credentials are used by
    scammers to log into various systems. Cybercriminals can gain access to the rest
    of the internet by taking full control of these workstations. By scanning the
    entire connection for these flaws, AI encryption can stop the majority of prevalent
    types of assaults. In reality, artificial intelligence (AI) is just a tool, and
    individuals still need to direct it and discipline it when it makes mistakes [7].
    MasterCard has introduced a fraud protection system that uses artificial intelligence
    and computers based on anticipated user behaviour. To assess if a transaction
    is odd, it looks at the buyer''s typical buying habits, the seller, the event''s
    location, and a number of other intricate algorithms. Several teams successfully
    demonstrated the creation of solutions, the design of weaknesses, and the dissemination
    of attacks. Hackers can also exploit learning-based systems in a number of ways.
    Researchers gave an illustration of how messing with self-driving cars'' perception
    of traffic signs could fool them. software. They were able to train the automobiles
    to recognise street signs by employing simple techniques like graffiti and artwork.
    Cybercriminals must first assault classification methods that the AI has been
    trained to identify and exploit in order to beat artificial intelligence cybersecurity
    [8]. SECTION III. Research Methodology In this current age of digitalization,
    cybersecurity threats can be considered the greatest concern, and the need for
    authentication systems has become apparent. The purpose of the research is to
    examine cybersecurity threats and authentication systems. Previously many researchers
    have already published various research about the concerned topic. Although both
    primary and secondary data were essential for this particular research, the researchers
    have focused specifically on secondary data only. Secondary data refers to collected
    data sets obtained by any other person. With the help of secondary data, the researchers
    were able to analyse a large amount of high-quality data to answer the research
    questions more efficiently. The key reasons for considering secondary data include
    its economic use of time and resources, its uniqueness, and providing a detailed
    picture, helping build useful relationships, it tends to be high-quality, and
    secondary data is useful for data enrichment. SECTION IV. Analysis And Discussion
    Attackers have improved their cyberattack capabilities, yet the majority of the
    critical infrastructure systems in use today still rely on antiquated technologies
    that are open to low-tech cyberattacks. It is a frightening situation that vital
    infrastructures are becoming more interconnected through IoT technology and that
    there are more orchestrated cyberattacks occurring globally. There have been cyberattacks
    on SCADA control systems used by many vital infrastructures in recent years. The
    most notable ones include Stuxnet, Havex, BlackEnergy, & Industroyer. It is obvious
    that the ransomware, which targets vital infrastructures including water treatment
    facilities, gas processing facilities, hydroelectric dams, and transportation
    networks, is expertly made and specialised [9]. Many IoT-based devices are incorporated
    into the vital communication infrastructures. By 2025, there will be 75 billion
    ways to connect, which might make things worse. However, it''s possible that attacks
    on crucial facilities may increase in the future. In the figure below, the main
    sectors of vital infrastructure are depicted. These crucial infrastructures could
    be vulnerable to cyberattacks because they were built using IoT-based solutions.
    The most popular technologies for enhancing critical infrastructures are those
    that are IoT-based. A device can be connected to the Internet if it has an IP
    address. Thanks to the present Internet infrastructure, it is conceivable to declare
    that every device that is linked to the web falls within the IoT idea. IoT devices
    could therefore be vulnerable to almost any hacks that could happen in IP-based
    environments. IoT applications are hampered by the Internet''s security flaws.
    As a result, there are some cyber-security flaws in this new technology. The most
    significant IoT-based cyberattacks in the industry and the risks they pose to
    vital infrastructures are discussed in this section [10]. Fig. 1. Smart Grid Electricity
    Transmission Process Show All Fig. 2. Major Critical Infrastructure Sectors Show
    All Fig. 3. Cyber Security Issues Show All Tramway Hacking: A youngster used a
    homemade transmitter to reroute trains to hack the Lodz city tram system. This
    was the first cyber-kinetic assault to cause some injuries. Hacking at a power
    company: An employee who was fired from his job shut down the company''s power
    forecasting systems by breaking into the network. The attacker accomplished this
    by using his login credentials, which were left unblocked by system administrators.
    Stuxnet: This cyberattack is suspected to have been conducted out by the governments
    of the United States and Israel. By disrupting centrifuges that enrich uranium
    at the nuclear facility, Stuxnet sought to end Iran''s nuclear programme. Stuxnet
    attacked SCADA systems by focusing on PLCs, which allow electromechanical processes
    to be automated. Water Delivery System Hacking: The sanitary sewer department''s
    water distribution system was compromised. The attackers then displayed a few
    screenshots of system diagrams for wastewater and water treatment facilities.
    Additionally, a multiple passwords was used to secure the system, which demonstrated
    how simple it is to launch a remote assault by intercepting the password [11].
    Cyber-attack on a dam: The attackers gained unauthorised access to the Bowman
    Avenue Dam''s SCADA system, where they were able to collect information on activities
    such as water levels, temperatures, and device status. It demonstrated how simple
    it is for attackers to alter the water flow settings, the quantity of chemicals
    used to treat the water, and release the shutters during a downpour. The incident
    is also a perfect example of the enormous damage that such a cyberattack against
    vital IoT systems might bring about. Energy Distribution Hacking: Through the
    SCADA system, terrorists were able to take over control of Ukraine''s power grid.
    Due to this, there was a blackout that caused roughly 700,000 people to experience
    some time without power. With this cyberattack based on the Internet of Things,
    attackers are allegedly testing the most sophisticated sabotage software [12].
    Dynamic DDoS Attack: The Mirai botnet was employed in the DDoS attack. The Mirai
    botnet hunts for IoT devices with weak security and default logins and passwords
    by scanning the internet. Additionally, it is in charge of massive DDoS assaults
    against Dyn servers, an ISP. Due to the fact that many users did not alter their
    devices'' default login credentials, this assault was largely successful. Many
    websites, including Reddit, Twitter, Netflix, and Spotify, might not be accessible
    for a day. Ransomware Attack on San Francisco''s Light Rail System: A ransomware
    attack was launched against San Francisco''s light rail system. No firewalls were
    overcome during the attack, although a worker did welcome the criminals into the
    facility by downloading a phishing email. Hacking a water company: The attackers
    gained access to the SCADA system of the water utility and used it to modify the
    quantity of chemicals utilised. They therefore got involved in the production
    and treatment of water [13]. Smart Building Attack: The main IoT applications
    involve smart homes and buildings. IoT devices are used to create the apps, which
    are constantly connected to the Internet. Two buildings'' heating and hot water
    services were switched off by the DDoS attack in the winter. The structure control
    system was inundated by fake Internet traffic as a result of the DoS assault.
    As a result, this prevented administrators from remotely controlling the device
    and caused the system to reset every few minutes [14]. Cyberattack on the power
    grid: In the UK, an electricity distribution network was attacked on the day of
    the general election. The SCADA system was targeted in the cyberattack in order
    to bring down the electrical grid. Senior personnel were the target of the attack,
    which was carried out via some phoney emails. The emails used social engineering
    strategies to get recipients to click on a phoney link that would launch malware.
    This attack used spear phishing, a more sophisticated kind of phishing. Fig. 4.
    User-oriented Attack Show All Fig. 5. Cyber Attacks Show All Fig. 6. Cyber Attack
    Process Show All Petrochemical Facility Cyberattack: An unsuccessful cyberattack
    was launched against a petrochemical facility. The facility''s operations were
    to be undermined, and an explosion with the potential to kill people was to be
    caused. Fortunately, a flaw in the attackers'' source code prevented the explosion
    from happening. In other sense, the attackers'' source code error was the only
    explanation it didn''t happen. Furthermore, the original data was not discovered
    in a previous cyberattack. The Cellular hacking tools were all created from scratch.
    Transportation Network Cyberattack: The cyberattack affected the transportation
    network, causing disruptions to travel services and delays on trains. Reservations
    couldn''t be made, and customers couldn''t get updates on the delays. Healthcare
    Business Cyberattack: A highly skilled attack was launched on a healthcare organisation.
    First, the attackers stole login credentials from a supplier of IT equipment to
    the hospital. Second, they used SamSam ransomware and remote execution methods
    to attack a server. The vital data files for the hospital were then encrypted
    [15]. Financial and Telecommunications Sectors Cyberattack: A planned attack was
    launched against well-known organisations that offer financial and communication
    infrastructure. The attack''s goal was to deny essential infrastructures services.
    For a while, the assaulted institutions were unable to function. Through IoT-based
    applications, critical infrastructures offer more effective performance and communication
    [16]. However, this might create security gaps and increase the frequency of cyberattacks
    on vital infrastructure. The most significant IoT-based cyberattacks are highlighted
    in this study. It''s critical to assess the impact and outcomes of the aforementioned
    situations in order to comprehend the seriousness of the situation. The entirety
    of these incidents highlight the weaknesses in key infrastructure systems in this
    environment [17]. These flaws frequently result from unsecure configurations in
    IoT-based control systems. This article lists the aforementioned cyberattacks
    in accordance with the year, place, target, definition, and damage. Reference
    could be checked for additional cyber-attacks on vital infrastructure [18]. SECTION
    V. Conclusion According to the study''s findings, artificial intelligence is rapidly
    becoming into a vital tool for increasing the effectiveness of security professionals.
    Machine intelligence provides the critical analyses and cyber threat that security
    teams may use to lower the likelihood of a breach and improve their company''s
    security posture as humans are no longer able to properly secure an enterprise-level
    attack surface. Machine learning will become more influential in our lives as
    more material is integrated into our regular activities. Artificial intelligence,
    according to some experts, would stifle innovation while greatly enhancing our
    quality of life, according to others. The capacity of cloud computing to assess
    and control hazards more quickly is one of its major benefits for cybersecurity.
    Many individuals are quite concerned about hackers'' ability to launch highly
    sophisticated technology and cyberattacks. The early detection of cyberattacks,
    hazard assessment and categorization, and crisis response planning may all benefit
    from the use of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence will therefore
    advance cybersecurity and help firms create a stronger security posture, notwithstanding
    any potential risks. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

  description: Internet of things (IoT) is a promising technology that provides efficient
    and reliable techniques for automatically maintaining and monitoring an object
    with minimal human involvement. IoT is used in almost every field, like smart
    homes, automobiles, etc. One of the implementations of IoT can be seen in the
    farming sector. As we know, agriculture plays an essential role from both an economic
    point of view and feeding and providing basic needs for a considerable population.
    To achieve both aspects, the proper maintenance of agriculture is essential, which
    can be achieved by using IoT. In traditional agricultural methods, the productivity
    and quality of crops are not up to the mark, but with the help of IoT, we can
    increase both productivity and quality of crops, as IoT helps in better crop management,
    resource management, and crop monitoring. The real-time implementation of smart
    farming can be categorized into two parts. One part is the hardware section which
    includes all different sensors (soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, etc.)
    and irrigation tools. Another part is the software section, which includes cloud
    computing and network technologies (architecture, layers, and network topologies).
    Since IoT includes software and wireless communications, it can be exposed to
    specific cyber security threats such as data leakage, authorizations, authentication,
    and vulnerabilities in the smart farming ecosystem. IoT-based agriculture faces
    more challenges than security issues such as hardware malfunction, networking,
    and technical issues. Hence, IoT usage in farming is very efficient and effective.

    Figures Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) as refers
    to a network of devices that have the ability to connect, collect and exchange
    data with other devices over the Internet. IoT is a revolutionary technology that
    have tremendous applications in numerous fields of engineering and sciences such
    as logistics, healthcare, traffic, oil and gas industries and agriculture. In
    agriculture field, the farmer still used conventional agriculture methods resulting

    Internet of Things; authentication; security; agriculture 1. Introduction With
    the recent advancements in communication and physical sciences, it is now possible
    to connect physical objects to the Internet from any place any time for anything
    without human intervention by making everything smart. This advancement is referred
    to as the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. One of this century’s key technological
    development has been the IoT, which is still in its fancy stages. In the coming
    years, this development is expected to hit a big figure. By the end of 2024, 62
    billion IoT devices are expected to exist [2]. According to Statista report, it
    is predicted that this number will rise to 75.4 billion by 2025. The significance
    of the IoT system has been acknowledged by major international standards bodies,
    thereby ensuring development towards the proper functionality, flexibility and
    compatibility of this system. Due to which IoT is making an impact in the majority
    of the fields i.e., healthcare, traffic, logistics, oil and gas industries and
    agriculture [3]. The IoT enables devices with a variety of features and capabilities
    to connect to the Internet. The rapid rise of IoT applications results to a tremendous
    increase in the number of IoT devices connected to the worldwide network as well
    as network traffic over conventional network. Due to its constrained nature, the
    IoT growth adds more security challenges to the conventional network, as the conventional
    communication network already faces various security challenges. Different IoT
    devices are not constructed to the necessary security requirements, resulting
    in huge security breaches [4]. Food consciousness has grown amongst the people
    lately with the exponential increase of the food industries and radical improvements
    in individuals’ dietary behaviors and ways of life [5]. People nowadays are more
    worried about the quality and safety of the food they consume. Food safety is
    perceived to include food that is liberated from contaminants and chemicals that
    may cause the development of microscopic organisms destructive to individuals’
    safety and lives [6]. Agriculture systems has a significant impact on a country’s
    economic growth as it is the main source of food. According to report published
    by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization [7], a significant portion
    of food waste happens due to various variables during the pre-harvesting, harvest
    and even post-harvest stages and as well the extent of its influence on the economy,
    environment, health and survival of human race. According to a UN report, the
    world population is estimated to surpass 9 billion humans being by the end of
    2050, an increase of about a third over the current population [8]. More than
    half of this increase will occur in Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, Ethiopia,
    the United Republic of Tanzania, Egypt, and the United States. Such rise in population
    necessitates a nearly 70 percent increase in food production rate. This fast growing
    population brings with it a slew of additional challenges, including increased
    competition and overuse of land, water and also other natural resources. These
    challenges highlight critical need to minimize food system’s reliance on our environment.
    As a result, in order to meet the expanding need for food and crop production,
    an evolutionary agricultural paradigm is required to ensure long-term development.
    In an agricultural field, a smart sensing system is necessary to integrate the
    status of the field, its influence on field productivity, and to determine the
    actions that must be taken on the field for a good outcome of a good produce.
    A smart sensing environment is made up of a system of connected devices that can
    constantly send and receive data from one another. It can also make decisions
    on behalf of a user and take action to enhance the environment [9]. This shift
    in the environment necessitates more constant monitoring of the surroundings,
    resulting in an ever-changing environment. Agriculture plays an important role
    in country’s economic growth and it is the basis for human species. Conventional
    agricultural methods are still being used by farmers, resulting in low crop and
    fruit yields. As a result, integrating IoT technologies can boost crop productivity.
    IoT is an essential part of the smart agriculture architecture. With the integration
    of IoT devices, the agriculture systems have been monitored 24/7. These IoT devices
    sense the surrounding environment and physical parameters to take sensed information.
    Such sensed information is then sent to the backend server via Internet or through
    sensor gateway, where date is stored for future use or even user can view that
    sensed data. The user can make decisions about what actions to do in such a monitored
    environment. However, it’s not an easy task to integrate everyday devices with
    the Internet. Security is a big challenge faced by IoT, although each device has
    its unique set of characteristics and requirements. First of all, each person,
    device and system which is connected to the Internet must be identified. Intruders
    will acquire access to the network and perform security breaches if they do not
    have a valid identity. In case of smart agriculture systems, if information of
    sensors monitoring the agriculture parameters is leaked, lost or tampered with,
    it can render the products useless and damage their value significantly hence
    resulting in huge economic food loss. Therefore, developing a concrete framework
    for secure monitoring of smart agriculture with the adaption of IoT devices is
    an essential requirement of this era. Since IoT devices are designed to be compact
    and cost effective, because they have limited computing power and memory. Their
    resource constrained nature makes it difficult to secure them and has necessitated
    the development of lightweight application protocols and security suites. Instead
    of using standard TCP/IP protocols i.e., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and
    Transport Layer Security (TLS), these devices use the IoT protocol stack, which
    is a lightweight version of the TCP/IP model specially designed for IoT devices.
    The CoAP has been standardized as lightweight application protocol for IoT systems.
    However, developing a low-overhead security solution for CoAP remains a challenge.
    Though some security protocols i.e., standard Datagram Transport Layer Security
    protocol (DTLS) exists. However, it is not suitable for IoT constrained devices
    and is expensive due to its computational overhead, complexity and lengthy cipher
    suites process. Therefore, this paper proposed a robust and lightweight secure
    authentication framework in CoAP using symmetric encryption i.e., Advanced Encryption
    System (AES) and HMAC-SHA-224. The main contribution of this paper is to design
    robust and tamper-resistant secure authentication framework for agriculture application
    using CoAP by ensuring data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA is
    implemented in Contiki NG and Cooja simulator and evaluated performances in terms
    of packet size, communication overhead and power consumption. The significance
    of proposed CSFSA is to make resilient against various cyber security attacks
    i.e., replay attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion. The
    proposed CSFSA provides secure monitoring of various agriculture parameters remotely.
    The architecture of proposed CSFSA has three modules i.e., 6LoWPAN based internal
    network having IoT devices deployed in agriculture field for monitoring and controlling,
    a border router which acts as bridge between Internal network and external network
    i.e., Internet and a web server that provides access to the sensed data as shown
    in Figure 1. Figure 1. CSFSA architecture. The paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 provides brief explanation of literature review that has been done in
    smart agriculture, IoT and CoAP security. Section 3 provides an in-depth overview
    of standards and protocols pertinent to our research work. Proposed methodology
    is presented in Section 4. Simulation and results evaluation is discussed in Section
    5. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 6. 2. Related Work This section
    provides the related literature that has been done in the field of CoAP security,
    IoT security, various authentication techniques used between IoT devices and agriculture
    sector. The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol
    used by the World Wide Web to access data on Internet and uses the Representational
    State Transfer (REST) architecture. The HTTP request and response messages exchange
    data between HTTP server and client [10]. This protocol is not suitable for IoT
    and cannot be implemented on IoT devices due to computational overhead. As a result,
    a lightweight and efficient protocol for constrained devices is required. The
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE)
    working group has standardized lightweight application protocol for IoT systems
    i.e., CoAP. It is a specialized web transfer protocol, specially designed for
    resource constrained applications. In [11], the authors compared the CoAP and
    HTTP protocol and evaluated their performances based on energy consumption, battery
    life and amount of bytes exchanged per session as shown in Table 1. Table 1. HTTP
    and CoAP comparison based on resource consumption. Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    is used for securing HTTP communication over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    The CoAP communication over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is secured by using DTLS.
    However standard DTLS is not suitable for constrained networks due to its computational
    overhead, complexity and handshake session overhead. In [12], the authors provided
    brief overview of layered architecture of IoT and security vulnerabilities at
    each layer. They discussed in details various communication technologies along
    with their features and limitations which are being used by IoT applications.
    They also reviewed the existing security mechanisms with their limitations to
    secure the IoT environment. In [13], the authors presented two-way authentication
    scheme based on DTLS and RSA cryptographic algorithm. DTLS protocol is implemented
    in context of system architecture to achieve low overhead and high interoperability.
    However, due to the deployment of RSA encryption, the computational overhead required
    by their handshake process requires more energy. Shahid et al. [14] presented
    lightweight secure CoAP i.e., Lithe for securing IoT devices communication. This
    work provided secure framework by integrating CoAP and DTLS. The standard DTLS
    is not suitable for constrained devices. The proposed scheme used the DTLS header
    compression by leveraging 6LoWPAN standard and significantly reduced the energy
    consumption. The results showed that compressed DTLS performs better in terms
    of energy efficiency, network response time, packet size and processing time.
    In [15], the proposed framework enables the communication between android phones
    using DTLS secured CoAP. This framework combines other algorithms with DTLS that
    are not applicable on resource constrained IoT devices. DTLS requires public key
    cryptography which is a computationally expensive process and a lengthy handshake
    process [16]. Although there are certain security algorithms which are lightweight
    and have less overhead such as raw public key, at least 25 bytes per-packet overhead
    of DTLS takes up one-third of a frame. DTLS heavily hinders the performance in
    terms of round-trip messages when retrofitted to CoAP [17]. The authors Raza et
    al. [18], present a scheme for making the implementation secure CoAP lightweight
    by applying header compression techniques. Although header compression does not
    offer an improvement in performance because DTLS is computationally intensive.
    The authors Freeman et al. [19] propose a plan that enables the client to assign
    a certificate path and construction as well as the validation of the certification
    path to a server. However, this protocol is expected to be used over HTTP. This
    protocol relies on third-party instead of communication parties and adds a heavy
    communication overhead. In [13], a framework for the end-to-end security of IoT
    has been presented. The authors have used DTLS in combination with other standard
    protocols such as RSA. The use of RSA adds a high computational complexity and
    overhead to the network. In addition to that, the authentication handshake process
    in DTLS in which the client and server authenticate each other takes in excess
    of three round trips. Authors of [20] have suggested a technique for lightweight
    authentication using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). In this technique, the
    client and server ensure the identity of the devices based on the message payload.
    During this process, a total of four messages are exchanged between the client
    and server. In [21] Park et al. have presented an implementation of an architecture
    that uses a delegation method to send and receive messages. In this implementation,
    a Secure Service Manager (SSM) is used in the handshake process. This system requires
    the SSM, sensors and trust manager to be located in a constrained network. Hence
    it may not be suitable for all kinds of IoT setups. In [22], Granjal et al. propose
    a plan for end-to-end security by using DTLS algorithm. This system uses the Elliptic
    Curve Cryptography (ECC) to encrypt data in resource constrained nodes. Although
    ECC consumes less power and memory compared to other public key encryption algorithms,
    it still uses up more resources than the symmetric key encryption algorithms [23].
    Using complex cipher suites for encryption results in high energy consumption.
    The authors have used a symmetric key cryptography algorithm, AES to replace DTLS
    in the authentication process. AES performs a four-way handshake between the CoAP
    based server and CoAP client. This process adds two header options in the CoAP
    packet for enabling secure mode. In [24], the authors present a scheme for the
    authentication between client and server by modifying the header of the CoAP packets.
    AES 128 is used for the encryption process and UDP protocol is used without DTLS
    in the transport layer. This scheme reduces the number of messages required for
    authentication between two parties without any loss in the overall efficiency.
    In [25], the various advantages of the new features of “Future Internet” are described,
    which greatly benefits farm management techniques. The “Future Internet” programme
    overcomes the limitations of the already existing Internet. These benefits include
    generic software modules that can be modified to build specific modules related
    to farming. The main architecture of the farm management system is specified,
    depending on which model is stored in the cloud. Tanmay Baranwal et al. [26] the
    main focus of this paper is to protect and secure agricultural goods from rodents
    and insects in storage units and fields. Real-time security systems are used,
    which provide notifications as soon as an issue is identified. Python scripts
    are used to integrate the various electronic devices and sensors. The algorithm
    of this system is based on data collection to achieve accuracy in alerting the
    user and starting the repellent. The system is tested in a 10 m², the device is
    fixed in a corner during the testing. As the PIR sensor senses heat, it immediately
    starts the URD sensor and starts video recording through a webcam. The accuracy
    achieved from these test cases reaches up to 84.8%. It will be beneficial to incorporate
    the security system in storage units to prevent rodents from attacking the goods.
    LIU Dan et al. [27] this paper emphasizes on the role of greenhouse technology
    in the agricultural field and presents the design and development of an environment
    monitoring system. This system makes use of ZigBee technology and CC2530 chip.
    Data collection, processing and communication by the wireless sensors and nodes
    is done by using the CC2530F256 core. The proposed monitoring system gives real-time
    information to the user regarding different parameters such as temperature control
    and fan condition etc. This system utilizes intelligent greenhouse monitoring
    and control techniques and helps the farmers to produce balanced and scientific
    crops. Nikesh Gondchawar et al. [28] proposes a smart agriculture system based
    on IoT and automation techniques. The proposed system uses a remotely controllable
    robot based on GPS to execute tasks such as weeding, spraying pesticides and monitoring
    moisture levels etc. The proposed system also incorporates smart irrigation techniques
    through intelligent decision making based on real-time data from the fields. In
    addition to that, it also includes smart warehouse management modules. It observes
    the temperature, humidity as well as theft detection in the warehouse. The system
    architecture includes various sensors, cameras, ZigBee devices, actuators with
    microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. This system alerts the user regarding irrigation
    and storage problems and uses a remotely controllable robot for smart irrigation
    and warehouse management. Agostino Forestiero [29] proposes an activity footprints
    based method to detect anomalies in IoT by exploiting a multiagent algorithm.
    The method allows real-valued vectors to be used to map sequences of specific
    device activity (digital footprints). The vectors are given to mobile agents,
    who act according to a modified bio-inspired model for each of them. On the basis
    of simple local movement rules observed by all agents onto a virtual 2D space,
    this model allows intelligent global behaviour to evolve. In [30], the authors
    proposes an agent-based algorithm for achieving a distributed resources organization
    in an IoT environment. In order to map the IoT objects, a natural language processing
    approach was used, which was able to capture the semantic context and represent
    things with high-dimensional vectors, allowing advanced agents to operate. In
    a highly dynamic and, essentially, unstructured environment, the growing organised
    virtual structure, i.e., a similarity-based overlay network of agents, allows
    for the development of informed resource selection/discovery services, making
    them more efficient. The approach’s validity has been confirmed by preliminary
    results. Marco Lombardi et al. [31] proposed a preliminary study case of a probabilistic
    approach in an intrusion detection system over the CAN-bus to guarantee cyber
    security inside connected vehicles. An innovative two-step detection algorithm
    has been used to exploit both the variation of the status parameters of the various
    ECUs over time and the Bayesian networks which can identify a possible attack.
    Starting from a domain analysis is possible to find out what are the parameters
    of interests and how these are related to each other. Marco Lombardi et al. [3]
    provided brief overview of IoT regarding current architectures, technologies,
    protocols, and applications. They discussed in details various applications which
    is based on IoT i.e., smart Cities, smart roads, and smart industries. Exiting
    security protocols i.e., standard Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol (DTLS)
    is not suitable for IoT constrained devices and is expensive due to its computational
    overhead, complexity and lengthy cipher suites process. However, the DTLS protocol
    needs to be modified in such a way that it’s feasible for resource constrained
    devices. Hence, researchers are looking for alternative security frameworks to
    replace DTLS. In this research work, we propose a lightweight and robust authentication
    framework for agriculture application and evaluate its performance to show that
    it is feasible for constrained IoT devices. 3. Background This section provides
    an in-depth description of IoT layered architecture, CoAP architecture, proposed
    framework architecture, standard and protocols related to our research work. 3.1.
    Iot Protocol Stack Development The IoT protocol stack is a critical component
    of IoT technology because it allows hardware to communicate data in a structured
    and useful way. In recent years, the IoT has seen an uptick in a variety of applications,
    such as smart homes, smart health, smart agriculture, and smart logistics, where
    each application has its own properties and resource requirements, as well as
    its own protocols to match its objectives [32]. IoT protocols are classified based
    on the role they play in the network. Table 2 shows the logical layering of protocol
    hierarchies used in network communications nowadays. The following is a comparison
    of the protocols for each layer in the protocol stack to determine which one is
    best for the smart agriculture scenario in terms of efficiency and productivity.
    Table 2. IoT Communication Protocols. 3.1.1. Application Layer Protocols Comparison
    CoAP, MQTT, MQTT-SN, and XMPP are the most often used application layer protocols
    in IoT. The following paragraphs offer a comparative review to choose an ideal
    application layer protocol for smart agriculture based on their advantages and
    limitations. Constrained Application protocol (CoAP) is a web transfer protocol
    that is designed to be a lightweight version of HTTP based on Representational
    State Transfer (REST). CoAP runs over UDP, eliminating most of the TCP overhead
    of HTTP, decreasing the bandwidth requirements, providing more simplicity, and
    makes it more appropriate for smart agriculture applications. CoAP is built upon
    the request/response model and supports methods such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE
    as well as unicast and multicast transmission. CoAP is efficient in terms of infrastructure,
    bandwidth and power usage [33]. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is
    another protocol designed for resource constraint devices by IBM. It is based
    on an asynchronous publish/subscribe protocol that runs over TCP. The message
    pattern in MQTT includes a broker, publisher and subscriber. The broker is tasked
    with controlling and distributing of data packets between subscribers and publishers.
    The addition of TCP makes it much more reliable, however it adds more latency
    and causes a higher bandwidth and power consumption. Hence, it is not recommended
    for real time applications. MQTT-SN is a modified version of MQTT, designed especially
    for sensor networks. It uses UDP instead of TCP to minimize the drawbacks of MQTT
    but its core infrastructure is the same as MQTT. The main difference between the
    two is that, MQTT-SN requires a gateway to translate all MQTT-SN messages over
    UDP to MQTT messages over TCP. Currently, this functionality is integrated within
    the brokers [34]. This extra step for the interpretation of messages, adds complexity
    to the overall framework hence increases power consumption. The Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is designed to allow short messages and low latency,
    making it ideal for IoT communications. The XMPP protocol may handle both request/response
    and publish/subscribe formats, which allow for bidirectional and multidirectional
    communication, respectively. The decentralised nature of XMPP allows for high
    scalability [35]. The XMPP protocol use XML for communication, which increases
    network traffic. This results in high bandwidth use, high CPU usage, and no guarantee
    of QoS. The comparative analysis of various application layer protocols show that
    CoAP generates less overhead than the other protocols. In terms of power consumption,
    bandwidth and infrastructure requirements and is most suitable for the proposed
    CSFSA framework. 3.1.2. Network Layer Protocols Comparison Some of the most used
    network layer protocols used in IoT applications are IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
    Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN), ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A comparative
    review of these network layer protocol is given as follows: 6LoWPAN is based on
    IP version 6 (IPv6), it features 128-bit hexadecimal addresses, and uses the 802.15.4
    radio frequency. It enables the use of IP in low-power and lossy wireless networks,
    such as WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks), IoT (Internet of Things) and M2M applications.
    One of the most unique characteristics of 6LoWPAN is that it allows header compression
    and encapsulation, making it more lightweight and secure than ZigBee. The most
    notable advantage of 6LoWPAN is that it supports IP networks natively [36]. The
    ZigBee protocol is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which allows for less
    battery consumption in IoT networks by keeping nodes in low power mode for the
    most part. However, unlike 6LoWPAN, which has interoperability, ZigBee cannot
    readily communicate with other protocols. Bluetooth 5 is the latest version of
    BLE. It supports IP networks however, BLE is unable to establish a self-healing
    mesh network, which is becoming particularly crucial for IoT applications. An
    additional gateway is required to communicate with the internet when utilizing
    ZigBee or classic Bluetooth, which adds extra overhead. It can be deduced from
    the above discussion that due to its compression and encapsulation capabilities,
    interoperability and low network overhead, 6LoWPAN is the prime option for the
    proposed CSFSA framework. 3.1.3. Link Layer Protocols Comparison There are three
    main link layer protocols present for IoT applications, IEEE 802.15.4 for 6LoWPAN
    and ZigBee, IEEE 802.11 for Wi-Fi. and IEEE 802.15.1 for Bluetooth. A brief analysis
    of the above mentioned protocols is given below: IEEE 802.15.4 is a low-power
    wireless network standard developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
    Engineers (IEEE). It has a communication range of at least 10 metres and up to
    100 metres. The 802.15.4 category is the dominant standard for low data-rate and
    security in Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). IEEE standards for wireless
    communications WLANs/Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) are 802.11 networks with communication
    ranges varying from 40 to 90 metres. Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) is inefficient in terms
    of battery life, does not cover a vast area, and does not support a large number
    of end devices. Bluetooth, i.e., 802.15.1, is another WPANs standard specified
    by the 802.15 group, with a communication range of 10 metres to 50 metres. It
    is more power efficient but less encrypted compared to Wi-Fi [37]. From the comparison
    it is determined that IEEE 802.15.4 is the best fit for the proposed CSFSA framework
    because it is compatible with 6LoWPAN, provides more security, consumes less power
    and has a higher communication range compared to the other protocols. Based on
    the comparison of several protocols at different layers, the IoT protocol stack
    for proposed CSFSA framework is presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. IoT protocol
    stack for CSFSA. 3.2. Coap Architecture The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    is a specialized web transfer protocol, specially designed for constrained applications.
    The CoAP’s interactive client/server model is similar to HTTP model. It has similar
    features and principles as in HTTP. Due to higher communication overhead of HTTP
    and HTTPS, such protocols are not suitable for IoT communication. Therefore, CoAP
    is designed to interface with HTTP, to easily integrate with existing web-browsers,
    while ensuring constrained networks and M2M [38,39] specialized requirements i.e.,
    multicast support, simplicity, and low message overhead. The IETF Constrained
    RESTful Environment (CoRE) working group standardized CoAP protocol. It is designed
    according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. CoAP supported
    multicast requests, asynchronous communication, content type and congestion control,
    cashing and proxy abilities. The CoAP packet format has a 4 bytes fixed size header
    as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. CoAP packet format. The CoAP architecture has
    message layer and request/response layer as shown in Figure 4. The message layer
    handles the message exchange over UDP between end points. It deals with reliability
    and asynchronous mechanism. While request/response layer deals with request and
    response messages and their mapping. CoAP has four types of messages i.e., Confirmable
    (requires an acknowledgement), Non-Confirmable (needed no acknowledgement), Acknowledgement
    (receipt of confirmable message), Reset (confirmable or non-confirmable message
    not processed properly), Piggy-backed (sends Acknowledgement with confirmable
    message). The CoAP used same methods i.e., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for generating,
    restoring, creating or updating and deleting processes as like HTTP. The CoAP
    protocol lacks trusted standards for secure architecture and its messages are
    encrypted by using DTLS, which was not designed for resource constrained devices
    and hence is not suited for CoAP [40]. Figure 4. CoAP architecture. 3.3. Proposed
    Robust and Tamper-Resistant Authentication Framework In most of the IoT applications,
    CoAP is utilized as an application layer protocol. CoAP does not provide any security
    for data transmission between two constrained nodes. The CoAP server and client
    communication can be secured with DTLS, however, as mentioned in the preceding
    section, DTLS is not suitable for IoT constrained devices and it causes computational
    overhead and complexity on constrained nodes. Therefore, robust and tamper-resistant
    authentication framework between CoAP server and client is proposed to ensure
    data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA framework is computationally
    efficient and is resilient against various cyber security attacks i.e., replay
    attacks, DoS attacks and resource exhaustion. It avoids the need to develop the
    additional security protocol. Like HTTP, CoAP is based on client/server model
    architecture to establish connection when client sends request to server and server
    sends response to the client. For observation of resources, all the server and
    clients used the CoAP protocol. In order to observe resource, the server first
    authenticates the client identity. If the client is authentic, the server will
    establish session with that client and will respond to the client. On the client
    side while receiving response message from server, the client checks the server
    authenticity. Once both client and server are authenticated, they proceed and
    exchange data between them. The proposed CSFSA framework uses the AES encryption
    techniques and hash based message authentication code algorithm HMAC-SHA-224 by
    ensuring message integrity and authenticity. Before starting communication, the
    CoAP client and server first agree on sequence ID and pre-shared secret key Kpre.
    The server stores each device sequence ID and Kpre in its own repository for device
    identification and to fetch associated Kpre for that device. Now whenever client
    wants to start communication with server, it will send request to server, after
    receiving request from server, server will check client authenticity first. Figure
    5 shows the proposed CSFSA authentication architecture. On the client side, the
    server verifies and authenticate the client identity. The client first generates
    timestamp T1 in order to prevent from replay attacks and calculates hash value
    of Kpre and T1 using HMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm. This hash value is then concatenated
    with the device sequence ID and T1 as follow: H C =HMAC( K pre ,T1) (1) C MP =ID||T1||
    H C (2) where CMP is the client message payload. The client then sends its final
    message CMP to the server. Figure 5. Proposed CSFSA authentication framework.
    On the server side, while receiving message from client, the server checks client
    message authenticity. The server first checks the sequence ID in its repository,
    if it’s not present in repository, the connection will be then rejected, otherwise
    server will fetch associated Kpre for that device in its repository. The server
    then generates its own hash value of Kpre and T1 as follow: H S =HMAC( K pre ,T1)
    (3) where HS is the server hash value. The server compares its own generated hash
    value HS with the received hash value HC from the client. If both hash values
    are not same, the server then rejects the client request. If both values are same,
    then the server authenticates client for services. Once client is authenticated
    by server, the server creates reply message for the message received from authentic
    client. Therefore, the server generates timestamp T2 and session key KS. The server
    encrypts KS and T2 using Kpre and AES encryption algorithm and calculate the hash
    value of Kpre and T2 using HMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm as follows: EM= E K pre
    (KS,T2) (4) H′ 𝑆 =HMAC( K pre ,T2) (5) The server sends H’S along with encrypted
    message EM and T2 to the client. Upon receiving message from server, the client
    generates the hash value HMAC (Kpre, T2) and compares both own generated hash
    value and received hash value. If both hash values are not same, the client terminates
    the connection. If both are same, the server is authenticated and the client then
    decrypts the received encrypted message EM using Kpre and AES encryption algorithm
    to obtain session key KS. H′ 𝐶 =HMAC( K pre ,T2) (6) DM= D K pre (EM) (7) In this
    way, the sensitive agriculture data is being encrypted and decrypted between the
    server and client with the help of using this session key KS. 4. Methodology This
    research work aims to develop robust and tamper-resistant authentication framework
    for monitoring and controlling of IoT devices in smart agriculture. The architecture
    of proposed CSFSA consists of three modules such as internal network i.e., 6LoWPAN
    based IoT network, external network and gateway which acts as bridge between internal
    and external network. The complete proposed CSFSA is developed and emulated in
    Contiki-NG operating system and Cooja simulator. Various steps of methodology
    are briefly explained in the following subsections. 4.1. Description of Proposed
    CSFSA Framework This is the first phase where we will define and explain the structure
    of proposed CSFSA. The proposed CSFSA consists of personal computer where VMWare
    is installed. On VMWare, Ubuntu is installed for Contiki-NG operating system where
    Cooja simulator and Wireshark is used for framework development and analysis of
    result. Cooja is a useful simulator for Contiki-NG development, as it provides
    simulation environment by allowing developers to simulate and test code/system
    before running it on the actual hardware. The proposed framework has three modules
    i.e., 6LoWPAN based internal network having IoT devices deployed in agriculture
    field for monitoring and controlling, a gateway which acts as bridge between IoT
    and external network i.e., Internet and a web server. 4.2. Design and Development
    of Proposed CSFSA Framework This is the second phase which is based on design
    and development. The comprehensive activity diagram for CSFSA is as shown in Figure
    6. First step is to open Cooja simulation, then radio propagation model is selected
    i.e., Unit Disk Graph Medium-distance loss (UDGM-Distance Loss). The Unit Disk
    Graph Radio Medium abstracts radio transmission range as circles. Two different
    range parameters are used i.e., one for transmission and one for interfering with
    other radios and transmission. Figure 6. Activity diagram for design and development.
    The next step is the selection of mote i.e., sky mote is selected having 10 KB
    of RAM. On one sky mote, CoAP server is compiled for communication within agriculture
    field (internal network) and is secured by deploying proposed CSFSA. While Routing
    Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) border router is compiled on another
    sky mote for connectivity with external network. The next step is to create bridge
    between border router and external network. To enable that bridge, need to open
    serial socket server on the border router through “Listening on port 60001”. In
    this way, RPL network is created. Now to connect this RPL network to the external
    network, tunslip utility is used which is provided in Contiki-NG. Tunslip creates
    a bridge between RPL network and local machine i.e., 127.0.0.1 as shown in Figure
    7. Figure 7. Tunslip connectivity. To initiate border router connection, open
    a new terminal in Contiki and type the following commands (shown in Figure 8):
    Figure 8. Border router connectivity with external network. cd Contiki/examples/ipv6/rpl-border-router/
    make connect-router-cooja Finally, Copper (Cu) based CoAP user agent is installed
    for communication with web server which is then opened in browser for control
    and monitoring of IoT devices in smart agriculture. The Copper CoAP user agent
    is an add-on for the Firefox web browser, used for browsing and direct interaction
    with CoAP resources. 4.3. Operation and Procedure of Proposed CSFSA Framework
    In this phase, the operation of proposed CSFSA is presented in 3 primary modules
    such as the internal network i.e., IoT devices, border router and external network
    i.e., internet as illustrated in Figure 9. The framework’s procedure and operation
    ratify the proposed IoT protocol stack which includes IoT devices that use CoAP
    at the application layer, a border router that uses 6LoWPAN at the network layer
    and IEEE 802.15.4 radio at the link layer and a web server that uses a Copper-based
    CoAP client. The RPL border router acts as bridge that connects external network
    with 6LoWPAN based internal network. The proposed framework connects CoAP based
    IoT devices to the internet via 6LoWPAN border router. Figure 9. Operation of
    proposed CSFSA. 5. Results Evaluation and Discussion To appraise the performance
    of proposed CSFSA, the CSFSA is emulated in Contiki NG operating system and Cooja
    simulator. Contiki NG is an open source operating system which is designed especially
    for memory constrained systems. Cooja is an open source simulator which is used
    for the development of Contiki NG, as it provides simulation environment by allowing
    developers to simulate and test code/system before running it on the actual hardware.
    5.1. Simulation Parameters The simulation parameters used for the implementation
    of CSFSA is shown in Table 3. The mote chosen for simulation is Wismote which
    is MSP430 microcontroller based board having 16 KB of RAM and 256 KB of flash
    memory and a radio chip CC2420 compatible with IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The protocols
    used in the simulation are CoAP as an application layer protocol, UDP as transport
    layer protocol, 6LoWPAN as network layer protocol and IEEE 802.15.4 as link layer
    protocol. Table 3. Simulation parameters. 5.2. Scenario Development In order to
    evaluate the CSFSA’s performance, it is divided into two simulation scenarios
    i.e., CoAP with proposed CSFSA and CoAP-DTLS implementation scenarios. CoAP with
    proposed CSFSA scenario comprised of 5 motes and 1 border router. Here motes are
    CoAP servers which are developed on proposed IoT protocol stack and deployed in
    agriculture field for control and monitoring of various agriculture parameters.
    The mote 1 is the border router while motes 2–6 running CoAP servers and all the
    motes are placed in the transmission range of border router. The border router
    is used for connectivity with external network (internet) through tunslip utility.
    The purpose of CoAP servers are monitoring and controlling of environmental conditions
    of agriculture field and send it to remote server i.e., CoAP client application.
    The CoAP client is Cupper based browser which is used for browsing and direct
    interaction with CoAP resources. The CoAP with proposed CSFSA scenario is emulated
    in Cooja as shown in Figure 10. While in CoAP-DTLS scenario, mote 1 is border
    router and motes 2–6 are CoAP servers and all the motes are placed in the transmission
    range of border router as shown in Figure 11. The CoAP-DTLS scenario is used for
    results comparison with proposed CSFSA framework based CoAP. Figure 10. Proposed
    CSFSA simulation scenario consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes. Figure
    11. CoAP-DTLS simulation scenario consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes.
    5.3. Results This section describes the simulation results obtained. We appraised
    the results of proposed CSFSA in terms of performance evaluation parameters i.e.,
    packet size, communication overhead and power consumption. The packet size is
    an important evaluation parameter and have a significant impact on power consumption
    particularly in constrained networks. For message transmission, the standard CoAP
    requires one round trip. In proposed CSFSA framework, the authentication messages
    require two round trips as compared to CoAP-DTLS scheme, which processes it in
    four round trips i.e., three round trips for DTLS and one round trip for CoAP.
    Proposed CSFSA is lightweight and power efficient as compared to CoAP-DTLS and
    has significantly smaller packet size than CoAP-DTLS. Figure 12 illustrates the
    packet size and the number of messages for both proposed CSFSA framework and CoAP-DTLS
    scheme during transmission. Figure 12. Packet size. From the figure, it is clear
    that the packet size for our proposed CSFSA is smaller than that of packet size
    of CoAP-DTLS. Also the round trip time of our proposed CSFSA is lower as compared
    to round trip time of CoAP-DTLS. Communication overhead is defined as the number
    of extra messages or packets that has been transmitted over network. The Standard
    CoAP communication overhead does not include extra packets for data transfer.
    The DTLS adds extra communication overhead to secure CoAP. To establish DTLS secure
    session, it adds 29 bytes to each datagram i.e., 8 bytes nonce and 8 bytes authentication
    tag. In CoAP-DTLS, DTLS handshake adds extra 29 bytes as overhead to standard
    CoAP. In our proposed CSFSA, it requires only two extra bytes communication overhead
    to the total number of transmitted bytes to secure the communication between client
    and server. Figure 13 shows the communication overhead for both proposed CSFSA
    and CoAP-DTLS scheme. Based on comparison, communication overhead in our proposed
    CSFSA is lower as compared to CoAP-DTLS. Its means that our proposed CSFSA is
    efficient and has lightweight communication overhead. Figure 13. Communication
    overhead comparison. Power consumption is another important metric, as it directly
    impacts the lifetime of IoT devices since IoT devices are powered by small sized
    batteries. Proposed CSFSA is lightweight and has significantly smaller packet
    size than CoAP-DTLS. Hence, it consumes less power and bandwidth as compared to
    CoAP-DTLS. The power consumption of proposed CSFSA is measured through software
    based energy estimation tool called Energest which is built in Contiki NG OS.
    The function energest_type_time () outputs the clock ticks obtained from the time
    when IoT device is booted. The formula for measuring the power consumption is
    as follows: PowerConsumption= EnergestValue×Current×Voltage RTIMER_ARCH_SECOND×RunTime
    (8) where current, voltage and RTIMER_ARCH_SECOND are constant, taken from Wismote
    datahseet. Figure 14 shows the power consumption measured for both proposed CSFSA
    and CoAP-DTLS scheme. Figure 14. Power consumption. 6. Conclusions Agriculture
    plays an important role in country’s economic growth. In agriculture, the yields
    or crops which are to be produced are sensitive to changes in their environmental
    conditions and required controlled environment. Conventional agriculture methods
    are not integrated with IoT devices to provide controlled environment, resulting
    in low crop and fruit yields. This necessitates the integration of IoT technology
    in agriculture field to boost crop productivity. However, the integration of IoT
    in agriculture field introduces cyber security attacks and vulnerabilities. Such
    cyber attacks have the capability to adversely affect the countries’ economies
    that are heavily reliant on agriculture. On the other hand, these IoT devices
    are resource constrained having limited memory and power capabilities and cannot
    be secured using conventional cyber security protocols. Therefore, designing robust
    and efficient secure framework for smart agriculture are required and is main
    aim of this paper. In this paper, a Cyber Secured Framework for Smart Agriculture
    (CSFSA) is proposed. The proposed CSFSA presented a robust and tamper resistant
    authentication scheme for IoT devices using CoAP to ensure the data integrity
    and authenticity of smart agriculture monitoring. The significance of proposed
    CSFSA is to make resilient against various cyber security attacks i.e., replay
    attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion and is efficient
    for constrained devices having limited memory. Furthermore, the packet size, communication
    overhead and energy consumption are also computed to appraise efficiency of proposed
    CSFSA framework. As a result, the proposed CSFSA can make a significant contribution
    to the problem of food wastage and its security. Also the economic loss can be
    reduced greatly. Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.U.K., S.A. (Saleh Alyahya)

    (ICSs) are complex systems due to the technology and protocol diversity they contain.
    Operational Technology (OT), an ICS operating structure, has different performance
    and security requirements than the standard IT infrastructure. ICS systems consist
    of field devices where operational processes take place and control systems that
    provide management of these devices. Attackers are involved in the whole process
    after gaining access from the control layer. As a result, critical infrastructure
    systems are threatened by cyber-attacks. Therefore, continuous monitoring and
    security audits are also necessary processes for critical infrastructures. In
    this study, studies on the cyberattack and detection system were carried out on
    the critical infrastructures of the water management process. On the EtherCAT-based
    water management process, six different attack vectors for field devices were
    developed by the techniques in the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix, and these attacks
    were separated by data obtained from network traffic and determined by the SVM
    algorithm. Attack scenarios were created by selecting seven different MITRE ICS
    ATT&CK matrix techniques for attacks on the SCADA system in the control center
    via the engineering computer on the same process. Wazuh HIDS was used for the

    IEEE Conference Location: Elazig, Turkey SECTION I. Introduction ICS is the intersection
    of the physical world and the cyber world. Therefore, the system requirements
    and the operation of the processes are a little more complicated than the standard
    informatics infrastructure. To give an example to industrial control systems,
    systems that have an essential place in daily life, such as energy distribution
    systems, water management systems, intelligent transportation systems, natural
    gas distribution systems, are the main ones. Especially in recent times, the risk
    has increased substantially with the enabling of remote use and control of industrial
    control devices. In other words, while the systems were previously operated in
    isolation, the cyber-physical structure has now become integrated. In a study
    conducted by IBM [1], cyber attacks on the OT side where critical infrastructures
    are running indicate an increase of 2,000 percent. This increase is one of the
    main reasons for the expansion of attack surfaces for cyber attackers due to decreasing
    controls as institutions and industrial structures grow. Therefore, it has become
    necessary to operate cybersecurity processes such as security controls in critical
    infrastructures, continuous system monitoring, periodic penetration tests, and
    follow-up of related systems tightening. When literature studies are analyzed,
    there are different approaches for attack detection systems. Machine learning-based
    detection systems [2], [3], [4] detection system development by open source IDS
    tools [5], and detection with categorical based classification [6], [7] are some
    of these approaches. As can be seen from the literature examples, although intrusion
    detection methods in ICS are carried out with various tools, new methods continue
    to be developed. We used two different detection systems in this study. (1) SVM
    algorithm for attacks on field devices in drinking water systems, (2) Wazuh HIDS
    [8] for attacks on the SCADA system via the engineering workstation. The attack
    vectors were created using the techniques in the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix [9].
    The detection system has been visualized in the ELK environment. The organizational
    structure of the study is as follows: In Section 2, theoretical information about
    MITRE ICS ATT&CK, EtherCAT protocol within the experimental method; Attack vectors
    for field devices and engineering computers, and application information for detection
    are included. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section II, some
    background information is briefly described; in Section III, methodology about
    attack vectors Section IV, conclusions are given. SECTION II. BACKGROUND A. MITRE
    ATT&CK Matrix MITRE ATT&CK Matrix [10] is database consists of tactics and techniques
    based on known cyber-attacks. This open and accessible structure is open to continuous
    improvement. It significantly contributes to the systematic performance of various
    tests for red and blue teams. MITRE ATT&CK techniques and procedures provide behavioral
    observability to detect attacks by analyzing the network and end systems [7].
    MITRE ATT&CK Matrix is improved continuously, and there are three types of MITRE
    Matrix: Enterprise [10], Mobile [11], and ICS [12]. We used the MITRE ICS ATT&CK
    Matrix type for our study. Due to the diversity of assets in industrial control
    systems, the ICS ATT&CK matrix was created focusing on the functional levels of
    the Purdue architecture and asset classes to make the correct classification [9].
    While each title in the matrix defines a tactical name, techniques used for the
    relevant tactic are described under each heading. A technique can be classified
    under more than one tactic according to its intended use. There are 11 tactics
    and 81 techniques in the existing ICS Matrix. The matrix shows us which method
    APT attacks like Stuxnet, BlackEnergy, Havex, Etc—followed for damage to the critical
    infrastructure by APT groups. We used ICS Matrix in our study to create the Attack
    scenario in Section III. B. WAZUH Host-Based IDS and Sysmon Wazuh [13] is an open-source
    host-based intrusion detection system. It provides multiple functionalities like
    integrity monitoring, security monitoring, incident response, vulnerability management,
    etc. With the triggering of relevant events in the system, alarms are created,
    and potential threats are detected early, preventing severe attacks. Additional
    alarm rules can be written to the default alarm rules. Wazuh can be used in various
    architectures [14] depending on the intended use and system size. System Monitor
    (Sysmon) is the Windows system service and device driver for monitoring system
    activity and logging system events in the Windows event log. Provides detailed
    information about process creation processes, network connections, and changes
    in the file creation time [15]. We located this tool on the engineering workstation
    the collect critical events. SECTION III. METHODOLOGY In this section, we describe
    our methodology to attacks and detection techniques on EtherCAT-based Water Management
    System. Our study consist of two main approaches: making an attack by MITRE techniques
    and detection methods for these attack techniques. The detection system includes
    two particular solutions for end point (Engineering Workstation) systems and field
    device (PLC) systems. A. Testbed Environment The test environment topology includes
    managing a total of 4 stations, including one treatment station, two pumping stations,
    and one warehouse. Each station has PLC and I/O equipment for control (Fig 1).
    There are also key devices, an engineering station for configuration and programming,
    ET2000 probe devices for passive network listening, and an HMI panel (Fig 2) for
    management/monitoring. Our study was carried out in real devices and modeled water
    process in Sakarya University Critical Infrastructure National Testbed [16] center.
    B. Attack Vectors for ICS Network This section discusses the safety aspect of
    using the EtherCAT protocol at the factory level. The Ethercat protocol does not
    contain basic security parameters such as standard authentication, encryption,
    and authorization used in information technologies. Therefore, media access control
    has been vulnerable to leaks, remote data acquisition, and other advanced attacks
    requiring advanced information. There are various EtherCAT protocol-based anomaly
    detection methods in the literature: machine learning for device level [4], periodicity-based
    [17], and fuzzing methods [18]. However, we analyze AMS and EAP sub-protocols
    that enable EtherCAT to communicate at factory level, which is not in other studies.
    Fig. 1. Testbed environment Show All Fig. 2. Evacuation scenerio control screen
    Show All TABLE I. MITRE ICS ATT&CK Tecnhiques T0855 attack in Table I, EAP communication,
    which carries the data information between PLC devices, rested from the Probe
    (ET2000) device in the test environment. The water level was changed, and the
    water was pumped into the filled water container as if there was a small amount
    of water. The system has been manipulated by running the motors that should not
    work in the same way. T0816 and T0858 attacks in Table I, PLC configuration statuses
    are transmitted via AMS protocol. With the TwinCAT program running on the engineering
    computer for AMS communication, during the transition of PLCs from working to
    configuration state, network registration was recorded with ET2000 device. When
    the saved AMS PCAP file is examined, the ADS State field has been changed for
    PLC devices to switch from working to configuration. C++ code developed to make
    for these attack vectors in the testbed. T0814 attack in Table I, With high network
    traffic over a single source, the running system has been able to stop the water
    treatment process. The PCAP file received from the system was stopped by creating
    a large number of network flows by giving the loop parameter 5000000 of the tcpreplay
    tool in the Kali operating system. C. Attack Vectors for End Point Systems Many
    APT attacks on natural systems have been carried out by taking advantage of the
    lack of security controls such as misconfiguration, no security tightening, or
    lack of authentication. There are various social engineering methods to provide
    initial access to the system. In this study, assuming the attacker is in Layer
    3 of the Purdue architecture, possible APT scenarios have been implemented on
    the existing water process. The scenarios realized were created according to the
    tactics and techniques in the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix. In our study, we create
    two attacks scenario for simulating APT behaviors. We selected techniques from
    the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix step by step for two attack scenarios (Fig 3). 1)
    Attack Scenario 1 There are three different scenarios in the water process based
    on the various working principles of motors and valves, namely evacuation, circulation,
    and treatment. In the evacuation scenario, the motors of the dam in the system
    do not work typically. The attack vector aims to make the motors in the dam run
    when the evacuation scenario is selected. Step 1: Initial Access/ Replication
    Through Removable Media (T0847), A USB device that includes reverse shell exe
    to attacker machine is attached to engineering workstation. Step 2: Initial Access/
    Engineering Workstation Compromise (T0818), The previous technique provides that
    attacker access to engineering workstation persistently. The \"Migrate\" process
    has been done to continue in privileged mode on the engineering computer. While
    performing the \"migrate\" process, \"RtkAudioService64.exe\", a process belonging
    to the system user, was made according to the process number. Step 3: Discovery/
    Remote System Discovery (T0846), Using the MAC addresses in the ARP table of the
    engineering computer, the model of Ethernet cards was determined to be Beckhoff
    PLC. Step 4: Lateral Movement / Program Organization Units (T0844), The TwinCAT
    development environment of the program required for the development and installation
    of the program that enables the control of Beckhoff PLC devices has been found
    in the internet environment. The processes running on the target computer are
    listed, and the POU file containing the PLC codes has been found on the engineering
    workstation machine. The POU file was downloaded from the engineering workstation
    to the attacker machine via injected malicious exe file. Dam motors have been
    changed to TRUE in the condition of scenario_secim=3 in Fig 4. Step 5: Execution/
    Project File Infection (T0873), PLC logic control code changed in the previous
    step. However, this change in the attacker machine, not in the engineering workstation.
    The changed POU file was uploaded to the same directory in the engineering workstation.
    Step 6: Impair Process Control/ Modify Control Logic (T0833); for the logical
    change made in the previous technique to be effective in PLCs, the \"Activate
    Configuration\" process must be done by the TwinCAT program. An attacker machine
    caused this process. Fig. 3. MITRE ICS ATT&CK techniques Show All Fig. 4. PLC
    POU file Show All Step 7: Impact/ Manipulation of Control (T0831), As a result
    of all steps, when the \"Evacuation Scenario\" is selected from the HMI interface
    in the water process, the control has been changed to unauthorized by ensuring
    that the motors that should not work for the dam will run. 2) Attack Scenario
    2 In the water process, attack vectors have been applied to the PLC device that
    controls the treatment tank to perform the same operations regardless of the scenario
    selection. An essential step in this attack, different from the previous one,
    is to ensure persistence through routing the engineering computer to the C&C server
    (Fig 5). Step 1 and Step 2 are performed by applying the same method as specified
    in Attack scenario 1. Step 3: Persistence/ Program Download(T0843), Although this
    technique in the ICS matrix is not defined for the engineering computer, it has
    been interpreted in this technique because it has a similar effect. The .vbs code
    connected from the Kali virtual machine to the Ubuntu 19.10 virtual machine has
    been created on the engineering computer. Thus, it was transferred to the C&C
    server, where the commands to continue the attack will be executed. Since the
    .vbs code created in the engineering workstation can communicate with C&C when
    the computer is turned off and on again, persistence has been achieved on the
    system. Fig. 5. Attack flow of Attack scenario 2 Show All Step 4: Discovery/ Network
    Sniffing (T0842) and Network Connection Enumeration (T0840), Packages sniffed
    from the engineering computer were examined. The AMS sub-protocol of the EtherCAT
    protocol was detected from the network traffic. Step 5: Lateral Movement/ Program
    Organization Units (T0844), same as Step5 in attack scenario 1. Step 6: Execution/
    Project File Infection(T0873), same as Step 5 in attack scenario 1. Step 7: Impact/
    Manipulation of Control (T0831), As a result of this attack, the working principle
    of the PLC device, which controls the water process in the water treatment tank,
    did not change regardless of the scenario selected on the HMI screen. Manipulation
    occurred in the control center. D. Anomaly Detection and Visualization for ICS
    Network SVM algorithm was used to detect the attack vectors created in the previous
    section. According to the detection program of the attacks carried out at the
    factory level, learning is carried out from the traffic flowing in real-time.
    The parameters to be used to detect attacks from this learning are parsed and
    saved in the CSV file. The model formed as a result of the learning has been kept
    in a file. Subsequent attacks were evaluated according to this model, and the
    states of PLC devices were classified. Classified attacks were transferred to
    the ELK system and visualized. The flow given in Fig 6 was realized on Ubuntu
    19 with Python3 programming language. A linear SVM algorithm is used. In the learning
    part of the SVM algorithm, five attributes are used as features. These are defined
    in Table II according to their intended use. Fig. 6. Anomaly detection for ICS
    Network Show All TABLE II. Features for SVM Algorithm An open-source ELK Stack
    is used to visualize the attacks. The log files resulting from the SVM attacks
    were transferred to the ELK machine with filebeat. Dashboard screens, where detailed
    data of attacks are displayed graphically, have been created in Kibana (Fig 7).
    Fig. 7. Anomaly detection dashboard Show All E. Anomaly Detection and Visualization
    for End Point Systems Wazuh open source HIDS was used to detect the attacks carried
    out in section C. The ossec-agent component that sends events to the Wazuh tool
    is installed in the engineering computer. The agent sends its logs to the central
    server (Fig 9). The alarms on the main server will be displayed on the Kibana
    interface thanks to the Wazuh extension installed on Kibana. Sysmon tool is also
    included in Wazuh alarms to monitor logs that do not generate default, such as
    process create/delete, WMI Event. The rule file has been reconfigured for the
    Sysmon tool to classify techniques [19] in the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise matrix.
    The analysis of the attacks in the C part according to the events that took place
    in the engineering computer was made as follows: As a result of the \"migrate\"
    process of both attack scenarios in Step 2, a new process operating under the
    same process is formed. This situation causes a \"File Create\" type log to be
    created in Sysmon with Event ID = 11 value. The \"File Create\" event is significant
    as it detects newly created suspicious files. The alarm of this event is indicated
    in Fig 8. Fig. 8. Wazuh file create alarm Show All In Step 3 of the attack scenario
    2, a file consisting of random letters is created in the engineering computer
    to direct the .vbs code to the C&C server and provide persistence. C&C server
    and engineering computer communicate by accessing this file. Therefore, the alarm
    similar to specified in Fig 8 occurs. Fig. 9. Wazuh HIDS Workflow Show All Various
    graphs have been created in the Kibana tool to analyze alarms with appropriate
    filters quickly. These graphs are collected in a dashboard structure. For example,
    in attack scenarios, a continuous connection is provided during the sending of
    commands. Therefore, since the connection process is accessed chiefly (185) (Fig
    10), the \"Process Access\" rule is unified. Fig. 10. Process access count by
    event log count Show All SECTION IV. CONCLUSIONS In industrial control systems,
    existing and new attacks continue to threaten organizations. Due to its critical
    impact on both financial and human life, it is crucial to manage, detect and prevent
    security vulnerabilities to prevent these attacks. In our study, a solution proposal
    has been developed that provides possible attacks and detection of both end point
    devices and SCADA system in an EtherCAT-based water process. The attacks and detection
    system do not offer a solution for zero-day vulnerabilities. With this study,
    the machine learning algorithm for the field level for detecting cyber attacks
    that may occur at the factory level against the EtherCAT protocol; An intrusion
    detection system with Wazuh HIDS was developed for the control center. The monitoring
    of devices is facilitated with the ELK system, which is integrated to monitor
    the system. It was ensured that information about essential criteria such as analysis
    of attacks over time and tracking system vulnerabilities was obtained through
    both visual and numerical ratios. If it is desired to get instant information
    from the operations performed in the test environment, it is possible to add visuals.
    In future studies, solutions for both attack and detection can be diversified
    on this matrix. Periodic up-to-date studies of this matrix can also provide continuous
    traceability of the system. When the logs generated by the Wazuh server are generated
    at certain levels, they direct them to the SIEM product, allowing a more comprehensive
    correlation. Network-based monitoring can be done by setting up NIDS in water
    process communication and sending network-based events to the Wazuh server for
    analysis. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes More

  description: Most of the water resource management systems are not migrated to cyber
    physical systems which make control mechanisms implemented insecure. Intruders
    target sustainable environmental systems focused on environmental disaster. User
    identification in modern structures no longer ensures right identity authentication
    and authorisation to digital control system, if the control system is misbehaved
    by the intruder and then it causes extreme damage to the environment. Even though
    current water resource management systems have implemented legacy digital control
    mechanism they have a higher chance of getting compromised through malicious activities.
    The framework proposed in this work involves multilayer authentication of user.
    The first gateway of our architecture uses a cryptographic salting technique,
    where in a random data is used as an additional input to a one way function that
    hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in
    storage. The second gateway imposes an algorithm that uses GPS which has the potential
    to help cyber security professionals to better detect and prevent cyber-attacks
    in real time. The third gateway uses image recognition on android mobile phones,
    from which security system is enhanced detecting image of the user, followed by
    a pattern.

    Location: Salt Lake City, UT, USA SECTION I. Introduction Facilities management
    is highly dependent on data to make informed decisions to manage and maintain
    several systems effectively. These systems are critical to ensure operational
    up time is kept to a maximum. This is essential in an academic environment as
    research experiments can be in process and interruption can cause severe losses
    of research that may be years in the making. These systems are managed by the
    technical services department (TSD) and is responsible for multiple bulk services
    that includes electricity, backup electricity system and water. Building management
    systems (BMS) controls fresh air with heating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
    for buildings as well as environment management for biosafety labs (BSL) also
    known as a cleanrooms. Physical security systems is the final area of responsibility
    to manage that includes CCTV, alarm systems, access control, fire detection and
    fire protection systems. All these systems have several interfaces that make them
    vulnerable to cyber attacks. The effective management of these systems can only
    be understood if the objective is clear on what they are intended to achieve while
    taking into account what disruption and damage it will cause if they are targeted
    by a cyber attack. Information governance is an initiative that intends to effectively
    manage information of systems and processes with protection of personal information
    confidentiality as the primary focus. This is a primary focus of the private information
    protection act (POPIA) compliance with the act coming in full effect on the 1st
    of July 2020 and may impose severe penalties imposed when data breaches occur
    [1]. The POPIA is implemented to ensure protection of personal and private information
    for South African citizens. The Greenwich University data breach received a 500
    000 GBP (Great British Pounds) fine under the European Union (EU) General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR) [2]. Figure 1 however shows that personal information
    is not the only focus of the information governance initiative with data integrity
    and availability as the second and third pillar of the initiative. These pillars
    are of utmost importance for the TSD as data needs to be available when needed
    without needing to waste time to search for the data as it will assist in quicker
    response times when interruptions do occur in the services. This information needs
    to be correct, with a high level of integrity, to ensure effective steps can be
    taken on interruptions. Malicious attacks on these system can be for direct service
    interruptions, data destruction, data delay, or simply a malicious hackers. These
    types of attacks are not limited to the day to day operations of a facility. These
    attacks can also be used on a larger scale to cripple a country’s during cyber
    warfare when targeting a countries critical infrastructure [3]. Facilities management
    also has the risk of being a target for potential attacks and currently does not
    have a drive to prepare for future attacks. Interruptions in the information received
    from these services can have severe financial impact through losses or service
    interruptions. This paper discusses the current system overview and operation
    in section II with the security risk and possible attack vectors in section III.
    Section IV discusses a proposed system to minimise attacks and minimise future
    risks while discussing the importance of staff training on cyber security and
    social engineering measurements. A future cost effective implementation plan is
    proposed to detect and mitigate potential attack vectors. Finally, Section V concludes
    this paper with a short summary and the direction of future work that is proposed.
    Fig. 1. Information governance pillars Show All SECTION II. Background Understanding
    the cyber security risk requires to critically analyse current system components.
    Background of the infrastructure will assist in knowing why these are critical
    infrastructure to manage with operating system, databases, and communication methods
    used for identifying the attack vectors into the systems. A. Electricity supply
    South Africa has been hit by a severe electrical shortage since 2008, with load
    shedding of the electricity supply becoming a norm during that time [4]. The cost
    of the electricity has increased by 350 % from 2007 - 2017 after the crisis started
    and inflation over the same period was only 74 % as seen in figure 2 [5]. South
    Africa has suffered severe impact of load shedding as recent as 2019 with the
    threat that loomed in June and July 2020 becoming a reality [6]. Load shedding
    is implemented on several stages dependent on the shortfall from the electricity
    provider with stage 4 being a common occurrence during 2019 that has 8 hours a
    day power outage split into 2 hour windows over the day [7], [8]. These interruptions
    will greatly impact any research conducted and day to day operations at the university.
    Generators are installed to supply electricity during these times to mitigate
    impact of power outages. Running cost of these generators are roughly 6 times
    higher than supplied electricity in diesel cost alone and does not include maintenance
    cost of the machines. Effective alerting on when power outages occur is needed
    to monitor if the generators correctly start up and similarly when power has returned,
    that the generator has switched off to minimise generator running cost. Running
    the generators also has an effect on carbon tax fees that gives further incentive
    to run the generators as short as possible [9], [10]. Fig. 2. Eskom electricity
    cost increase versus inflation (CPI) [5] Show All The first section to discuss
    is the electricity network monitoring system. Electricity loggers are installed
    over several University campuses at main substations and buildings. These loggers
    originally reported to an old outdated application server running Windows Server
    2003 with SQL Server 2005. Communication is initiated from the server to the loggers
    on a fixed time period to retrieve electrical usage of each site. A new generation
    of software is currently in development running on Windows Server 2016 and SQL
    Server 2018 with monitoring dashboards to see live readings while the communication
    to the loggers are still using the same method as the original system. The generator
    monitoring makes use of a Short Message Service (SMS) messaging protocol to send
    data to specific cellphone numbers and a base station. The data is displayed on
    a dashboard while storing the data in a database. Messages that are received have
    a wide range of information and a overview is displayed on a dashboard. These
    include general maintenance messages like low fuel and battery and charger related
    issues. The main messages of importance is the status of main power supply, changeover
    status to generator/mains, and generator start/stop messages. Reaction to the
    messages is primarily done from cellphone messages received but unfortunately
    a flood of messages can occur if a large area outage occurs as all generators
    will send status messages to the staff member’s cellphone. Fault detection becomes
    extremely difficult as the volume of messages received can easily ensure that
    a message is missed when a change over did not occur or a generator did not start
    correctly. Typically a change over failure from generator to mains will ensure
    that generators keep running after power has been restored at a much higher running
    cost compared to the municipal supply. B. Water management Water is a limited
    resource with a prediction that 40% of the world’s population will live in water-stressed
    areas by 2035 [11]–[13]. The available fresh water has reduced by 55% from the
    1960s and demand is projected to increase by an additional 50% by 2030 [11]. This
    has been financially equated to 500 billion US$ per annum due to water insecurity
    [11]. The United Nations (UN) has developed, due to this scarcity and projections,
    the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) to work towards water security to the
    world that is affordable to the masses [13]. This water insecurity has been felt
    locally in South Africa as it is currently been affecting several of its provinces
    with drought. Cape Town was been declared a crisis zone with severe water restrictions
    to the urban communities of 50 litres of water per day [14], [15]. These severe
    restrictions have been introduced to assist in water supply to the communities
    and additional measures have been imposed to secure natural spring areas from
    water theft [15]. The fact unfortunately, is that around 30% of water is lost
    through leakage within distribution networks and the Durban area has losses of
    35% due to theft through illegal connections [12], [13]. Port Elizabeth has stated
    that 46% losses occur before it reaches its residences [16]. Reduction in these
    losses will assist in alleviating some of the stresses in the water supply. Water
    monitoring systems are implemented to detect losses from the clients’ water network
    to reduce usage through losses which in turn will reduce monthly bills as well
    [3]. Currently there are two monitoring systems installed at the University. The
    first is a SMS based system sending alerts on high water flows and low water pressures.
    Typically a high flow will occur with a severe water leak and low pressure when
    no water supply is present. Data is sent from installed monitoring equipment via
    SMS on a specific time interval which is currently set at 12 hours to limit data
    costs. This provides a historic overview but is problematic if real-time data
    is required to be analyse and detect small leaks. Smaller leaks typically do not
    pass the threshold setup that would trigger high flow alerts. Data can be displayed
    on a desktop application for historic flows and pressures of the sites across
    several of the campuses. The alerts require a fixed threshold value to be set
    that will send alerts. Currently the threshold is set based on the historic maximum
    flows of the specific site but does not take into account that leaks may be present
    in non peak hours with lower usage and will not be detected on the fixed threshold.
    The alarm functionality is a key feature used on this platform as the manual daily
    usage is labour intensive to analyse. The second system installed is used for
    usage monitoring with flow meters installed at over 300 sites across multiple
    campuses. These meters send data to a base station over radio frequency (RF) and
    then a GSM connection to the server. The data is stored in a MySQL database and
    viewable over a web-based system on hourly intervals. This system has a vast amount
    of information but requires manual intervention to view each site on the system
    to determine if there are irregularities in water usage as it does not have an
    alerting functionality. The large amount of sites and time required for analysis
    by a small team is inefficient. The authors have previously proposed to adapt
    the system to, firstly, construct a nightly leak flow report and email a report
    on the site flow rates during the hours of 00:00 and 05:00, when there should
    be no personnel on the site and is with high probability that the reading is a
    leak [3]. This is made possible by having access to the MySQL databases and further
    expansion is proposed for anomaly detection during all hours of the day by making
    use of access control and CCTV for occupancy detection while combining it with
    water usage [17]. C. Biosafety labs BSL control systems are essential to ensure
    proper operation within these labs. The research conducted in these clean-rooms
    have highly contagious pathogens while the control systems ensure a safe working
    environment while keeping the pathogens contained within the room. The labs are
    rated based on the potential lethality of the disease that may be worked on. Keeping
    it safe however requires control systems and strict processes to ensure the viruses
    are kept in the BSL and do not escape to the outside world. An extreme risk lies
    in the something can go wrong with these control systems and in severe cases cause
    an outbreak. The BSL makes use of a BMS that controls air flow by means of differential
    pressure and directional airflow to air into the lab between segregated zones
    with graphical demonstration in figure 3 [18]–[20]. Fine control is implemented
    to ensure that the air pressure is lower in the centre of the lab when compared
    to atmospheric pressure. This is done to ensure that potentially released pathogens
    will stay contained in the cleanroom. Manipulating the controls of the system
    may be used to reverse airflow and increase pressure inside the lab and thus reversing
    the safety mechanism and in turn potentially releasing pathogens to the outside
    world. The systems typically run on a private WiFi network to the control equipment,
    with a windows based system that is installed without further updating and security
    management of the system. Fig. 3. BSL design for differential pressure [19] Show
    All These labs have strict rules and guidelines on management procedures to limit
    unauthorised access. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centre for Disease
    Control (CDC) offering guidelines on how to manage the BSLs [21], [22]. Access
    control measures and CCTV are typical systems that assist in limiting unauthorised
    access to the labs while offering traceability if something may go wrong. Backup
    power supply in the form of a generator is also installed to ensure the control
    systems remains operational when power outages occur. D. Physical security Physical
    security systems are intended to detect intrusions into facilities while alerting
    if something is out of the norm. Unauthorised access can be to steal anything
    from cellphones, laptops, or exam papers as examples. These devices typically
    report to a security control room to monitor the current status and react when
    alarms are triggered. The University makes extensive use of access control at
    perimeter gates, building entrances, and restricted areas. Access to these areas
    are regulated with permissions and stored in a database before being distributed
    to the relevant access control nodes over a typical computer network. All the
    rights are managed through a web interface before storage into the database. The
    access control nodes report back to the main server and can be used to track historic
    movement in and out of location when a intrusion has occurred. Alarm systems are
    used to detect intrusions after forced entries occur. The system is typically
    set on a timer to activate after office hours and be deactivated by personnel
    when they arrive in office the next morning. Activated alarms report to the security
    control room for security personnel to react to the breaches and investigate the
    intrusion. The system also receives panic alarms and the intercoms from elevators
    if staff, students or visitors are stuck when a malfunction occurs. All these
    alerts are sent via the network and stored in an old Microsoft access database
    for analysis of the intrusions if needed. CCTV usage is common in many areas of
    the world and the University is no different. Implementation of the CCTV system
    is done with the objective to keep an eye on multiple campuses that is separated
    by quite a distance. There is around 3000 cameras situated over all the campuses
    that all communicate to individual recorders and is accessible over the network
    in the security control room. Future expansion is underway to have a more centralised
    system to streamline viewing and backup storage of a subsection of the recording
    devices while increasing operational efficiencies. Fire detection and protection
    systems are installed to firstly protect lives and secondly the protection of
    assets. Fire detection will send an alarm throughout a building if smoke, excess
    heat or manual alarms are triggered. Optionally the system will send the alarm
    to the security control room over the network and the authorities can be contacted
    to assist with firefighting. Fire protection by means of gas suppression is typically
    installed at key infrastructure sites such as data centres and sub stations to
    extinguish fires as they occur. These systems are typically not safe for humans
    and is therefore installed in areas that have less human occupancy and protects
    critical infrastructure to maintain business continuity after a fire occurs. Fire
    protection by means of water sprinklers are commonly installed in offices and
    warehouses to protect infrastructure but can damage content extensively with water
    damage. Understanding the systems building blocks will assist in identifying the
    weak points in the system that can be targeted in a cyber attack and is discussed
    in section III. SECTION III. Security risk and impact All of these systems concurrently
    running have common elements that can be targeted for a cyber attack. Network
    communication is a core part on all of these systems as all of them need to transfer
    data. Disruption of this network service can have a severe financial impact. The
    first potential cyber attack is thus a simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
    attack on any of the installed field equipment or servers. Attacks on the RF,
    CCTV cameras, alarm systems, or control equipment will ensure that data losses
    occur. Interruption of these systems will cause anything from blind spots to allow
    intrusions, miss massive water leaks, miss electrical outages, or leave environments
    open for physical intrusions. Independent WiFi of these systems do not always
    fall under IT control so attacks and breaches will possibly not be detected if
    attacked or disrupted. Mobile communication over GSM or SMS may be unreliable
    and messages can be delayed and also have information loss. Most of these systems
    makes use of a web interface that can be targeted in an attack as it makes use
    of a database backend. These systems typically may have a vulnerability to SQL
    injection attacks that can either leak data from the database, inject their own
    data, or delete potentially some or all of the data in the database. The limitation
    of some of the systems being old makes them susceptible to these attacks as they
    have been discontinued with no further security updates. Operating systems that
    do not receive security updates may leave them just as vulnerable as the databases.
    The aging operating systems will have had time for known security flaws to become
    public and can directly be targeted in attacks on these outdated systems. Third
    party software may be designed without taking security into account can cause
    increased risks to the system. Control systems have been targeted directly with
    viruses and malware with Stuxnet specifically focused on PLC control systems.
    These attacks typically start by infecting a computer on the same network and
    then distributed to the control systems with devastating consequences. Altering
    operations of the control systems can have a devastating effect as reversing differential
    air pressure design of a BSL will ensure that potentially lethal virus containment
    fails. Cooling systems that malfunction will have a severe impact on hardware
    in data centres or temperature sensitive research as high temperatures will damage
    or destroy the hardware or research. The human element in these systems are often
    overlooked and can be exploited by making use of social engineering techniques.
    Social engineering is defined as \"the science of using social interaction as
    a means to persuade an individual or an organisation to comply with a specific
    request from an attacker where either the social interaction, the persuasion or
    the request involves a computer-related entity\" [23], [24]. As clearly stated
    by various authors [25]–[28], the human element is the ‘glitch’ or vulnerable
    element within security systems. This weakness can be exploited by various phishing
    schemes and email scams to appear legitimate while attempting to gain access to
    login information, network IPs, hardware locations, or rerouting of financial
    payments. Twitter was recently hacked by making use of a coordinated social engineering
    attack and this same method can be used on smaller enterprises [29]. The question
    now remains which techniques can be implemented to assist in mitigating the threats
    against these systems and a proposal is made in section IV. SECTION IV. Proposed
    system The overlap between the systems is clear that the same functional units
    exist even if the age of the systems may vary. Guidelines and best practices have
    been developed over the past decade to improve control systems cyber security
    [30], [31]. A wide variety of measures can be taken and include network segmentation,
    patch management, system monitoring, and awareness training to address the industrial
    control systems weak points [30]. A simplified overview of the functional units
    and interfaces is shown in figure 4. The physical systems have an interface (I/F
    1) by means of monitoring equipment. Equipment then transmits over a network system
    (I/F 2) to a server and stored into a database. Backend analysis is where the
    proposed system has most of the focus. Network traffic analysis on the monitoring
    equipment and servers can assist in detecting a DDoS attacks [32]. These attacks
    are hopefully minimised as the servers are either in a controlled network space
    with no public facing IPs. Attack threats can thus still be from the internal
    enterprise network on the servers if the rules are not enforced and correctly
    managed. Private WiFi on some of the control systems are however still open for
    attacks and intrusion detection will greatly assist in attacks on the control
    and monitoring equipment. Simply ensuring WiFi SSID is hidden will decrease some
    of the risk that these stand-alone control systems have. An additional step can
    be taken to separate critical systems from the network virtually by making a demilitarized
    zone (DMZ) or different VLANs. This will segregate the network in a manner so
    that specific computers can only access the essential systems and limit attack
    attempts as the computers are not visible on the standard enterprise network.
    Data received from monitoring equipment that is on a fixed time interval can be
    monitored. Analysing the influx of data received on these specific time intervals
    will assist that loss of data is detected much earlier when compared to a small
    team needing to analyse all the data manually. An alert (I/F 4) can be set up
    and sent to relevant staff to investigate monitoring equipment power supply, monitoring
    equipment damage, or network communication when data interruption is detected.
    This alert can easily be sent to a Telegram group by making use of their bot API
    without the need of manual intervention. Cyber security education is an item that
    should be mandatory in every organisation. There is no way we could expect individuals
    to stay vigilant if they do not even know the basics of technology and the attacks
    that may happen on physical systems or the human element [33], [34]. Education
    is at the heart of this problem and mandatory employee training is essential to
    inform them how protect themselves against these attacks. This can be a challenge
    when taking into account that staff education ranges from non-computer literate
    all the way to post graduate level. A campaign thus needs to be designed not only
    to cater to computer literate staff but also non-computer literate staff. Penetration
    testing of systems can provide valuable insight to the weaknesses currently present.
    Identified weaknesses can be used to modify the system to mitigate the risks and
    improve the security posture of the environment. By implementing scheduled security
    assessments and addressing the findings adequately, one can ensure the security
    posture of the environment is maintained. These tests can be outsourced to white
    hat hacker companies or internal staff can be upskilled and trained to do the
    penetration testing for the enterprise. A. Initial implementation plan This is
    a conceptual design and will need to be investigated to determine the extent to
    which the systems are vulnerable to potential attacks. Several open source packages
    are available that can be used to test for vulnerabilities in these systems. Reports
    generated from open source software packages can be used as a motivation tool
    for budget request for system improvements or system upgrades. Some immediate
    mitigation actions can be implemented without investing too many resources at
    a minimum or no financial cost. Server downtime is becoming more frequent due
    to rolling blackouts in South Africa. The servers are configured to auto restart
    and a simple script is implemented to alert staff to check that all software and
    services are indeed running. Data entry count is currently implemented on the
    daily leak flow reports and can be adapted with slight code alterations to be
    used during all hours of the day with notifications to the alerting platform on
    data interruptions. Zabbix uptime monitoring is currently being implemented on
    network equipment to notify on downtime and alerts sent to investigate the outage.
    The load shedding however does cause a false negative alarm with power outages
    and longer alerting time periods are required to ensure a flood of alarms aren’t
    received on every load shedding occurrence. Open source DDoS detection system
    are available for a proof of concept deployment to detect attacks with internal
    penetration testing on the systems. Most of the network based attacks can be minimised
    by moving the critical infrastructure network to a DMZ environment. This will
    decrease the visibility of equipment on the network and potentially mitigate the
    attack vector entirely. Fig. 4. Proposed system function units Show All SECTION
    V. Conclusion Facilities management is often overlooked when performing risk assessments.
    Entities running several systems have a massive threat landscape that need to
    be monitored for cyber attacks. Information received from monitoring equipment
    ensures that decisions can be made to keep critical infrastructure functional.
    These include electrical systems, water management systems, BSL, and physical
    security systems. This paper discusses the systems currently installed with an
    overview of the backend systems that are used to monitor operations. The risks
    has been identified with proposed systems to be implemented to mitigate the risks.
    A current cost effective implementation plan is proposed to ensure quick testing
    of the systems vulnerabilities. This paper highlights the fact that cyber security
    training is an essential part in any organisation to ensure staff understands
    the attack vectors that can be used to gain access to the systems. Authors Figures

  description: Large river basins present significant challenges for water resource
    planning and management. They typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic
    regimes, are characterized by complex and variable hydrology, and span multiple
    jurisdictions with diverse water demands and values. They are often data-poor
    and in many developing economies are characterized by weak water governance. Rapid
    global change is seeing significant changes to the pressures on the water resources
    of large basins, exacerbating the challenge of sustainable water management. Diverse
    technologies have long supported water resource planning and development, from
    data collection, analytics, simulation, to decision-making, and real-time operations.
    In the last two decades however, a rapid increase in the range, capability, and
    accessibility of new technologies, coupled with large reductions in cost, mean
    there are increasing opportunities for emerging technologies to significantly
    “disrupt” traditional approaches to water resources management. In this paper,
    we consider the application of ‘disruptive technologies’ in water resources management
    in large river basins, through a lens of improving water security. We discuss
    the role of different actors and institutions for water management considering
    a range of emerging disruptive technologies. We consider the risks and benefits
    associated with the use of these technologies and discuss the barriers to their
    widespread adoption. We obverse a positive trend away from the reliance solely
    on centralized government institutions and traditional modeling for the collection
    and analysis of data, towards a more open and dynamic ‘data and knowledge ecosystem’
    that draws upon data services at different levels (global to local) to support
    water planning and operations. We expect that technological advances and cost
    reductions will accelerate, fueling increased incremental adoption of new technologies
    in water resources planning and management. Large-basin analytics could become
    virtually free for users with global, regional, and national development agencies
    absorbing the costs of development and any subscription services for end users
    (e.g., irrigators) to help improve water management at user level and improve
    economic productivity. Collectively, these changes can help to ‘democratize’ water
    management through improved access to data and information. However, disruptive
    technologies can also be deployed in top-down or centralized processes, and so
    their use is sometimes contested or misunderstood. Increased attention therefore
    needs to be given to ensuring equity in technology access, and to strengthening
    the governance context for technology deployment. Widespread adoption of disruptive
    technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals are trained,
    increased adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations, and careful
    consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues.

    management is a major and growing global issue for economic development and poverty
    reduction [1,2]. Water is essential for food and energy security [3,4], and water-related
    extremes of flood and droughts have significant economic and social costs [5,6].
    With increasing global population and economic development, demand for water and
    competition between uses and users are on the rise [7,8]. Global water consumption
    is estimated to have increased by 40 percent in the last four decades [8], mostly
    for irrigation, which represents 70 percent of total global water withdrawals
    [9]. While everyone depends on freshwater, the importance of groundwater is often
    overlooked; for example, groundwater provides drinking water for 1.5–3.0 billion
    people [10]. The current level of global water withdrawals is approaching a planetary
    boundary, which if crossed would take the Earth system outside a safe operating
    space for humanity [11]. As result of these pressures, an estimated 4 billion
    people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year [12].
    Local water availability constraints, rapid population growth and urbanization,
    inadequate infrastructure, and governance shortcomings [13] mean nearly 0.7 billion
    people lack access to a safely managed drinking water supply [14]. Accelerating
    climate change is perturbing the global water cycle [15], altering the average
    patterns of water availability and increasing the magnitude and frequency of water-related
    extremes in parts of the world. These changes, however, are uncertain and still
    poorly understood [15,16,17,18]. Climate change increases the uncertainty in projections
    of water supply and demand, and increases the uncertainty in feasibility and economic
    performance assessments of water infrastructure [19,20]. 1.1. Large River Basins—Character
    and Importance There is no widely accepted criterion for defining “large river
    basins”, either in terms of drainage area or total discharge. Basins exceeding
    100,000 km2 in area—of which there are an estimated 130 or so globally (including
    22 exceeding 1,000,000 km2)—could reasonably be considered large. However, rather
    than use an arbitrary criterion such, we adopt a looser definition that also includes
    geographically smaller basins where water management challenges are considered
    ‘large’, because of one or more of: (i) hydrologic complexity (high flows, hydrologic
    variability, non-stationarity, surface-groundwater interactions, multiple water
    sources—rainfall-runoff, snow, glacier melt); (ii) water management complexity
    (large population, supply-demand imbalance, inter-sectoral competition, rapid
    demand growth, pollution, high flood and erosion risk, climate change vulnerability),);
    and (iii) administrative complexity (transboundary coordination or conflict; federate-state-local
    coordination or conflict; governance complexity—intersecting legal, policy, regulatory
    frameworks). Aside from remote and sparsely populated basins in northern Canada
    and Russia, most of the geographically largest river basins in the world are also
    international transboundary basins. A total of 286 river international transboundary
    river basins have been identified (spanning 151 countries and home to more than
    40 percent of the global population); 80 percent of the total area and population
    of the transboundary basins is associated with the largest 156 basins [21]. Larger
    river basins tend to have a higher economic dependence on water resources, and
    the 14 basins with the greater economic dependence on water are home to almost
    50 percent of the population of all transboundary basins—nearly 1.4 billion people
    [21]. In addition to international transboundary rivers, large basins within federal
    countries—such as the Murray–Darling in Australia—represent complex resource management
    challenges [22]. As well as the economic importance and the associated social
    values of large river basins, these systems are critical habitat for freshwater
    biodiversity. Rivers, lakes, and other ‘wetlands’ occupy just 0.8 percent of the
    Earth’s surface but support 6 percent of all described species including 35 percent
    of all vertebrates [23], especially fish. Large rivers with higher flow volumes
    tend to support more fish species, and tropical rivers tend to have higher levels
    of species richness. The highest levels of riverine fish species richness are
    found in the Amazon, Orinoco, Tocantins, and the Paraná in South America; the
    Congo, the Niger Delta, and the Ogooue in Africa; and the Yangtze, Pearl, Brahmaputra,
    Ganges, Mekong, Chao Phraya, Sittang, and Irrawaddy in Asia [24]. Large rivers
    are also especially important for freshwater megafauna with slow life-history
    strategies and complex habitat requirements [25]. Globally, freshwater megafauna
    populations declined by 88% from 1970 to 2012, with mega-fishes exhibiting the
    greatest global decline (−94%) [25]. These major biodiversity declines highlight
    the conflicts between economic development and environmental protection and conservation
    in large river basins. Large river basins present particular challenges and opportunities
    for the use of emerging technologies in support of water resources management.
    Geographically, large basins typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic
    regimes, and processes that characterize basin-scale hydrological behavior take
    place at multiple scales. These give rise to technical challenges for the design
    and operation of hydrometeorological data collection systems, including the integration
    of ground-based and remote observations. Because they often span multiple jurisdictions—within
    and, or between countries—large basins have institutional complexities for coordinated
    data collection, sharing and analysis, as well as for decision making and for
    coordinated real-time operational management. 1.2. Water Security as an Objective
    for IWRM Integrated water resources management (IWRM) has been vigorously promoted
    by the international development community as a set of principles and a best practice
    process for planning and managing water resources [26]. IWRM has also however,
    been strongly criticized from both technical standpoints (for being too vague
    to have real utility for practical implementation [27]) and from political economy
    standpoints (having been dubbed “soft coercive hegemony” [28]). We find that accepting
    some key principles of IWRM (e.g., water systems focus, data/analytical foundation,
    participatory planning) but shifting to a medium-long term ‘water security’ outcome
    focus, helps to better define desired economic, social and environmental outcomes
    from water, and identify specific interventions to help achieve these. ‘Water
    security’ is thus conceptualized as the relationships between the water endowment,
    the water sector architecture (institutions and infrastructure), water sector
    performance (resource management, service delivery and risk mitigation) and the
    outcomes from how water is managed and used (Figure 1). A recent example of the
    application of this conceptualization is a comprehensive water security diagnostic
    for Pakistan [29]. Figure 1. Conceptual framework for water security. Water resources
    management is integral to sustainable development. In 2015, all 193 Member States
    of the United Nations General Assembly agreed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
    Development and established 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is a
    plan to “end poverty in all its forms” and to “shift the world to a sustainable
    and resilient path”. SDG 6—Ensure availability and sustainable management of water
    and sanitation for all—considers not just water supply and sanitation services,
    but also water scarcity and water use efficiency, water quality and wastewater
    treatment, water ecosystems, as well as institutional aspects of water resources
    management (including IWRM implementation) and cooperation [30]. Other aspects
    of water security (such as water-related disasters) are captured by other SDGs.
    In this paper, we review the application of “disruptive technologies” in water
    resources management in large river basins, through this water security lens.
    We consider how these technologies can assist delivering better outcomes or deliver
    outcomes more efficiently or cost effectively. We discuss the roles of different
    actors and institutions, and consider risks associated with the adoption of these
    technologies and the barriers to widespread adoption. 1.3. Role of Technology
    in Water Management Technology has multiple roles in water management, across
    the spheres of infrastructure design, systems planning, real-time operations.
    These can be considered in a matrix with the key areas of water resource management,
    irrigation management, water supply (and treatment) and sanitation, and environmental
    water management. Here, we focus on decision making—at both planning and operational
    time scales—for water resources management. This includes river basin planning;
    water allocation planning; flood and drought outlooks, forecasts and warnings;
    and the real-time operational management of water resources infrastructure. However,
    these boundaries are not tightly delineated, and many of the technologies discussed
    have application into other aspects of water management as well. For these selected
    focal areas of water resources management, we consider how ‘data’ is transformed
    into ‘information’ and then ‘knowledge’, and how these are then used in decision
    making for action. Along this ‘value chain’, we thus consider the collection,
    transmission, storage, management, and sharing of data. Then the ways in which
    data is transformed into information and thence into knowledge, and how information
    and knowledge are stored, managed, shared, visualized, and otherwise communicated.
    We consider the decision process and the roles of multiple actors in this process,
    and how decisions are communicated and then actioned. Beyond the ‘hydro-informatics’
    elements of technology, there are innovative technologies for operations and stakeholder
    interaction. With respect to SDG 6, a brief introduction to some technology opportunities
    is provided by [31,32]. 2. Disruptive Technologies Disruptive technology is commonly
    defined as “technology that can fundamentally change not only established technologies
    but also the rules and business models of a given market, and often business and
    society overall”; the term (and concept) was first introduced in the mid-1990s
    by Harvard Business School scholars in the context of business innovation [33].
    Disruptive technologies are now showing much promise in every field of development
    [34]. The evolution of these technologies is accelerating and disrupting traditional
    approaches to water planning and management. The key relevant technologies are
    summarized in Table 1 with implications on their application to water resource
    management in large river basins. Table 1. Summary of disruptive technologies
    relevant to water management in large basins. 2.1. Technology Evolution Technological
    evolution has influenced the use of water resources for millennia. However, in
    recent years, there has been an acceleration in the development of new tools and
    technologies of relevance for water resources management (Figure 2). Many factors,
    however, affect the adoption of emerging technologies, including institutional
    capacity, the enabling policy and institutional environment, resource availability,
    competing priorities, access to global good practice, intellectual property, and
    the agility of governments, the private sector, academia, and other actors. These
    factors have meant heterogeneous but overall slow uptake and diffusion of new
    technologies. Some technologies that were deployed in the developed world more
    than a century ago, are only now being adopted across the developing world. However,
    much of the developing world has a ‘last mover’ advantage, with the potential
    to leapfrog old ways and adopt new approaches more rapidly than the developmental
    paradigm allowed in the developed world. While there have been many challenges
    in leapfrogging in some areas, including for environmental sustainability and
    indeed for river basin management [35], information and communication technology
    leapfrogging is beginning to show real impact in spite of “tech transfer” and
    “absorptive capacity” issues [36], including through rapid adoption of mobile
    technologies and leveraging the large data sets generated by some developing countries
    [37]. Figure 2. Timeline of water technology evolution. Here, we classify disruptive
    technologies according to where they can be most disruptive: (i) decision-making,
    (ii) operations, and (iii) stakeholder interaction (Figure 3). Figure 3. Typology
    of ‘disruptive’ technologies. 2.2. Technology Appplications Traditional investments
    in water resources in the developing world have seldom been conceived, implemented,
    or operated from a holistic multi-sectoral basin perspective. They often are based
    on old technologies and have high operational and maintenance costs that are seldom
    met, leading to poor service delivery exacerbated by deferred maintenance as they
    age. Even basic monitoring data are usually not accessible in real-time and require
    different ‘ringfenced’ legacy software that are not inter-operable. One of the
    main ways in which modern technology is reshaping water resources planning and
    management is through ‘disrupting’ the data value chain (Figure 4). This is manifested
    through new inexpensive sensors for in-situ monitoring (tending towards an expansive
    ‘internet of things’), increasingly powerful Earth observations from satellites
    and drones/unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide synoptic views of topography
    (including high-resolution digital elevation models to identify flood-prone areas
    and support hydrodynamic modeling), climate, water levels, flows, snow cover,
    inundated areas, landcover, watershed status, and even some aspects of water quality
    and groundwater. Earth observations [22], with near global consistent coverage,
    is rapidly becoming a game-changer for synoptic observations in large basins,
    where the resolution of even the free resources from NASA and ESA are often adequate
    for useful water resources analytics. New unmanned on-water and under-water vehicles
    show promise; they can be outfitted with sensors and autonomous (single or swarm)
    capability for surveying large water bodies (e.g., for bathymetry, hydraulic safety,
    water quality, or fish stock assessments). Figure 4. Modernizing the data value
    chain (Data→Information→Knowledge→Decision Support). New analytical tools, increasingly
    cloud-based—including at the global level, assimilate available data and generate
    estimates of a range of critical parameters related to snowmelt estimation, water
    balance, water accounting (e.g., WA+, WAPOR) [38,39], scenario analysis, and forecasts
    to create ‘digital twins’ of basins to facilitate analyses. These enable access
    to curated archives and real-time estimates of the water status for any basin
    anywhere in the world to support both strategic planning and tactical operations
    through data visualization, early alerts/warnings, and the development of interactive
    packaging for data, analytics, and knowledge. Examples include interactive portals,
    mobile phone applications, and dynamic e-books. These support decisions at all
    levels, from simple scoping of water resources development, to detailed planning
    with stakeholder involvement/outreach, as well as real-time operations. Additional
    systems related to data/text mining, social media integration, advanced cloud-based
    modeling, machine learning/AI, or ‘bots’ can help bring in an additional automation
    and integrated perspectives to support decision-making. These technologies are
    helping water managers reimagine the way information-based decisions can be made
    for smart water resources planning and management and are allowing development
    of integrated basin/aquifer plans based on both analytical and stakeholder approaches.
    Technologies have made possible new approaches to use and conserve water and administer
    usage caps (e.g., using satellite-derived actual evapotranspiration estimates),
    adopting a systems perspective to improve agricultural water productivity, benchmark
    systems, and incentivize sustainability. New in-situ and Earth observation monitoring
    and analytics allow for development and customization of tools for water planning,
    allocation, and coordinated water infrastructure operations in an integrated multi-sectoral
    systems perspective. Water infrastructure can now be operated in a more coordinated
    systems context for multiple objectives ranging from service delivery to climate
    resilience. Continuous innovation, piloting, and learning from global good practices
    enables quick scaling-up of new technologies and enables more adaptive management.
    3D printing, robotics, automated transport, advanced materials, nanotech, biotech,
    and cleantech are supporting new operational systems that represent a paradigm
    shifts away from traditional approaches. Examples include irrigation systems that
    improve water productivity and field-level water use efficiency (especially when
    combined with policies such as limits on water abstraction); 3D printed monitoring
    stations (e.g., 3D-PAWS [40]) that reduce costs for monitoring weather and water
    levels; and ultrasonic control systems (successfully piloted in Lake Quaroun in
    Lebanon) that can mitigate algae-related water quality problems. Platforms are
    emerging to enable people to work together in new ways in the sharing economy,
    including fintech, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, block-chain enabled supply chains,
    asset sharing systems, Digital ID enabled e-governance, and open learning platforms.
    Many of these platforms have application in water management in large basins,
    including online/mobile platforms to support learning or interactions among remote
    or disperse water user associations, and platforms to help farmers access global
    marketplaces online, with feedbacks into irrigation water requirements. 2.3. Implications
    for Large Basins The implications of these new technologies, with a focus on digital
    technologies, for water resources planning and management in large basins, are
    summarized in Table 1. Major changes in water management around the world are
    likely in very short timeframes. Ref [41] Many of the initial impacts will come
    from the plummeting costs of sensors, mobile devices and connectivity, cloud services
    (including to process increasingly powerful earth observation and other big data),
    interoperability due to online data standards and protocols, and increasing digital
    literacy. Water data could be used primarily for water assessments, evaluations,
    operations, foresight, design, accountability, and education [42]. Many of these
    are useful at different scales—from monitoring progress towards the SDG-6 global
    indicators to helping design a culvert. Many countries are modernizing their water
    resources institutions and developing national water resource information systems
    and analytics to support basin planning and disaster management. Some are also
    strengthening ties among government, academic, civil society organizations (CSO),
    and private sector institutions to develop a broad stakeholder base for this transformation.
    Modern water information systems require integration of data (from global, regional,
    national, to local sources), data quality management, conversion to interoperable
    data services, and development of interactive dashboards to help access and visualize
    data services and associated analytics in appropriate formats to support decisions.
    Large basins will especially benefit from these changes given both the challenges
    (e.g., the need to integrate data across large areas; multiple stakeholders wishing
    to inform coordinated decisions; large water infrastructure investments) and the
    opportunities of large basins (e.g., application of free Earth observations in
    the 10–250 m resolution range; the ability to deliver reach large numbers of remote
    beneficiaries with valuable data services). Institutions such as the Mekong River
    Commission and the various Nile Basin Initiative centers have demonstrated the
    utility of modern data and analytics in basin planning and hydro-meteorological
    data integration. Other large basins (e.g., the Congo, Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna)
    are in the nascent stages of this journey given capacity constraints and transboundary
    cooperation challenges. Many countries are modernizing their water information
    systems taking advantage of new technologies. The United States and Australia
    are improving their already well-established systems facilitated by strong national
    institutions. Europe is increasingly building on its regional institutions (e.g.,
    European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, European Organisation for
    the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, Joint Research Centre of the European
    Commission) to help countries access better data and analytics. China is utilizing
    evapotranspiration estimates derived from Earth observations to improve irrigation
    management [43,44] and India is enhancing its national water resources information
    system [45]. Estimates based on satellite products or global models are increasingly
    found to be comparable with those based on in-situ observations [46,47]. These
    techniques, especially when enhanced by a new generation of artificial intelligence
    (AI)/machine-learning (ML) algorithms and global models, can revolutionize water
    resources management even in data-poor environments. When accessed through customized
    interactive dashboards, this information can be especially useful for estimating
    parts of the water balance, estimating flooding areas, making customized weather/hydrologic/inundation
    forecasts, managing large water demands (e.g., agriculture) and system losses,
    while enhancing and benchmarking water productivity [48,49]. 3. Institutional
    Roles Traditionally, water resources institutions have faced the challenge of
    inefficient workflows, low capacity, poor coordination across sectors and governance
    levels, poor integration with other kinds of institutions (e.g., academia, private
    sector), limited transparency, and inadequate alacrity in learning from global
    good practices. New technologies are enabling improvements in information interoperability
    [63] and institutional infrastructure that can be developed at reasonable cost
    (e.g., ecosystems of computers, tablets, and smartphones and related Apps; shared
    audio/videoconferencing, shared communication, and touchscreen access resources;
    dynamic physical-computer modeling approaches [e.g., [69]). These can be co-located
    in clusters such as water centers that allow for co-location of representatives
    from related organizations that need to work together (e.g., the National Water
    Center in the United States) to develop and use shared products (e.g., the National
    Water Model [70]). These approaches could be adopted in many countries and transboundary
    basins where shared personnel and tools could ‘disrupt’ traditional ‘siloed’ approaches.
    New technologies are also fundamentally changing the notion of capacity-building,
    with services, automation, and interfaces reducing the need for laborious and
    time-consuming issues related to access restrictions, digitization, formats, fragmented
    desktop analysis, and dissemination on a case-by-case basis, all with only a few
    people having access to even view the data and products. New more automated systems
    enable wider access and a different kind of capacity development, avoiding the
    need for reinventing similar systems at great cost and with limited new functionality.
    These systems can increase levels of collaboration between agencies, through shared
    data, analytics, and visualization services. All stakeholders can leverage the
    learning and collaboration systems supported by the internet and high-speed connectivity,
    in order to learn rapidly from and contribute to global good practices. New technologies
    can help redesign stakeholder consultation, climate hazard insurance, payments
    for ecosystem services, by connecting stakeholders and by accessing new data analytics.
    Different institutions have different roles in this evolving world (Table 2).
    Table 2. Institutional roles in the disruption process. Water sector institutions
    have both management and governance roles [71] and both these roles can be enhanced
    through technology. For example, in the case of groundwater management in large
    areas, improved monitoring using in-situ sensors (e.g., for extraction, use, quality,
    recharge), Earth observations (e.g., for evapotranspiration estimates and gravity-based
    water equivalent changes) and improved models, could improve resource management
    through regulating groundwater pumping (volumes and timing) or determining bore
    spacings. Modern communication including for automated collection of fines, could
    improve governance to promote resource management goals of equity, efficiency,
    conservation, and sustainability. New technologies could be particularly useful
    in transboundary waters contexts, with multiple options now available for estimating
    resource extent and condition, and other key water resources variables. A key
    constraint in reaching the potential the various technologies is data availability.
    This could be overcome by wider government adoption of an open data approach.
    For example, the California Open and Transparent Water Data Act requires the state
    Department of Water Resources to create, operate, and maintain an open-access
    state-wide integrated water data platform [72]. 4. Benefits, Risks, and Barriers
    to Adoption The technologies discussed herein offer important technical and governance
    benefits compared to traditional approaches. They can increase robustness in decision
    making, as decisions are more likely to be based on more complete information
    (e.g., from weather and other apps, portals, decision support systems). They can
    increase the timeliness and accuracy of real-time and near real-time decisions
    through greater use of automation and rapid and reliable communications. They
    can reduce the costs of basin planning and management (e.g., lower traditional
    hydromet monitoring costs, reduced redundancy, and increased economies of scale
    from online services). They benefit end-users through better information and decision-support
    and enhanced mechanisms to connect stakeholders and global good practice (e.g.,
    through social media and packaged curated content). They provide enhance trust
    and cooperation across sectors and regions (including transboundary) and can support
    more democratic decision-making through open and equal access to data and information.
    While disruptive technologies (even while often benefitting from centralized platforms
    and standards) are encouraging a move away from top-down centralized decision
    processes, their adoption does not guarantee this positive shift. There are many
    instances of the deployment of disruptive technologies in top-down or centralized
    decision making without adequate stakeholder consultation. Understanding the governance
    context for disruptive technology deployment is therefore critical, as is explicit
    consideration of how this context determines whether new technologies enhance
    or hinder processes of stakeholder participation and empowerment [73,74]. In addition
    to these potential negative consequences, there are significant barriers to widespread
    and rapid uptake of these technologies. Adoption requires a considerable range
    of new technical skills, many of which are not standard in university water management
    curricula. In addition to awareness-building, there is a need to improve the sector
    skill-base through training, recruiting/insourcing appropriate cutting-edge technology
    skills, and building partnerships. As with any new technology, the need to invest
    in new infrastructure has budget implications, and while costs for many of the
    technologies are rapidly reducing, governments may be reluctant to invest in what
    may be perceived as non-standard equipment. As these technologies are evolving
    rapidly, there will be pressure to update and upgrade more frequently than in
    the past. With the accelerated risk of obsolescence, it will be important to move
    to new adaptable cloud-based approaches that allow rapid upgrading of systems.
    This highlights the need for changed mindsets to help water resource managers
    and decision makers step out of the ‘comfort zone’ to recognize this new world
    of rapidly evolving technologies. As well as barriers to adoption, there are some
    significant risks. Effective management of privacy and cybersecurity risks requires
    good institutional policies, frameworks, and systems [71]. There are implications
    for professional employment, since as with any technological change, large numbers
    of employees will increasingly find there is diminishing need for traditional,
    manual jobs as these become automated (e.g., gauge readers, analysts, desktop
    modelers, translators, etc.). Employers will need to recognize these trends and
    institute retraining or retrenchment/skill upgrading/replacement programs for
    effective workforce management. There is a risk that the digital divide will become
    greater—with many countries, and communities within countries, unable to access
    the disruptions that seem to be changing life for the better in other places and
    for other people. This will require increased emphasis on low-cost or free open
    public-domain systems and the ability to create and use more global platforms.
    5. Conclusions and Forward Look A new world of innovative technologies has the
    potential to ‘disrupt’ traditional approaches to water resources management in
    large basins. The widespread operationalization of the fuzzy concept of IWRM is
    now within reach, with new ways to strengthen the information, institution, and
    investment foundations of IWRM. Looking ahead, there are two mutually reinforcing
    aspects that will help make the rate of technological adoption exponential. First,
    technology is evolving at a blistering pace, dropping the costs for every process
    and enabling actions that were not even considered in the realm of possibility
    a few years ago. Second, the incremental adoption of some of these technological
    options in water resources planning and management are generating lessons that
    can inspire others to do even better as adoption spreads. These changes are likely
    to lead to a new way of reconsidering data and analytical sovereignty as data
    and analytics (e.g., for droughts, floods, basin scenario planning) become increasingly
    global, fueled by machine learning that builds on opening up of data access for
    training. Water withdrawal and net consumption will be closely tracked and monitored
    (with a combination of in-situ sensors and Earth observation) to improve systems
    management and benchmarking. Large-basin analytics could become virtually free
    for users with global, regional, and national development agencies absorbing the
    costs of development and any subscription services. Services for end users (e.g.,
    farmers) could also become free or low-cost services and help improve water management
    at the user level and deliver improved productivity. Collectively, these changes
    can help to ‘democratize’ water management through improved access to data and
    information, but increased attention will need to be given to equity in technology
    access. Disruptive technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals
    are trained, an increasing adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations,
    and careful consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues. Especially as the
    world struggles with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic experience, there is an increasing
    appreciation of the use of such new technologies to help conceive, remotely monitor,
    and manage water resource systems and related investments. Strong leadership to
    create an enabling environment to improve awareness and skills related to new
    technologies to realize the promised benefits and effectively manage risks is
    essential to facilitate this modernized approach to planning and managing large
    basins. Author Contributions Conceptualization, N.R.H. and W.Y.; Methodology,

  description: Modern day health care providers have traditionally only focused on
    meeting the response phase requirements of disasters. The emergence of complex
    global public health crises such as climate change and extremes, biodiversity
    loss, emergencies of scarcity, rapid unsustainable urbanization, migrant and refugee
    surges, domestic and international terrorism, cyber-security, the civilianization
    of war and conflict, and the global rise of resistant antibiotics has resulted
    in an unprecedented rise in direct and indirect mortality and morbidity. These
    crises are beyond the current decision-making and operational capabilities of
    traditional disaster management and its providers most of who are community level
    practitioners representing every discipline. The 1930s “disaster cycle” concept
    describes a phase-related approach to meeting the strategic, operational, research,
    educational, and training components required of disasters; and, presents an opportunity
    for the structured development of a Health Crisis Management Framework to oversee
    the phase-related strategic and operational requirements for prevention, preparedness,
    response, recovery and rehabilitation challenges of major global public health
    crises. Whereas this approach mimics the manner in which practitioners at every
    level of society identify with in their daily practices, this approach deserves
    the support of every clinician, researcher, academic, and ancillary health care
    provider. Interestingly, this was also the intent of the original 1930 disaster
    cycle concept.

    crises are beyond the current decision-making and operational capabilities of
    traditional disaster management and its providers most of who are community level

    PDF 1 Introduction Communication networks have become an essential part of our
    everyday lives and currently, our society is highly dependent on the proper functioning
    of communication networks. In connection with our private lives, the number of
    services that are being delivered over these networks is progressively increasing,
    and probably in the future, new services will appear, all converging over the
    same infrastructure [1]. Regarding professional aspects, communication networks
    play a key role in efficiently developing economical activities in a fast, secure,
    and reliable way. In addition, it is possible to find very powerful companies
    in the world having Internet services and applications as their main activity,
    such as Google or Facebook, and they are continuously expanding. In relation to
    critical applications, the question is whether the existing communication infrastructure
    can provide the necessary reliability, or whether new networks that allow the
    harsh requirements of such applications will be needed? 2 The Role of Telecommunication
    In the early days of telecommunication, communication between two entities was
    ensured through a physical communication channel between the two entities by so-called
    circuit switched networks [2]. This type of network ensures a guaranteed bandwidth
    between the entities, since once setup there are no interferences, and is kept
    available during the communication. However, setup time is required to ensure
    the connection is established. Besides the setup time, it should also be fairly
    easy to imagine the great limitations of these types of networks when considering
    millions and millions of connected end devices that need communication. The introduction
    of packet switched networks allowed the sharing of the limited physical medium
    among several communicating entities [2], and allowed for a much more flexible
    communication. The road from the first initial baby steps of a few machines connected
    over some copper wires done in the late 1960s as a response to the cold war, up
    to today’s full scale hyper complex networks of networks is a study worth in itself
    [3]. Today, end users have grown accustomed to have access to communication networks
    more or less everywhere and whenever needed, leaving them with a perception that
    the Internet is something that just is. This impression has not only been driven
    by the fact that wired communication offers very high speeds to the individual,
    but also mobile communication today offers a high data rate due to the technological
    development [4]. Now, the next step has come, that we want to use the existing
    communication infrastructure to mission critical applications. One thing is to
    say “my Internet works nicely at home, and at work it also works nice”, but another
    thing is to put so much trust into the network that we allow critical systems
    such as water, electricity management, or eHealth applications to run on top of
    these networks of networks. 2.1 Basic Communication Between Two Entities Critical
    infrastructures are to a large extent also distributed by nature. In such setting,
    communication is often required to be able to have elements in the system interact
    in a synchronized and organized matter. Subsystem A may need to react upon events
    that happen in subsystem B or vice versa. At the same time, critical infrastructures
    are often characterized by deadlines due to their connection to the physical world
    and the properties of the physical world which a critical infrastructure interacts
    with. Figure 1 shows the example of two communicating physical devices located
    at different geographical and network locations. These two entities could for
    example be a water management system that has to interact with remote control
    units located at strategic points along water pipes. Fig. 1 Communication between
    two entities [5] Full size image The data that is required to be passed from A
    to B and vice versa has to undergo a long way through several routers due to the
    packet switched approach we have today. At each passing point (router), the received
    data needs inspection to decide which router the packet should go to next. This
    may not always be the same for all packets even though their sources and destinations
    are the same as clever traffic load balance algorithms may be applied to avoid
    congestions among routers. A data packet route example is illustrated in Fig.
    1 as data going up and down in the different levels of the OSI model [2]. In some
    parts, packets need to be addressed at a network level, while in others only a
    link level is required. But it is clear that each hop takes some time for the
    routers to process packets. This leads to an end-to-end delay even though we experience
    the communication as a direct communication between A and B. The end-to-end delay
    depends on many factors, such as the quality of each link between routers, network
    traffic conditions (there may be bottlenecks between some routers), the route
    through which the data packets are being sent (this is not controlled by the application,
    but is impacted by the decisions made by the network). These factors also mean
    that the end-to-end delay usually shows a highly stochastic behaviour, rather
    than a desirable deterministic behaviour, and even changes over time, e.g., in
    some parts of the network there is more traffic during work hours than in night
    time or weekends. This complexity of intercommunication needed to transport data
    from A to B illustrates some key problems that critical applications have when
    dealing with communication over networks today. There is no or very little control
    of the data streams going between A and B. When routers receive a significant
    amount of traffic, they may start to drop incoming packets. Some transport protocols,
    as TCP aim at providing reliable transport by ensuring retransmission of missing
    packets, but at the cost of end-to-end delay because it first needs to detect
    missing packets, and then ask for retransmission. Others such as UDP offer to
    send data with crossed fingers that it appears at the receiving side. In that
    case, the application must be able to tolerate packet losses. Therefore, some
    of the key challenges that communication systems face, and even considering only
    two entities communicating, to support critical applications are not necessarily
    only classical data throughput, but definitely also latency and reliable communication.
    These key requirements are often assumed, because they are to a large extent hidden
    to the everyday user, but as communication developers we need to take these issues
    seriously if critical infrastructures shall be supported by (existing) communication
    technologies. 2.2 Communication over Heterogeneous Networks As a further complication,
    networks are heterogeneous and full of new and legacy systems. Figure 2 shows
    a conceptual example of how different devices and applications may be connected
    via a large set of networks of networks. The heterogeneity covers some challenges
    that may limit some use cases as the following example illustrates: Fig. 2 Simplified
    example of networks and connected applications Full size image In order to communicate
    between two entities an addressing scheme is required (a basic requirement for
    any type of communication). The most prominent addressing scheme today is IP addressing.
    In principle, all addresses should be uniquely defined, in order for packets to
    be sent to the right destination at all times. When the Internet Protocol version
    4 was designed and implemented, the space allocated for the address in the protocol
    allowed for ‘only’ approximately 4.29 billion unique devices. At the time of development,
    that was enough, but with the current development this amount has shown to be
    too small, since all sorts of sensors, mobile devices, multiple interface devices,
    etc., has ultimately led to an address starvation. This has not been acceptable,
    so several solutions have been invented to overcome this address starvation, such
    as Network Address Translation, use of private network addresses, tighter control
    of Internet registries, network renumbering of existing networks, etc. Even a
    new IP version 6 has been developed with a much larger address capacity, but still
    the earlier IP is being used, since so many devices depend on the stability of
    this protocol’s address space, that in fact no one knows exactly what happens
    if suddenly software started to use IPv6 [6]. The IP address issue is just one
    of many examples of the complexity of networks of networks shown in Fig. 2 and
    how networks even today are challenged by more or less invisible problems. Therefore,
    once again, one could ask the following question: do we trust these networks to
    serve as communication media for mission critical applications? Do we dare to
    let this patchwork of networks, software patches, numerous of standards, protocols
    and configurations be the bearing part of critical, life depending elements such
    as electricity, water and health in our everyday life? Referring to Fig. 2, the
    vision of several critical applications which interact with the network is shown:
    Doctors who have online meetings with patients, eHealth [7] Water detection and
    control, [8] Electric power control, smart grids [9]. On top of this, there will
    surely be other applications using the network, such as web browsing, video streams,
    emails, online games, etc. The question is, why should these critical applications
    use the same network? For example, cars and air planes have several dedicated
    internal communication networks so as not to mix the application traffic with
    real time critical data traffic. However, for simplification and cost reduction
    reasons, research is ongoing on how merge the different data traffic [10]. The
    time, effort and cost of deploying the Internet as it is today is immense. Deploying
    a separate network for each of the applications that is envisioned does not appear
    to be a very attractive solution if we somehow are able to ensure the existing
    infrastructure can support the requirements of the critical applications. A major
    key to the solution is the flexibility of the network as it is today. As a corner
    stone design idea of the early Internet (from ARPANET [3]), the idea of robustness
    to link failures has been eminent, which is a key feature for critical infrastructure
    as well as not having to deploy net networks from scratch. However the complexity
    and heterogenic nature of communication due to legacy systems requires interoperability
    and standards. In the following we take a closer look at how this is being addressed
    in the smart grid as an example. 2.3 Communication Standards for Smart Grids In
    smart grids, data from consumers and potentially also from the power grid infrastructure
    is required to be collected for control purposes. This not only means communication
    over heterogeneous networks, but also with a wide range of communicating entities,
    smart meters for example, produced by different vendors. Today, the core purpose
    of the meters already developed is to monitor power usage for e.g., electricity
    bills [11]. However, the data also have value for the utility company. In smart
    grid terminology, being able to remotely read the meter is called automatic meter
    reading (AMR) and is a part of the automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), i.e.,
    the network between the smart meter and the utility company [12]. With an AMI
    network the monitored data from a household can be sent to the utility company,
    which can use it to optimise their production of power and thereby avoiding over/underproduction.
    AMI has been addressed in various projects like Power Matching City [13] and others
    [14, 15] and it has been shown, that using the data from monitoring systems can
    lead to optimisation of the demand and response (DR) [16, 17]. However, it is
    not clear what are the requirements for the communication network. For example,
    the authors in [13] have made a living lab to demonstrate a smart grid. In the
    chosen setup, dedicated ADSL communication lines are used for AMI in order to
    avoid human interference. The purpose of this is to make sure that they have enough
    bandwidth for the communication. Nevertheless, the requirements for the networks
    are not mentioned. Implementing dedicated communication lines only for the smart
    grid communication is very expensive and not a feasible solution for all cases
    of AMI. Furthermore, the data can be used by the utility company to act as an
    energy consultant, to advice the customers how to save money based on their power
    usage data and additionally offer free or cheaper electricity during overproduction
    periods to encourage their customers to use power consuming devices, for example
    heat pumps, or allow the utility company to perform Direct Load Control (DLC)
    by controlling the customers devices and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) [18].
    Being able to control e.g., heat pumps, electric cars and other DER’s, makes it
    possible for the utility company to control and level the peak periods in the
    power grid by remotely turning on/off specific units in order to take off load
    or supply more power to the grid appropriately [16]. In Denmark, the Danish Ministry
    of Climate, Energy and Building has published a report in October (2011) about
    Smart Grid in Denmark [70]. In the report they encourage further research and
    development in smart grid and also mention communication as a vital part of the
    smart grid. 2.4 Standards for Smart Grids Mapping requirements for critical infrastructures
    is a challenging task, because the smart grid is a large complex infrastructure
    with different layers of networks, which gives a diversified communication performance
    expectation [18]. IEEE and IEC have already proposed a number of standards regarding
    the communication in smart grid in different layers. One of the most commonly
    used standard is IEC 61850, which focuses on the substation automated control
    and is used in the Danish smart grid project in Bornholm called ECOGRID [71] and
    for the AMI there is IEC 62056 [19, 20]. In the following some communication standards
    are mentioned which are proposed for different parts of the smart grid. IEC 61968-9
    and 61970: Defines the common information model for data exchange between devices
    and networks in the power distribution domain and the power transmission domain
    respectively. They are used in: Energy management system [21]. IEC 60870-6: Defines
    the data exchange model between the control center and power pools. It is used
    in: Inter-control center communication [21]. IEC 61850: Defines the communication
    between devices in transmission, distribution and substation automation system.
    It is used in: Substation automation [21]. IEEE P2030: Defines the inter-operability
    of energy devices and IT operation with electric power systems. It is used in:
    Customer side application [21]. IEEE 1646: Defines the communication delivery
    times to substation. It discusses the requirements of the system to deliver real-time
    support, message priority, data criticality and system interfaces. It is used
    in: Substation automation [21]. Challenges for the smart grid network: Other challenges
    in the communication network in smart grids, relates to delay, availability and
    security [12, 15, 18]. If the utility company is expected to control the distributed
    energy resources (DER), delay becomes a critical metric in the network performance.
    The delay in the network will have a high impact on the grid if the DERs are not
    activated or shutdown on time; thus, some sort of message priority scheme in the
    communication protocol will be required [18, 22]. Availability and reliability
    of the network are of importance to ensure the grid operation and also plays a
    vital role in the demand response [23, 24]. Security is crucial to the smart grid.
    When extracting information from the user, the privacy of the user has to be secured.
    The grid can also be vulnerable to terrorist attacks if the control messages to
    control various electric devices are hijacked [25]. Adding security can have an
    impact on the delay, as the messages have to be encrypted. Another way to add
    security is by not letting the hacker know where these control messages come from
    or go to. For this, an anonymous packet routing with minimum latency has been
    proposed [26]. There are a number of challenges in the communication network for
    smart grid. The standards proposed still have to be implemented and tested in
    many scenarios, in order to examine the network performance. There is still a
    need for research in protocols that can deliver messages safely according to the
    time constraints specified by the different standards. 3 Design of Critical Optical
    Transport Infrastructure Communication networks have become an essential part
    of our everyday lives and our society is highly dependent on the proper functioning
    of communication networks. In connection with our private lives, the number of
    services that are being delivered over the data networks is progressively increasing,
    and probably in the future new services will appear, all converging over the same
    infrastructure. Regarding professional aspects, networks play a key role in efficiently
    developing economical activities in a fast, secure, and reliable way. In addition,
    it is possible to find very powerful companies in the world having Internet services
    and applications as their main activity, such as Google or Facebook, and they
    are continuously expanding. Telecommunication systems have been evolving for the
    past 10 years, towards the unification of services and applications over the same
    infrastructure [27]. Currently, it is possible to identify how this initiative
    is partially followed by operators providing voice, data and video transmissions
    over the same access connection, known as Triple Play. However, the distribution
    networks of these services are not unified physically. For example, the TV and
    telephony infrastructures are traditionally separated. The unification of these
    infrastructures implies ambitious requirements to be supported by the network,
    for example due to the heterogeneity of the traffic flowing through, or the significant
    profit losses, or the number of affected users when loss of connectivity occurs
    [28]. Examples of recent cable cuts in optical networks are: In the beginning
    of 2008, the cable connecting Europe and Middle East suffered four single cuts,
    affecting millions of users [29]. In April 2009 AT&T suffered cable cuts, perhaps
    due to vandalism, in the area of San Jose and Santa Clara, California, leaving
    many of Silicon Valley businesses and customers without phone and data services
    [30]. In July 2011 35,000 broadband customers were affected for several hours
    by a cable cut caused by a truck in Washington State, USA [31]. Looking back it
    is possible to realize how fast the world of communications has evolved. For example,
    in 2009 the 40th anniversary of the first ever data transmission over ARPANET
    was celebrated. This fast evolution of communication technologies and services
    is causing a gradual increment of the bandwidth and reliability requirements to
    be fulfilled by the network infrastructure [32]. In addition, the traffic supported
    by the Internet has significantly grown over the last few years, shaping up the
    requirements that future networks need to handle. In order to be able to support
    all the traffic and quality of service demands, there is a need for high performance
    transport systems, and focusing on the specific field of this work, a highly reliable
    optical backbone infrastructure [33]. The interest is especially increasing regarding
    optical transport networks, where huge amounts of traffic are continuously traversing
    their links. Inefficiencies or disruptions on delivering the information become
    critical at this level, due to the number of simultaneously affected users. All
    these huge flows of information must be efficiently distributed using reliable
    high capacity transport networks. Bandwidth requirements clearly indicate that
    the optical network technology based on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
    will play a key role regarding this issue [34]. 4 Planning the Physical Infrastructure
    The deployment of optical networks is a long and expensive process, due to the
    trenching tasks involved, especially for large geographical areas such as national
    or continental territories. It can take 10–15 years to deploy such networks under
    the cost of millions of euros [35]. Moreover, the lifetime of the physical infrastructure
    is rather long, between 30–50 years [36, 37]. These features make such a network
    deployment a long term investment project, which should be carefully planned.
    In addition, when this high investment is combined with a reliable, preventive
    and green planning, a better outcome can be achieved [35]. Optical network systems
    are very complex; each of the network layers can have great impact on the overall
    performance, going from physical to application layers. In relation to backbone
    networks, the infrastructure can be limiting the global performance of a network
    just by the fact that the physical interconnection scheme has not been carefully
    planned [28]. In fact, when the network requires some kind of physical upgrade,
    the solution’s costs in economic terms might be much more significant, due to
    trenching and deployment tasks, than at higher layers where software updates might
    be enough to solve the problem [38]. Hence, networks should be planned and designed
    to provide high performance and high availability in transmissions. As the economic
    relevance of these networks is increasing, it is also feasible to increase the
    investment for their deployment. This capital increment opens up a whole new space
    of possibilities when designing the network’s interconnection. Planning is crucial
    and even small improvements may have high economic impact. However, no well documented
    methods exist for the whole interconnection planning process leaving room for
    the development of this work. The main overall challenge can be described as the
    physical interconnection decision problem of a set of nodes. This interconnection
    can be configured in many different ways, and several of these might be “optimal”,
    depending on the objective function and constraints of the optimization. In this
    case, two of the most relevant objective functions are: Deployment cost minimization
    and average connection availability maximization. The main problem is how to cover
    these two aspects in the same optimization process, as they are contradictory.
    Usually, the minimization of deployment costs would imply a negative effect on
    the availability of the designed networks. The number of deployed links to interconnect
    the nodes is compromised, in order to achieve the minimization goal. This can
    be avoided by conveniently selecting the proper constraints in the search process.
    The feasible solutions spectrum can be reduced to graphs that a priori will provide
    good solutions in terms of availability and not be extremely costly. Three-connected
    graphs are a good possibility to implement such transport networks. This type
    of graphs is discussed below, but first the models regarding deployment costs
    and availability should be introduced. Definition 1 A graph is k-connected when
    any \\( k - 1 \\) elements, nodes or links, can be removed from the network and
    still maintain a connected graph. 4.1 Deployment Cost There are three main contributing
    elements regarding the economic costs for deploying optical transport networks
    using WDM technology: trenching, nodes, and fiber spans. These are considered
    to define the following deployment cost model used in this work but new elements
    may be included at a later stage. Some of these concepts can be found in [39]
    and a complete review on the architecture of optical networks can be found in
    [34]. Let \\( I_{NT} = I_{links} + I_{nodes} \\) be the total cost of deploying
    a network. \\( I_{links} \\) is the cost of deploying the links and \\( I_{nodes}
    \\) is the cost of deploying the nodes. Each existing link is characterized by
    its length, \\( Lm_{ij} \\), and the traffic traversing it, \\( Ld_{ij} \\). Not
    all pairs \\( i - j \\) have an existing link. Basically, three cost parameters
    can be defined to calculate \\( I_{links} \\): \\( I_{trench} \\), \\( I_{fix}
    \\), and \\( I_{span} \\). \\( I_{trench} \\) corresponds to the price for the
    trenching tasks per km and its value can significantly vary, depending on the
    region or landscape. \\( I_{fix} \\) corresponds to the fiber terminating equipment,
    and \\( I_{span} \\) is the cost related to each fiber span where ducts, fiber
    and amplifier costs are included. The length of each span \\( L_{span} \\) can
    vary from 50 to 100 km [36]. Therefore, \\( CW \\) being the wavelength (\\( \\lambda
    \\)) capacity and \\( W \\) being the number of \\( \\lambda^{\\prime}s \\) per
    fiber, the number of fibers \\( nf_{ij} \\) for the link between nodes \\( i \\)
    and \\( j \\) is defined in Eq. (1). The number of amplifiers, \\( nla_{ij} \\)
    in a link is defined in Eq. (2). Consequently, the economic costs for deploying
    the links of a network \\( Top \\), \\( I_{links} \\), is formally defined in
    Eq. (3). $$ nf_{ij} = \\left\\lceil {\\frac{{Ld_{ij} }}{CW \\cdot W}} \\right\\rceil
    $$ (1) $$ nla_{ij} = \\left\\lfloor {\\frac{{Lm_{ij} }}{{L_{span} }}} \\right\\rfloor
    $$ (2) $$ I_{links} = \\sum\\limits_{{\\forall \\;i,j\\; \\in \\;S_{N} }} \\left(
    {I_{trench} \\cdot Lm_{ij} + 2 \\cdot nf_{ij} \\cdot I_{fix} + \\left( {\\left\\lfloor
    {\\frac{{TRF_{ij} }}{{L_{span} }}} \\right\\rfloor + 1} \\right) \\cdot I_{span}
    } \\right) $$ (3) Regarding the nodes, \\( I_{nodes} \\) can be divided in two
    parts; the facility cost, \\( I_{fal} \\), and the switching cost, \\( I_{swch}
    \\), related to each switch size. The switch size is given by the number of incoming
    and outgoing fibers to each node and the number of wavelengths per fiber. Usually
    standard switch sizes are given by \\( 2^{m} x2^{m} \\) for \\( 0 < m \\le 5 \\),
    and \\( I_{swch} \\) is not linearly proportional to \\( m \\) [40]. Concluding,
    \\( I_{nodes} \\) is formally defined as Eq. (4). $$ I_{nodes} = N \\cdot I_{fal}
    \\sum\\limits_{{\\forall \\;i\\; \\in \\,S_{N} }} I_{swch} (i) \\cdot W $$ (4)
    4.2 Availability Availability is a convenient parameter for measuring the efficiency
    of the network infrastructure regarding failure support. Availability is defined
    in [36] as follows: “Availability is the probability of the system being found
    in the operating state at some time t in the future, given that the system started
    in the operating state at time t = 0. Failures and down states occur, but maintenance
    or repair actions always return the system to an operating state”. Availability
    in optical networks has been widely studied. For example, [41] presents an interesting
    availability review of Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) network components
    and systems. In terms of connection availability analysis, [42] compares the availability
    results between simulation and analytical environments for a shared protection
    scenario. Also, in [43] an interesting approach is followed to evaluate the availability
    in optical transport networks. It is measured in expected traffic losses when
    failures occur. Availability is mathematically defined as the working time/total
    time ratio. Let \\( MTTF \\) be the Mean Time To Fail of any element or system
    and \\( MFT \\) be the Mean Failure Time. Availability \\( Av \\) is presented
    in Eq. (5), resulting in a numerical value of \\( 0 \\le Av \\le 1 \\). $$ Av
    = \\frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MFT} $$ (5) The availability in relation to an \\( s - d
    \\) pair connection is given by the availability calculation of sets of elements
    in series and in parallel. For each provided disjoint path to be available, all
    of its elements must be available. For a connection to be available, at least
    one path must be available. Let \\( Av_{pj(s,d)} \\) be the availability of each
    \\( j \\) of the provided \\( k \\) disjoint paths between \\( s \\) and \\( d
    \\). \\( m_{j} \\) is the number of elements of path \\( p_{j} (s,d) \\), each
    of these characterized by an availability \\( Av_{i} \\). Equation (6) presents
    the calculation of the availability for each path. The connection availability
    for an \\( s - d \\) pair, \\( Av_{C(s,d)} \\), is presented in Eq. (7). $$ Av_{pj(s,d)}
    = \\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^{{m_{j} }} Av_{i} $$ (6) $$ Av_{C(s,d)} = 1 - \\prod\\limits_{j
    = 1}^{k} (1 - Av_{pj} ) $$ (7) 4.3 The Graphs The decision of how to deploy optical
    links to interconnect network nodes is a complex problem. Its combinatorial nature
    makes it impractical to make the interconnection decision using exhaustive search
    methods. Heuristics may provide a good approximation to optimal results while
    Integer Linear Programming would be the ultimate approach. In relation to the
    distribution of the links, currently it is widely accepted that these ring interconnections
    are reliable enough for the demands of the users. However, if the current evolution
    of telecommunication demands keeps heading towards a more IT dependent society,
    higher degree physical networks (>2) can significantly contribute to the improvement
    of failure support, congestion control, or delay propagation aspects due to multipath
    options. For example, in the long term, it might be cheaper to build more reliable
    networks than less reliable networks that require higher maintenance investment
    to keep similar availability levels. Therefore, 3-connected graphs could be the
    natural evolution for this type of networks [44]. Consequently, networks formed
    by 3-connected graphs are capable of supporting two simultaneous failures, links
    or nodes, and still maintain connectivity between any pair of nodes. 4.4 Illustrative
    Example The main goal of this example is to identify the deployment cost versus
    availability consequences of using 3-regular, 2- and 3-connected graphs to interconnect
    several sets of nodes. The number of links in all options is the same but their
    different distribution of the links implies different performance characteristics.
    In order to obtain concrete numerical results, three scenarios are presented.
    These consist of sets of 16 nodes in Europe, US, and Asia to be interconnected.
    This experiment consists of designing the interconnection for these sets of nodes
    following these topologies: Single Ring, \\( SR \\); 3-regular 2-connected, \\(
    D3_{2C} \\); and 3-regular 3-connected, \\( D3_{3C} \\). The \\( SR \\) is the
    shortest 2-connected topology and it is used as a lower bound reference. Downtime
    and capacity allocation are determined considering two disjoint paths (1:1 protection)
    in the \\( SR \\) case. In the \\( D3_{2C} \\), three disjoint paths (1:1:1 protection)
    are provided between pairs of nodes, if possible; for the rest, two disjoint paths
    are used. In the \\( D3_{3C} \\) case, three disjoint paths are provided between
    each pair of nodes. The interconnections are optimized in terms of deployment
    costs, and the cost and availability models presented above are used. Details
    about this experiment, and Figs. 3 and 4 can be found in [45]. Fig. 3 Cost versus
    downtime Full size image Fig. 4 3-connected solutions. a Asia, b America, c Europe
    Full size image Figure 3 presents the comparison of deployment cost vs. downtime
    in the three scenarios. The pattern followed by the results in the three cases
    is similar, and it can be noticed how the improvement of moving from the \\( D3_{2C}
    \\) to the \\( D3_{3C} \\) is more significant than moving from the \\( SR \\)
    to the \\( D3_{2C} \\). The slope of the lines between points can be interpreted
    as the availability benefit of increasing the deployment costs, the steeper the
    better. Figure 4 illustrates the resulting \\( D3_{3C} \\) graphs for the three
    scenarios. In summary, to deploy \\( D3_{3C} \\) graphs is slightly more costly
    (between 2 and 11 % higher) than the \\( D3_{2C} \\) option, but the improvement
    on availability pays off the extra investment by reducing the yearly downtime
    between 230–400 times. 5 Reliable Access to Dynamic Information in Critical Infrastructures
    As a part of dependability, reliability of the system and information being accessed
    is critical. In many situations in critical systems, events are happening and
    require reporting to a server that will take action upon the event. In this matter,
    it is critical that the server reacts upon the situation as it is, and not how
    it was moments ago. In the following we consider the communication between two
    entities A and B, at different geographical and network locations, with A having
    a need to obtain information from B which happens to be dynamic, and this access
    needs to happen over a (complex) network with a stochastic end-to-end delay (see
    e.g., Fig. 1). In [46] we evaluated the impact on different access strategies
    to dynamic information elements over a network. The access scheme models are generic
    meaning that they do not model any particular protocol, but rather the behaviour
    of one. The delays involved are described statistically such that any stochastic
    models based on MAC, IP or Application layer can be incorporated. The models consist
    of the following three basic schemes: reactive access, proactive event driven
    and proactive periodic. Then, for the following we consider the stochastic processes
    An Event process \\( {\\mathcal{E}} \\), if Poisson with rate \\( \\lambda_{e}
    \\). \\( E = \\{ E_{i} ,i \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}\\} \\), where \\( i \\) the \\( i
    \\)th event number. An upstream (A–B) and downstream (B–A) delay \\( {\\mathcal{D}}
    \\), if Poisson with rate \\( \\nu \\), and indices \\( u \\) and \\( d \\) for
    upstream and downstream, respectively. \\( D = \\{ D_{j} ,\\,j \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}\\}
    \\), where \\( j \\) the \\( j \\)th delay. An Access Request process \\( {\\mathcal{R}}
    \\), if Poisson with rate \\( \\mu_{r} \\). \\( R = \\{ (R_{k} ,k \\in {\\mathbb{Z}})\\}
    \\), where \\( k \\) indicates the \\( k \\)th request. The definition of an event
    may not be unique, but by event we here mean a significant change in the value
    of some attribute or information element of interest. Significant can for example
    be if a signal exceeds some threshold or simply takes another enumerated value.
    5.1 Reactive Access The reactive access is characterized by A sending a request
    for information to B. Once B receives the request, it sends back the response
    to A containing the information and A will use this information for some purpose,
    for example as input for a smart grid control. Then we can calculate the probability
    of A using outdated and mismatching information as [46], $$ mmPr_{rea} = 1 - \\int
    \\overline{B}_{E} (t)F_{D} (dt) $$ (8) where \\( \\bar{B}_{E} (t) \\) is the CDF
    of the backwards recurrence time (see [46] for details) of the event process,
    and \\( F_{D} (t) \\) the CDF of the delay (with the bar indicating the reliability
    function, i.e. \\( \\bar{F}_{X} = 1 - F_{X} \\)). Here traffic is only generated
    whenever needed. The average waiting time is entirely defined by the sum of the
    upstream and downstream delay. The result obtained from B may also be cached at
    A, on which for some time period any requests are fetched from the local cache
    rather than sending requests to B. The mismatch probability model for that case
    is rather complex (see [47]) for details. Applying a cache means also that network
    traffic is in average reduced, as well as the average waiting time. 5.2 Proactive:
    Event Driven Update Another option is that B, which collects the data, sends an
    update to A if it detects an event has occurred. In this way, network traffic
    is only generated whenever events occur, however, if the event process is rather
    fast this can become a rather large amount of traffic. The mismatch probability
    for this approach can be calculated by considering two types of updates: (1) if
    each update contains full information, i.e., each update completely overwrites
    existing value at A, or (2) if each update only provides the incremental value
    since the previous update. For case (1), the mismatch probability becomes exactly
    the same as for the reactive strategy, but for (2), the mmPr can be modelled by
    considering the probability of finding a \\( G/G/\\infty \\) queue being busy,
    with queue elements modelling updates in transit. If just one is in transit, then
    there will be a mismatch (see [46] for further details). $$ {\\kern 1pt} {\\text{mmPr}}{\\kern
    1pt}_{pro,evn}^{(inc)} = {\\mathbb{P}}(E/D/\\infty \\quad queue\\quad is\\quad
    busy) $$ (9) 5.3 Proactive: Periodic Update This approach relies on B sending
    the current value or state of the information to A with a time period specified
    in one way or another. The traffic generated by this approach is entirely determined
    by the update rate. The mismatch probability for this approach is based on a thinned
    Poisson update process. This also means that the update process is stochastic,
    while it normally is deterministic. However, due to clock and scheduling drift
    in operating systems, and the fact that a deterministic update process (via simulation
    studies) shows to provide better reliability, this assumption serves as a worst
    case scenario. Thus, the model becomes $$ {\\kern 1pt} {\\text{mmPr}}{\\kern 1pt}_{pro,per}
    = \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty } \\exp \\left( { - \\int\\limits_{0}^{t} \\tau F_{D}
    (s)ds} \\right)A_{E} (dt), $$ (10) with \\( \\tau \\) the update rate, \\( F_{D}
    \\) the delay distribution and \\( A_{E} \\) the backward recurrence time, [46].
    5.4 Impact of Access Strategy on Reliability Figure 5 shows the mismatch probabilities
    for the different access strategies with varying event process rate, under the
    assumption that the involved processes are all exponentially distributed (for
    simplicity). The effect is clear for this situation: there is not only a significant
    impact, but also a very different impact on the different strategies, which makes
    it less clear which approach is actually the best. Fig. 5 Mismatch probability
    as a function of the event rate for different access strategies, for a symmetric
    delay of 500 ms and request rate of avg. 0.1 req/s Full size image Although it
    appears as if the pure reactive and event driven (using full update) appears to
    perform best, one also has to consider that the traffic generated is different
    (reactive in this case is 0.2 messages/s, event driven in the range of 0.1–10
    messages/s compared with the periodic one which is 1/3 message/s). Thus, in case
    of scalable systems such as smart grids where several thousands of customers provide
    data regularly, the solution of which strategy to take is not necessarily clear.
    5.5 Impact of Event and Delay Processes It is also not just the event rate that
    has an impact on the reliability. If there are restrictions to which values an
    information source can attain, e.g., a lamp is either on or off, and that is the
    information needed for e.g., a smart grid solution, then this additional information
    on restriction has an additional effect on the reliability. Figure 6 shows an
    example of a case where information can only be in one of two states (ON or OFF),
    with the ratio of time spent in one or the other state (\\( \\zeta = \\lambda
    /\\mu \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) as the rates at which the information
    changes states in a two state Markov Chain). Fig. 6 Mismatch probability for an
    ON/OFF type of information model Full size image The figure shows that there is
    a maximum mismatch probability at the ratio of 1, i.e., when there is equal probability
    of finding the information in one of the two states. Any other ratio gives a lower
    mismatch probability due to the biased time spent in one or the other state. In
    comparison, the same process modelled as a Markov jump process instead, shows
    not only the obvious that the ratio does not have an impact, but that the resulting
    mismatch probability is higher than the two state model at any point. Another
    important aspect which is shown in Fig. 6 is that the delay process is important
    too (in fact the following observation is equally valid for the event process
    too—that is as long it is not a recurrent process). The figure shows three results
    of the same plot, coming from three different distribution types: (1) an exponential
    distribution, (2) an Erlang distribution with 20 phases, and (3) a Truncated Power
    Tail (TPT) with 20 phases, all with the same mean value. The results, which are
    consistent with other results shown in [46], show that the deterministic process
    (modelled by the Erlang distribution) is far the worst case, i.e., resulting in
    the highest mismatch probability. The best case is the highly stochastic type
    of information modelled by the TPT distribution. This is indeed good news for
    example for smart grid solutions, where the most stochastic elements are those
    which will need to be observed, while the deterministic elements are often those
    which will need or can be controlled, and thus do not need much other observation
    than perhaps a feedback whether the element has been activated or not. Take the
    example of a lamp, TV, or other similar device such as a household device which
    has a level of stochastic behaviour which may be modelled e.g., as an ON/OFF model
    as shown in Fig. 6. 5.6 Network Adaptive Access Strategies One example of how
    the models can be useful is the selection of the update rate of the periodic strategy.
    Figure 7 shows how an appropriate choice of update rate (\\( \\tau \\)) in the
    periodic scheme can lead to a consistent reliability, set here to 0.3. However,
    this comes at a cost of an increased network overhead which in theory can rise
    to an infinitely fast update rate (this is of course unrealistic). Fig. 7 Mismatch
    probability for an ON/OFF type of information model Full size image Similarly,
    an appropriate caching period can be selected to keep reliability (see [47]).
    Therefore, these models offer a large range of possibilities for reconfiguration
    of protocols which have the above mentioned type of interaction for dynamic information.
    However, as already discussed, networks are not static, and end-to-end delays
    are not necessarily similar over the days, weekdays or months. Therefore, these
    processes should be monitored and estimated, which is not trivial and requires
    software components, [67–69]. But, if done properly, algorithms via observations
    of information access request rates, data sizes of requests, and knowledge of
    the delays and event processes can be provided for proper selection and configuration
    of access to dynamic information for reliable operation. Then, the selection of
    metrics becomes a matter of how much traffic a system is allowed to create and
    how high requirements to the reliability of the information one has. A proposal
    for such an algorithm that utilizes the mentioned aspects has been described and
    evaluated in [48]. 5.7 Summary From this section we learned that the information
    access, the dynamics of the information, and the delay are closely related to
    reliability. Mismatch probability is a probabilistic notion on how certain dynamic
    information accessed remotely is, when being used for whichever purpose. The more
    likely it is that the information is correct, the more likely a correct system
    behaviour will occur. Unless dedicated networks are set up where data can be reliably
    scheduled, future critical infrastructure will have to face such challenges thus
    only probabilities for success can be given, and the cost of deploying networks
    is not to be underestimated as we will look into later in this chapter. 6 Security
    and Threats to Critical Infrastructure Networks are controlled by software, and
    as such they are vulnerable to flawed designs in protocols, implementation bugs,
    exploits and so forth, and every opened communication channel generates principally
    for a possible attack opportunity. In today’s world where for example terrorism
    is in focus, securing networks when used in critical infrastructures is more important
    than ever. Securing networks is a continuous battle against an invisible and sometimes
    unknown enemy, and in war, one of the most fundamental elements for a successful
    defense is to know and understand the enemy. Therefore, in this section we propose
    a framework for analyzing digital hacker threats to critical infrastructures [49,
    50]. As the digital aspect of society and our lives in general becomes ever more
    important, the defence hereof becomes an increasingly higher priority. Billions
    of dollars are spent each year to protect the systems that form the basis for
    our everyday lives against malicious attackers who would steal our data or sabotage
    our critical infrastructures. It is an uneven battle—attackers need to be successful
    only once, while the defenders must be successful every time. Therefore it is
    imperative that we know as much as possible about the potential attackers and
    their methods to be able to prioritize the defence efforts. If we know the potential
    attackers, we are able to predict, detect and manage possible attacks. To do this,
    it is necessary to make a threat assessment for the systems in question [51].
    Threats can be divided into three categories: natural disasters, accidents, and
    attacks. Traditionally, attackers are considered to be the same attackers who
    would attack the installation/system in the physical world (e.g., criminals and
    terrorists), with an added category of “hackers” [52, 53]. However, “hackers”
    is such a loose term that by grouping all attackers into this one category, it
    is very difficult to say anything specific about important threat properties.
    For an assessment of the hacker threat to critical infrastructures to be useful,
    it should have a greater granularity with respect to the attacker identification.
    By dividing the “hacker” category into a number of subcategories, for which we
    can determine specific threat properties, it is possible to give a much more precise
    picture of the threat. We divide the hackers into eight categories: Script kiddies
    Insiders Gray hats Hacktivists Cyber punks Petty thieves Professional criminals
    Nation states. The motivations behind each of the categories of hackers can be
    represented by a circumplex, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Each of these categories
    will be evaluated separately, whether or not they represent a sabotage threat
    against critical infrastructures. In this context, the sabotage is considered
    as reducing or removing the availability of the service provided by the critical
    infrastructure. In terms of cyberattacks, this can be achieved for instance, by
    a malicious use of controls, (Distributed) Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, or
    worms [54]. These are the vectors that will be considered. The threat assessment
    is performed by comparing hacker motives (intent) and capabilities (competencies
    and available resources) [51], with the profile of the targeted critical infrastructure.
    This profile is described widely in the literature, e.g., in [55] and [56], and
    will be summarized in the following section. Obviously, the first step is to generally
    protect the infrastructure, by making sure that it is not vulnerable to common
    security threats. Therefore, in the rest of the section we will assume that appropriate
    action has been taken to ensure this, and we will focus on more advanced/severe
    kind of attacks. Fig. 8 Circumplex illustrating motivations behind each of the
    categories of hackers Full size image Intent: Critical infrastructure is a high-profile
    target that provides critical services to the area it is located in, indicating
    that attackers with Notoriety or Revenge motives would find critical infrastructure
    tempting targets. The return on investment on sabotaging critical infrastructure
    for money is very low because of the high security and the lack of monetary gain,
    so Financial motives are not likely to drive a hacker to this type of attack.
    And while Curiosity might cause an attacker to try and break into critical infrastructure,
    it is unlikely that it would spur the hacker to perform sabotage [57]. Triggers:
    Critical infrastructures, being high-profile targets, do not need any special
    triggers to be attacked. However, since critical infrastructures are often state-run
    and a necessity for a state to run, attackers with revenge motives could be triggered
    to attack at a perceived threat or insult from the government of the state in
    question. Capabilities—skills: Critical infrastructures should be and usually
    are assumed to be protected against common vulnerabilities; the systems are updated
    and protected by security solutions. Therefore it takes either a significant amount
    of very specialized skills to break the defences and/or considerable resources
    [58]. Capabilities—resources: For sabotage of critical infrastructures to be really
    effective, several facilities need to be hit for prolonged periods. This requires
    either huge amounts of resources to be able to hit several systems in parallel
    and sustain attacks, or very specialized skills and insider knowledge to create
    cascading effects between networked systems. Methods: While critical infrastructures
    are generally well protected, no system is completely secure. Critical infrastructures
    are vulnerable to all considered attack vectors (malicious use of controls, DDoS
    attacks, and worms) if the attackers utilize them with enough resources and/or
    skills. Trends: The increased focus on cyber security in the society in general
    also has a positive effect on the security awareness of critical infrastructures.
    One example is that industrial control systems are generally better protected
    after the Stuxnet incident made everyone aware that they are a potential target
    [59]. In the following we will use these threat properties to discuss to which
    extent the different hacker categories have the will and the capabilities to execute
    successful attacks specifically against critical infrastructures. 6.1 Script Kiddies
    Attackers of the Script kiddies category are novices with low hacking skills and
    limited understanding of technical consequences, who use tools or scripts downloaded
    from the internet. Intent: Primary motivations for Script kiddies are notoriety
    and curiosity, and as such critical infrastructure being a high-profile target
    would be attractive, but the tools used by Script kiddies often choose targets
    at random (for example, The Honeynet Project (2004)). Triggers: The only trigger
    Script kiddies need to attack is the opportunity. If they find a vulnerability
    in their random, automated search, they will exploit it. Capabilities—skills:
    Low technical competencies makes it highly improbable that a Script kiddie could
    execute a successful attack against a target with a minimum of up-to-date defences.
    This is expected to exclude critical infrastructures from their targets. Capabilities—resources:
    Having very little resources available and operating solo further decreases the
    probability of a successful attack. Threat assessment: Have the will but lack
    the capabilities. 6.2 Cyber Punks Members of the Cyber punks category are medium-skilled
    but mostly solitary hackers and virus writers. Intent: As primary motivations
    of Cyber punks are notoriety and curiosity, they might target critical infrastructures.
    Triggers: Cyber punks need no trigger to attack. Capabilities—skills: Cyber punks
    have some technical skills and understanding, and they will be able to use and
    even improve tools available on the Internet. A Cyber punk might write their own
    malware exploiting well-known vulnerabilities, but they are not likely to develop
    their own 0-days or perform very advanced attacks. However, some virus writers
    also fall under this category, and a novel virus might compromise one or more
    critical infrastructure systems [60]. It is not likely that systems could be compromised
    in such a manner as to cause cascading failures without being specifically designed
    to do so, but if a worm spreads aggressively enough to infect a large number of
    critical infrastructure systems, then it could cause widespread denial of service.
    Capabilities—resources: Cyber punks have limited resources since they are mostly
    solitary, or in small groups. They are likely to able to perpetrate simple, isolated
    attacks, although nothing sustained or large-scale. Threat assessment: Have the
    will and the capabilities. 6.3 Insiders Insiders are malicious but trusted people
    with privileged access and knowledge of the systems in question. Intent: Insiders
    are motivated by revenge and to some degree notoriety, and the former part makes
    them likely to try to conduct sabotage. Triggers: A malicious Insider mostly needs
    to be triggered to attack, however since the trigger can be any perceived insult
    or slight at the workplace, it can be very hard to determine whether or not a
    potential attacker has been triggered—especially considering that the potential
    attacker is typically a trusted employee. Capabilities—skills: An Insider can
    have extensive knowledge of the systems, including vulnerabilities, as well as
    privileged access to controls. An Insider might even have the skills to perpetrate
    an effective cascading attack. Capabilities—resources: While insiders very often
    work alone, they usually have the resources needed to make an effective attack,
    namely privileged access to controls, and physical access to the systems. Threat
    assessment: Have the will and the capabilities. 6.4 Petty Thieves Members of the
    Petty thieves category commit low-level fraud and theft, usually by using existing
    tools and scripts. Intent: Petty thieves are primarily motivated by financial
    gain, and as such, critical infrastructures do not constitute an attractive target
    to members of this category. Triggers: This group needs no other trigger than
    opportunity and a viable business case to attack. Capabilities—skills: Petty thieves
    use a standard portfolio of tools and techniques primarily focused around phishing,
    scamming, and credit card fraud. They are not likely to possess the skill set
    nor the tools needed to attack critical infrastructures. Capabilities—resources:
    Members of this group work alone or in small groups, and considering their focus
    on low-level crime, it is not likely they will have the resources needed to commit
    a successful attack. Threat assessment: Lack the will and the capabilities. 6.5
    Grey Hats Grey hats are often skilful hackers with limited criminal intent but
    a lack of respect for limitation on information flow and a large curiosity. Intent:
    This category of attackers is primarily motivated by curiosity, and they are very
    unlikely to perpetrate any form of sabotage. Triggers: Rumors of secret information
    or “impenetrable” defences might increase the risk of attack. Capabilities—skills:
    Grey hat hackers have very specialized technical skill sets and an extensive exchange
    of information, and as such it is likely they would be able to execute an attack
    successfully. Capabilities—resources: While there is a high degree of knowledge
    exchange in this group, most work alone and as such do not have the manpower to
    make widespread and persistent attacks. They do have the skills and equipment
    however, to gain insider access to the systems in question, which could enable
    them to execute a cascading attack. Threat assessment: Lack the will but have
    the capabilities. 6.6 Professional Criminals Professional criminals are organised
    groups of hackers with a strict business approach to attacks. Intent: Professional
    criminals are purely financially motivated. There is currently no business model
    that makes the reward of an infrastructure attack worth the risk, since most governments
    do no negotiate with terrorists, so they are unlikely to attack. Triggers: Like
    Petty thieves, the Professional criminals need no specific trigger apart from
    a viable business case. Capabilities—skills: Members of this group of attackers
    possess a wide variety of technical skills and knowledge, and they are willing
    to recruit or hire people with the necessary competencies to complete an operation.
    Capabilities—resources: This group has many resources in the form of money, equipment,
    and manpower—enough to perpetrate a successful attack against critical infrastructures.
    Threat assessment: Lack the will but have the capabilities. 6.7 Hacktivists Hacktivists
    are groups of ideologically motivated hackers with varying technical skills, but
    many and geographically distributed members. Intent: Since Hacktivists are motivated
    by ideological agendas and notoriety and known for a lack of regard for consequences,
    they are likely to target critical infrastructures. The US Department of Defense
    warns that it believes one of the biggest hacktivist groups, Anonymous, have both
    the will and the capability to perform such an attack [61]. However, Anonymous
    have publicly declared [62], that they are not interested in attacking the power
    grid because they realize the adverse effect it would have on the general population,
    and as such the intent in this regard is not completely clear. There are many
    groups, though, and not all of them have the same moral scruples as Anonymous
    claims to have. On the other hand, they do not alone have the necessary resources
    available. Triggers: Hacktivists are triggered by perceived threats or insults
    to their ideology. Capabilities—skills: While the levels of technical skills are
    diverse within the Hacktivist groupings, they usually have members with high technical
    competencies, although they might not have the highly specialized skills needed
    for a cascading attack. Capabilities—resources: Hacktivists have a large geographical
    spread and sometimes vast amounts of manpower. They may also have the attack resources
    in the form of botnets available to execute a widespread and sustained attack.
    However, only Anonymous is big enough at this point in time to conduct a sustained
    attack, and they have declared a lack of interest in doing so. This is subject
    to change though. Threat assessment: Have the will or the capabilities, but not
    both. 6.8 Nation States Nation states or representatives hereof have been known
    to perpetrate everything from industrial espionage over acts of terrorism to devastating
    nation-wide attacks in the cyber arena. Intent: In case of a conflict, any disruption
    of the enemy’s infrastructure is desirable, and as such, critical infrastructures
    represent an extremely attractive target to a hostile Nation state. Triggers:
    Nation states are almost exclusively triggered by disputes in the physical arena,
    most often geopolitical in nature. Capabilities—skills: Many nation states have
    substantial presence in cyberspace and commands many highly skilled experts in
    the critical infrastructure field. Capabilities—resources: They have vast resources
    in the form of money, manpower, specialized knowledge and intelligence, and equipment.
    They are very likely to be able to conduct a successful attack. Threat assessment:
    Have the will and the capabilities. 6.9 Threat Picture Three of the hacker categories—Insiders,
    Hacktivists, and Nation states, see Table 1—can be considered a substantial sabotage
    threat to critical infrastructures at present time, but this is subject to change.
    Currently, only these three categories have both the will and the capabilities
    to execute a successful attack on critical infrastructures. Table 1 Threat matrix
    indicating will and capabilities of attackers Full size table 6.10 Defence Priorities
    Working to defend critical infrastructure in a resource-constrained environment
    means that limited budget funds must be applied to achieve the best effect. While
    the thorough “basic” security is assumed in place, there are many areas in which
    security officers could focus their attention. Cyber punks methods: While most
    of the attacks performed by this category of attackers are limited in scope and
    sophistication, the Cyber punks do have one weapon that is a legitimate sabotage
    threat to critical infrastructures, namely viruses. A worm exploiting an unanticipated
    attack vector might plausibly infect several of critical infrastructure systems
    and causing widespread denial of service. Viruses such as Melissa (1999), ILOVEYOU
    (2000), Nimda (2001), Slammer (2003), and Conficker (2008) (most contributable
    to Cyber punks) show that it is certainly possible to reach a critical amount
    of infection in a very short while. To defend against such a worm may prove difficult;
    see Wiley, Brandon (circa 2002). An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System
    (IDPS) that uses statistical anomaly-based detection and/or stateful protocol
    analysis detection would have a good chance of catching such a threat, and there
    are different ways of hardening the network, depending on how fast the worm propagates
    [63, 64]. Insider methods: Attacks by Insiders will likely take the form of malicious
    use of controls. Based on the [65], 43 % of Insider attacks were executed while
    the attacker still had legitimate access to the systems. The majority of Insider
    attacks were, however, executed while the attacker should no longer have the access.
    The defence mechanisms that would help defend against such attacks should be based
    on the principle of least privilege in order to limit the amount of damage that
    can be done with malicious use of legitimate access. Also, having tight management
    of personnel access would limit the amount of damage previous employees could
    cause, since they would lose access as soon as they were no longer employed. More
    detailed advice on how to mitigate the threat of Insider attacks can be found
    in [66]. Nation state methods: The methods employed by Nation states vary, but
    there seems to be a prevalence towards spear-phishing and zero-day exploits combined
    with worms (e.g., Night Dragon and Stuxnet attacks) as well as devastating DDoS
    attacks (e.g., Georgia, 66, and 10 Days of Rain). Defence priorities include educating
    staff and increasing awareness to avoid anyone falling victim to spear-fishing
    or similar social engineering attacks. It is in the nature of things quite difficult
    to detect the use of zero-day exploits, but good intrusion detection systems might
    be able to pick up the change in network behaviour. DDoS prevention should also
    be a priority, and the volume of the attacks can be expected to be severe, so
    cooperation with for instance large ISPs might be an option to consider. 6.11
    Summary Based on the threat picture described in this section, defence efforts
    against digital sabotage of critical infrastructures should focus on dealing with
    malicious Insiders as well as Cyber punks, and hostile Nation states. This could
    be done by prioritizing access management, including implementing the principle
    of least privilege, as well as installing an Intrusion Detection and Prevention
    System, educating staff to be wary of spear-phishing and similar social engineering
    attacks, and protecting systems from DDoS attacks. Defence efforts should be particularly
    focused in times of geopolitical conflict, where the risk of a Nation state attack
    is high. Furthermore, an eye should be kept on the development in the Hacktivist
    category, since there is a risk that this group will develop into a threat in
    the near future. The analysis presented can also be used when designing and deploying
    new infrastructures such as Smart Grid, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and
    infrastructures supporting Tele-Health in larger scales. Knowing which groups
    are the most probable attackers, and knowing their capabilities in terms of skills
    and resources, can help identify which kinds of attacks are important to prepare
    for. There is a big difference between being attacked by Insiders, Nation states,
    or Script kiddies. For researchers in the domain of cyber security this knowledge
    can be used to indicate where further research and development is needed, e.g.,
    when developing technologies for intrusion detection systems for general or specific
    critical infrastructures. 7 Previous and Ongoing Research Activities The purpose
    of this section is not to provide an elaborate list of projects, but give a short
    overview of some of the activities that have been carried out, are running or
    will be running in the near future, at European level in the area of communication
    role in Critical infrastructures and related topics. For more details, the reader
    should visit the IST website: http://www.ist-world.org/ or http://www.cordis.europa.eu/ist/.
    7.1 Brief Overview of Selected Projects and Activities CRUTIAL This project, which
    ran from 2006–2008, has focused on key issues related to trust establishment,
    access control and fault diagnosis for critical infrastructures. Inspired by Intrusion
    tolerant system architecture, CRUTIAL is based on two facts; Critical Information
    Infrastructure features a lot of existing legacy systems, and two existing security
    solutions may jeopardize operational and functional requirements to critical infrastructure
    systems. Key components in their architecture are (1) configuration aspects, (2)
    middleware for automatic fault tolerance inclusive intrusion, (3) trustworthy
    monitoring mechanism, (4) security and access policy management and enforcement.
    MAFTIA was a project running between 2000–2003, focusing on fault and intrusion
    tolerance network support for critical infrastructure systems. The project aimed
    to develop an architecture based on hybrid failure assumptions, recursive use
    of fault prevention and fault tolerance techniques, and the notion of trusting
    components to the extent of their trustworthiness. MAFTIA distinguishes between
    attacks, vulnerabilities, and intrusions as three types of interrelated faults.
    Selected system components were implemented and validated through a set of text
    scenarios with success. HIDENETS The aim of HIDENETS, running from 2006 to 2008,
    was to develop and analyse end-to-end resilience solutions for distributed applications
    and mobility-aware services in ubiquitous communication scenarios. The idea has
    been to make use of off-the-shelf components and wireless communication links
    to dramatically decrease the costs of market entry and enable ubiquitous scenarios
    of ad hoc car-to-car communication with infrastructure service support commercially
    feasible. Dependability has been a keyword in this project, and many of the lessons
    learned here will be beneficial to critical infrastructure communication systems.
    GRIDCOMP GridComp main goal was to design and implement a component based framework
    suitable to support the development of efficient grid applications. Such frameworks
    are important since the automation and complexity of critical infrastructures
    makes it necessary to have a structural way of developing software components
    and middleware on top of networks. The key feature of the developed framework
    was its level of abstraction perceived by programmers by hierarchically composable
    components and advanced, interactive/integrated development environments. The
    framework was supposed to allow a faster and more effective grid application development
    process by considering advanced component (self-) management features. NESSI-GRID
    The objective of this project was to contribute to the activities of the Networked
    European Software and Service Initiative (NESSI) with special focus on next generation
    Grid technologies; Services not necessarily only for user interaction, but also
    for critical subsystems. The aspect regarding services in the communication infrastructure
    and inter operability is not trivial, and it was expected that output of this
    activity would be aligned with that of Service Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU)
    as defined by the Next Generation Grid expert group. INTEGRIS A project which
    has run since 2010 and ended in 2012, addressing a novel and flexible ICT infrastructure
    based on a hybrid power line communication/wireless integrated communication system
    for smart electricity grids. The project covers monitoring, operation, customer
    integration, demand side management, voltage control, quality of service control
    and control of distributed energy resources. On the communication side, in particular
    interoperability of the power line communication, wireless sensor networks and
    radio frequency identification are in focus. REALSMART This project, running from
    2010 to 2014, aims to look at smart grid solutions. From a communication point
    of view, the solutions sought in this project relate to measurement collection
    procedures for phasor measurements to allow an improved observation of the transmission
    grid. Among other questions that need to be addressed, is the handling of the
    massive amounts of real time data that are to be collected. EDGE EDGE is a Danish
    funded project running from 2012 to 2017, which aims to develop complex control
    algorithms for smart grid systems based on power flexibility from consumers. The
    role of the communication in this project is in particular on the interaction
    between these advanced control algorithms and strategies and the network dynamics
    that exist in heterogenous networks. SmartC2Net This project is a new smart grid
    project starting in the last part of 2012 until 2015. This project aims to provide
    an ICT platform that supports flexible interaction possibilities between control
    algorithms and strategies, and the physical entities distributed in the power
    grid. This entails information reliability models, flexible reconfiguration of
    the network, control strategy based QoS control, network monitoring and security
    threat analysis. 7.2 Summary A common denominator of all these projects is the
    focus of ICT and its role in the various aspects of critical applications that
    run over the network. As investigated in this part, this is necessary as networks
    are complex, and far from perfect. In most cases, and in particular for large
    scaled, general purpose networks (e.g., the Internet) only probabilistic guarantees
    can be given, which may or may not be sufficient for the critical applications.
    Projects such as CRUTIAL, MAFTIA and HIDENETS focus to a large extent on the dependability
    of services in the network infrastructure, which all concerns both reliability
    and availability in a distributed setting elements. Availability and security
    is strongly linked. These are key elements when supporting critical infrastructures,
    and surely lessons learned here will in some way find the way in future networks.
    Projects such as GRIDCOMP and NESSI-GRID focus also on service interaction and
    interoperability as well as on how programmers can integrate software solutions.
    This is absolutely a key feature for reliable operation of networks, since as
    also seen in many of the other projects, middleware and software components in
    the network will play a key role in future critical networks. Finally, projects
    such as INTEGRIS, EDGE and SmartC2Net aim specifically to address the interaction
    between control algorithms for smart grids and the network. For the network, the
    running application behaviour is critical, as this sets the requirements to the
    network that provides the end-to-end communication. Therefore, understanding the
    interaction between application and network is critical, and is manifested to
    some degree in the need for such projects. These examples as well as the other
    non-European efforts, national projects and initiatives, provides valuable insight
    in the challenges and solutions of using the existing network for critical applications.
    At the end this benefits to save costs for redeployment of dedicated networks
    to each critical application that exists. This makes it necessary to explore and
    spend funding on research to achieve a reliable communication infrastructure.
    8 Conclusions and Outlook Communication networks are complex and pose a challenge
    to distributed systems, and although these networks offers great advantages of
    cheap exchange of information for various purposes, it is critical not to under
    estimate the role communication plays in distributed applications. In particular
    not for critical infrastructures which require communication due to their distributed
    nature. The complexity and dynamics of the networks are challenged at all levels.
    Through this chapter, we looked at basic communication, standards for smart grids,
    network deployment, reliability of protocols, security and threats, and also gave
    a brief overview of what type of research is or has been ongoing at a European
    level to address the issues that need to be tackled for networks to support critical
    infrastructures. References Future Internet 2020: Visions of an Industry Expert

  description: 'Like natural ecosystems, the cyber ecosystem comprises a variety of
    diverse participants - private firms, non-profits, governments, individuals, processes,
    and cyber devices (computers, software, and communications technologies) - that
    interact for multiple purposes. Today in cyberspace, intelligent adversaries exploit
    vulnerabilities and create incidents that propagate at machine speeds to steal
    identities, resources, and advantage. The rising volume and virulence of these
    attacks have the potential to degrade our economic capacity and threaten basic
    services that underpin our modern way of life. This discussion paper explores
    the idea of a healthy, resilient - and fundamentally more secure - cyber ecosystem
    of the future, in which cyber participants, including cyber devices, are able
    to work together in near-real time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit
    the spread of attacks across participating devices, minimize the consequences
    of attacks, and recover to a trusted state. In this future cyber ecosystem, security
    capabilities are built into cyber devices in a way that allows preventive and
    defensive courses of action to be coordinated within and among communities of
    devices. Power is distributed among participants, and near-real time coordination
    is enabled by combining the innate and interoperable capabilities of individual
    devices with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies.
    To illuminate such a cyber ecosystem in action, one might look at today''s practice
    known as “continuous monitoring,” in which system managers use a variety of software
    products to automatically detect and report known security vulnerabilities in
    network nodes. In some cases, system managers further configure their systems
    to automatically remediate detected security deficiencies. To offer an analogy,
    continuous monitoring is to a healthy cyber ecosystem as smoke detectors and sprinkler
    systems are to a “smart” building. At the other end of sophistication in the orderly
    management of a complex system, we draw inspiration from the human body''s immune
    system. To paint a picture that mirrors the body''s ability to defend itself is
    complex. It might include layered defenses and countermeasures that work in tandem;
    specialized roles; powerful methods for rapidly identifying attackers; surge capabilities;
    and the ability to learn and rapidly adapt. A companion analogy may be made to
    the public health system and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    Here, cyber equivalent functions might include threat and incident watch, data
    dissemination, threat analysis, intervention recommendations, and coordination
    of preventive actions. Automation is one of three interdependent building blocks
    of a healthy cyber ecosystem, along with interoperability and authentication.
    Automation can increase speed of action, optimize decision making, and ease adoption
    of new security solutions. A healthy cyber ecosystem might employ an automation
    strategy of fixed, local defenses supported by mobile and global defenses at multiple
    levels. Such a strategy could enable the cyber ecosystem to sustain itself and
    supported missions while fighting through attacks. Further, it could enable the
    ecosystem to continuously strengthen itself against the cyber equivalent of autoimmune
    disorders. Interoperability can broaden and strengthen collaboration, create new
    intelligence, hasten and spread learning, and improve situational awareness. This
    paper posits three types of interoperability - semantic (i.e., shared lexicon
    based on common understanding), technical, and policy - as fundamental to integrating
    disparate cyber participants into a comprehensive cyber defense system. It examines
    how the cybersecurity community has achieved some early successes by explicitly
    separating the management of security information from the management of security
    functions in an approach called security content automation. Such successes include:
    developing naming conventions and shared lists and catalogs of the fundamental
    elements that we identify here as the ecosystem; creating and using machine readable
    languages and formats for expressing security policies or encoding security transactions;
    and developing and using knowledge repositories for best practices, benchmarks,
    profiles, standards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules and principles,
    among others. The paper also looks at some challenges associated with expanding
    this approach to ensure a widely distributed, automated, collective defense. Authentication
    can improve trust in ways that enhance privacy and decision making. It is integral
    to many capabilities beyond cyber defense, and the paper looks to the emerging
    National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), detailed below,
    to build a shared foundation. The paper calls for identification and authentication
    technologies that deliver across five operational objectives: security, affordability,
    ease of use and administration, scalability, and interoperability. Additionally,
    the paper calls for consumer guides that rate technologies across all five objectives
    and assist system developers and owners in making phased improvements and selections.
    For automated cyber defense, it calls for strong standards-based device authentication,
    including for software, handheld devices, and small, often wireless, devices composing
    massively scalable grids. The paper also draws on current research on network-enabled
    enterprises that is recasting traditional notions of command and control in the
    direction of focus and convergence. Focus provides the context and defines the
    purposes of an endeavor, but is agnostic regarding who might be in charge or particular
    lines of authority. Convergence refers to the goal-seeking process that guides
    actions and effects, but recognizes that control works in an unconventional manner
    in highly distributed systems. The paper presents a five-level maturity model
    for ecosystem focus and convergence that is associated with increasing agility
    and provides an approach for defining how to achieve and employ these various
    levels. Ecosystem maturity is further explored through a discussion of healthy
    attributes-eight for the ecosystem and eighteen for participants and exchanges.
    The paper concludes with a brief discussion of incentives and recommendations
    for the way ahead. It posits that the slow adoption of available best practices
    and technologies in the face of increasing cyber attacks indicates an imbalance
    of incentives and proposes that better and more widely disseminated aggregated
    and anonymized information about the frequency and actual harm of cyber attacks
    is needed. Despite the many open questions remaining, the field is ripe for planning
    and action.'

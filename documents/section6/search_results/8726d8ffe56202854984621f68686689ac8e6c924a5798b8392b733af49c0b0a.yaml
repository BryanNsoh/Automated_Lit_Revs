    The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) involves a network in which computing
    devices, Items, Automated systems, animals, and humans are linked together. Each
    element is equipped with unique identifiers and has the capacity to effortlessly
    exchange information across a system, eliminating the necessity for direct interaction
    between humans or human-computer engagement [1]. Agricultural IoT is a network
    that connects various physical elements including animals, plants, the environment,
    production equipment, and virtual objects in agriculture. It enables communication
    over the internet using agricultural information sensing devices and specific
    protocols. By enabling effective identification, location, tracking, and monitoring,
    its aim is to ensure intelligent management of agricultural elements and processes.
    The interconnection of \"man-machine-object\" in agricultural IoT enhances the
    management of agricultural elements, processes, systems, and the understanding
    of essential aspects of the lives of animals and plants. Moreover, it facilitates
    the management of agricultural emergencies and complex agricultural systems [2].
    In the agriculture sector, IoT applications play a pivotal role, as depicted in
    Fig. 1. These applications encompass soil monitoring to enhance crop growth, efficient
    irrigation, and fertilizer management. Nutrient optimization is crucial to reduce
    the environmental impact by addressing the soil and plant nutrient requirements.
    Crop monitoring, facilitated by sensors and IoT, supports informed decision-making
    regarding pest control, irrigation, and harvesting. Agricultural product storage
    techniques aid in preserving crops and preventing losses. Smart irrigation improves
    the accuracy of crop watering, reduces water wastage, and promotes sustainability.
    Precision agriculture employs drones and sensors for field mapping and precise
    input application. Finally, IoT automates livestock management, including feeding
    and health data collection. Collectively, these IoT applications enhance agricultural
    efficiency, sustainability, profitability, and global food security [3]. Fig.

    image The utilization of agricultural data hosted in the cloud as digital evidence
    is set to streamline administrative processes in agriculture in the future. Smart
    tractors leverage GPS for precise steering and optimal route planning, reducing
    soil erosion and saving fuel. Farmers now have the ability to gain in-depth insights
    into their fields through the use of agricultural drones equipped with advanced
    sensors and cutting-edge imagery. These sensors also monitor livestock health
    and provide alerts aimed at enhancing dairy production, as depicted in Fig. 2
    [4]. Fig. 2. The Future of Intelligent Farming Full size image The integration
    of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence (AIoT) in the field of aquaculture
    has led to the development of smart systems. These systems enhance responsiveness
    and early warnings by monitoring water quality and weather conditions. They have
    the capability to connect their equipment to smart electrical boxes for controlling
    water wheels, pumps, and other power equipment. Utilizing sensors and power data,
    an AIoT system promotes more precise and intelligent aquaculture. This integration
    results in reduced energy consumption, stabilized water quality, decreased labor
    dependency, and precise feeding, ultimately leading to improved aquaculture productivity.
    Furthermore, this approach reduces risks associated with disasters and damages,
    maximizing the benefits of aquaculture. In summary, the IoT and AI significantly
    contribute to the efficiency and sustainability of the aquaculture industry [5].
    The core issue of this study revolves around exploring the opportunities presented
    by current technologies, specifically the (IoT) and (AI), to optimize the integration
    of existing data. This process aims to enhance water quality monitoring, improve
    fish health, ensure more effective environmental management, optimize agricultural
    operations, and streamline fish stock management while bolstering operational
    efficiency within the context of aquaculture establishments in Morocco. The ultimate
    objective of this endeavor is to stimulate an increase in high-quality fish production
    while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the aquaculture industry. This
    must be accomplished in the face of increasingly stringent environmental constraints
    and growing demand. In essence, the fundamental question we seek to answer is
    as follows: How can we optimize the incorporating of IoT and AI technologies with
    existing data to monitor, regulate, and enhance water quality in Moroccan aquaculture
    facilities, all the while increasing the production of quality fish and securing
    the industry''s viability amidst evolving environmental challenges and dynamic

    temperature, humidity, water quality, etc., by transmitting this data instantly.
    AI steps in to analyze this information for precise and swift decision-making,
    such as adjusting irrigation or regulating water quality. Furthermore, it contributes
    to optimizing the use of resources like water and fertilizers, tailoring them
    to the actual needs of crops or fish. This approach results in reduced costs and
    minimized environmental impacts through the automation of agricultural tasks via
    IoT. Finally, AI enables autonomous process management, reducing dependence on
    human labor and ensuring product quality monitoring throughout the entire production
    process, from the farm to the consumer''s table, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig.

    that meet the specific needs of the agricultural and aquacultural sectors. This
    forward-looking research direction is expected to generate crucial knowledge,
    improved methodologies, and innovative tools, contributing positively and sustainably
    to shaping the future of these industries. 4.2 The Obstacles and Limitations of
    IoT in Farming The agricultural sector faces limitations such as the scarcity
    of natural resources like water and arable land, as well as budget constraints
    for purchasing seeds and agricultural equipment. Additionally, the lack of access
    to advanced agricultural technologies hampers production efficiency, while government
    regulations on land and chemical usage add further restrictions. Seasonal fluctuations
    and unpredictable weather conditions also pose obstacles to production, as does
    the deficiency in training and skills within the agricultural sector, reducing
    productivity. Moreover, the aging rural population limits the available agricultural
    workforce, and the lack of adequate infrastructure, such as roads and product
    markets, hinders crop commercialization. The IoT equipment deployed in farming
    and fish farming are specifically designed to collect meaningful data on various
    environmental and operational parameters. This data is of crucial importance for
    improving agricultural practices, optimizing aquaculture management, and increasing
    crop and livestock productivity. However, despite the potential benefits they
    offer, IoT-based agricultural systems face issues and limitations that need to
    be overcome for broader and more effective adoption. These devices provide valuable
    information on various parameters to enhance agricultural practices and boost
    crop productivity. Nevertheless, they continue to encounter obstacles and limitations
    that must be addressed. The primary challenges hindering the adoption of smart
    agricultural applications include, as depicted in Fig. 5, various types of obstacles
    [20]. Fig. 5. Challenges in the implementation of IoT in smart farming. Full size
    image 5 Conclusion In summary, the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized
    agriculture by improving production, reducing costs, enhancing environmental sustainability,
    and ensuring food product traceability. This technology has already transformed
    how farmers manage their operations, delivering tangible benefits in terms of
    efficiency and profitability. This article explored specialized literature focusing
    on technologies and applications in current IoT-connected agriculture. It assessed
    challenges and technologies in agriculture and aquaculture spanning from 2018
    to 2023, forecasting the role of IoT in farming''s future. Seizing this opportunity
    could result in lower labor costs and increased efficiency in producing high-quality
    food. However, the future of IoT in agriculture appears even more promising with
    the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). This combination will further
    enhance precision, sustainability, and the automation of smart agriculture, while
    potentially reducing labor costs and improving the quality and efficiency of food
    production. The next article will explore how integrating IoT and AI technologies
    with existing data can be used to monitor, control, and improve water quality
    in aquaculture fish farms. The authors have already achieved impressive and efficient
    results in these technologies, with the potential for further real-time improvements
    to address identified challenges. References Jebari, H., Mechkouri, M.H., Rekiek,

  description: Sensor applications have become ubiquitous in modern society as the
    digital age continues to advance. AI-based techniques (e.g., machine learning)
    are effective at extracting actionable information from large amounts of data.
    An example would be an automated water irrigation system that uses AI-based techniques
    on soil quality data to decide how to best distribute water. However, these AI-based
    techniques are costly in terms of hardware resources, and Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    sensors are resource-constrained with respect to processing power, energy, and
    storage capacity. These limitations can compromise the security, performance,
    and reliability of sensor-driven applications. To address these concerns, cloud
    computing services can be used by sensor applications for data storage and processing.
    Unfortunately, cloud-based sensor applications that require real-time processing,
    such as medical applications (e.g., fall detection and stroke prediction), are
    vulnerable to issues such as network latency due to the sparse and unreliable
    networks between the sensor nodes and the cloud server [1]. As users approach
    the edge of the communications network, latency issues become more severe and
    frequent. A promising alternative is edge computing, which provides cloud-like
    capabilities at the edge of the network by pushing storage and processing capabilities
    from centralized nodes to edge devices that are closer to where the data are gathered,
    resulting in reduced network delays [2], [3].

    challenges associated with transferring data to the cloud, such as data privacy
    and communication overheads. Conversely, Local Learning is an alternative where
    we train the machine learning models directly on the devices where the data are
    hosted using their own local computing resources (Fig. 1b), Since data are not
    shared among clients or with the server, local learning solves the privacy and
    communication overhead issues of centralized learning. However, local learning
    alone can struggle with machine learning bias. This is an emergent problem since
    data at these devices are often non-independent and identically distributed (iid).
    For instance, many data patterns sensors collect are geographically-related. Thus,
    sensors from different locations will likely collect different types of data.
    Learning independently can result in models that do not generalize well which
    can afflict the knowledge extraction across the entire system. A third alternative
    is to apply the recent Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for distributed learning
    (Fig. 1c). FL is a distributed machine learning technique that enables multiple
    clients (e.g., mobile devices, IoT devices) to collaboratively train a shared
    global model without needing their raw data transmitted to the cloud. Instead,
    local models are trained on each client using their own data, similar to local
    learning. Where FL diverges from local learning is that the server will periodically
    collect model updates from the client devices and “average” them to update the
    global model, which is then redistributed to the client devices for further training.
    FL has shown to work well in the face of non-iid data distributions which are
    common in sensor applications. Therefore, FL is a promising solution for several
    challenges associated with decentralized machine learning, such as data privacy,
    communication efficiency, scalability, data unavailability or heterogeneity, system
    heterogeneity in terms of computation power, storage, and energy availability,
    computation efficiency, and better model performance [4], [5]. Standard FL may
    incur high communication costs as the model updates need to be shared with the
    central server, creating an interesting trade-off when considering that centralized
    training requires that all data be shared with the central server (Fig. 2a). In
    cases where the communication between the sensors and the central server is very
    poor (i.e., low data transfer rate, unreliable connection), this can be a significant
    challenge. Such overhead can affect individual sensor life and the overall performance
    of the application, especially if the sensor application has power constraints
    and limited connectivity [6]. One possible solution is to expand the infrastructure
    and use hierarchical FL. Under hierarchical FL, there are additional aggregation
    nodes that may have stronger connections to the nearby sensors. These aggregation
    nodes also participate in additional levels of aggregation to make sure knowledge
    is learned throughout the entire system. Hierarchical FL overcomes some of these
    issues by allowing data to remain on the edge devices, such as sensors and smart
    devices. It enables optimization of computational and communication overheads
    that can be customized to suit the needs of specific applications and networks.
    Fig. 1. Comparison of (a) Centralized, (b) Local, and (c) Federated learning architectures.
    Federated learning enables collaborative learning among multiple edge devices
    without compromising data privacy. Centralized learning relies on a central server
    to train a global model on data from all devices, while local learning trains
    multiple local models on disjoint subsets of data. Show All Fig. 2. Illustration
    of (a) Standard federated learning (FL) and (b) Hierarchical federated learning
    and their interaction between lot devices, edge and cloud servers. The aggregation
    nodes are where the local model updates from the participating devices or intermediary
    nodes are combined to form a global model. Show All Different approaches of hierarchical
    FL can be employed by making use of available networking hubs and structures,
    such as a cloud server that is accessed over the internet and an edge server,
    which is a computer server that is located closer to the devices that it serves
    at the network edge (Fig. 2b). One option is to aggregate models within a cloud
    server, while other options can involve hierarchical aggregation at the edge server
    which sends the model updates to the cloud for further aggregation or storage.
    This allows local processing power and storage capacity to perform distributed
    learning without relying solely on a central server, resulting in improved scalability,
    reduced latency and privacy preservation of sensitive data. While hierarchical
    FL has shown potential in various domains, including precision agriculture and
    environmental monitoring, [4] points out that very few production FL applications
    have been reported, with most work being proof-of-concept prototypes. The paradigm
    itself is relatively new and its implementation requires careful consideration
    of various issues such as data inequality [7], [8] and malicious attacks [9]–[11].
    Another important challenge to overcome with FL is the cost of adoption and the
    incentives to incorporate FL into existing systems. In FL, devices must contribute
    their computational resources and data to train a model. However, some organizations
    may be reluctant to participate in a large FL endeavor due to the computational
    resources needed to participate and data transfer and communication costs. Furthermore,
    there may not be the right incentives to join if a benefit from the global model''s
    performance is not properly recognized. For example, an industry leader may be
    less incentivized to adopt multi-organizational FL if they are already the primary
    source of data as their marginal benefit would be significantly lower. To address
    these challenges, various methods have been proposed to incentivize participation
    in FL. These methods include providing monetary or non-monetary rewards for contributing
    data, ensuring that the global model''s performance benefits all participants,
    and providing greater control over the use of data by participants. For example,
    [12] proposed a reward-based mechanism that provides tokens to devices that contribute
    data to the FL model, which can then be used to purchase services or products.
    Authors in [13] propose a privacy-preserving FL model that allows participants
    to retain control over their data and provides incentives for contributing high-quality
    data. In this article, we present a case study of the feasibility and benefits
    of FL for precision agricultural spraying and extend it to a larger conceptual
    hierarchical FL architecture for smart farming. We also discuss ongoing efforts
    to improve hierarchical FL systems using standardized quality frameworks to systematically
    identify and prioritize the efforts. Finally, we cover open problems associated
    with this technology and highlight its potential to transform numerous domains
    such as precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and smart
    infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a roadmap for further development of hierarchical
    FL in instrumentation and measurement. Federated Learning for Precision Spraying
    In the previous section, we discussed the different types of learning architectures
    that can be applied to edge devices. In this section, we present a case study
    involving precision spraying in agriculture (Fig. 3) to highlight the benefits
    of FL. Traditional spraying methods often apply pesticides uniformly across an
    entire field, leading to waste and potential harm to crops. In contrast, precision
    spraying uses cameras, optical sensors, and GPS receivers to provide accurate
    location data, enabling robots to apply spray only where necessary. However, the
    advanced data processing and machine learning required for precision spraying
    can be resource-intensive, making it challenging to perform all operations on
    the sensor or robot alone. Data collected from sensors can be processed using
    cloud computing relying on connectivity, but this can be a challenge in remote
    environments. By relying on computational resources at the edge server, data can
    be processed in real-time or limited-time to accelerate the decision-making process.
    FL can further improve spray precision by enabling learning from different data
    sources (e.g., across different locations with different distributions of plant/weed
    species) while preserving data privacy and security. This is particularly important
    for farmers who are concerned about data privacy and potential cyberattacks. Furthermore,
    FL can be flexibly performed on a network of edge devices potentially of different
    types, which can scale up or down to meet the needs of different agricultural
    operations, making it a valuable tool for precision spraying. Fig. 3. Precision
    spraying prototype using edge federated learning. Show All In this feasibility
    study, we limit the discussion to a single source of information, which is a near-infrared
    hyperspectral imaging system that is used to guide the operations of a mobile
    precision pesticide spraying robot at each of the three pasture sites (Site A,
    B and C). Each robot processes the input information using a local machine learning
    model (e.g., an image classifier implemented by a Convolutional Neural Network).
    The intent is to have the robot apply spray to a plant only if the plant is classified
    as a weed, ensuring minimal impact on crops. Storing a machine learning model
    locally ensures that spray operations can continue in areas without network coverage.
    Although the local model is trained using local data (∼71 Megabytes), it periodically
    receives updates (∼0.04 Megabytes) from the server via FL to incorporate knowledge
    learned from other pasture sites. With FL, communication is significantly reduced
    from 71 Megabytes to 0.04 Megabytes. Different forms of computation resources
    reside in each pasture site, with the model potentially being trained on the robot
    using single-board computational devices such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
    The locally-trained models from each pasture site are then aggregated using Federated
    Averaging [14], a popular aggregation algorithm in FL. The pasture sites are interconnected
    using communication infrastructure for sharing information and enabling FL. The
    dataset used during our evaluation consisted of four labelled classes: three species
    of pastoral weed and a background class of grass (Table 1). The evaluation results
    for our case study with different machine learning methods are shown in Fig. 4,
    whereby FL achieves 96% accuracy. This result is comparable to centralized learning
    where all the data are present, and a marked improvement compared to local learning
    where only local data are present. Our result confirms that FL is capable of addressing
    the dilemma between network latency, bandwidth limitations, data privacy and data
    sharing while providing comparable model performance. Table 1 Pasture Image dataset
    with imbalanced class distributions and disparate volumes of data across sites
    A Hierarchical Federated Learning Architecture for Smart Farrning We now consider
    broadening the precision spraying use case to a larger conceptual hierarchical
    FL architecture for smart farming. Precision agriculture often involves gathering
    heterogeneous data from various sensors within a farm. By leveraging FL, farmers
    can benefit from insights gained from other farms without compromising the privacy
    of their own raw data. This will enable them to enhance crop yields and minimize
    wastage. Fig. 5 illustrates the physical, cyber and networked (interconnected)
    view of a precision agriculture robot at work. Fig. 5a shows the “physical world”
    where the robot has sensors on board and navigates to perform tasks such as harvesting,
    weeding, and spraying. Fig. 5b represents the “cyber world” where the robot processes
    input information from its sensors using a local machine learning model to perform
    high priority tasks that must continue even when the communication fails (i.e.,
    navigation). The robot also monitors the quality of service for communication
    and decides whether to pass on further information or receive information from
    the cloud. Fig. 5c is the “interconnected world” where a group of robots is connected
    via a communication infrastructure for FL to share knowledge and improve their
    respective local machine learning models based on collective learned experiences.
    The types of sensor systems used for smart farming are heterogeneous. For example,
    a smart farm may rely heavily on IoT sensors and cameras to collect and process
    data related to soil quality and plant visual information. Additionally, smart
    farms may use multiple data sources to optimize farming operations. These data
    sources may include historical data, real-time sensor data, and publicly available
    data to predict soil water levels and future weather patterns with machine learning
    models. Fig. 6 illustrates an example of a hierarchical FL architecture for smart
    farming to train lightweight machine learning models on edge devices. Fig. 4.

    learning approaches trained on dataset described in table 1. Show All Fig. 5.

    of a hierarchical federated learning architecture for smart farming. Show All
    In this example, the architecture uses Apache Kafka, a popular distributed event
    streaming platform. Kafka is used to collect data from IoT devices and sensors
    located at the edge of the network, enabling real-time processing and response
    to changing conditions. Instead of waiting for large amounts of data to be collected
    and sent to a remote, central server, data streaming enables the sensor devices
    to transmit the local models to the edge servers in real-time—thus reducing latency
    and facilitating more efficient use of available network bandwidth. Hierarchical
    FL allows for adaptive clustering of the edge devices involved in the FL process,
    whereby groups of devices can be divided into smaller clusters for the training
    depending on device availability, scalability and power requirements. By making
    use of Kafka clusters to facilitate communication between the edge devices and
    the FL framework, fault tolerance can be incorporated with multiple brokers running
    on different machines to ensure high availability and data replication. FuncX
    [15] is a federated function-as-a-service platform that enables computation, represented
    as programming functions, to be dispatched for execution on edge resources. FuncX
    is used here to manage the deployment of the machine learning models to the edge
    devices and to invoke the models for inference and training. FuncX uses the Parsl
    [16] parallel programming library to manage the parallel execution of the FL tasks
    on edge devices. It is worth noting that this simple architecture can be easily
    extended to include heterogeneous resources such as Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetsons
    with GPUs, which can be deployed near the sensors for more local data processing.
    This introduces interesting research questions on the implicit trade-offs related
    to such system heterogeneity. Overall, using a hierarchical FL architecture for
    edge devices has the potential to revolutionize smart farming by enabling more
    efficient and effective data sharing, processing and decision-making, resulting
    in improved crop yields and reduced water waste. It is also resilient against
    issues such as unreliable network connectivity, which is an important consideration
    as limited network coverage is commonly encountered in agricultural land. Similar
    architectures can be developed for other applications such as: Environmental monitoring:
    Hierarchical FL could enable better analysis of data collected from remote sensors
    and devices, leading to better understanding and management of natural resources.
    Healthcare: Medical sites can collaborate and share machine learning models to
    improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment without having to share sensitive
    patient information. Wearable monitoring devices: IoT devices are integrated into
    devices to monitor human biometric data such as heart rate, temperature and movement
    patterns aiming to identify potential safety hazards and improve worker safety
    in the hazardous work environment. Application Requirements for Hierarchical Federated
    Learning Hierarchical FL systems have great potential to realize new sensor-driven
    applications, as discussed in the previous section. However, the technology faces
    numerous challenges due to the diverse nature of these applications and the equally
    diverse performance requirements. Some of these requirements can conflict with
    one another. To address the needs of these systems systematically, we recommend
    using two widely recognized standards for software quality and data quality, which
    are the ISO/IEC 25012 [17] and ISO/IEC 25010 [18] frameworks, respectively. By
    applying these frameworks, we can identify and prioritize the requirements, design
    appropriate performance metrics, and develop techniques and algorithms that optimize
    the trade-offs between conflicting requirements. This will help ensure that hierarchical
    FL systems are reliable, efficient, and effective and can be deployed in a wide
    range of real-world applications. Functionality is a crucial metric that measures
    the system''s ability to perform consistently and accurately over time. This metric
    is closely related to data quality since poor-quality data can result in unreliable
    and inaccurate machine learning models. Optimizing hierarchical FL parameters,
    applying model personalization and transfer learning techniques, and adapting
    the models to the specific characteristics of each device can help improve functionality.
    Reliability is important for edge devices, which often operate under intermittent
    connectivity, mobility, and resource-constrained conditions [19]. These challenges
    can make it difficult to develop efficient and reliable FL systems. To overcome
    these challenges, researchers are exploring techniques such as task offloading
    [20], adaptive sampling [21], and reinforcement learning to optimize the system
    performance and adapt to changing edge computing environments [22]. Redundancy
    can be introduced by configuring the edge devices into different clusters, which
    may improve reliability in hierarchical FL. Performance efficiency can be evaluated
    by quantifying the computation and communication overheads. In hierarchical FL
    systems, the edge server acts as a coordinator, responsible for aggregating and
    processing the data from multiple edge devices [23]. This can create a huge computationaland
    communication burden on the edge server, which can result in high latency, reduced
    system performance, and increased communication costs. To mitigate these challenges,
    researchers are exploring techniques such as partitioning and scheduling to distribute
    the computation and communication load across multiple edge servers and among
    cloud and edge servers [6]. The use of data streaming techniques helps to further
    reduce communication overheads while also increasing the reliability of the edge
    systems. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, mobility, and varying edge
    computing environments, engineers should consider metrics like system scalability,
    cost/benefit balance, and application size on the edge device to evaluate resource
    utilization. Techniques like task offloading, adaptive sampling, and reinforcement
    learning can further optimize system performance and adapt to changing edge computing
    environments. The convergence rate of the learning process is also a critical
    consideration. Compatibility is essential in terms of device heterogeneity, where
    edge devices may not have the same type of sensors and may run on different operating
    systems and software. Edge devices used in FL systems may differ in terms of their
    hardware capabilities, such as CPU processing power, memory, and battery life,
    as well as their software configurations, such as operating systems and libraries.
    This heterogeneity can lead to statistical heterogeneity in the data collected
    from the devices, making it challenging to develop models that generalize well
    across all devices [24]. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring
    methods such as transfer learning [25] and model personalization [26] that can
    adapt the models to the specific characteristics of each device. Security is a
    significant concern for hierarchical FL systems. FL provides some level of privacy,
    but to protect data and models from malicious actors, techniques like secure aggregation,
    differential privacy, blockchain, and homomorphic encryption can be applied. Hierarchical
    FL systems may have edge servers from different sources, which makes the systems
    more vulnerable to security threats such as data leakage, model poisoning, and
    inference attacks [23]. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring
    techniques such as secure aggregation [27], differential privacy [28], and homomorphic
    encryption [29] to ensure that the data and models are protected from malicious
    actors. Metrics like confidentiality, currentness, and reliability can be used
    to evaluate the severity of security challenges, as defined by the ISO/IEC 25010
    standard for data security and accessibility. Dynamic infrastructure is a common
    problem in hierarchical FL systems. In these settings, the aggregation nodes are
    not necessarily static or fixed. It may be necessary for the aggregation node
    to change over time if a node is rendered offline due to low battery or a poor
    communication channel. This makes ensuring stable hierarchical FL difficult. Strategies
    to prevent this can be resource-aware real-time decision making where edge devices
    coordinate among themselves to decide how communication should be done among them.
    Software support: Currently, common FL frameworks (e.g., Flower, PySyft) do not
    natively support hierarchical FL, especially for highly dynamic systems where
    infrastructure may change over time. Opportunities and Open Problems The opportunities
    and future research directions for using FL for sensing and measurement can be
    organized into three key axes: resource management and coordination of devices
    that make up the FL system; data management and access; and application-specific
    considerations, such as the use of UAVs [30] and Internet of Medical Things [23].
    In this section, we elaborate on the first two axes, which have general applicability
    across different domains. The third is highly domain-specific and thus not included
    in this general roadmap. Resource Management and Coordination FL opens up new
    methods for supporting fault tolerance of IoT devices. The use of multiple IoT
    devices increases the completeness of data and facilitates the detection and correction
    of erroneous readings and faulty operations. An FL system capable of supporting
    multiple heterogeneous devices and able to recover from faults is reported in
    [31]. A hierarchical FLsystem able to account for the hierarchy of edge servers
    may result in multiple memberships for IoT devices requiring recovery and adaptation
    at several levels. Another exciting direction is the integration of self-adaptivity
    into IoT devices using hierarchical FL. IoT devices become self-adaptive by learning
    from their past behaviors and performance data, can detect changes in environmental
    conditions and predict equipment failure, and automatically adjust device parameters
    [32]. As IoT devices collect knowledge about their environment, they must share
    knowledge to better understand their environment and its dynamics. However, a
    collective system of self-aware devices does not have a centralized knowledge
    base. FL could facilitate sharing of knowledge between devices as a collective.
    Unlike context-aware systems, which typically assume a ground-truth-based environmental
    context that is true for all IoT devices, it is explicitly acknowledged that self-aware
    devices in the collective systems will have different experiences of a shared
    environment [33]. A federated system can be expanded to incorporate information
    for the edge servers at the membership level to provide self-adaptiveness for
    different branches of the edge computing infrastructure and provide context on
    how the information was gathered. Hierarchical FL architectures are inherently
    resilient against network latency and bandwidth limitations. They therefore open
    up new opportunities for network optimization due to the heterogeneity of edge
    environments. For example, network routing needs to be dynamically adapted and
    optimized to the traffic patterns and topologies to improve network throughput
    and latency. Meanwhile, new network designs and paradigms can be introduced, such
    as software-defined networking and blockchain. New algorithms and techniques that
    are specifically designed to optimize resource allocation in edge computing environments
    can dynamically allocate computational and communication resources to different
    tasks based on their priority and application-specific requirements. This allows
    for real-time balancing of multiple objectives. For example, a healthcare application
    that uses a large number of medical sensors to collect, adapt, and react to medical
    information in real time requires security robustness and resource optimization
    for computational and communication tasks [34]. The energy consumption of IoT
    devices and edge computing infrastructure can be optimized by dynamically adapting
    the computational workload and communication overhead to the available energy
    and power constraints. Exploring multi-objective optimization techniques such
    as evolutionary algorithms and Pareto optimization is another direction of research
    that is crucial due to the complexity of hierarchical FL systems. There is a need
    to balance multiple objectives and constraints, such as communication overhead,
    energy consumption, privacy preservation, and security, while creating a global
    machine learning model with limited and heterogeneous resources. This requires
    the coordination of multiple clients and servers at different layers of the system,
    creating a complex interaction network. Additionally, the underlying technologies
    used, such as wireless communication, data storage and processing, and machine
    learning algorithms, introduce their sets of constraints and trade-offs that need
    to be considered in the optimization process, where not only performance but scalability
    needs careful consideration when optimizing these conflicting objectives. Fig.
    7. Future directions for hierarchical federated learning in sensor applications.
    Show All Data Management and Access While FL adds a layer of privacy around user
    data by eliminating the need to share data with others, sharing model updates
    do not offer privacy guarantees as individual data points can be reconstructed
    [35]. To address this issue, privacy-preserving FL can be expanded using techniques
    such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, digital signature, and hash
    functions [23], [36]. These techniques enable FL in edge computing environments
    while preserving the privacy of data and participants. For instance, differential
    privacy provides privacy guarantees for medical image analysis. In unstable edge
    computing environments, such as smart healthcare, a privacy protection scheme
    is proposed that provides gradient privacy and resistance to collusion and replay
    attacks for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) [23]. A privacy protection technique
    for a hierarchical FL system needs to be computationally efficient and adaptable
    to the underlying learning algorithms, with an ability to effectively scale to
    a large number of clients and servers. Fig. 7 summarizes some of the opportunities
    presented by hierarchical FL that make it an exciting area of research for engineers
    and academicians in the field of instrumentation and measurement. Conclusion Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers have a critical role to play in driving technological
    advancements to address global challenges and advance the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015. Hierarchical federated
    learning is an emerging technology that enhances the intelligence of sensor systems
    in many applications such as environmental quality management, personalized health-care
    devices, and precision agriculture. Secure, resilient, and robust sensor systems
    that support real-time, data-driven decision-making are valuable infrastructure
    for helping us reduce carbon emissions (SDG 13–Climate Action), promote sustainable
    urbanization (SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities), and improve healthcare
    outcomes (SDG 3–Health and Well-being). We urge researchers and practitioners
    to collaborate on the opportunities and open problems presented in this article
    to realize the full potential of this technology. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research

    Rice is a water-guzzling crop cultivated mostly through inefficient irrigation
    methods which leads to low water use efficiency and many environmental problems.
    Additionally, the export of virtual water through rice trading and the looming

    and food security. There are several alternative rice production methods to improve
    water use efficiency. These include aerobic rice, direct-seeded rice (DSR), alternate

    For example, drip-irrigated rice and IoT-based automated irrigation are not feasible

    food for over half of the world’s population, and it requires a vast amount of
    water to grow [1]. However, the growing water crisis in rice-cultivating countries
    has become a matter of concern. The increase in demand for rice production coupled
    with the shortage of water supply has led to a severe water crisis in rice-cultivating
    countries. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), rice cultivation
    accounts for 34–43% of global irrigation water use [2]. In countries such as India
    and China, where rice cultivation is a significant agricultural activity, water
    scarcity is a significant issue. The water availability in India has been declining,
    and projections suggest that the demand for water will exceed the supply by 50%
    by 2030 [3]. Similarly, in China, rice cultivation accounts for 40% of the country’s
    total water consumption. China is home to over a third of the world’s irrigated
    land and faces water scarcity issues. The per capita water availability in China
    is much lower than the global average, and it is projected that water scarcity
    will worsen in the future [4]. The growing water crisis in rice-cultivating countries
    poses a severe threat to food security [4]. Rice is a crucial crop for food security
    in many developing countries, and the shortage of water supply can lead to a decrease
    in rice production, thereby affecting food security [2]. Water scarcity also affects
    the quality of rice produced and can lead to increased prices, making it unaffordable
    for the poor. The depletion of water resources for rice cultivation can lead to
    soil degradation and reduced agricultural productivity. The overuse of water resources
    can also lead to increased salinization and waterlogging, further reducing agricultural
    productivity [2]. Additionally, climate change is expected to have significant
    impacts on water availability for rice cultivation. The changes in temperature
    and precipitation patterns are likely to alter the availability of water for irrigation,
    which could result in both water shortages and flooding. As global temperatures
    rise, it is expected that the hydrological cycle will intensify, resulting in
    more extreme rainfall events in some areas and more prolonged dry spells in others
    [5]. Higher temperatures are expected to increase evaporation rates and water
    loss from soil, which could lead to reduced soil moisture and more frequent droughts.
    This could affect the growth and productivity of rice crops, as they require adequate
    soil moisture to grow and produce high yields. In addition to changing precipitation
    patterns, climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of
    extreme weather events such as floods, storms, and cyclones [6]. These events
    could damage rice crops and infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, which
    could further reduce water availability for rice cultivation. Climate change will
    exacerbate existing water scarcity issues in many regions, and adaptation strategies
    will be needed to ensure the sustainable production of rice in the future [5].
    In regions where rainfall is already scarce, this could lead to more frequent
    and severe droughts, making it harder for communities to access the water they
    need for agriculture, drinking, and other uses. As temperatures increase, so too
    does the rate of evaporation, which can lead to decreased soil moisture levels
    and reduced water availability for crops. This is particularly important for rice
    cultivation, which is one of the world’s most water-intensive crops. Rising temperatures
    are expected to increase the water requirements for rice cultivation, leading
    to increased demand for irrigation water in regions where water is already scarce
    [2]. Similarly, industrialization and urbanization can have significant impacts
    on freshwater availability for rice cultivation, as they increase competition
    for fresh water, contribute to water pollution and degradation, and lead to land-use
    changes that reduce the availability of surface water [7]. This increased demand
    can put pressure on freshwater resources, leading to over-extraction of groundwater
    and surface water, and potentially reducing the amount of water available for
    irrigation in rice cultivation areas. Industrialization and urbanization can also
    lead to water pollution and degradation, as wastewater and other pollutants are
    discharged into water bodies. This pollution can affect the quality of freshwater
    resources and reduce their suitability for rice cultivation [8]. Research on innovative
    irrigation management technologies to enhance water use efficiency in rice farming
    has been ongoing for almost two decades, but there are still some knowledge gaps
    that need to be addressed. These gaps include a lack of detailed review on the
    performance of various innovative irrigation management technologies on water
    use efficiency in rice farming. In addition to water use efficiency, it is essential
    to review the impact of these technologies on rice yield and quality comprehensively.
    Another vital gap to address is cost-effectiveness. Although innovative irrigation
    management technologies can be effective in saving irrigation water and improving
    water use efficiency, it is crucial to review the cost-effectiveness of these
    technologies. This review should include the return on investment and potential
    cost savings over time. Moreover, different regions have unique climatic conditions
    and soil characteristics that affect water use efficiency in rice farming. Therefore,
    it is necessary to identify suitable and effective methods of irrigation from
    the existing innovative irrigation management technologies based on the available
    research data. Finally, the success of innovative irrigation management technologies
    largely depends on farmer adoption, which requires the development of appropriate
    policies to promote the adoption of these new technologies. In light of these
    gaps, this article comprehensively reviewed the performance of innovative irrigation
    technologies on water use efficiency, cost-effectiveness, rice yield and quality,
    climatic and soil suitability, and policies to promote their adoption. 2. Improving
    Water Productivity and Water Use Efficiency of Rice Feeding a growing population
    and meeting their water demands will become increasingly challenging in the future.
    Sustainability in agricultural water resource utilization is crucial for achieving
    global food security [9]. To address food scarcity caused by water scarcity, there
    are three approaches: (i) increasing water availability through wastewater recycling,
    (ii) enhancing water productivity through higher yields or better water use, or
    both, and (iii) addressing regional water scarcity through importing water in
    the form of food through virtual water trade [10]. The main objective of all three
    approaches is to maximize the use of available rainfall, make efficient use of
    limited irrigation water, and enhance crop water use efficiency through integrated
    techniques. Improving water efficiency in agriculture is a crucial approach for
    India to meet the growing demand for food. This can be achieved through various
    practices and technologies, including (i) upgrading and optimizing irrigation
    and drainage systems, (ii) building and lining field channels and waterways, (iii)
    land leveling and shaping, (iv) constructing field drains, (v) conjunctive use
    of surface and groundwater together, (vi) implementing and regulating appropriate
    cropping patterns, (vii) introducing and enforcing rotational water distribution
    systems (warabandi’s), (viii) developing plans for providing inputs such as credit,
    seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, and (ix) strengthening current extension,
    training, and demonstration programs in farmers’ fields to conserve freshwater
    and increase irrigation efficiency. 2.1. Water-Saving Irrigation The pressure
    on freshwater resources is growing in India, particularly in key rice-producing
    states. Improving agricultural water productivity (more produce or revenue per
    drop) is crucial in reducing the demand for freshwater. Rice cultivation traditionally
    involves continuously flooded (CF) conditions, which are highly productive but
    require a large amount of water and have negative environmental impacts such as
    degradation of soil health, increased methane emissions, and higher accumulation
    of harmful substances, such as mercury and arsenic [11,12]. Hence, agricultural
    research and development should aim to reduce the amount of water required for
    rice cultivation and find alternative methods to the conventional system [13].
    To boost rice output, a variety of water-saving techniques have been tested and
    disseminated for adoption by farmers, which include (i) the alternate wetting
    and drying (AWD) method of irrigation, (ii) the aerobic rice system, (iii) the
    system of rice intensification (SRI), (iv) saturated soil culture (SSC), (v) direct
    seeded rice (DSR), and (vi) drip-irrigated DSR. The raised-bed system involves
    growing rice on raised beds, which are well-drained and not continuously flooded,
    allowing for less water usage and improved soil aeration. The system of ground
    cover rice production utilizes a shallow water depth with AWD to conserve water.
    Transplanting in non-puddled soil and using non-flooded mulching cultivation can
    also help reduce water consumption while maintaining crop yield. Intermittent
    dry spells and semi-dry cultivation involve strategic periods of drought to promote
    plant water use efficiency and reduce water usage in rice cultivation. These alternative
    methods are known for their reduced water consumption, improved soil health, lower
    greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced accumulation of harmful elements in rice
    grain. Implementing these techniques could play a crucial role in mitigating the
    water scarcity challenge in India’s agriculture sector. 2.2. Alternate Wetting
    and Drying AWD irrigation was developed by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) and is a technically promising, realistically water-saving, and economically
    viable environmentally benign technique [14]. AWD has been extensively tested
    and is now being implemented in many Asian countries, including India, the Philippines,
    Vietnam, and Bangladesh. AWD irrigation subjects the field to alternating cycles
    of saturation (flooding) and drying (unsaturation), thereby saving irrigation
    water, improving water-use efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and
    saving fertilizer, pesticide, and labor inputs. Once the soil reaches a specific
    lower moisture level, irrigation is provided. During the crop growing season,
    the fields are switched from a continually wet rice field to a field with occasional
    dry spells. After transplanting (or three to four weeks after sowing), the field
    is allowed to dry out for about two to three weeks until the water table reaches
    about 10–15 cm below the surface of the soil [13]. If no precipitation occurs,
    this could take anywhere from 1 to 7 days, depending on the soil. Once the threshold
    is met, irrigation water should be applied until the field receives 3–5 cm of
    standing water [15]. A sunk perforated plastic field tube (PVC pipe) allows examination
    of the below-ground water table and assists in making a decision to irrigate at
    the appropriate time (Figure 1). A safe level of 15 cm has been identified so
    that plants do not experience stress due to drought and yields do not suffer.
    The effect of AWD on rice yield and WUE is presented in Table 1. Figure 1. Perforated
    plastic field tube to examine the below-ground water table in AWD. The AWD irrigation
    method can reduce water usage by up to 37% without affecting production. AWD has
    shown 23% less water use compared to continually flooded rice systems [16]. In
    addition to saving water, the AWD system has the potential to improve grain quality
    by lowering total arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) content in rice grains by 50%,
    reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45–90%, boosting water efficiency,
    and keeping or even increasing grain output [17]. In rice cultivation, intermittent
    watering with AWD was found to decrease insect pests by 92% and diseases by 100%
    [11]. Additionally, the study by Duttarganvi et al. (2016) showed that the use
    of AWD in conjunction with cono-weeding resulted in significantly higher yields
    compared to other irrigation and weed management methods. This is due to the promotion
    of abundant root growth and an aerated growing environment [18]. Furthermore,
    the AWD method has also resulted in a 22% reduction in the frequency of watering
    compared to conventional rice production systems [19]. The significant decrease
    in irrigation water input in AWD is mainly due to a reduction in deep drainage,
    seepage, runoff, and evapotranspiration [20]. The absence of flooding in the AWD
    method minimizes water loss through seepage and percolation, although the rate
    of these processes is largely dependent on soil hydrological properties. The use
    of AWD under dry direct-seeded rice (DDSR) reduced the total water input by 27–29%
    and water productivity by 44–50% [11]. Another study by Sujono et al. (2011) reported
    that the practice of AWD in rice reduced the irrigation water input by 13.1%,
    increased the grain yield by 22.9%, and improved water productivity by 41.6% compared
    to shallow intermittent irrigation [21]. Likewise, Ceesay et al. (2006) also reported
    60% water savings under AWD compared with continuous submergence [22]. The absence
    of standing water in the field under AWD is a key factor contributing to the reduced
    water input in this technique [23]. Based on the meta-analysis of 56 studies,
    Carrijo et al. (2017) established that severe AWD in rice saved 33.4% of water
    input with a 22.6% yield reduction, whereas mild AWD saved 25.7% of water input
    with increased rice productivity [24]. AWD promotes root growth, enabling better
    uptake of water and nutrients from deeper soil layers, which leads to increased
    grain productivity [25]. AWD plots received 57% less irrigation water than CF
    with a non-significant difference in grain yield, indicating that AWD could considerably
    enhance crop water use efficiency in Nepal [26]. In addition to reducing water
    usage and increasing yields, the use of AWD has also been found to modify plant
    hormone signaling, which in turn enhances grain filling rate, decreases the percentage
    of unfilled grain, and improves water use efficiency [27,28,29,30]. Research has
    found that the use of intermittent irrigation with three-day and seven-day intervals
    can save 55% and 74% of water, respectively, compared to CF irrigation. The seven-day
    intervals were found to have an irrigation water productivity of 0.48 kg grain/m3
    and a total water productivity of 0.35 kg grain/m3 [31]. Maintaining a six-centimeter
    standing water depth at seven-day intervals has been shown to support plant growth
    while also boosting yields. Keeping soil moisture at optimum levels without inducing
    stress is crucial for the growth and development of the rice crop. While the adoption
    of AWD has proven to be effective in enhancing water use efficiency, saving water
    inputs, and increasing or maintaining yields, it is important to note that in
    some cases, particularly with light-textured sandy soils, the implementation of
    severe AWD may result in a sacrifice of yield for the sake of water savings and
    improved WUE. Additionally, the impact of soil characteristics on the effectiveness
    of AWD was found to be more pronounced in cases of severe AWD [24]. To prevent
    yield reductions in AWD, it is important to continuously irrigate crops during
    and after the start of the reproductive phase. Compared to CF, the AWD has been
    shown to significantly reduce water usage while maintaining or even improving
    yields [32]. The 34% reduction in water input in AWD, in turn, increased the water
    productivity of rice compared to continuous submergence [33]. Tan et al. (2013)
    found no significant decrease in yields under the AWD method, and the use of AWD
    resulted in a 17% increase in water productivity compared to CF irrigation. According
    to Islam et al. (2022), the AWD irrigation system mitigated GHG emissions by 27%
    compared to CF irrigation. The methane (CH4) emission for AWD was lower (1.67
    kg ha−1 day−1) than that of CF (2.33 kg ha−1 day−1) [34]. The study conducted
    by Djaman et al. (2018) found that the implementation of AWD irrigation management
    with a pressure head of 30 kPa resulted in a substantial increase in rice yield
    and nitrogen use efficiency while reducing the need for irrigation applications
    by 27.3% compared to CF. The performance of AWD was found to be most effective
    in soils with a pH of less than 7 and a soil carbon content of at least 1% [35].
    Although AWD reduced water input and gives a reasonable yield in many parts of
    the world, it has not been widely adopted due to its potential for reduced yields
    [24,36]. Adoption of AWD resulted in reduced rice productivity in certain conditions
    [24,26,37,38]. The significant disparities in grain yield across soils, climates,
    seasons, years, cultivars, and management practices pose a significant challenge
    to the widespread adoption of AWD [16,39]. Humphreys et al. (2012) found only
    a slight reduction in yield under AWD [40]. Similarly, Carrijo et al. (2017) reported
    a yield reduction of 5.4% under AWD. However, research has shown that under mild
    AWD, such as maintaining a soil water potential (SWP) of −20 kPa or higher or
    ensuring that the field water level does not drop below 15 cm from the soil surface,
    grain yields are not significantly impacted [24]. Despite the ability of the AWD
    method to conserve irrigation water, it is unlikely that this method will be widely
    adopted in Nepal, as the current water administration system is not providing
    any direct incentives to reduce irrigation water usage [26]. It should be noted
    that AWD may not be the most suitable approach for rice cultivation in sandy soils,
    as the water drains quickly and results in minimal water savings. Similarly, in
    soils with thick clay and shallow water tables, AWD may not be necessary, as the
    water table never drops below the lowest roots in these soils [41]. Table 1. Paddy
    yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of rice under alternate wetting and drying
    (AWD) and continuously flooded (CF) methods. 2.3. The Effect of AWD on Grain Quality
    of Rice The rice grain quality may change while transitioning from the conventional
    flooding system to water-saving rice production technologies [45]. The effect
    of AWD on rice grain quality is presented in Table 2. CF has been shown to have
    negative impacts on grain quality, as it accumulates harmful heavy metals such
    as arsenic and mercury [46,47]. On the other hand, the implementation of AWD irrigation
    has been found to improve grain quality by increasing protein content, milling
    recovery, and grain yield. However, excessive AWD can result in reduced protein
    content [48]. Song et al. (2021) reported that AWD improved the nutritional quality
    of milled rice by increasing amino acids and phenolic acids and decreasing lipids
    and alkaloids [49]. Rice plants grown under AWD showed higher levels of leaf abscisic
    acid and increased concentrations of foliar isopentenyladenine (37%), while leaf
    trans-zeatin concentrations decreased by 36% compared to CF [50]. In comparison
    to aerobic irrigation management, AWD irrigation reduced the number of opaque
    kernels (62%), abortive kernels (51%), and chalkiness (42%). Additionally, AWD
    irrigation decreased the kernel amylose levels by 15%, amylopectin by 6%, and
    mercury uptake by 21% compared to CF [51]. The nutritional quality of brown rice
    was improved under AWD water management, as there was an increase in grain antioxidants,
    flavonoids, γ-oryzanol, total tocopherols, grain iron, and zinc, as well as a
    significant decrease in grain arsenic compared to CF [52]. Table 2. Influence
    of the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) production system on grain quality of
    rice. AWD is a simple and low-cost method that can be easily adopted by smallholder
    farmers. AWD requires careful management to prevent damage to the rice crop and
    ensure optimal water and nutrient uptake by the plants. Additionally, the effectiveness
    of AWD may vary depending on local soil and climatic conditions, and it may not
    be suitable for all regions and climatic conditions. To further improve the adoption
    and effectiveness of AWD, some future research areas include Optimization of AWD
    practices: AWD is a complex agricultural technique that involves the manipulation
    of soil water dynamics. There is a need for further research to optimize AWD practices
    such as irrigation scheduling, drainage management, and water-saving technologies
    to maximize yields while minimizing water use. Soil health and nutrient management:
    AWD can have significant impacts on soil health and nutrient cycling. Future research
    should focus on understanding the long-term impacts of AWD on soil properties,
    nutrient availability, and GHG emissions, as well as developing strategies for
    managing soil health and fertility in AWD systems. Scaling up and dissemination:
    Despite the many benefits of AWD, adoption rates remain low in many regions. Future
    research should focus on identifying the barriers to adoption and developing strategies
    for scaling up and disseminating AWD practices to farmers, including training
    programs, farmer field schools, and extension services. 2.4. Aerobic Rice System
    Aerobic rice cultivation is an innovative approach to growing rice in well-drained,
    non-flooded, and unsaturated soils without ponded water [56]. This method incorporates
    the use of specialized aerobic rice cultivars that are responsive to inputs and
    optimized water management techniques, resulting in an impressive yield of 4 to
    6 tonnes per hectare with a water consumption rate of only 50 to 70% compared
    to traditional irrigated rice cultivation. This method is highly recommended for
    regions facing water scarcity or high water costs, as well as areas where there
    is a pressing need for labor and rising wages. The WUE and water productivity
    of rice under an aerobic system are presented in Table 3. The most serious barrier
    to the widespread adoption of aerobic rice is weed infestation. Various low-dose
    high-efficacy herbicides are available on the market to control weeds in the aerobic
    rice system. These herbicides also have a wider window of application. Shahane
    et al. (2019) reported that the aerobic rice system saved 37.4% and 50.8% of irrigation
    water during the first and second years of the experiment, respectively, over
    conventional transplanted rice [57]. More water is saved in the aerobic system
    than in puddled transplanted rice and the SRI due to the absence of nursery raising,
    puddling of fields, and maintenance of arable soil. However, the aerobic rice
    system caused a significant yield penalty over puddled transplanted rice. In addition
    to water-saving, aerobic rice is known to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
    lower global warming potential [58]. Changing rice cultivation from conventional
    flooded rice to an aerobic rice system emitted an average of 79.8% less CH4, whereas
    it emitted 14.4% more nitrous oxide (N2O) than transplanted paddy [59]. Aerobic
    rice cultivation resulted in lower yields, averaging 3 tonnes per hectare with
    27% lower water use compared to traditional flooded conditions, which produced
    5.8 tonnes per hectare [60]. Additionally, Kato et al. (2009) found that water
    productivity was 1.4 to 3.7 times higher in aerobic rice systems compared to transplanted
    rice (Table 3) [61]. The implementation of aerobic irrigation with DDSR increased
    water productivity by 22–30% and water savings by 49–55%, despite a decrease in
    paddy yield of 36–39% due to higher panicle sterility [11]. In a study conducted
    by Shahane et al. (2019), which compared the water productivity of aerobic rice,
    the system of rice intensification (SRI), and transplanted rice, it was found
    that aerobic rice saved 50.8% of the water used in transplanted rice [57]. Similar
    results were reported by Ramulu et al. (2020), who found that aerobic rice in
    sandy loam soil saved 50% of the irrigation water compared to transplanted rice
    [62]. Table 3. Water use efficiency and water productivity of aerobic rice systems.
    Aerobic rice has several challenges, including, Nutrient deficiencies: The non-flooded
    aerobic soil conditions favor the development of nutrient deficiencies, such as
    iron and phosphorus which are typically more available under flooded conditions.
    Farmers must carefully manage nutrient inputs and may need to use fertilizer formulations
    that are specifically designed for non-flooded conditions. Weed control: Farmers
    may need to use more intensive weed control measures, such as herbicides or manual
    weeding, to maintain yields. Pest and disease management: Non-flooded conditions
    can also create favorable conditions for certain pests and diseases. For example,
    root-knot nematode infestation is more common under aerobic rice systems compared
    to flooded rice production systems. 2.5. The System of Rice Intensification For
    more than a decade, the system of rice intensification (SRI) has been pushed as
    a set of agronomic management approaches for rice farming that increases output
    while lowering water usage. Henri de Laulanié invented the SRI in Madagascar in
    1983 while working with peasant farmers [64,65]. The system has spread rapidly
    to dozens of rice-growing countries. It consists of several distinctive practices
    including transplanting young (13–15 days old) and single seedlings, wider and
    square planting, intermittent water management (irrigation after hair-like crack
    development), weed control with a cono-weeder/mechanical weeder for better weed
    control and soil aeration, and encouraging the use of organic nutrients and inorganic
    fertilizers. It has been demonstrated that paddy farming using the SRI approach
    significantly increases land productivity while consuming less water. The SRI
    method of paddy cultivation saved up to 50% of irrigation water in comparison
    to the traditional method by avoiding evaporation and deep percolation losses.
    The SRI is the preferred method for rice cultivation on flat and irrigated land
    compared to uneven rainfed land [66]. This method is highly suitable for water-scarce
    regions, although this method slightly increases the need for human manpower initially.
    The primary difference between the SRI and non-SRI irrigation techniques in terms
    of water use is that the former uses a dry-wetting irrigation system while the
    latter uses the more traditional inundation technique. Second, the SRI approach
    saves a significant quantity of water because it does not require deep or repetitive
    puddling. Third, irrigation is applied sparingly at the time of transplanting,
    contrasting with the typical procedure. Fourth, a simple wetting of the ground
    is sufficient to operate a hand-drawn cono-weeder or mechanical weeder efficiently
    in a paddy field. Extended root growth takes place due to the wide spacing followed
    during transplanting. This robust root system in the SRI facilitates the uptake
    of water and nutrients from a large volume of soil and results in higher yield.
    The SRI method can enhance rice grain yield with substantially less water input
    than the conventional method of rice cultivation [66]. Shahane et al. (2019) reported
    that the SRI method saved 21.9% and 27.4% of irrigation water without any reduction
    in yield during the first and second year of the experiment, respectively, over
    conventional transplanted rice [57]. When compared to normal transplanting, the
    SRI method saved 31 and 37 percent of irrigation water during the Kharif and Rabi
    seasons, respectively [67]. The saving of water with the SRI was due to the lower
    depth of irrigation water application in the SRI than in conventional transplanted
    rice during the early growth period. The SRI method of stand establishment saved
    irrigation water and has a greater WUE (70.8 kg rice equivalent yield/ha/cm) than
    the conventional transplanted rice (67.0 kg rice equivalent yield/ha/cm) and the
    alternate wetting and drying method of irrigation [68]. Farmers who use the SRI
    method instead of the usual inundation approach can save around 40% of irrigation
    water, enhance land yield by about 46%, and reduce cultivation costs by 23% [69].
    According to Toungos (2018), the SRI method of rice production reduced 40% of
    irrigation water usage in Indonesia, 67% in the Philippines, and 25% in Sri Lanka
    when compared to traditional farming practices [70]. During the Kharif and Rabi
    seasons, the SRI method recorded 31% and 37% less water usage for irrigation compared
    to normal transplanting [71]. The SRI method had a higher irrigation water productivity
    (IWP) and economic water productivity (EWP) of 6.62 kg and ₹ 108, respectively,
    while the non-SRI method had a lower IWP and EWP of 2.70 kg and ₹ 45, respectively.
    The IWP was found to be 145% higher in the SRI method compared to the non-SRI
    method [69]. The higher IWP and EWP in the SRI method are due to the fact that
    farmers who adopt this approach generally save more water and produce more rice.
    SRI proponents suggest the use of cono-weeders for weeding and soil aeration,
    but poor farmers find the equipment to be too expensive and struggle to use it
    in field conditions [72]. The amount of water saved using the SRI approach was
    found to be higher in groundwater-irrigated areas (roughly 45 percent) than in
    canal-irrigated areas (about 33 percent) [69]. The reason for this variance is
    that farmers were able to closely adhere to a dry-wetting irrigation method since
    water availability was guaranteed in the groundwater-irrigated region. This allowed
    the farmers growing an SRI paddy to save a sizable amount of water. However, it
    was not feasible in the canal-irrigated area since farmers are not in charge of
    water management and are, therefore, prone to over-irrigate crops whenever water
    is available in plenty [69]. The SRI method improves the water and nutrient-holding
    capacity of soil as it adds more organic manure through the incorporation of weeds
    and promotes the use of organic nutrient sources (green manure, green leaf manure,
    farmyard manure, compost). Greenhouse gas emissions are also lower in the SRI
    method of cultivation, as it emitted an average of 26.8% less CH4 and 3.8% more
    N2O than the conventional flooded paddy [59]. The majority of farmers that adopted
    the SRI approach did not adhere to all of the suggested practices due to inadequate
    literacy and limited knowledge of the recommended irrigation practices. As a result,
    farmers have not used the SRI technique to its full potential [69]. Depending
    on local agronomic or institutional opportunities and constraints, partial implementations
    of SRI principles, i.e., adopting individual SRI practices, could provide some
    benefits to farmers but could not derive synergies between all of the principles
    [66]. The SRI may not be suitable for all farmers or all rice-growing conditions.
    Farmers must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the SRI and determine
    whether it is a suitable option for their specific situation. There are some challenges
    associated with the SRI system include Labor-intensive: The SRI requires more
    labor than traditional rice cultivation methods, particularly during the transplanting
    stage when seedlings are planted individually. This can be a challenge for smallholder
    farmers who may have limited labor resources. Water management: The SRI requires
    careful water management, and an area that has high rainfall may not be ideal
    as it does not allow better soil aeration for root growth and tiller development.
    Knowledge and skills: The SRI requires farmers to have a certain level of knowledge
    and skills, particularly in terms of transplanting, water management, and nutrient
    management. This can be a barrier to adoption for some farmers, particularly those
    with limited access to training and extension services. Time-consuming: The SRI
    requires more time and attention from farmers, particularly during the transplanting
    stage and in terms of soil management. 2.6. Saturated Soil Culture Saturated soil
    culture (SSC) entails providing shallow irrigation to achieve around 1 cm of ponded
    water depth for a day or two after the ponded water has vanished. In SSC, the
    soil is kept as close to saturation as feasible, lowering the ponded water’s hydraulic
    head, seepage, and percolation flow. In SSC (no standing water), the deep percolation
    losses are zero, while in continuously flooded conditions percolation of water
    is high (Figure 2). The percolation rate increases along with increasing irrigation
    water depth in the field [73]. The water depth above the soil is kept below 3
    cm in SSC compared to other methods, where 5 cm is followed. The lower water depth
    reduces the percolation loss of water in SSC. The effect of SSC on rice yield
    and WUE is presented in Table 4. Tuong and Bhuiyan (1999) reported that SSC can
    reduce water losses, diminish water use, and maintain or increase productivity
    in rice-based systems. However, plants reduced evapotranspiration under severe
    water stress, which led to a decrease in photosynthesis, which in turn caused
    a decrease in chlorophyll, height, and tiller number [74]. Water stress during
    the tillering stage reduced the number of panicles per hill significantly [75].
    Keeping the soil moisture in saturation avoids the problem of moisture stress
    and did not affect root growth, tiller production, and biomass accumulation. On
    average, SSC can decrease water input by 40% from the continuously flooded condition
    with a non-significant yield reduction of 6% [76]. Figure 2. The saturated soil
    culture method of rice cultivation. Among different irrigation water depths, viz.,
    5, 4, 3, and 2 cm, the application of 3 cm of irrigation at weekly intervals appeared
    suitable and beneficial to rice crops in loamy textured soil, as it recorded significantly
    higher total water productivity (0.35 kg/m3) and irrigation water productivity
    (0.79 kg/m3) with non-significant yield reduction [77]. Another study reported
    32% less water usage under SSC compared to intermittent irrigation at a weekly
    interval [78]. According to Matsue et al. (2021), SSC irrigation significantly
    increased grain yield by increasing the percentage of filled grains compared to
    CF [79]. The quality of rice grains was also improved, with a higher percentage
    of head rice recovery and improved cooking quality due to a lower protein content
    and hardness/adhesion ratio. In the Philippines, SSC irrigation has been shown
    to save 30–60% of water compared to the CF system, with only a slight reduction
    in grain yield (4–9%) and an increase in WUE by 30–115% [27]. On the other hand,
    AWD saved 16–24% of irrigation water and 20–25% of production costs while maintaining
    the same yield as farmers’ practices [80]. Growing rice (cv. IR20) in the dry
    season under AWD saved 56% of irrigation water, whereas the yield was reduced
    from 7.9 t ha−1 to 3.4 t ha−1 [81]. In Australia, SSC used about 32% less water
    compared to traditional flooded rice production in both seasons (wet and dry),
    with no effect on grain yield and quality. Another study in Australia reported
    that SSC reduced water use by 16–28 percent and improved water use efficiency
    by up to 20 percent [82]. For growers in semi-arid tropical areas, SSC provides
    a practical substitute for flooded rice production [83]. Weekly irrigation at
    120% soil saturation exhibited greater irrigation water productivity (0.69 kg/m3),
    rainwater productivity (1.02 kg/m3), and water-saving (90.53%), with less production
    penalty (5 × 10−3 kg/m3) compared to irrigation at 200% soil saturation (farmer
    practice) [84]. SSC facilitates maximum utilization of rainfall, thereby increasing
    the effective rainfall percentage during the crop season. Moreover, high effective
    rainfall is recorded from panicle initiation to physiological maturity, as the
    increased moisture content in this stage helps with faster crop recovery from
    moisture stress, better initiation of panicle, and higher panicle fertility. Thus,
    it will be more suitable for rainfed rice-growing areas. SSC has the ability to
    significantly reduce unnecessary water outflows while increasing water productivity.
    Compared to other water-saving irrigation methods, SSC is a low-cost technology
    that has greater potential to save available irrigation water. SSC reduces the
    number of irrigations required to raise the crop, thereby reducing the irrigation
    cost, energy required for irrigation, and irrigation water. Table 4. The effect
    of the saturated soil culture irrigation method on rice yield, water use efficiency,
    and irrigation water saving. 2.7. Direct-Seeded Rice DSR is also an efficient
    resource conservation technology that holds great promise in rice-based cropping
    systems. DSR can be established by broadcasting or line-sowing at 20 cm row-to-row
    spacing, a 3–4 cm seeding depth, and using a mechanical seed-cum-fertilizer drill
    in unpuddled and well-prepared dry soil followed by light irrigation (2 cm) for
    germination. Thereafter, irrigation is somewhat delayed and given 20 days after
    the sowing to encourage a sturdy root system. Later irrigations are given by adopting
    the AWD cycle at the interval of 7–10 days depending on rainy events, soil type,
    crop growth stage, and ET demand. Alternatively, wet DSR involves the sowing of
    pre-germinated seeds (radicle 1–3 mm) on puddled wet soil. The labor-intensive
    practice, viz., raising the nursery and transplanting the rice, is eliminated
    in DSR [85]. In the event of a monsoon delay or a water constraint, DSR allows
    the farmer to direct sow a paddy with an appropriate short-duration variety to
    fit within the cropping system. This also enables the timely seeding of succeeding
    wheat crop rice-wheat systems where delayed wheat sowing causes significant yield
    loss in the IGP region [86]. When compared to transplanted flooded rice, DSR uses
    less water and provides several other advantages such as reduced crop duration,
    cost of cultivation, etc. DSR is proven to yield more than conventional transplanted
    rice production if weeds are controlled properly at the right time. DSR is more
    prone to weed infestations than traditional transplanted rice, as the rice plants
    are initially smaller and weeds can more easily compete for resources. Herbicides
    are mostly used for weed control in DSR. The herbicides recommended for different
    rice production methods along with their rate and time of application are summarized
    by Saravanane et al. (2021) [87]. Poor seed germination and sub-optimal plant
    population are major causes of low yields in DSR. To ensure an optimum plant population,
    it is essential to use high-quality seeds with a high germination percentage.
    By doing so, farmers can increase the chances of successful germination and establish
    a healthy and uniform plant stand, ultimately resulting in higher yields. The
    effect of DSR on WUE and water productivity is presented in Table 5. Dry direct-seeded
    rice produced higher yields (13–18%) and reduced the total water inputs (8–12%)
    in comparison to transplanted rice [11]. Gill et al. (2006) indicated that water
    productivity was improved to 0.46 from 0.36 by following the DSR compared to transplanted
    rice due to less irrigation water consumption (18%) and a similar yield [88].
    Despite having more irrigation events, the average water input of DDSR was lower
    than that of transplanted rice for both rice seasons, as DSR omits the large amounts
    of early-season water input used to puddle the field. The extent of water savings
    in DDSR was relatively low (only 8–12%) in the sandy loam composition of the soil
    in comparison to transplanted rice, which might be attributed to the absence of
    a plow pan or a hard pan [11]. DSR with sesbania co-culture saved irrigation water
    (34%), increased water productivity (0.43 kg m), reduced labor requirements (24%),
    and saved electricity (29%) [89]. Similarly, when compared to transplanted rice,
    the global warming potential (GWP) of dry DSR rice was 76.2 percent lower than
    that of wet direct-seeded rice, which was 60.4 percent lower [90]. The new technology
    would not be widely used if it just served to save water without increasing the
    yield. Farmers would not use the technology if it was not profitable for them.
    Table 5. Water use efficiency and water productivity of direct-seeded rice. 2.8.
    Drip-Irrigated Rice Drip irrigation is a modern water-saving technology used in
    direct-seeded rice production (Figure 3). The water productivity in drip-irrigated
    rice under a direct-seeded system was significantly higher compared to transplanted
    rice under flood irrigation due to higher evaporation, deep percolation, runoff,
    and seepage in the later system. In drip irrigation, precise water application
    and ensuring consistent wetting of the rice field to meet crop evapotranspiration
    would be possible. Drip irrigation also promotes healthy crop development by reducing
    soil evaporation and deep percolation [91,92]. Furthermore, drip fertigation increases
    rice yield potential by administering divided fertilizer doses precisely at the
    proper moment according to crop developmental phases at the right place, i.e.,
    the zone of maximum root activity. Additionally, the physiology of the rice crop
    was positively influenced by drip irrigation with enhanced water, nutrient, and
    resource use efficiency. Figure 3. Rice cultivation through drip irrigation. Rice
    cultivation with drip irrigation resulted in longer and denser roots, which boosted
    canopy photosynthesis and tiller numbers [91]. Planting on either side of the
    dripline or one dripline feeding 2 to 3 rows on the bed was a preferred option
    by the farmers. The narrow dripline spacing gives farmers more flexibility and
    options for including a range of rotational crops. However, narrow spacing of
    0.5 to 0.6 m also means more dripline, more connections, and higher costs. Emitter
    spacing used by researchers was mostly narrow and varied from 0.3 to 0.5 m, depending
    on soil characteristics. Seasonal irrigation requirements for drip-irrigated rice
    in the semi-arid region of Hyderabad, Telangana, India, were estimated to be 801
    mm, which was 51.6% less than flooded irrigated rice. The quantity of irrigation
    water for drip-irrigated rice varied from 547 to 844 mm in the semiarid region
    of South India, 882 mm in Ludhiana, Punjab, 639 mm in Pantnagar, Uttarkhand, and
    789 mm in Nashik, Maharashtra [93]. The continuous flood-irrigated rice across
    different agroecological conditions needed 150 to 853 mm more water (27.4 to 106.4%)
    than drip-irrigated rice. The water-saving in drip irrigation is mainly due to
    reduced evaporation, deep percolation, and conveyance losses. The WUE of surface
    drip-irrigated rice was 0.0576 t/ha-cm compared to 0.0181 t/ha-cm under conventional
    transplanted flooded rice [94]. In addition to saving 50–61 percent more water
    than the flood system, the drip system with fertigation also boosted yield and
    water productivity [95]. The effect of drip irrigation on WUE and water productivity
    is presented in Table 6. However, the advantage of drip irrigation in terms of
    yield can vary based on environmental conditions. According to He et al. (2013),
    the decrease in yield with drip irrigation in rice is largely due to a reduction
    in the number of productive tillers [96]. Additionally, root length is also found
    to be reduced, with more roots distributed in deeper soil layers under drip irrigation
    compared to CF irrigation. On the other hand, Sharda et al. (2017) found that
    the higher grain yield in drip-irrigated DSR was mainly attributed to higher root
    density at deeper soil layers (15–30 cm), which in turn increased the irrigation
    WUE and the number of filled grains per panicle [97]. He et al. (2013) also found
    that drip irrigation with plastic mulch was more efficient in terms of water savings
    compared to furrow irrigation in rice cultivation [96]. This was attributed to
    two factors: (i) plastic mulching, which can effectively reduce evapotranspiration
    compared to bare land, and (ii) seepage, which was significantly lower in the
    drip irrigation treatment than in the furrow irrigation treatment in loamy soil.
    The adoption of water-saving practices in irrigated rice increased paddy productivity,
    promoted soil carbon sequestration, assisted in resource conservation (water,
    labor, energy, and time), and lowered greenhouse emissions [11]. Drip irrigation
    helped with the production of more roots in the topsoil layer than furrow-irrigated
    rice [96]. Spacing between the lateral should be kept optimum for higher yield
    along with water-saving. Ramesh et al. (2020) reported an 80 cm interval between
    the lateral optimum for hybrid rice [98]. In the changing climate scenario, a
    continuous flooding system contributes more methane gas to global warming; adopting
    drip irrigation for growing rice reduced methane and nitrous oxide emissions.
    According to Ramesh and Rathika (2020), an average of 68.6 and 34.4% less CH4
    and N2O emissions were noticed under drip irrigation over a conventional flooded
    paddy [59]. Considering the seriousness of fast-depleting groundwater reserves
    and international commitments to address climate change issues, drip-irrigated
    rice would be of immense value to various stakeholders for saving water in agriculture.
    The evidence suggests that farmers do not embrace the drip fertigation technique
    in rice solely to conserve water, electricity, or other resources. In India, electricity
    is heavily subsidized, and water is not metered. The farming community will readily
    adopt the new technology only if it increases profits and is supported by farmer-friendly
    government policies that offer subsidies and other incentives. Installation and
    maintenance of the system. Drip irrigation systems require specialized installation
    and maintenance, including checking for leaks or clogs in the emitters, adjusting
    the water flow rate, and monitoring soil moisture levels. This can require additional
    labor input. Table 6. Water use efficiency and water productivity of drip-irrigated
    rice. 2.9. Smart Irrigation Sensor technology, the Internet of Things, wireless
    communications, public automatic weather station networks, improved crop evapotranspiration
    measurements, satellite and aerial imaging, and cloud computing technology are
    all promising areas for developing robust irrigation advisory tools to assist
    farmers in accurately determining and meeting crop water needs. Wireless networks
    can be used to collect data from soil moisture sensors, which can then be accessible
    via a web browser or smartphone app. Many of the computations involved in crop
    evapotranspiration-based irrigation scheduling have been automated using web and
    smartphone applications [100]. Smart irrigation apps are mobile-based irrigation
    scheduling tools that use weather data to determine irrigation scheduling protocols
    (when to apply and how much to apply) based on water losses from cropped fields.
    The weather data is obtained from the nearest automated weather monitoring network
    stations. A user’s new field is automatically associated with the nearest weather
    station when they register it in the smart irrigation apps; however, the user
    has the option of selecting any of the other available weather stations [101].
    Around the world, agriculture automation is becoming more and more important.
    Irrigation systems can be automated to suit different crops, soil, climate, and
    other factors with the help of sensors (moisture, temperature, and humidity),
    IoT devices, and machine learning algorithms. The automation of irrigation systems
    increases crop output, quality, and water use efficiency while reducing irrigation
    water, time, cost, and electricity [102]. By measuring the level of water, soil
    temperature, nutrient content, and weather forecasting, smart irrigation technology
    increases production without requiring manpower. However, for an automated irrigation
    system to be implemented successfully, sensor installation is crucial [102]. Sensors
    need to be put in the area where plants’ roots extract water (ensuring that there
    are no air gaps around the sensor). This will guarantee that the crops obtain
    enough water. Solar-powered raindrops and soil moisture sensors were buried in
    the root zones of the crops, and all these sensors are managed by a wireless internet
    network. The GSM module is used in the soil moisture sensor and raindrop sensor
    to transmit SMS notifications on soil moisture to the farmer’s cell phone. As
    a result, the farmer may control the water supply using SMS (Figure 4). Figure
    4. A smart irrigation device installed in the field. The intelligent water-saving
    irrigation system based on the agricultural IoT enables the real-time remote monitoring
    of moisture content and the accurate management of irrigation in paddy fields.
    These intelligent automatic irrigation systems are simple to adopt, function perfectly,
    and have high reliability and low power consumption. Currently, the cost of sensors
    used for intelligent automatic irrigation is prohibitively high, making it unfeasible
    for small and marginal farmers to adopt this type of system in their farms [103].
    Manufacturers are actively working to develop low-cost sensors that can be linked
    to nodes, thus facilitating the implementation of budget-friendly irrigation management
    systems and agriculture monitoring solutions. An IoT-based modern irrigation system
    has been found to reduce the water footprint by 40.29% and 29.22% compared to
    AWD and basin irrigation, respectively [104]. The water footprint of the IoT-based
    modern irrigation system, AWD, and basin irrigation was 2343, 3924, and 3310 m3/tonnes
    of paddy, respectively. The effect of smart irrigation on rice is presented in
    Table 7. Table 7. The effect of smart irrigation on rice cultivation. Future research
    that could further improve the effectiveness of these systems includes Sensor
    accuracy and reliability: which is the idea that the accuracy and reliability
    of the sensors used in automated IoT sensor-based irrigation systems can affect
    the precision and efficiency of the irrigation process. Future research could
    focus on improving the accuracy and reliability of sensors to ensure that they
    provide accurate and timely data to the system. Crop modeling and prediction:
    Developing accurate crop models and prediction tools can help farmers optimize
    irrigation schedules and avoid over- or under-watering of their crops. Future
    research could focus on developing more accurate and sophisticated models for
    rice crops that take into account factors such as soil moisture, weather conditions,
    and plant growth stage. Optimization of water use efficiency: Automated IoT sensor-based
    irrigation systems can help farmers optimize their water use efficiency by providing
    real-time data on soil moisture levels and crop water requirements. Future research
    could focus on developing more efficient irrigation scheduling algorithms and
    control strategies to further improve water use efficiency. Integration with other
    technologies: Automated IoT sensor-based irrigation systems can be integrated
    with other technologies, such as weather forecasting or drone-based imaging, to
    further optimize the irrigation process. Future research could focus on developing
    more sophisticated and integrated technologies that provide farmers with a comprehensive
    and data-driven approach to crop management. Adoption and dissemination: Despite
    the potential benefits of automated IoT sensor-based irrigation systems, their
    adoption and dissemination in rice farming communities can be slow due to factors
    such as a lack of awareness, technical expertise, or financial resources. Future
    research could focus on developing effective dissemination strategies and outreach
    programs to promote the adoption and scaling up of these technologies. 2.10. Comparision
    of Different Water Saving Technologies with Conventional Flooding Comparing water-saving
    rice production methods based on climate, soil type, labor, energy, and GHG is
    important for several reasons (Figure 5). Firstly, it helps farmers to select
    the most appropriate method based on the specific conditions of their farm, which
    can lead to higher yields, reduced costs, and improved WUE. Secondly, it allows
    policymakers to identify the most sustainable methods for a particular region,
    taking into account the local climate, soil type, and labor availability. This
    can help to reduce the environmental impact of rice cultivation while ensuring
    food security for local communities. Thirdly, comparing water-saving rice production
    methods based on energy and GHG emissions can contribute to the reduction in carbon
    footprints associated with rice production. Therefore, comparing water-saving
    rice production methods based on various factors is essential for sustainable
    rice production and achieving global food security and climate goals. Figure 5.
    A comparison of water-saving rice production methods. Production cost: The adoption
    of DSR may result in lower cultivation costs when compared to traditional rice
    farming, as it eliminates the need for transplanting and reduces labor requirements
    for water management. Conversely, aerobic rice cultivation may incur higher production
    costs compared to traditional rice farming due to the additional inputs and equipment
    required. Similarly, the SRI may also lead to higher production costs due to its
    labor-intensive nature, including the need for manual labor in activities such
    as transplanting, weed control, and irrigation. Drip-irrigated rice may also have
    a higher cost of cultivation compared to traditional methods, as it requires the
    use of drip irrigation equipment and maintenance. Finally, the implementation
    of IoT-based automated irrigation may also incur higher cultivation costs than
    traditional rice farming due to the requirement for sensors, monitoring equipment,
    and maintenance. Soil type: Aerobic rice is most suitable for well-drained soils,
    while heavy clay soils are not recommended. DSR, on the other hand, is not recommended
    for soils with high water tables, high soil pH, or salinity, as all of these factors
    can lead to poor seed germination. The SRI is not suitable for poorly drained
    or waterlogged soils as it can result in poor tiller and root development and
    higher seedling mortality. Similarly, drip irrigation may not be ideal for soils
    with high clay content as it can lead to clogging of the emitters. However, IoT-based
    automated irrigation can be implemented in any soil type as long as the sensors
    and monitoring equipment can be installed and function properly. GHG emissions:
    The implementation of practices that reduce water and fertilizer inputs while
    promoting soil aeration can significantly reduce methane emissions associated
    with rice cultivation. However, these practices increase nitrous oxide emissions,
    as alternate wetting and drying irrigation cycles promote the conversion of ammonia
    to nitrate. Similarly, the adoption of energy-intensive drip irrigation equipment
    may lead to an increase in GHG emissions during production and operation. This
    is also true for IoT-based automated irrigation systems. Weed pressure: Weeds
    are a serious problem in aerobic rice, especially during early growth stages.
    Similarly, DSR faces weed competition due to limited water availability. The SRI
    requires more manual weeding because of a reduced number of plants per unit area.
    IoT-based automated irrigation and SSC also have weed control issues, but SSC
    uses stale seedbed preparation to reduce weed germination, and drip-irrigated
    rice reduces weed growth by minimizing soil moisture levels. Improved water-saving
    rice production systems have higher weed pressure than conventional flooded rice
    systems. However, the availability of broad-spectrum herbicides with a wider window
    of application helps the farmers to control weeds in these systems. Labor requirement:
    The labor requirement varies across different rice production methods. The SRI
    demands more manual labor due to transplanting single seedlings, maintaining wider
    spacing, weeding, and irrigation. Similarly, aerobic rice also requires more labor
    during the early growth stages for manual weed control. In contrast, drip-irrigated
    rice requires less labor for weeding but requires more labor for installation
    and maintenance of the drip irrigation system. DSR, on the other hand, requires
    less labor for land preparation and transplanting but more for weeding. Therefore,
    labor-intensive rice production systems are better suited for regions with ample
    and affordable labor resources. Climate: The SRI, aerobic rice, and DSR are not
    suitable for regions with high rainfall, as these methods require well-drained
    soil and do not perform well under flooded conditions. Drip-irrigated rice and
    SSC may not be suitable for arid regions where the availability of water for irrigation
    is limited. 3. Best Management Practices and Water Use Efficiency Water use efficiency
    is a function of yield and evaporation. Any agronomic management practices that
    increase the grain yield will also increase the WUE. Along with these improved
    irrigation methods, smart irrigation technologies the adoption of other improved
    agronomic management practices is highly essential to achieve higher yield potential.
    Agronomic management practices such as the optimum time of sowing, adequate plant
    population establishment, timely control of weeds, balance and optimum fertilization,
    the proper control of insect pests and disease, and harvest are highly important
    to increase WUE. Additionally, various agronomic practices, including crop rotation,
    water conservation through minimum- or no-tillage, the use of plastic film or
    straw mulching, regulated deficit irrigation, fertigation, anti-transpirants,
    and soil amendments, can be employed to enhance soil water-holding capacity and
    WUE of rice-based cropping systems [14]. Engineering approaches such as rational
    exploitation of surface and groundwater resources, rainwater harvesting and storage
    for life-saving irrigation and groundwater recharge, the utilization of recycled
    sewage water or marginal quality saline water, the modernization of canal irrigation
    systems, low-pressure pipe conveyance, laser-controlled land leveling technology
    [14], improved surface irrigation by shortening or narrowing borders or furrows,
    and sprinkler irrigation implementation are highly recommended to increase water
    use efficiency [109]. 3.1. Balanced and Efficient Nutrient Management Vijayakumar
    et al. (2021) demonstrated that the application of nutrients based on the 4R principle
    of nutrient stewardship (right dose, right time, right place, and right method)
    led to increased water use efficiency in aerobic rice systems [110]. A supply
    of 100% of the recommended dose of fertilizer through drip fertigation was found
    optimum for higher yield and WUE [98]. Several new-age fertilizer carriers such
    as nano fertilizers, slow-release fertilizers, and organic nitrification inhibitors
    were found to be effective in reducing nutrient loss and increasing the recovery
    efficiency of nutrient and crop yield [111]. Similarly, Jinger et al. (2020) reported
    that the application of silicon fertilizer increased the yield and water use efficiency
    of rice [112,113]. Farmers can utilize tools such as decision support systems
    [67,114], riceNxpert [115], and other Android-based applications to adopt site-specific
    nutrient management in rice cultivation [116]. Nitrogen is a major key nutrient
    to rice, and response to nitrogen application is reported in all the rice growing
    ecosystems. The nitrogen use efficiency in rice is very low (~30%) and improving
    nutrient use efficiency directly increases rice yield and WUE. Subramanian et
    al. (2020) recommended the application of 175 kg N/ha in four equal splits at
    10–12 days after emergence, at active tillering, panicle-initiation, and flowering
    for sustaining the aerobic rice yield [117]. Similarly, two to three split applications
    of the recommended dose of potassium were found to be more economical in the aerobic
    rice system [118]. In addition to macronutrient application, the need-based use
    of secondary micronutrients is also equally important. The application of iron
    foliar spray is important in DSR and aerobic rice, especially in the early stage
    of the crop to overcome iron deficiency [119]. Under surface drip irrigation with
    zinc fertigation (8 kg/ha), rice crops need 1246 L of water to produce one kg
    of rice compared to 4263 L under conventional transplanted rice with 25 kg Zn/ha
    application [94]. The water productivity is highest (1.13 g kg−1) in nitrogen-fertilized
    plots in comparison to no nitrogen (0.62 g kg−1) under aerobic rice [60]. 3.2.
    Efficient Weed Control As water scarcity becomes more acute, rice farmers may
    face limitations on the amount of water available for rice production and may
    not be able to rely on continuous flooding as a method for weed control in the
    future [120]. Though flooding helps in eliminating grass and sedges in rice cultivation,
    it failed to control broadleaf weeds [121]. Weed menace is the major problem in
    the SRI, DSR, aerobic rice, and drip-irrigated rice [119]. The occurrence of non-aquatic
    weeds increased in these systems due to the absence of flooding. The time of weed
    removal is more important in these methods. Early control of weeds helps with
    better crop establishment and turns crop weed competition in favor of rice plants
    [122]. The use of herbicides ensures that weeds are controlled at the time of
    germination. In direct-seeded rice systems, the use of a sequential approach consisting
    of a pre-emergence herbicide followed by a post-emergence herbicide was found
    to be more effective and cost-efficient than traditional hand weeding [87,123,124].
    Several improved farm tools and implements were available for weed control in
    the SRI, line-sown DSR, and line-transplanted rice. The use of these tools improves
    soil aeration, root growth, and yield, in addition to better weed control [18,125].
    DSR can reduce GHG emissions, improve soil quality, and save money on labor, water,
    and energy. However, weeds constitute a significant problem that could result
    in the total failure of the rice crop. To increase output and optimize resource
    utilization, effective weed management is vital. Compared to other weed control
    strategies, herbicides are a more efficient and cost-effective solution in the
    case of DSR. The sequential use of pendimethalin 1000 g/ha as a pre-emergence
    herbicide applied 1 day after sowing and penoxsulam + cyhalofop-butyl 130 g/ha
    as a post-emergence herbicide applied 25 days after sowing significantly increased
    grain yield, irrigation water productivity, and total water productivity by 378.9%,
    378%, and 380%, respectively, compared to the unweeded control [126]. Effective
    weed control, which reduces competition for growth resources, such as water and
    nutrients, is essential for maximizing water use efficiency in direct-seeded aerobic
    rice systems. In aerobic rice, the herbigation with pretilachlor + bensulfuran
    methyl as pre-emergence, and bispyribac sodium as post-emergence at 20 days after
    sowing, resulted in higher water use efficiency (153.45 kg/ha cm) compared to
    the weedy check (7.07 kg/ha cm) [127]. This improvement was attributed to increased
    grain yield due to better weed management in the weed-free and herbigation treatments.
    3.3. Seed Treatment Seed priming is a pre-sowing seed treatment that helps rice
    seeds overcome various biotic and abiotic stressors, leading to improved seedling
    growth and an increase in crop productivity. Based on the substance/material used
    for priming, it is classified into hydro-priming (water), osmo-priming (osmotic
    agent), halo-priming (use of specific salts for priming), bio-priming (microbial
    bio-agents), and hormo-priming (plant growth regulators). Priming does not allow
    radical protrusion through the seed coat but allows the seeds to imbibe water
    and stay ready for quick germination. Seed priming has been shown to enhance plant
    germination even in adverse soil and weather conditions. It reduces the average
    time for seeds to sprout and increases the energy used for germination, resulting
    in a higher germination index and improved seedling vigor. This helps to ensure
    more robust plant growth and development, even in challenging environments [128].
    The reduced imbibition lag time [129], osmotic adjustment [130], accumulation
    of germination-enhancing metabolites [131], enzyme activation [132], and metabolic
    repair during imbibition [133] ensure higher and uniform germination of primed
    seeds. Rice cultivation is possible with limited irrigation levels, even as low
    as −15 kPa and −30 kPa. In areas where it is challenging to maintain frequent
    irrigation and soil water levels drop below −15 kPa, seed priming with Trichoderma
    is advised, as this technique can result in a significant boost in grain yield,
    with an increase of 68% at −15 kPa and 77% at −30 kPa, as well as an improvement
    in water productivity, with a rise of 70% at −15 kPa and 66% at −30 kPa, compared
    to non-primed seeds [134]. The use of potassium nitrate as a seed priming agent
    is another promising option, especially when soil water levels fall below −15
    kPa. This substance has the potential to improve seed performance in these challenging
    conditions. Seed priming with moringa leaf extracts (3.3%) or CaCl2 (2.2%) improved
    the direct-seeded rice performance when practiced with AWD irrigation [135]. According
    to research by Hussain et al. (2016), chemical priming with selenium and hormonal
    priming with salicylic acid were found to be more effective at mitigating the
    effects of chilling stress in rice seedlings [136]. These priming methods improved
    seedling performance and tolerance by enhancing starch metabolism, increasing
    respiration rates, reducing lipid peroxidation, and strengthening the plant’s
    antioxidant defense system. Seed priming can be a useful approach to improve rice
    germination and stand establishment in the rabi season, particularly in the eastern
    part of India where low temperatures can cause poor germination. Additionally,
    Dhillon et al. (2021) found that halo-priming with 2.0% potassium nitrate and
    hormo-priming with 50 ppm GA3 had the potential to improve rice crop establishment
    and yield by 7–11% in both conventional and soil mulch DSR systems [137]. The
    higher yields were attributed to faster and more successful germination and crop
    emergence, improved root growth, and enhanced yield attributes. The priming treatments
    also activate important enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and
    catalase, and increase the accumulation of glutathione and free proline in rice
    seedlings, which protect the seedlings from chilling-induced oxidative stress.
    3.4. The Water Footprint as an Indicator of the Best Rice Production Method The
    water footprint (WF) is a comprehensive indicator of the environmental impact
    of rice cultivation and can help identify more sustainable and efficient irrigation
    practices to reduce water use and improve water quality. The WF in rice cultivation
    refers to the amount of water used for irrigating rice fields throughout its growth
    cycle, as well as the amount of water required to dilute pollutants, such as nitrogen
    and phosphorus, that may be released into the environment due to agricultural
    activities. It includes both the direct water consumption by the crop through
    evapotranspiration (green water) and the water used for irrigation (blue water),
    as well as the water required to dilute and transport pollutants in the environment
    (grey water). The worldwide WF of rice production is estimated to be 1308 Mm3
    per year, with 707 Mm3 per year attributed to evaporation, of which 332 Mm3 per
    year is attributed to green water use and 374 Mm3 per year to blue water use.
    Furthermore, 64 Mm3 per year is related to pollution, while 538 Mm3 per year is
    lost through percolation and residual soil moisture after harvest [138]. In Thailand
    and Malaysia, the WF of rice cultivation was estimated to be 1665 m3 per ton and
    2500 L/kg based on life cycle assessment, respectively [139,140]. Wu et al. compared
    the WF of paddy rice production under common flood irrigation (CFI) and water-saving
    irrigation (SWI) in Nanjing, East China, and found that the WF was 1000 m3/t for
    CFI and 910 m3/t for SWI, with a 9% reduction in WF for SWI compared to CFI. SWI
    reduced irrigation during non-critical periods, shifting the ratio of blue to
    green water fluxes in field water and using green water preferentially [141].
    Another study evaluated the WF of rice production in the Walawe irrigation scheme
    of Sri Lanka over three years. Results showed that the average annual WFblue was
    found to be 2.27 m3/kg, which is higher than global and national WFtot, indicating
    that irrigation water usage in the area may be significantly higher due to relatively
    higher evapotranspiration in the area, suggesting the need to reduce excess water
    usage by shifting irrigation practices from flooded irrigation to the SRI [142].
    In India, the WF of rice in 2014 was found to vary with region. Among the five
    rice-growing regions (south, north, east, west, and northeast), the western region
    showed the highest WF of 3.52 m3 per kilogram of rice due to the region’s high
    irrigation water usage [143]. This study also recommended large-scale promotion
    and adoption of water-saving irrigation techniques such as SRI, aerobic rice,
    AWD, DSR, etc., to reduce blue WF. Another interesting study in Indonesia compared
    the WF of conventional rice with organic rice cultivation, and the result showed
    that organic rice cultivation saves up to 52.8% of the WF compared to conventional
    flooded rice, demonstrating the potential of organic farming practices to promote
    sustainable water use in agriculture in Indonesia [144]. 4. Conclusions The paddy,
    a staple crop that feeds millions, has historically relied on the inundation irrigation
    method, which is highly water-intensive. However, farmers are still struggling
    to cultivate paddies profitably to meet the growing food demands of the world
    population amid increasing water scarcity. To address this challenge, rice-growing
    countries must embrace new practices and technologies that enable sustainable
    use of scarce irrigation water at the farm level. In response to this challenge,
    several water-efficient rice production technologies have been introduced, such
    as DSR, the SRI, aerobic rice, SSC, drip-irrigated rice, and others. These technologies
    reduce water consumption and improve the productivity and profitability of paddy
    cultivation. However, the adoption of these technologies is region-specific and
    based on climate suitability, soil type, availability of resources, and expertise.
    DSR, the SRI, and AWD are cost-effective options that are suitable for implementation
    in fields and should be promoted for immediate and large-area adoption. Despite
    the demonstrated efficiency of these improved irrigation methods, farmers have
    been slow to adopt them. Farmers should be trained in new irrigation technologies,
    such as smart irrigation using sensors and the IoT, by grassroots-level extension
    officials, as they have a poor understanding of these technologies and lack knowledge
    about the herbicide and mechanical method of weed management. To increase the
    adoption of these technologies in areas with significant water scarcity, specific
    programs with attractive incentives must be created and implemented. To achieve
    this, there must be a collective effort from all stakeholders, including farmers,
    extension officials, and the government sector, to promote and support the large-scale
    adoption of these technologies. However, large initiatives should come from the
    public sector. Author Contributions Alternate wetting and drying, literature collection,

    are edible young plants that have recently attracted interest because of their
    color and flavor diversity, phytonutrient abundance, short growth cycle, and minimal
    space and nutrient requirements. They can be cultivated in a variety of systems
    from simple home gardens to sophisticated vertical farms with automated irrigation,
    fertilizer delivery, and lighting controls. Microgreens have also attracted attention
    from space agencies hoping that their sensory qualities can contribute to the
    diet of astronauts in microgravity and their cultivation might help maintain crew
    physical and psychological health on long-duration spaceflight missions. However,
    many technical challenges and data gaps for growing microgreensboth on and off

    of microgreens, including nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation
    systems, operative conditions, innovative treatments, autonomous facilities, and

    plants that are harvested at full cotyledon expansion and emergence of true leaves
    (Xiao et al. 2012, Xu et al. 2020), have recently gained increasing popularity.
    These seedlings exhibit advantages over mature plants given their short growth
    cycle and attractive colors and flavors, etc. Moreover, microgreens are rich in
    phytonutrients with highly species-dependent nutrient profiles (Mir et al. 2017,
    Teng et al. 2021, Turner et al. 2020, Xiao et al. 2012). Microgreens can be produced
    by procedures with all levels of sophistication, ranging from at-home cultivation
    on potting mix or capillary mat (Işık et al. 2020, Kyriacou et al. 2020, Wieth
    et al. 2020) to mass production with state-of-the-art controlled environment agriculture
    (CEA) technologies (Guntaka et al. 2021, Jiang et al. 2021, Rankothge et al. 2021).
    The multitude of benefits of microgreens has incited extensive studies and technological
    advancement, a trend that has accelerated in the 2020s. Several underutilized
    species and cultivars have been investigated for their nutritional composition
    and health benefits (Altuner et al. 2021, Lenzi et al. 2019, Schayot 2021, Senevirathne
    et al. 2019). Several comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies (de la Fuente
    et al. 2020, Mohamed et al. 2022, Truzzi et al. 2021) yielded more insight at
    the level of molecular nutrition. Continuous efforts have been made to optimize
    the growth conditions with a focus on light input (Appolloni et al. 2022) and
    nutrient management (Islam et al. 2020, Patras 2021, Phornvillay et al. 2022).
    Moreover, microgreen production has benefited from a variety of emerging cultivation
    systems (Kizak & Kapaligoz 2019, Ma et al. 2019), innovative treatments (Phornvillay
    et al. 2022, Saengha et al. 2021, Supapvanich et al. 2020), and the revolutionary
    Internet of Things (IoT) (Guntaka et al. 2021, Jiang et al. 2021, Turchenko et
    al. 2020). Beyond the Earth, microgreens have been considered as a possible diet
    component for crew members in the space station(s). The rich flavor and unique
    nutrient profile of microgreens may help promote appetite and maintain the homeostasis
    of astronauts (Cahill & Hardiman 2020, Taylor et al. 2020). In addition, the convenient
    cultivation and vibrant color make microgreens a good choice for horticultural
    therapy (Kyriacou et al. 2017). Although space farming faces many challenges from
    the microgravitational environment (Hirai & Kitaya 2009, Kitaya et al. 2010),
    various technologies and growth systems are being developed or conceptualized
    to achieve successful space cultivation (Chandrika et al. 2019, Kalossaka et al.
    2021, Rai & Kaur 2012, Xu et al. 2020). This review aims to summarize the latest
    research and development on multiple aspects of microgreens, including the nutritional
    and socioeconomic aspects, cultivation systems and techniques, critical growth
    conditions, quality and safety improvement technologies, IoT and autonomous gardening,
    and the potential of microgreen space farming. It also provides the authors’ perspectives
    on the trends and research opportunities in this area with the intent to stimulate
    more comprehensive and interdisciplinary research. The fact that most of the references
    covered in this review were published in the 2020s signifies the increasing interest
    and momentum in microgreen-related research. 1.1.   Nutritional Profile of Microgreens
    Microgreens are densely packed with nutrients and health-promoting phytochemicals.
    The past four years (2019–2022) have seen a surge in research on the nutritional
    aspects of microgreens. Two subjects are highlighted in these recent studies:
    (a) the nutritional composition of uncommon or underutilized microgreen species
    and (b) mechanistic investigations via in vitro and in vivo studies. Readers are
    referred to review articles for studies published prior to 2019 (see Mir et al.
    2017, Teng et al. 2021, Turner et al. 2020). 1.1.1.   Nutritional composition.
    Table 1 summarizes recent studies regarding the nutritional composition and antioxidative
    activities of microgreens. Many microgreen species are excellent sources of essential
    nutrients (amino acids, vitamins, minerals, etc.) as well as nonessential, health-beneficial
    phytonutrients (mainly phenolics and glucosinolates). Whether microgreens or their
    mature counterparts provide more nutrients depends on the species and the type
    of nutrients. For instance, parsley microgreens have more phosphorous and potassium
    but less calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and sodium than baby greens (El-Nakhel et
    al. 2021a). For vitamins, fenugreek and roselle microgreens have higher α-tocopherol
    but lower β-carotene levels than mature plants (Ghoora et al. 2020b). In addition,
    certain microgreen species exhibit high levels of nitrate (Lenzi et al. 2019)
    or an inadequate nitrogen balance index (Altuner et al. 2021). Regarding the phytonutrients,
    although lettuce (Martínez-Ispizua et al. 2022) microgreens exhibit higher total
    phenolic content (TPC) than mature plants, Chinese basil (Dimita et al. 2022),
    radish, jute, and water spinach (Yadav et al. 2019) show greater TPC at maturity.
    Moreover, as discussed in Section 3, the nutritional profile of microgreens is
    greatly influenced by the growth environment and nutrient input. As such, the
    comparison between microgreens and mature plants should be conducted under reasonably
    similar growth conditions. Considering all these factors, it is recommended that
    microgreen species be investigated discriminatively for their nutritional properties
    and included in nutritionally balanced meals to realize maximal nutritional benefits.

    There have been several recent studies on the antiproliferative effect of microgreens
    and their underlying mechanisms ( Table 2 ). In vitro studies revealed remarkable
    and selective inhibition against cancer cells by broccoli, kale, mustard, radish,
    green pea, soybean, barley, beetroot, and amaranth microgreens (de la Fuente et
    al. 2020, Truzzi et al. 2021). Studies show that the antiproliferative effects
    of microgreens may be attributed to two factors. First, microgreens in general
    are an abundant source of antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E, as well
    as phenolics. Those compounds scavenge excessive ROS (reactive oxygen species)
    and help maintain normal signaling, thus preventing cell damage induced by cancer
    cells (do Carmo et al. 2018). Second, it has been found that certain polyphenols
    such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), trans-resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin
    may act as pro-oxidants. Those compounds produce hydrogen peroxide and kill cancer
    cells without significantly damaging normal tissues (D''Angelo et al. 2017, León-González
    et al. 2015). Recently, two comparative studies (Drozdowska et al. 2020, 2021)
    reported more potent antiproliferative effects of red-headed cabbage microgreens
    than mature plants. The authors attributed the difference to the greater levels
    of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids in microgreens. However, more
    studies are needed to conclude whether microgreens in general exhibit greater
    antiproliferative effects than their mature counterparts. In addition, knowledge
    gaps remain as to which role of the phenolics is predominant under given conditions
    and in certain pathways. Table 2 Recent studies on the antiproliferative and antidiabetic

    species. More recently, barley (Mohamed et al. 2022) and broccoli (S. Ma et al.
    2022, Theodorou et al. 2021) microgreens have been reported to exhibit significant
    antidiabetic effects. Such an effect is achieved by broccoli microgreens through
    blood lipid status improvement, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions, insulin
    sensitization, and modulation of gut microbiota. The effect observed in barley
    is attributed to two compounds, wistin (4′,6-dimethoxyisoflavone-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside)
    and phytanic acid. Both compounds activate proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-α
    and PPAR-γ subunits), which are major regulators of adipocyte differentiation
    and glucose metabolism (Roca-Saavedra et al. 2017, Sanada et al. 2016). Wistin
    has not been reported as indigenous to mature barley plants or grains, which suggests
    different antidiabetic mechanisms for mature and microgreen barleys (Zeng et al.
    2020). Similar to the case of antiproliferative effects, there is limited research
    on the comparison between the antidiabetic functions of microgreens, baby leaves,
    sprouts, mature plants, and mature edible parts (e.g., grains) (Wojdyło et al.
    2020). Further research is recommended to address this knowledge gap. 1.2.   Role
    in Physical and Mental Well-Being The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused not
    only psychological stress but also a general reduction in daily physical activities.
    Gardening is a cost-effective activity that enhances a feeling of connectedness
    with nature and addresses the problem of a sedentary lifestyle (Theodorou et al.
    2021). Growing microgreens has emerged as a favored home gardening activity. The
    convenient growth procedure, short growth cycle, vibrant color, and rich flavor
    make microgreens an excellent choice for first-time home gardeners, who may be
    more hesitant to try growing mature plants because of the complexity of maintenance
    and potential failure. Microgreens’ positive effects on physical and mental health
    are demonstrated in two studies in the United Kingdom (Gittins & Morland 2021)
    and United States (Kelley et al. 2017), respectively, which suggested that participants
    experienced less depression and better physical health by growing microgreens,
    and they would continue to grow plants as a hobby. 1.3.   Role in Food Security
    Food insecurity is a growing concern as the world urbanizes. Microgreens may be
    a suitable addition to urban farms that improves food security owing to their
    ability to provide households with a timely supply of nutrients in the case of
    emergency (Di Gioia et al. 2017). Moreover, the minimal space requirement and
    relatively high price make microgreens a profitable choice for CEA and urban/vertical
    farms, which allow year-round production under various climatic conditions. Those
    advantages have made microgreens a main food product in global urban farming according
    to a recent survey (Armanda et al. 2019). Furthermore, microgreens have proven
    to be a great educational tool for improving nutrition awareness (Haslund-Gourley
    et al. 2022) and stimulating indoor food farming practices in local communities
    (Herrmann et al. 2020). However, it is worth noting that microgreen production
    requires a large volume of seeds with relatively low biomass yield per seed in
    comparison to mature plants.  2.  MAIN AND EMERGING CULTIVATION SYSTEMS FOR MICROGREENS  Microgreens
    have been grown in various systems with diverse levels of precision and sophistication.
    Many of these systems are discussed in this section and can be used in CEA facilities
    that allow precise climate, nutrient, and light control in all locations and seasons.
    Compared to conventional open farm production, CEA enables energy-efficient and
    year-round production of crops with greater and more consistent yield, nutritional
    value, quality, and safety (Shamshiri et al. 2018). 2.1.   Soilless Substrate–Based
    Farming Soilless substrate–based farming is the most convenient growth method
    for noncommercial settings such as home gardening. These systems leverage soilless
    substrates such as peat moss, coconut coir, hemp mat, rockwool, or other inert
    porous materials (Di Gioia et al. 2017, Thuong & Minh 2020) and deliver water
    via either top-down dripping/spraying or bottom-up wicking. A common analogy is
    made between this approach and the hydroponic cultivation of mature crops. However,
    microgreen cultivation is unique in that the nutrient solution is optional rather
    than required (El-Nakhel et al. 2021b), and thus the substrates may function as
    a nutrient source rather than merely an inert support (Thuong & Minh 2020). To
    date, various user-friendly growth kits have been developed based on soilless
    substrates and gained popularity among home gardeners. One example is the Microgreen
    Growth Kit™ by Hamama ( Figure 1 ), which consists of a pre-seeded mat and a coconut
    coir substrate. This system only requires laying the seeded mat on the substrate
    and watering once. Microgreens can grow with an adequate level of water supply
    and be harvested typically in two weeks. Another example is the Cell One™, which
    is an enclosed system with pre-seeded pods and LED illumination. A user-friendly
    mobile application allows users to monitor the water level and adjust lighting
    conditions. Figure 1 A home-friendly microgreen growth kit. (a) A proprietary
    germination mat with seeded pockets. (b) Placing the germination mat after one-time
    watering. (c) Seedlings emerging from the pockets. (d) Harvesting the microgreens.

    Systems Hydroponic techniques such as deep-water culture (DWC) and nutrient film
    technique (NFT) feature higher water efficiency at the expense of higher instrument/energy/space
    costs. In DWC systems, seeds are sown on an inert substrate floating on a deep
    reservoir of circulated water or nutrient solution, where the roots develop to
    seek nourishment. DWC systems require active aeration of the reservoir. A recent
    study reported that proper aeration improved the productivity of lentil and wheat
    microgreens, while insufficient aeration led to root hypoxia and poor growth (Grishin
    et al. 2021). On the other hand, excessive agitation and aeration were found to
    cause root damage and reduced yield for Swiss chard (Baiyin et al. 2021). NFT
    systems deliver the nutrient solution continuously as a shallow, recirculating
    stream through an inclined growth tray. NFT is advantageous due to minimal root
    submersion, which boosts root zone aeration and benefits plant development. However,
    it is susceptible to pump failure, which leads to rapid root dehydration. Recently,
    NFT has been reported to provide significantly improved yield of table beet microgreens
    compared to substrate-based methods (Murphy et al. 2010). Moreover, home-friendly
    NFT systems such as Grow Wall™ are available for household cultivation of microgreens
    and mature plants. 2.3.   Aeroponic Systems Aeroponic methods deliver the nutrient
    solution via fine aerosol droplets (10–100 μm) through various atomization techniques
    (Eldridge et al. 2020). These minute droplets offer two major advantages, namely
    the highest water efficiency among all growth methods and excellent root zone
    oxygenation. However, aeroponic systems require sophisticated instrumentation
    for precise environmental control and are vulnerable to power outages or suboptimal
    nutrient recipes. Aeroponic techniques have been adopted for commercial microgreen
    production in emerging corporations such as AeroFarms ( Figure 2 ). Miniaturized
    aeroponic microgreen growth towers (Agrotonomy 2019) and prototype root chambers
    (Gnauer et al. 2019) have also been reported. Figure 2 Microgreens produced by
    aeroponic technology. (a) Seedlings growing on a proprietary fabric suitable for
    aeroponic operation. (b) A final product containing several varieties of microgreens.
    Photos courtesy of AeroFarms, Inc.   Click to view Download as PowerPoint   2.4.   Aquaponic
    Systems Aquaponic systems feature the simultaneous cultivation of fish (aquaculture)
    and plants (hydroponics). They leverage the conversion of fish waste to plant
    nourishment via naturally occurring microbes (Yep & Zheng 2019), followed by remediation
    and recirculation of water consumed by plants. This system is highly water/nutrient
    efficient and improves plant growth via its unique dissolved organic matter and
    microbiota (Nicoletto et al. 2018). However, it requires constant monitoring and
    adjustment of nutrient composition due to the mismatch between the nutrient requirements
    of fish, nitrifying bacteria, and plants (Nicoletto et al. 2018). Currently, there
    is only one academic publication on aquaponic production of arugula microgreens
    (Kizak & Kapaligoz 2019). However, it is foreseeable that this technology could
    gain more attention in the future and become a sustainable, visually appealing,
    and economically viable method for producing microgreens or other miniaturized
    plants.  3.  KEY FACTORS AFFECTING MICROGREEN GROWTH  The growth and quality of
    microgreens can be influenced by many environmental and operational factors, including
    substrate, light, and nutrient input. These factors need to be considered and
    optimized on a species-specific basis to achieve optimal yield and product quality,
    as is discussed in this section. 3.1.   Substrates Substrates can serve as a nutrient
    source and/or as an interface between plants and the nutrient solution. Thus,
    substrates may affect microgreen growth by physical (mechanical strength and support,
    water holding/wicking capacity, air-filled porosity, etc.), chemical (dissolution
    of nutrients and/or antinutrients from substrate), or microbiological (initial
    microbial load or susceptibility to microbial growth) means. Table 3 summarizes
    recent studies comparing the performance of various microgreen growth substrates.
    These results suggest that the performance of a substrate is dependent on the
    species and the goals (fresh yield, dry yield, nutrient level, etc.). In addition,
    it is noteworthy that all those studies employed similar fertilizers or nutrient
    solutions, and thus the different performances of the substrates were more attributable
    to their physical property than chemical composition. The role of chemical composition
    would have been more remarkable if the microgreens had been cultivated in pure
    water or under nutrient deprivation (see Section 3.3). Moreover, factors such
    as cost, durability, ease of disinfection, and biodegradability need to be considered.
    Overall, it is recommended that proper substrates be chosen on a case-specific
    basis. Table 3 Recent studies on the effect of substrates on microgreen growth

    K concentration but lowest N concentration T. Li et al. 2021a 3.2.   Light Input
    Light as the energy source for plant growth is the core parameter controlled by
    CEA as well as the factor most extensively studied for microgreen production (Alrifai
    et al. 2019, Appolloni et al. 2022, Zhang et al. 2020). In brief, the light spectrum
    affects yield and the contents and profile of secondary metabolites (glucosinolates,
    phenolics, etc.) in a highly species-dependent manner (Alrifai et al. 2020). The
    photoperiod interacts with the circadian rhythm of plants, regulates nutrient
    uptake and growth, and alters the production of secondary metabolites (Liu et
    al. 2022). The blockage and subsequent exposure to light cause physiological and
    biochemical changes referred to as etiolation and de-etiolation, respectively;
    modulation of such processes by manipulating the timing of first light exposure
    alters the yield, hypocotyl length, and levels of certain nutrients of microgreens
    (Kong & Zheng 2021, Niroula et al. 2021). Overnight supplementation of blue light
    may improve microgreen yield without compromising the nutritional values (Ying
    et al. 2020). Finally, short-term high-intensity light irradiation (Shao et al.
    2020) and pulsed LEDs (Miliauskienė et al. 2021, Olvera-Gonzalez et al. 2021)
    have been reported as effective ways to save energy and induce higher antioxidant
    levels in microgreens. 3.3.   Nutrient Management Although microgreens can grow
    without a nutrient solution, their metabolic pathways can be effectively altered
    by the macro- and microelements in the environment. Therefore, nutrient solutions
    are commonly used and modified in microgreen production, especially under CEA
    settings, to boost crop yield and quality. For example, one-time application of
    a general-purpose fertilizer increases the fresh shoot weight and macro- and micronutrient
    concentrations of ten microgreen species (amaranth, arugula, broccoli, basil,
    cabbage, radish, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, and green pea), despite lower levels
    of minerals that were not present in the fertilizer (T. Li et al. 2021b). In addition,
    the NH4 +/NO3 − ratio in the fertilizer affects the fresh and dry matter, nitrate,
    protein, and β-carotene content of broccoli, broccoli raab, and cauliflower microgreens
    (Palmitessa et al. 2020). Regarding trace nutrients, selenium biofortification
    has been reported as an effective method to enhance the contents of selenium,
    phenolics, flavonoids, vitamin C, and anthocyanin in microgreen species, including
    wheat, coriander, tatsoi, green basil, and red basil (Islam et al. 2020, Pannico
    et al. 2020a). Although sodium is not an essential element for plants, sodium
    salts are employed to induce salinity stress and serve as an elicitor. For instance,
    NaCl (up to 25 mM) significantly increases the levels of β-carotene, phenolic
    acid, flavonoid, vitamin C, anthocyanin, and antioxidant activity of wheat microgreen
    extract without compromising the yield (Islam et al. 2019). Likewise, elevated
    salinity increases the total phenolic content and diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
    scavenging capacity of white cabbage microgreens (Patras 2021) as well as the
    glucosinolate content and antioxidant activity of Brassica carinata (L.) microgreens
    (Maina et al. 2021). Nutrient deprivation has proved to be another effective method
    to regulate microgreen growth. In a recent study, replacing a quarter-strength
    Hoagland nutrient solution with pure water reduced the yield of Brussels sprouts,
    cabbage, and rocket microgreens by 10%, 10%, and 47%, respectively. However, such
    treatment led to remarkably increased levels of lutein, ascorbic acid, phenolic
    acid, and total anthocyanins as well as a reduction of nitrate levels by as much
    as 99% (El-Nakhel et al. 2021b). Very similar results on yield, ascorbic acid,
    phenolics, and nitrate were reported in another study on lettuce microgreens (Pannico
    et al. 2020b). In a third study, lowering the strength of Hoagland nutrient solution
    from 100% to 25% yielded higher anthocyanin content and lower nitrate content
    in garden cress microgreens, but such treatment reduced the carotenoid, total
    phenols, and antioxidant activity levels in radish cress microgreens (Keutgen
    et al. 2021). Finally, nutrient deprivation up to 12 days before harvest reduced
    the nitrate content and improved the phenolic content of lettuce, rocket, and
    mustard microgreens at the expense of lower carotenoid content (Kyriacou et al.
    2021).  4.  TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT EMPOWERING MICROGREEN PRODUCTION  Microgreen
    farming is an epitome of modern agriculture that evolves with greater productivity,
    precision, and level of automation. Such transition is largely propelled by new
    technologies, including advanced physical and chemical treatments as well as IoT-enabled
    autonomous operation. Many of those technologies were invented outside of agricultural
    science but have demonstrated many beneficial effects in microgreen production.
    This section discusses the latest technological advancement in microgreen cultivation
    to highlight and stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration between growers, scientists,
    and engineers. 4.1.   Physical Treatments Physical treatments improve the yield,
    quality, and safety of microgreens by inducing abiotic stress and altering plant
    metabolism. For instance, the advanced oxidation process (AOP) generates highly
    unstable ROS in the presence of UV-C. AOP is augmented by a solvent containing
    micro-nano bubbles (50–100 μm diameter), which generate ROS as the bubbles collapse.
    Combination of the two techniques (AOP and micro-nano bubbles) produced large
    quantities of free radicals that stress the plants and bacteria, which was reported
    to improve seed viability and increase the total phenolic content and DPPH antioxidant
    activity of roselle microgreens (Phornvillay et al. 2022). Cold plasma is a nonthermal,
    economical, flexible, and environmentally friendly procedure for food processing.
    It stresses the plant by oxidative degradation of double bond–containing compounds.
    Cold plasma seed treatment showed significant improvement in the total phenolic,
    isothiocyanate, and flavonoid contents; antioxidant activity; and antiproliferative
    effects for mustard microgreens (Saengha et al. 2021). Similarly, rat-tailed radish
    seeds (Luang-In et al. 2021) treated with a combination of cold plasma and CaCl2
    yielded microgreens with improved dry weight, total isothiocyanate content, and
    total phenolic content. Recently, a multicorona discharge model was developed
    to deliver stable plasma to large microgreen growth areas. The novel design exhibited
    a significant improvement in germination rate of up to 8% and growth rate of up
    to 3.5 times for rat-tailed radish microgreens (Tanakaran & Matra 2021). Pulsed
    electromagnetic field is a noninvasive and ecological method for plant treatment.
    By improving food reserve utilization, nutrient assimilation, enzymatic activity,
    and photosynthesis of plants, this technology was reported to improve the fresh
    weight, dry weight, and greenness of wheat and spinach microgreens (Katsenios
    et al. 2021). Low-frequency high-intensity ultrasound (20–40 kHz) inactivates
    bacterial cells by inducing shear forces, water jets, and shock waves resultant
    from acoustic cavitation in a liquid. A novel technology was developed to leverage
    the bactericidal effect of ultrasound without damaging plant tissues. It combines
    high acoustic power density ultrasound with mild heat and a CaO/Ca(OCl)2 antimicrobial
    spray. This treatment achieved satisfactory antimicrobial effectiveness on radish,
    broccoli, and kale microgreens, which was comparable to that accomplished by immersion
    in a water solution of 20,000 mg/L free chlorine for 20 min. It provides an adequate
    and environmentally friendly solution for mitigating microbial contamination on
    microgreens (Dong et al. 2022). 4.2.   Chemical Treatments A variety of chemical
    treatments have been applied singularly or with physical treatments for improving
    microgreen quality. The chemicals may impact the quality and safety of microgreens
    by (a) serving as elicitors that trigger plant defense response during growth
    or (b) acting as a preservative that extends shelf life after harvest. For preharvest
    applications, CaCl2 combined with UV-B radiation improved the glucosinolate level,
    visual appeal, and shelf life of broccoli microgreens (Lu et al. 2021). A combination
    of Na2SeO3 and UV-A radiation led to significantly improved levels of anthocyanin,
    glucosinolate, total soluble proteins, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant
    activity in broccoli microgreens (Gao et al. 2021). Regarding postharvest treatments,
    immersion of red amaranth microgreens in a solution of cyanocobalamin (vitamin
    B12, 0.1 μM) enhanced the betacyanin, betaxanthin, and total betalain concentrations
    of red amaranth microgreens during storage (Supapvanich et al. 2020). Treatment
    of sunflower microgreens with citric and ascorbic acids improved the phenolic
    content and antioxidant activity while lowering the microbial load at the end
    of storage (Dalal et al. 2020). Finally, aloe vera gel was demonstrated to be
    effective for both pre- and postharvest treatments. Consisting of polysaccharides,
    vitamins, and minerals, the gel led to less electrolyte leakage, higher ascorbic
    acid content, lower microbial load, and better overall acceptability of radish
    and roselle microgreens (Ghoora & Srividya 2020). 4.3.   Autonomous Gardening
    Empowered by the Internet of Things The emergence of the IoT has brought unprecedented
    opportunities for agricultural modernization. IoT-based autonomous growth systems
    collect extensive, real-time data on plant growth and environmental parameters
    (climate, plant size, soil/substrate moisture, nutrient solution status, light
    intensity, photosynthetically active radiation, etc.). These data are utilized
    to inform end users through interactive interfaces and drive autonomous control
    systems to operate functional components (fans, humidifiers, LED panels, robotic
    arms, etc.). These integrated systems minimize the physical intervention by users
    and thus reduce the risk of human error and human-mediated pathogen contamination.
    In addition, by precisely delivering optimal growth conditions at desired times
    and locales, these systems hold promise in improving yield, quality, and energy
    efficiency (Ragaveena et al. 2021). Compared to the broader realm of agriculture,
    microgreen production is still in its early stages of IoT adoption, especially
    on the consumer end. So far, only a few prototypes of IoT-based microgreen sprouting
    systems have been reported ( Table 4 ). These systems are claimed to have multiple
    benefits, including precise climate control, uniform temporal/spatial distribution
    of lighting conditions, energy saving, intuitive operation, and effective inspection
    over large growth areas. It should be noted that the IoT has found much wider
    applications in the production of mature plants, with many more successful designs
    reported since the late 2010s (Sharma et al. 2020). In addition, this technique
    has been adopted by several leading commercial CEA companies (AeroFarms, Bowery
    Farming, Plenty, etc.) for microgreen cultivation. Therefore, it is foreseeable
    that the IoT technology will be applied more widely in microgreen production,
    providing growers with more convenience, better energy efficiency, greater yield,
    and more consistent nutrition quality. Table 4 Internet of Things–enabled autonomous

    MICROGREENS FOR SPACE FARMING  The ability of humans to travel in space on extended
    missions may depend on growing fresh plants in space. NASA (National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration) has been testing growing leafy greens to feed astronauts
    on the International Space Station (Hummerick et al. 2021, Johnson et al. 2021,
    Massa et al. 2016). But growing plants in space faces many technical challenges
    because of the microgravity, limited growth areas and crew time, and elevated
    radiation levels (Johnson et al. 2021). Recently, microgreens have attracted significant
    attention and are being tested by NASA as an alternative or supplement to other
    leafy greens ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Microgreen tests performed by NASA. (Left)

    The unique advantages of microgreens discussed in previous sections make them
    an ideal food ingredient in space. Their short growth period and convenient horticultural
    procedures allow crew members to focus on critical missions and spend minimal
    effort on maintaining the plants. Their relatively low light and water requirements
    are beneficial in a spacecraft environment with limited water and electrical power
    for artificial lighting. In addition, spacecraft and habitats have limited volumes
    and the small size of microgreens would be an asset. Microgreens can be picked
    fresh and are ready-to-eat given proper sanitization measures, and the bold flavor
    and appealing color could enhance food presentation and astronauts’ appetites.
    Lastly, the high density of nutrients and presence of additional bioactive food
    factors may improve crew members’ health and provide adequate antioxidant and
    antiproliferative activities, the latter of which counterbalance the oxidative
    stresses and genotoxicity induced in outer space. The downside of microgreens
    in space farming lies in (a) their inability to produce progenies, leading to
    a large net consumption of seeds, and (b) their low biomass fixation and low oxygen
    generation as compared to growing larger plants (Kyriacou et al. 2017, Wheeler
    et al. 2008). 5.2.   Major Challenges in Space Farming The outer space environment
    is full of challenges not found on Earth. As noted, some challenges are related
    to the limited volume, resources, and crew time during the flight, which can be
    addressed more easily with microgreens than with mature plants. However, growing
    microgreens encounters numerous technical challenges commonly seen with other
    mature leafy greens plus additional unique challenges. First, air convection driven
    by the buoyancy of hot air is lacking under microgravity, which retards the exchange
    of heat, moisture, and gases (e.g., CO2 and ethylene) between plants and the environment,
    sometimes causing metabolic disorders in or damage to plants (Hirai & Kitaya 2009,
    Kitaya et al. 2010). This issue may be addressed by monitoring cabin gas composition
    and applying forced-air convection via electric fans. For fractional gravity environments,
    such as the Moon (1/6 gravity) or Mars (3/8 gravity), the lack of natural convection
    should not be as severe but requires further research. Second, irrigation in space
    environments is extremely difficult, as there is little or no natural drainage
    of the root zone substrates (Jones et al. 2012, Monje et al. 2003), making rooting
    media prone to hypoxia (Porterfield 2002). Various watering solutions for microgravity
    have been tested, including the use of particulate media like arcillite (calcined
    clay chips) with time-released fertilizer and delivery of water with porous tubes
    embedded in the media (Massa et al. 2016, Morrow et al. 1993), use of passive,
    capillary-driven watering as with the NASA Veggie plant chamber (Massa et al.
    2016, Morrow et al. 2017), and proposed aeroponics or hydroponic concepts that
    could contain and recirculate water (Morrow et al. 2017). However, challenges
    remain and watering plants in weightlessness continues to be an area of research
    (Johnson et al. 2021, Monje et al. 2003). For partial gravity settings like the
    Moon and Mars, more conventional watering techniques with solid media and recirculating
    hydroponics should work, but further research is needed (Jones et al. 2012). In
    all cases, considerations for sustainable approaches that minimize consumables
    and generation of wastes and recycling water and nutrients must be considered
    (Vandenbrink et al. 2014). Third, reduced gravity may directly affect the physiology
    of plants and microorganisms (Su et al. 2017, Vandenbrink et al. 2014, Villacampa
    et al. 2021). In general, the observations from plant experiments in space suggest
    that if environmental requirements for light, water, CO2, air circulation, and
    nutrients are met, plant growth is good (Stutte et al. 2005). And numerous studies
    have shown that the growth of plant shoots in space can be oriented phototropically
    (Heathcote et al. 1995, Su et al. 2017). Therefore, providing adequate lighting
    should allow proper shoot orientation, cotyledon opening, and leaf development
    for microgreens even in microgravity.  6.  PERSPECTIVES AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES  As
    discussed in this review, microgreen production has benefited greatly from scientific
    studies and technological advancements. As the microgreen industry is still in
    its early stages of development, there is plentiful room for technological advancement,
    and many knowledge gaps remain to be filled by the scientific community. 6.1.   Holistic
    Nutritional Evaluation As discussed in Section 1.1.1, the nutritional value of
    microgreens needs to be assessed using a holistic approach instead of focusing
    on certain families of compounds. Untargeted metabolomic studies may reveal the
    complex composition of nutrients and antinutrients (Tomas et al. 2021). Moreover,
    as discussed in Section 1.1.2, the overall health benefits and/or specific nutrient
    concentrations of microgreens, baby leaves, sprouts, and mature plants can vary
    largely by plant species, growth stages, and growing conditions. Although many
    studies have documented the overall high nutrient density of microgreens, more
    studies are needed that compare the nutritional profiles of microgreens and mature
    plants of the same species and under similar growth and testing conditions. By
    the same token, expanded studies are also warranted to exploit the opportunities
    of growth environment modulations afforded by CEA to produce the targeted phytonutrients
    in microgreens. 6.2.   Artificial Intelligence As discussed in Section 4.3, autonomous
    microgreen production systems may benefit significantly from cutting-edge technologies,
    especially artificial intelligence (AI), that are proven in the production of
    mature plants. For instance, AI may be used to establish a proper image acquisition
    procedure based on environment and growth stage (Astapova et al. 2022), calculate
    leaf area and estimate the fresh weight at harvest (Nagano et al. 2019), predict
    the yield and nutrition of plants at early stages (Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi et al.
    2021), and predict optimal timing and position for product harvesting (Krishnan
    & Swarna 2020). In addition, rapid detection platforms may be developed by a matrix
    chromogenic array coupled with AI to detect the early emergence of human/plant
    pathogens (Yang et al. 2021). 6.3.   Nanotechnology Nanomaterials have superior
    capabilities in encapsulating, stabilizing, and delivering small functional molecules.
    Therefore, nanotechnology presents some unique potential in microgreen production
    and broader agriculture. For example, seed coating by nanofibers could not only
    serve as a regulator for moisture and gas exchange but also deliver functional
    compounds (e.g., antimicrobials and plant hormones) with maximal precision and
    efficiency (Chandrika et al. 2019, Xu et al. 2020). Nanoparticles and nanoemulsions
    allow the stabilization and stimulus-responsive release of fertilizer or bioactive
    compounds (Maluin et al. 2021). Hydrogels can be patterned at micro/nanoscale
    precision with the latest 3D-printing technology. This technique, combined with
    novel materials (Tang et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2017) and gelation processes (Cao
    & Li 2021, Wang et al. 2018), may provide an attractive growth substrate with
    desirable physical (particle size, pore size, wettability, air flow, mechanical
    properties, etc.) and chemical (reactivity and interaction with bioactive compounds)
    properties that allow optimal microgreen growth and limit microorganism propagation
    (Kalossaka et al. 2021). 6.4.   Microbial Safety There has been a significant
    knowledge gap in the safety of microgreen products. To date, no outbreaks associated
    with microgreens have been reported. However, there have been a few recalls of
    microgreen products related to human pathogens according to the US Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA 2022) and Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA 2022). These
    events underscore the urgent need for risk analyses that identify sources of contamination
    and critical control points along the farm-to-fork continuum. Lab studies and
    commercial-scale verification are required to establish the route of bacterial
    migration and propagation. Recirculated water and nonsterile substrates are two
    major causes of bacteria propagation (Gombas et al. 2017, Misra 2020); therefore,
    proper water and substrate treatments need to be developed and validated. Microgreens
    are harvested at a few centimeters above the substrate, and their delicate structures
    render them prone to mechanical damage. Both factors may cause substrate-to-product
    bacteria migration (Gombas et al. 2017). Therefore, safe and effective harvesting
    methods could help mitigate pathogenic contamination. Finally, novel antimicrobial
    measures such as biological control may be considered for killing pathogens without
    inducing drug resistance.  7.  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Microgreens are young plants
    with great potential. These versatile, nutrient-dense crops may play a beneficial
    role in the health of consumers, food and nutrient security, and bioregenerative
    support in outer space. The utilization of unconventional species, emerging growth
    platforms, innovative physical and chemical treatments, and the IoT all have had
    a profound influence on the development of the microgreen industry. Holistic nutritional
    evaluation, produce safety, and space farming remain great opportunities for future
    research. Finally, it is envisioned that AI and nanotechnology may greatly enhance
    the productivity, quality, value, and pleasure of microgreen production in the
    future.   disclosure statement  The authors are not aware of any affiliations,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Kanjirapally, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the Republic of India, analogous to the importance
    of oxygen to human beings. It not only forms the economic backbone of the nation
    but also drives individual livelihoods and sustains our populace. A substantial
    58% of our population is directly dependent on agriculture for employment. However,
    despite concerted efforts, including the Green Revolution, the agricultural sector''s
    contribution to India''s GDP remains remarkably low, standing at a mere 17% of
    the total economy. This discrepancy is primarily attributable to the suboptimal
    yield of agricultural produce in the country. One critical factor influencing
    agricultural growth is irrigation. India''s agricultural sector''s diminished
    contribution to GDP and the substantial dependence of its populace on this sector
    translate to low per capita income levels. Consequently, irrigation practices
    often involve excessive watering, with fields sometimes being inundated for extended
    periods or irrigated unnecessarily. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of rainfall
    occasionally results in farmers irrigating their fields just before a rain shower,
    a seemingly minor issue that can have significant repercussions. Excessive moisture
    in the soil can lead to soil clogging, impeding the exchange of oxygen and nitrogen
    gases crucial for plant health and yield. Addressing these challenges necessitates
    an affordable solution, which this paper aims to propose. Our objective is to
    automate the irrigation process by integrating a system that anticipates and adapts
    to imminent rainfall events. The system continuously monitors soil temperature
    and moisture levels, making realtime adjustments to maintain optimal conditions
    for crop health. Additionally, it incorporates a rainfall prediction feature,
    which assesses the likelihood of rain in the near future before activating the
    irrigation pump. This approach ensures that water levels in the fields remain
    within the desired range, mitigating soil clogging and promoting plant growth.
    Of noteworthy significance is the system''s reliance on solar-based energy, eliminating
    the need for fossil fuel consumption and reducing carbon emissions. This eco-friendly
    attribute not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also ensures
    the system''s continuous operation, regardless of energy availability. In conclusion,
    our research endeavors to present a scholarly solution to enhance agricultural
    productivity in India by automating irrigation processes. By optimizing water
    management through realtime monitoring and predictive capabilities, our system
    has the potential to revolutionize Indian agriculture while aligning with environmental
    sustainability goals. SECTION II. Literature Overview The Internet of Things (IoT)
    represents a convergence of various technological components, including microprocessors,
    memory devices, input/output peripherals, sensors, and actuators, all interconnected
    to facilitate the exchange of information. Contrary to its name, IoT does not
    exclusively rely on the internet for connectivity; it can function within any
    network capable of transmitting data. In this section, we delve into prior research
    and systems, examining their methodologies and outcomes. Arunava Chaterjee and
    Soumyajit[VI] Ghosh proposed a novel approach employing photovoltaic (PV) modules
    to power essential components like storage batteries, water pumps, soil moisture
    sensors, and DC motor-based pumps. Their system featured an Atmega-based controller,
    and its operation was contingent on solar radiation levels and soil moisture content.
    Significantly, the emphasis lay on energy efficiency through the use of PV motors.
    Prachi Subhash Kulkarni and Jitendra Pajendra[VII] introduced a system centered
    around continuous soil moisture monitoring using moisture sensors. When the soil''s
    moisture level dipped below a certain threshold, a relay triggered the activation
    of a water pump, harnessing available energy resources. Their primary focus resided
    in the automation of irrigation systems, optimizing water usage. HGCR Laksiri,
    HAC Dharmagunawardhana, and JV Wijayakulscreriya[11] undertook the development
    of a machine learning platform employing neural networks for weather forecasting
    and crop irrigation management. Sensors measuring moisture, humidity, and temperature
    provided input data, which was then transmitted to a local processing unit, a
    wireless communication module, and ultimately to a cloud server. Here, machine
    learning models processed and analyzed the data, which was subsequently relayed
    through a web application to end-users. These users had the autonomy to decide
    whether to activate irrigation pumps, thereby controlling water levels in their
    fields, based on the insights provided by the system. Yan Zhao, Yong Long Yu,
    Jun Kang, and Aong Chey Zhag[III] introduced an IoT architecture featuring a collection
    and control layer, which incorporated NB-IOT sensors, PLC-controlled pumps, PH
    sensors, electric ball valves, and other irrigation equipment. The network transmission
    layer was responsible for uploading sensor data to the cloud via NB-IOT. Subsequently,
    data underwent computation and analysis in the terminal application layer before
    being stored in a database and sent back to the PLC through DTU for precise irrigation
    adjustments. This system offered continuous access to historical and realtime
    data, utilizing graphical representations to highlight patterns and changes. A
    proposed autonomous irrigation and monitoring system by Vaishali S, Suraj S, Vignesh
    S, Divya S, and Udayakumar[V] featured a Raspberry Pi, water pump, and various
    sensors for moisture and temperature monitoring. Communication was facilitated
    through mobile phones. This system exhibited an intricate understanding of crop
    or plant water requirements at various growth stages, enabling the precise management
    of water resources. In summary, these previously explored systems and methodologies
    present diverse approaches to address the challenges of efficient irrigation and
    agriculture management through IoT. They underscore the importance of automation,
    energy efficiency, data analysis, and user control in optimizing crop yield, conserving
    water resources, and ultimately contributing to the sustainability of agriculture.
    SECTION III. Proposed System Components Required for Our System Microcontroller
    We employ the NODEMCU ESP8266 microcontroller for our operations. This versatile
    device can be programmed using the Arduino IDE and is equipped with WiFi ESP8266,
    enabling seamless connectivity to wireless networks. It boasts compatibility with
    both analog and digital devices through its Analog (AO) and Digital (D0-D7) pins,
    facilitating a wide range of interfacing possibilities. Additionally, it supports
    serial communication, allowing connections to serial devices such as LCD displays,
    accelerometers, gyroscopes, touch screens, and more, making it a versatile and
    essential component for our projects. Soil Moisture Sensor The soil moisture sensor
    is a three-pin digital device. Two pins supply power, while the third serves as
    the output. Using this sensor is straightforward: insert it into the soil, and
    based on a predefined threshold, it will detect moisture levels and output either
    HIGH or LOW signals. A HIGH signal corresponds to a 5V potential at the output
    terminal, while a LOW signal indicates OV potential. Solar Panel Solar panels
    comprise Photovoltaic cells, which have achieved up to a 50% energy conversion
    rate from solar to electric energy in scientific experiments. However, commercially
    available solar panels typically exhibit efficiencies ranging from 15% to 20%.
    In our system, cost constraints, especially for farmers with limited resources,
    lead us to employ a 15% efficient solar panel. The provided figure illustrates
    the average solar power generation over a 12-hour duration when the panel receives
    sunlight, quantified in watts per square meter. Battery Charging and Protection
    In standalone solar setups, solar regulators, or charge controllers, are essential.
    They primarily serve to prevent battery overcharging (by disconnecting solar panels
    when batteries are full) and excessive discharge (by disconnecting loads as needed),
    optimizing battery efficiency. Motor We opt for a DC motor instead of an AC motor
    in our system to avoid the need for an inverter, which would otherwise increase
    the system''s cost by converting DC to AC power. Relay A relay functions as an
    electrical switch, operating on electromagnetic induction. When the relay circuit
    detects fault current, it activates an electromagnet, generating a magnetic field.
    This magnetic force then engages the motor in response to input signals from the
    microcontroller. Weather Api Weather APIs are open-source code components seamlessly
    integrated into various systems, enhancing daily activities. They empower online
    news sources to deliver local weather updates, enable travel websites to furnish
    realtime conditions in different destinations, assist home automation systems
    in optimizing energy consumption through temperature monitoring, and aid smartphone
    apps in planning outdoor activities based on up-to-the-minute forecasts. These
    APIs find versatile applications across a spectrum of services, enriching user
    experiences with timely weather information. Fig 1 Circuit diagram of smart irrigation
    system Show All SECTION IV. Methodology The proposed system represents a sophisticated
    approach to efficient and sustainable irrigation, driven by the careful management
    of resources and data-driven decision-making. Central to this system''s operation
    is the DC pump, a crucial component that ensures crops receive the required moisture
    for optimal growth. Power for this pump is primarily supplied by a PV (photovoltaic)
    module, tapping into the abundant energy resource of sunlight. When the PV module
    generates an excess of power, it directly powers the pump, ensuring a seamless
    and eco-friendly irrigation process. However, in cases where the PV module''s
    power production falls short of the pump''s demands, the system is designed to
    access stored energy from a connected battery system. This smart power management
    strategy guarantees uninterrupted irrigation even when solar energy generation
    is insufficient, contributing to overall system reliability. The triggering of
    the DC pump is closely tied to soil moisture levels, monitored continuously by
    a soil moisture sensor embedded in the ground. When this sensor detects that the
    soil moisture has dipped below a predefined threshold, it sends a signal to the
    system''s microcontroller, signaling the need for irrigation. The microcontroller,
    a central decision-making component of the system, subsequently engages with external
    data sources through a realtime API hosted on a cloud server. This external data
    primarily consists of meteorological information, offering precise weather forecasts
    for the system''s operational area. The key aim of this data retrieval is to ascertain
    whether there is an imminent precipitation event, specifically during the next
    anticipated interval. This step is pivotal in avoiding unnecessary irrigation
    when natural rainfall is anticipated. If the API indicates impending rain, the
    microcontroller prudently decides not to activate the DC pump, allowing nature
    to fulfill its role in watering the fields. This strategic decision prevents over-irrigation,
    which can lead to waterlogging and soil degradation, conserving both water resources
    and energy. However, in scenarios where the weather forecast does not predict
    rainfall in the immediate future, the microcontroller proceeds to activate a relay,
    in turn starting the DC pump. The pump proceeds to irrigate the field until the
    soil moisture levels reach the predetermined upper threshold. These threshold
    values for soil moisture have been carefully set at a minimum of 60 gm-3 and a
    maximum of 90 gm-3, striking a balance between efficient irrigation and preventing
    soil saturation. U th is the threshold value for the moisture, SoC(t) is the State
    of charge of battery, I(0) is the initial charge, i(t) is the current going to
    the battery (either+ve,−ve or 0) , Ppv is the power supplied by the pump, P Pump
    is the power consumed by the pump, M cont is the moisture content of the of the
    soil in real time, P batt is the power of battery, where negative state indicated
    charging and positive indicates supply, P is the precipitation in the area, t
    is the time of the current state. Soc(t)= ∫ t o i(t)dt+I(0) View Source Fig 2:

    conservation due to rainfall check The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB
    (Developed by Mathworks primarily for mathematical computing but with addition
    of simulink, it can also work on graphical multi domain simulation), we sourced
    our datasets from open sources such as National solar radiation database (NSRDB)(.gov)
    and National center for medium range weather forecasting, a national agency for
    weather forecasting under ministry of earth science,Government of India. We primarily
    sources total precipitation over the month of June and soil moisture over layer
    1(0-0.1m) and soil moisture over layer 2(0.1-0.35m) below ground. We chose 30°
    N, 75.36° E as the location whose dataset we picked to run our simulation. We
    calculated energy consumption for two systems; in the first system the irrigation
    system will be triggered automatically as soon as the moisture in the layer one
    and layer two heads below the threshold, on the flip side in the second system
    the system would trigger the pump when the soil moisture level would go below
    the threshold and it is not going to rain the next clock cycle of the soil moisture

    and found that with precipitation check for this particular data set i.e. june
    2014, 30°N 75.36°E electricity consumed was 30% less as compared to irrigation

    Cost Since we replaced diesel energy system with solar energy system, we save
    a significant amount of Diesel. Using estimation technique and data of energy
    consumed over 15 days, we interpolate the amount of energy consumed during a year.
    Using general thumb of rule of 0.4L of Diesel consumed for every Kwh of energy
    consumed we calculate the amount of diesel and cost of diesel conserved by one
    farmer. Considering 70% irrigation using groundwater and one pump for every 5
    farming families and a nuclear family of four we calculate the annual amount of
    Diesel and cost of Diesel Saved too. Assuming 1.2$ per Litre Cost of Diesel [Mumbai,
    India, March 2023]. Table 2: Guesstimation for saving of diesel Estimation of
    saving of ground water Our system used 30% less ground water during our estimation
    period of June 2014. Now estimating two crop cycles and an estimate of 900 Liters
    of water per Kg of food[X] crop required for each crop cycle we estimate the conserved
    ground water. Assuming 342 million tons of food produced during a year we calculate
    estimated amount of ground water saved. Table 3: Guesstimation on amount of water
    conserved SECTION VI. Conclusion The paper presents a study whose primary energy
    source is PV module which is already a renewable source. We used NODEMCU for as
    a microcontroller for the system and with the addition of precipitation check
    we were able to save 30% energy for our defined data set in the simulation. IF
    our system replaced all diesel Pumps In India we can save 2 Billion dollars in
    cost. Our system if implemented in India can save upto 64.7 trillion Liters of
    water. This proves that we can save energy and at the same time prevent water
    logging in the field which also yields in better health of the plantation. This

    The need to boost farm productivity has become critical as a result of issues
    such that the exponential rise of the world’s population, would need the globe
    to produce 70% more food by 2050, shrinking agricultural areas, and the depletion
    of finite natural resources. The issue has further been aggravated by a lack of
    natural resources such as fresh water and fertile land, as well as declining production
    levels of certain critical crops. Another impediment is the changing organizational
    structure of the agricultural workforce. Furthermore, agricultural labor has declined
    in the majority of countries. Physical labor demand has decreased as a result
    of the shrinking agricultural workforce, prompting the incorporation of Internet
    connectivity solutions into farming techniques. The usage of fertilizer, the number
    of trips made by farm vehicles, and the effective use of resources like water,
    energy, and other resources are just a few examples of how smart farming based
    on IoT helps growers and farmers cut waste and enhance production. IoT smart farming
    systems use sensors to monitor and automate irrigation in agricultural fields
    (light, humidity, temperature, crop health, soil moisture, etc.). Farmers can
    check on the state of their fields from any location. Based on this information,
    they can decide between manual and automatic methods for taking the proper actions.
    In this paper, we will be designing a system to ensure that a farm remains secure
    from unwanted pests and rodents. Cellular networks are a popular choice for connectivity
    because they provide broad coverage for high-speed transmission. However, high-speed
    data is not always required for IoT applications, and cellular-connected devices
    frequently experience battery life issues and coverage gaps. Mesh networks of
    the ZigBee type are commonly used in home automation. This is due to the low to
    medium distance performance it offers. However, when it comes to long distances,
    these fail miserably (a few kilometers). Although Bluetooth/Bluetooth low energy
    (BLE) provides reasonable data speeds, as seen in [1,2,3,4], its range is a major
    drawback. The range provided is simply insufficient for long-distance IoT applications.
    Devices with Wi-Fi capabilities have a limited lifespan and rely on close proximity
    to the Wi-Fi access point to function properly. This is because the frequency
    of the wireless signals used by Wi-Fi technology can be obstructed by physical
    barriers, limiting their ability to easily penetrate through obstacles. The primary
    objective of the system designed in this study paper is to protect agricultural
    fields from rodents, pests, and other intruders. For this system, the use of LoRa
    technology is most beneficial due its low cost and low power consumption. Moreover,
    it can support communication over a long range which makes it ideal for use in
    larger agricultural fields. The major contribution in this paper is about the
    range achieved successfully between the LoRa node and LoRa gateway using the SX1276
    module and the rodent detection system created using an ultrasonic sensor. The
    paper is arranged as below. Sections 2 and 3 include the related works and the
    LoRa technology in detail. The implementation details and experimental results
    are a part of Sects. 4, 5 and 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related Works Literature
    studies show the prevalent use of technology for monitoring and boosting agricultural
    produce. The system designed in [5] utilizes a Heltec ESP32 module, which can
    communicate through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LoRa. The Semtech SX1276 LoRa module
    is considered for the proposed system model, since this farm monitoring system
    requires a LoRa module capable of communicating in the 865–867 MHz band of frequencies.
    The authors of [7] and [8] presented an IoT-based agricultural device that is
    a portable handheld device to determine the state of the environment and soil.
    These gadgets include an EC sensor, a pH sensor, a temperature sensor, a color
    sensor, and humidity sensors, and GPS and ZigBee modules for radio transmission.
    The authors of [11] create portable nodes using SX1278 based on STM32 microcontroller.
    Research indicates that in a densely populated metropolitan environment, a maximum
    distance of 900 m can be traversed. In this paper, the work done demonstrates
    a coverage over 1 km range in urban environment using Arduino and SX1276, however
    [11] makes use of SX1278. The suggested technique in [12] uses a LoRaWAN-based
    architecture to collect, store, and assess a variety of metrics relevant to the
    health of each head of the herd and the habitat where cattle are kept. These metrics
    are characteristic of the bovine livestock scenario. This application keeps a
    check on intruders which could be an added security for the cattle. [13, 14] make
    use of LoRa technology to communicate data between sensors placed in the field
    and a central controller. The sensors gather information on soil moisture levels,
    temperature, and other relevant factors, and send this data to the central controller.
    The central controller then processes this information and provides relevant information
    and recommendations to farmers, such as when to water or fertilize their crops.
    3 LoRa Technology Semtech developed LoRa technology, a new wireless protocol designed
    specifically for long range, and low-power communications. Long range radio, or
    LoRa, is primarily intended for machine to machine (M2M) communication and IoT
    networks. This technology allows multiple apps running on the same network to
    connect via public or multi-tenant networks. The LoRa Alliance has standardized
    low-power wide area networks (LPWAN) for the IoT. This collaboration is critical
    for enabling interoperability among various national networks. A single LoRa gateway
    can manage up to millions of nodes. Building a network is quicker and less expensive
    since signals may traverse large distances with less infrastructure. Moreover,
    LoRa includes an adjustable data rate algorithm that increases network capacity
    and node battery life. The LoRa protocol has several layers for secure communication,
    including encryption at the network, application, and device levels. Figure 1
    shows the range and bandwidth comparison of various existing communication technologies
    such as Wi-Fi, BLE, cellular, and LoRa technology. Fig. 1 Comparison of wireless
    communication technologies [15] Full size image 4 Implementation Details In this
    research paper, the system is designed to monitor the perimeter of a field in
    real time with the help of an ultrasonic sensor for detection of rodent intrusion.
    Once the perimeter is breached, the sensor will raise a flag by sending data to
    the gateway via LoRa communication. The data from the ultrasonic sensor is sent
    to the LoRa module node which is then sent to the LoRa gateway, the gateway then
    sends it to the cloud database through the Wi-Fi module, from which the data can
    be received and read. The communication established here is bidirectional in nature,
    i.e., both the nodes as well as the gateway can send as well as receive information.
    The interfacing is achieved by the help of Arduino UNO board. In Fig. 2, the LoRa
    gateway is connected to a Wi-Fi module that enables it to connect to a cloud service,
    which is considered as a future implementation. Fig. 2 Block diagram of LoRa-based
    farm monitoring system Full size image The SX1276 module''s sensitivity of 148
    dBm, dynamic range of 127 dB, frequency range of 867 MHz, constant radio frequency
    output of + 20 dBm, bit rate of 300 kBits/sec, maximum link budget of 168 dB,
    and packet engine of 256 bytes have all been taken into consideration [16]. The
    LoRa long range modem, which has been integrated into the SX1276 transceivers,
    offers ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and strong interference
    immunity while consuming the least amount of current. The SX1276/77/78/79 can
    reach a sensitivity of over −148dBm using a low-cost crystal and bill of materials
    by employing Semtech’s unique LoRa modulation technology. It is ideal for any
    application needing range or resilience because of its high sensitivity and integrated + 20
    dBm power amplifier, which together produce an industry leading link budget. To
    integrate the SX1276 LoRa module with the Arduino UNO, a breakout board is designed
    over which the module can be mounted. As displayed in the PCB layout in Fig. 3,
    we have an SX1276 LoRa module which is connected to an SMA connector so as to
    attach the antenna. The different pins are connected to pin headers so that it
    could be mounted on a breadboard. The dimensions of the PCB layout as seen above
    is 48.5 × 41.1 mm. The pin headers are kept at a distance such that the PCB could
    be mounted on a breadboard. Fig. 3 PCB design of LoRa module Full size image A
    rubber duck antenna with a frequency of 865–868 MHz and 1 dBi gain is used to
    extend the range of wireless network coverage in a single direction. It gives
    an approximate range of 1000 m (1 km) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Prototype of LoRa module
    Full size image 5 Results In this experimental setup, intrusion detection has
    been tested along with the corresponding range of communication and its corresponding
    signal strength. In Fig. 5, the LoRa node that is attached to the fence or boundary
    will continuously monitor whether there are any intruders approaching the fence.
    Fig. 5 LoRa node transmitted data Full size image Figure 6 shows the LoRa gateway
    messages that are received from the node. These readings give the distance of
    the intruder from the fence along with received signal strength indication (RSSI).
    Fig. 6 LoRa gateway received data Full size image As seen in Table 1, the system
    has been tested over a range of 100 m–1km. The LoRa node module and LoRa gateway
    are first kept at a distance of 100m from each other to test the message quality.
    The message is received without any garbage values. These values are tested in
    a heavily populated area and not in an open field. The distance is gradually increased
    by 100 m and the message quality is tested at every instance. Till the 500 m mark,
    the message quality is the best and after 500 m, there are some garbage values
    transmitted. Since it is tested in a heavily populated area and the ideal setting
    for such a system would be an open field, these few values are acceptable. After
    the 1 km mark, there are no values being received by the gateway. The program
    includes a condition that would make sure that a message will only be sent if
    the distance recorded by the ultrasonic sensor is less than a range of 24 inches.
    The data could also be uploaded to cloud services as suggested in [1, 6]. Table

    6 Conclusion Recent government policies promote farmers to adopt various technologies
    so as to increase their production yield, this in turn is causing a paradigm shift
    in agriculture. In this research paper, a farmland monitoring system is proposed
    and studied wherein, an ultrasonic sensor is used to detect stray animals or rodents
    that attempt to enter agricultural fields, and this information is then relayed
    to the gateway using LoRa communication. Internode communication is disabled so
    as to reduce any interference. The received data could then be sent to the cloud
    and stored in a database as mentioned earlier. Hardware used is LoRa SX1276 modules,
    Arduino Uno, and ultrasonic sensors and the maximum range of communication achieved
    is observed to be 1 km. A future prospect is to connect to a cloud database and
    collect data on the occurrence of rodents and finding the problem areas by increasing
    the number of nodes in the network so as to cover wider areas. As another future
    prospect, the proposed system could also be integrated with security cameras to
    increase surveillance. The use of an ultrasonic sensor in this device serves as
    an economic option and also helps detect intruders that cannot be detected by
    cameras such as insects and smaller rodents. The use of a PIR sensor could also
    be considered to detect movement. References Dharshan Y, Sharmila B, Srinivasan

    productivity. To address these issues, the fourth agricultural revolution is emerging,
    driven by precision farming, information and communication technology, and digital
    innovations such as 5G Networks, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Blockchain,
    Digital Twin, and Artificial Intelligence. These advancements enable farmers to
    make better decisions using real-time data, reduce manual farm control, and develop
    cyber-physical management systems for improved efficiency and sustainability [1].
    However, the agricultural sector also faces the impacts of sociopolitical and
    environmental factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Covid-19 pandemic,
    and climate change, which further underscore the need for transformative digital
    solutions in agriculture to ensure global food security and resilience. Smart
    Farming, so-called Agri 4.0 [2], is a data-driven approach to agriculture that
    leverages information and communication technologies to increase farming efficiency,
    productivity, and sustainability. It is based on collecting and analyzing real-time
    data from various sources such as weather, temperature, humidity, pH level, water
    level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight, such that farmers can make more informed
    decisions about planting, fertilizing, and harvesting. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) consist of diverse sensors responsible for sensing and data forwarding to
    facilitate the delivery of measurements to sink nodes or gateway. The implementation
    of WSN depends on the nature of the farming envitonment and communication requirements.
    For instace, ZigBee and LoRa are frequently employed WSN in outdoor areas due
    to their lower cost, low energy consumption, and good transmission range [3].
    Bluetooth communication is widely used in indoor farms due to its limited transmission
    range [4]. RFID and NFC communication technologies are used in monitor assets
    in agricultural supply chain [5]. Apart from that, WiFi is not common for WSN
    due to its high costs and high energy usage; thereby does not holds much promise
    for agricultural uses [3]. Smart farming has the potential to revolutionize agriculture,
    but the lack of low-cost reliable and fast connectivity is limiting its potential.
    A high-speed network, such as 5G, is essential for precision farming. By offering
    faster data transmission and supporting various applications, including Massive
    IoT, 5G networks can enhance WSN performance [6]. 5G technology can provide the
    high-speed, low-latency connectivity necessary to support smart farming and enable
    the widespread adoption of precision agriculture techniques. Fig. 1 shows 5G Network
    as a communication infrastructure for various process in precision agriculture.
    For instance, 5G Networks can provide connectivity to remote and rural areas,
    allowing farmers to access the technology and services. Moreover, 5G also support
    the deployment of autonomous vehicles, enabling farmers to optimize their operations
    and reduce costs. This study aims to investigate the potential challenges of and
    potential solutions for harnessing 5G Networks for smart farming. The 5G mobile
    network employs a high-band spectrum to provide very high speed and minimal latency.
    Because of its higher bandwidth, 5G can link billions of devices in addition to
    high data capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. In terms of downloading and
    uploading speeds, 5G will outperform existing 4G and 4G LTE standards by up to
    100 times. 5G can connect 1 million devices per square kilometre and is also enabled
    when devices travel at very high speeds (around 500 kmph). Another significant
    advantage of 5G is the ability to deliver latency as low as 1 ms, which eliminates
    the lagging connection issues that present in today’s network generation. Microwaves
    (MWs) cannot cover vast areas because they are used as carriers in the 5G network.
    The smallcell concept is introduced to provide seamless connectivity, in which
    small base stations are put approximately 250 m apart throughout coverage areas
    and can be expanded to any extent. To connect the bigger extents, the associated
    small towers can be placed anywhere (lamp posts, trees, roofs, car tops, etc.).
    Figure 4 shows how the 5G network is deployed in rural and urban areas, which
    may span any range. Benefits of using 5G are High capacity, Decreased latency,
    High connection density, High throughput, Improved spectral efficiency, Seamless
    connectivity, Wide coverage, Increased network energy efficiency. According to
    the ITU, the most recent 5G possibilities fall into three categories: enhanced
    mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultrareliable
    low latency communications (URLLC) [8]. In the case of eMBB, the primary goal
    is humancentric interaction performance metrics such as total user experience,
    whereas in the case of mMTC, the primary goals are high connection density, minimal
    battery consumption, low cost, and complexity. mMTC specialises in building and
    facility administration, logistics, smart/precision agriculture, fleet management,
    and other areas. Fig. 1. 5G Network as a communication infrastructure for precision
    agriculture [7] Show All A. 5G in Agriculture Sector The current state of 5G application
    necessitates a description of the agricultural ecosystem, which has yet to see
    large-scale, commercial application due to the number of operational 5G networks
    that are still in construction. The development of communication network technology
    is primarily pushed by major mobile operators and micro-electronics companies
    in large-scale pilots such as IoF2020 [9]. However, they prioritise current technologies
    (e.g., 3G/4G) and particular IoT protocols (e.g., LoRaWAN, SigFox, NB-IoT) because
    they anticipate a return on investment. Small and medium-sized mobile operators
    are also interested in 5G, and they are not constrained by the need for a return
    on investment in existing technologies such as 3G and 4G. This could allow them
    to completely invest in 5G, while established companies will launch new business
    models in densely populated areas. They will first use existing technologies in
    rural areas with reduced population density. Because the proportion of rural regions
    that may have 5G coverage is expected to remain small, the potential market for
    global agricultural manufacturers to engage in costly 5G development is insufficient.
    Another component of the agrifood ecosystem is the general growth of AgTech, which
    is just getting started. According to AgFunder, the world’s agrifood tech start-ups
    raised a total of 26.1billionin2020,upfrom 19.8 billion in 2019 in 1858 deals
    and 2344 distinct investors, up from $2.9 billion in 2012. SECTION II. Challenges
    of using 5G Networks in Precision Agriculture A. Network Connectivity 5G technology
    in agriculture must address the lack of reliable network coverage and high-speed
    internet in many rural locations, which can severely hamper the efficiency and
    dependability of the technology. Poor connectivity can restrict farmers’ access
    to current information, which can have a big impact on crop yields, soil quality,
    and water usage. Additionally, data transfer may be interrupted or delayed, leading
    to erroneous data and inefficient technology use. Weak signals and limited access
    to data and services can also make it challenging to integrate 5G technology.
    B. Cost and Scalability The costs associated with the adoption of smart technologies
    and systems are the main impediment to the agricultural sector’s digitization.
    5G technology adoption in agriculture faces a number of challenges, such as the
    high cost of equipment, hardware installation, subscription to centralised networks
    and software packages, and periodic maintenance. Environmental, ethical, and social
    costs may also be linked with the deployment of smart systems. Most farms are
    located in sparsely populated regions. 5G can address scalability challenges by
    supporting a wide array of use cases and devices. Low-bandwidth wireless connectivity
    is suitable for rural areas, while high-speed connectivity is crucial for vertical
    farming. By leveraging data collected from IoT-enabled remote sensors, 5G-enabled
    precision farming enables farmers to effectively manage pests and diseases, as
    well as address climate change-related challenges. Network Scalability and comprehensive
    coverage require deploying a big number of WSN nodes and 5G base stations. Managing
    the scalability of these networks becomes a significant challenge which involves
    designing a hierarchical or mesh network architecture that allows for seamless
    expansion, scalability, and effective management of network resources. Achieving
    comprehensive coverage also demands synchronization between WSN nodes and 5G base
    stations. Time synchronization for various applications, includes coordinated
    data collection, event detection, and resource allocation. Synchronization protocols
    and techniques are needed to ensure accurate and synchronized operation across
    the network. C. Data Management Despite the potential benefits of 5G technology
    for agriculture, one obstacle to implementation is data management. The increasing
    volume, speed, and variety of data produced by 5G technology present significant
    problems for data management. In order to facilitate quick decision-making, the
    deployment of sensors and IoT devices, for instance, can result in substantial
    data volumes that must be processed and analyzed in real-time. A few examples
    of the types of data produced by 5G technology in agriculture are crop data, weather
    data, soil data, and operational data. One of the primary problems with data management
    in the implementation of 5G in agriculture is data integration. Among the data
    sources used by 5G technology in agriculture are sensors, IoT devices, drones,
    and autonomous vehicles. Data integration and analysis can be difficult due to
    the richness and diversity of the data, and data security and privacy must be
    guaranteed to avoid unauthorized access and data breaches. To enable smooth data
    administration and analysis, standardizing data formats and ensuring compatibility
    between various data sources are crucial. SECTION III. Apotential 5G-enabled Solutions
    for Precision Agriculture A. Use of Drones/UAV in Farming UAVs/drones are becoming
    increasingly popular in the agriculture sector, allowing farms and companies to
    increase crop yields, save time, and make land management decisions. They can
    perform both airborne and ground-based missions, and have different sensors for
    different purposes. Drones with multispectral imaging, thermal infrared imaging,
    hyperspectral, and lidar sensors are used to scan a large area for 3D mapping;
    counting plants; computing vegetation indices such as NDVI, CCCI, NDRE, MCARI,
    and CWSI; and capturing plant health, soil temperature, and water levels. Agricultural
    drones are typically used for low-altitude operations (below 120 m) and use a
    specific radio connection or Wi-Fi; as a result, they have a very restricted range
    of 3-7 km with a big transmitting antenna. With 5G technology, farmers can fly
    a drone over a large distance either manually or through programmed checkpoints,
    and technically, the drone can be controlled from anywhere in the world [10].
    The 5G cellular network enables farmers to receive real-time data from drones,
    such as high-definition video streams, as well as other critical sensory data
    and telemetry, quicker and more seamlessly than previous-generation mobile networks.
    Drones do not need a lot of computing power, and all data can be sent to the cloud
    for faster processing. Multiple drones can communicate with one another to provide
    synchronized autonomous flight over a geographical region and perform multiple
    tasks with minimal data transmission loss and energy consumption, allowing for
    extended airborne sensing time and cost-effective operation beyond the line of
    sight. Table I reviews some of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural
    operations. Most of the systems are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. TABLE I Different UAV based systems for Agriculture [5]
    B. Real time Monitoring Wireless sensors connected to the internet can measure
    environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, luminosity, and soil moisture,
    allowing automated corrective action to be taken to maintain normal plant growth
    conditions. Agricultural data can be in various formats and requires compatibility
    with the relevant interfaces. Figure 5 shows an illustration of these sensors
    for real-time tracking. To monitor various farming parameters, Software programmes
    such as SmartElement, Pycno, Power BI, and Tableau are used to monitor farming
    parameters, while open-source platforms such as Thingsboard and Openfarm provide
    data gathering, visualization, device management, and other functions. A 5G cellular
    network can connect a massive number of sensors (1 million devices per square
    kilometer) to a single cellular tower, allowing farmers to install more IoT sensors
    to perform more tasks more efficiently. These sensors benefit from the minimal
    power transmission and reliability of 5G technology, allowing them to transmit
    data at reduced energy levels and avoid data re-transmission, increasing their
    lifetime. C. AI driven Robots AI and 5G technology enable live video monitoring,
    remote diagnostics, and on-site prescription, as well as stabilization of drones
    and robots by precisely controlling their parameters. AI in agriculture is expected
    to increase at a 25.5% CAGR between 2020 and 2026. (AI in Agriculture Market by
    Technology, 2020). Farming industries have started adopting robotic techniques
    to make farms autonomous saving labour costs and increasing efficiency of their
    farmlands, these autonomous robots use various navigation tools, image processing
    techniques and real-time control of physical extensions, these demands can be
    catered using 5G and Software defined networking(SDN) based edge computing [11].
    In recent years, agricultural robots have been used to plant various crop varieties
    autonomously across several acres of ground. AI powered robots are used to precisely
    identify and eliminate weeds across a given area without harming crops. The different
    kinds of AI powered robots are displayed in Figure 7. An example of this is an
    autonomous potato weed control project leveraging 5G , which uses cameras on a
    vehicle and a deep learning algorithm on an on-board computer. The detection is
    a time-consuming and data-intensive process that requires expensive hardware.
    Offloading these operations to a nearby infrastructure (cloud computing) lowers
    expenses and energy consumption of electric drive robots, allowing them to operate
    for longer periods of time in the field.. You can see the robot by Agrointelli
    in Figure 6. Fig. 2. General 5G and Iot Architecture [7] Show All An outdoor demonstration
    with pre-5G connectivity worked well. More than 90% of the volunteer potato was
    properly detected and sprayed, while only 5% of the primary crop sugar beet was
    incorrectly sprayed. The results obtained were an uplink bandwidth of 120 Mbps
    and a latency of 25 ms (upload pictures, processing images, and getting plant
    locations) [12]. D. Energy-saving Techniques The scarcity and high cost of energy
    in agricultural and rural sectors necessitate the use of energy-efficient devices,
    such as low-power 5G gadgets. These devices not only reduce energy use but also
    enhance dependability, since they are less prone to power outages. Additionally,
    5G-powered wireless sensor network (WSN) sensors consume minimal energy, enabling
    them to operate for extended periods without recharging. This approach significantly
    minimizes the need for costly repairs in remote locations. Energy-saving techniques
    like Beamforming can further optimize energy use by reducing the number of base
    stations needed in rural areas. This technology bolsters signal strength and diminishes
    interference. Utilizing a generalized version of the Lloyd algorithm, it was demonstrated
    that Beamforming could maintain a quality of service of 50Mbps for 95% of users
    during peak hours [14], thus lessening the requirement for additional base stations.
    This strategic decrease in base stations reduces not only the costs associated
    with their installation but also energy consumption and waste, contributing to
    an environmentally sustainable model by lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Considerations
    must include power usage, the feasibility of energy harvesting techniques, and
    the availability of power sources in the target area. Focusing on battery life
    optimization, the incorporation of renewable energy sources, and effective power
    distribution is crucial to the success of this endeavor. Fig. 3. General 5G and
    Iot Architecture [13] Show All E. Autonomous Farming 5G provides ultra-low latency
    communication which is critical for real time control and autonomous management
    of farms. 5G-connected robots in a farm can perform actions such as harvesting
    or fertilization applications accurately and efficiently. Another advantage of
    5G is the higher bandwidth due to which a large amount of data which is generated
    by various sensors in the field can be collected and transmitted to edge computing
    which is data being locally processed instead of a centralized cloud server. This
    ensures all data is collected and analyzed in real time. 5G also supports network
    slicing which allows different resources to be allocated to different parts of
    the network based on the specific requirements of each application. This can help
    ensure that the autonomous vertical farm’s control systems have the necessary
    resources to operate properly. Overall almost all the basic advantages of 5G like
    low latency, high bandwidth and network slicing helps IoT enabled farms immensely,
    reducing costs and increasing yield. A study from ONFarm found that farms aided
    by IoT enabled devices had almost 1.75% increase in yield and energy saving of
    almost 17-32 dollars per hectors, additionally water used for irrigation also
    was reduced by 8% [15]. This shows a significant amount of reduction in resources
    used and increase in profitability. F. Faster and Reliable Communication 5G networks
    are essential for real-time monitoring and precision management of agricultural
    systems. They can provide extremely low latency communications, allowing farmers
    to collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other variables and make immediate
    adjustments to irrigation, fertilizer application, and other inputs. Additionally,
    5G networks can provide high bandwidth, allowing for the transfer of large amounts
    of data generated by precision agriculture systems. This data can be analyzed
    in real-time to provide accurate and timely insights into crop health, soil conditions,
    and other factors that affect crop growth and yield. 5G networks also support
    the use of predictive analytics, which can be used to forecast crop yields, identify
    potential crop diseases or pests, and optimize resource allocation based on anticipated
    demand. This can help reduce waste, improve sustainability, and increase profitability
    [16]. Drones and other connected devices can use LEO satellite allowing crucial
    data to be analyzed quickly. Integrating satellites with 5G infrastructure improves
    the Quality of Experience (QoE) of high capacity applications. Drones with NDVI
    sensors may gather information on the health and development of plants, and 5G
    networks can be used to send that information to computers for analysis. By enabling
    edge computing, 5G can also aid NDVI. In order to use edge computing, data must
    be processed locally, near to the point of collection, rather than being sent
    to a central server for analysis. Edge computing enables in-the-moment analysis
    of NDVI data, giving quick insights into the health and development of plants.
    This is especially helpful in precision farming, where quick action may be required
    to increase yields and decrease waste. Precision agriculture typically covers
    vast areas, and thus ensuring reliable network coverage in all parts of the agricultural
    fields is a game-changer. One of the primary determinants for the optimal placement
    of WSN nodes and 5G base stations involves geographical constraints, signal propagation
    characteristics, obstacles, and coverage requirements. Strategic planning should
    involve careful site surveys, predictive modelling, and simulation tools to identify
    suitable locations for deployment. Coexistence between WSN nodes and 5G base stations
    introduces interference issues as both systems operate in the same frequency range.
    Careful planning mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication. Techniques
    like frequency planning, power control, and spatial separation are employed to
    manage interference effectively. SECTION IV. Case Study:Deep learning-base Classification
    of Fruits Early plant disease detection is economically vital. Computer vision
    and machine learning technologies can detect and treat infections early, reducing
    disease spread and increasing cure rates. Over 374 million fruits are harvested
    annually; in 2011, 50–55% of these were grown in Asia [17]. Fruit appearance influences
    customer choices and varies depending on the place of sale. (hawkers, shop, malls,
    etc.). Most fruits are packaged by hand, which reduces quality and increases labour
    costs. Given the enormous increase in fruit production, an accurate classification
    method is vital; manpower demands must be reduced and efficiency increased [4].
    Machine-learning approaches are replacing traditional methods of fruit classification,
    such as gas sensors, infrared imaging, and liquid chromatography, which require
    skilled operators and costly equipment. Fruit classification based on images requires
    only a digital camera and an efficient model. The neural network (NN)-based artificial
    bee colony (ABC) algorithm was used to classify four types of fruits, with an
    accuracy of 76.39% [18]. A hybrid technique using an enhanced fitness-scaled chaotic
    ABC, feedforward NNs, and an optimized genetic algorithm had an accuracy of 87.9%
    [19]. Two-step classification extracted shape, color, and texture data that were
    fed to a fast NN trained by a biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm.
    Principal component analysis (PCA) had a classification accuracy of 89.11% when
    applied to 18 different fruits [19]. Fruit Classification Framework have infrastructure,
    resource engine, and data engine layers. A device sublayer, a \"local edge cache
    unit,\" MEC orchestrators, and RANs are all part of the infrastructure layer.
    MECs and RANs distribute resources to end consumers. The resource engine layer
    optimises network resources for efficient transmission. For optimization, self-organizing
    networks (SONs), network function virtualization (NFV), and software-defined networks
    (SDNs) are used. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods can be used
    to preprocess data, extract features, and categorise objects. The overall structure
    of our model is illustrated in figure 8 Fig. 4. General 5G and Iot Architecture
    [19] Show All Mobile phones with cameras record images or video frames, which
    are saved locally and then transferred via 5G to the local edge cache unit. The
    layer of the resource engine optimizes resources by learning about network factors
    such as communication quality, data flow, and network type. When large amounts
    of data must be transferred but bandwidth is limited, this is crucial for green
    communication. The resource engine layer has an impact on 5G reliability, scalability,
    and adaptability as well. The data engine layer transfers images to data centres
    using 5G technology and has a hybrid DL design for identifying and classifying
    fruits the pretrained VGG19 model and the pyramid histogram of oriented gradient
    (PHOG) feature extraction method are used in the architecture. A flow chart of
    the fruit classification process is shown in figure 9. This hybrid classification
    technique uses 5G and cloud technology to classify fruits by combining a DCNN
    model with PHOG features. This effort to combine DCNN and PHOG features for fruit
    classification using 5G technology and the Internet of Things performed significantly
    better than presently available classifiers. Fig. 5. General 5G and Iot Architecture
    [19] Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Agriculture is one of the most important industries
    that could benefit from 5G networks, but the use of 5G in agriculture is in its
    early stages. To make things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, the
    issues raised in Section 6 must be resolved. Government efforts, grants and endowments,
    public-private partnerships, data openness, and regional research work can help
    in dealing with possible challenges. Advances in AI, analytics, and connected
    sensors technologies can help increase yields, improve efficiency, and build sustainability
    and resilience in precision agriculture [20]. The global precision farming market
    is expected to expand at a significant rate, reaching a value of USD 17,110.46
    million by 2028 [21]. As world’s population is increasing precision agriculture
    can help meet the growing demand for food while preserving resources, while 5G
    can help overcome labour shortages. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

  description: Climatic factors affect various stages of plant growth, thereby affecting
    agricultural productivity and production stability. The growth and development
    of various tissues and organs during the complete growth period of plants are
    affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype is the internal cause
    for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment is the external conditions
    for the appearance of various morphological characteristics. With the rapid progress
    of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology, combined with genomics,
    bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping will greatly promote
    the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular breeding and efficient
    cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links between genotypes, environmental
    factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype data, it is difficult to fully
    understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental factors on plant phenotypes.
    Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research are gradually shifting from
    genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping began at the end of
    the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality, reproducible trait
    data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment and their
    impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance. As more
    and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately, many
    of the world's top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and
    analysis methods are the core part of plant phenotyping research, including indoor
    and outdoor parts. Modern indoor high-throughput plant phenotype detection platforms
    generally detect plants closely related to plant genetics and variation through
    automated transmission equipment and integrated sensors (such as visible light,
    near-infrared, far-infrared, fluorescence, multispectral, laser, hyperspectral,
    etc.). The acquisition of a plant dynamic growth and developmental phenotype dataset.
    Its advantages are high resolution, high controllability and high-throughput,
    which can provide high-quality multidimensional images and experimental data for
    subsequent plant phenotyping. Whether it is aboveground or underground, indoor
    phenotype monitoring usually takes the individual plant as the unit and describes
    the population characteristics by collecting the characteristics of the individual
    plant. Depending on the image sensor accuracy, the extracted phenotypic data can
    often be accurate down to the tissue cell level. Thus, the scale division of indoor
    phenotypic traits can range from populations to histiocytes. Field-oriented plant
    phenotyping platforms provide accurate and continuous collection of single leaves
    or plant organs, single plants, small plots, and entire farms from proximal to
    long distances, mainly including vehicle-mounted, self-propelled, gantry, and
    suspension as well as several types such as drones, aerial remote sensing and
    spectral satellite imaging. The field high-throughput platform mainly includes
    two types of field machinery and UAVs equipped with multi-sensors, which can achieve
    rapid and non-destructive acquisition of plant population phenotype information
    under field conditions. The combination of agricultural machinery and equipment
    with a multi-sensor platform can effectively reduce the variation in measurement
    results but is limited by the distribution of crops and soil conditions after
    irrigation. Therefore, it is difficult to quickly realize cross-regional applications,
    the operation efficiency is low, and it cannot be used over a large range. However,
    the rapid analysis of field crop phenotype information based on an UAV-equipped
    multi-sensor platform has high technical efficiency and low cost and is suitable
    for complex farmland environments. It has a wide range of applications in the
    analysis of crop height, chlorophyll content, LAI, disease susceptibility, drought
    stress sensitivity, nitrogen content and yield, making it an important means to
    obtain crop phenotype information. Plant roots are an important part of plants
    and have very important functions such as water and nutrient absorption and transport,
    organic matter storage, plant anchoring, and interaction with soil. Since roots
    grow underground, the core of collecting root phenotypes is how to visualize roots
    growing under natural conditions. Therefore, the collection and analysis of root
    phenotypic traits has become the focus and challenge of biological and phenotypic
    research. At present, the research progress of cultivation and improvement based
    on root traits is very slow, and the screening of root traits is still a very
    time-consuming task. Researchers must continue to develop systematic and large-scale
    high-throughput root phenotyping platforms suitable for different cultivation
    goals, so as to accelerate the screening of root traits and the understanding
    of root function, and to gain an in-depth understanding of how root traits are
    related to whole plant stress resistance strategies correlate to increase crop
    productivity and ultimately successfully identify key root traits for crop improvement.
    In recent years, with the continuous development of remote sensing and related
    sensor technologies, a variety of non-destructive plant detection technologies
    have emerged, providing effective means for crop phenotype monitoring, disease
    and insect pest monitoring, and crop identification. RGB cameras are a relatively
    common sensor device in crop phenotyping technology. In the experiment, a digital
    camera with visible light imaging on a UAV can be used to improve the efficiency
    of data collection and achieve rapid acquisition of high-definition images. It
    can be used to monitor crop emergence during agricultural production, rate, flowering
    dynamics, canopy coverage, and lodging. Thermal imaging sensors use an infrared
    detector and an optical imaging lens to receive infrared radiation energy in a
    photosensitive element infrared detector. Infrared imaging technology is used
    to measure plant canopy temperature to infer plant water use efficiency and photosynthesis
    efficiency. It is also used to measure the response of crops to osmotic stress
    such as salinity or drought. It can also measure the impact of other abiotic stresses
    on organisms and detect the presence of pests in the grain. Because the crop canopy
    temperature changes with time, conventional handheld infrared temperature measurement
    equipment is limited by its low measurement efficiency, and it is difficult to
    be widely used in large-scale breeding areas. However, UAVs are equipped with
    thermal imagers for breeding areas, where canopy temperature provides a new efficient
    and reliable method. At present, thermal infrared technology is increasingly used
    in the field of precision agriculture. To ensure stable agricultural production,
    increased production and food security, optimized agricultural production structure,
    and a reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers, it is necessary to accurately
    monitor and warn the occurrence of diseases during agricultural production. Experts
    at home and abroad have carried out a series of thermal infrared imaging technology
    to detect crop disease research. The importance of data interpretation in phenotyping
    research cannot be overstated. With the continuous development of phenotyping
    platforms and related technologies at home and abroad, the current plant high-throughput
    phenotyping platform can obtain massive digital images, point cloud data, spectral
    imaging and thermal imaging data, and undergo geometric correction, radiometric
    correction, and data modeling. And a series of processing processes, and finally
    realize the use of remote sensing means to analyze plant phenotype information.
    High-throughput phenotyping is expected to become the latest tool for sustainable
    production under global climate change. However, at present, there are few plant
    species as the research objects of plant phenotype information, and there is a
    lack of analysis and identification of plant phenotype information in complex
    natural environments. The breadth and depth of plant phenotype analysis research
    must be continuously expanded to establish a unified plant phenotype monitoring
    system and specifications, form a network resource sharing library, and strengthen
    mutual cooperation among developers of various phenotype platforms. Using modern
    mathematical analysis methods, the rapidity and effectiveness of the algorithm
    can be achieved in image processing and recognition software design to improve
    the analysis ability of the analysis module of the plant phenotype monitoring
    system. It is necessary to use multi-domain knowledge to carry out comprehensive
    control and establish background expert decision-making support systems to automatically
    monitor and analyze target plants in real time.

    Get rights and content Abstract Climatic factors affect various stages of plant
    growth, thereby affecting agricultural productivity and production stability.
    The growth and development of various tissues and organs during the complete growth
    period of plants are affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype
    is the internal cause for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment
    is the external conditions for the appearance of various morphological characteristics.
    With the rapid progress of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology,
    combined with genomics, bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping
    will greatly promote the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular
    breeding and efficient cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links
    between genotypes, environmental factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype
    data, it is difficult to fully understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental
    factors on plant phenotypes. Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research
    are gradually shifting from genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping
    began at the end of the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality,
    reproducible trait data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment
    and their impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance.
    As more and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately,
    many of the world''s top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and
    analysis methods are the core part of plant phenotyping research, including indoor
    and outdoor parts. Modern indoor high-throughput plant phenotype detection platforms
    generally detect plants closely related to plant genetics and variation through
    automated transmission equipment and integrated sensors (such as visible light,
    near-infrared, far-infrared, fluorescence, multispectral, laser, hyperspectral,
    etc.). The acquisition of a plant dynamic growth and developmental phenotype dataset.
    Its advantages are high resolution, high controllability and high-throughput,
    which can provide high-quality multidimensional images and experimental data for
    subsequent plant phenotyping. Whether it is aboveground or underground, indoor
    phenotype monitoring usually takes the individual plant as the unit and describes
    the population characteristics by collecting the characteristics of the individual
    plant. Depending on the image sensor accuracy, the extracted phenotypic data can
    often be accurate down to the tissue cell level. Thus, the scale division of indoor
    phenotypic traits can range from populations to histiocytes. Field-oriented plant
    phenotyping platforms provide accurate and continuous collection of single leaves
    or plant organs, single plants, small plots, and entire farms from proximal to
    long distances, mainly including vehicle-mounted, self-propelled, gantry, and
    suspension as well as several types such as drones, aerial remote sensing and

    Location: New Delhi, India SECTION I. Introduction The world is tending towards
    new emerging technology for their day-to-day work and it becomes necessary to
    trend them to agriculture also. Major developing countries have agriculture as
    a major contributor to their economy. When we specifically talk about India''s
    Economy, Indian agriculture contributes 18% to Indian''s gross domestic products
    (GDP), and it provides 50% of the employment to the Indian workforce shown in
    fig. 1. Fig. 1. Role of agriculture in the Indian economy Show All Many researchers
    have been done in the field of agriculture. IoT provides an environment where
    animals, people, or objects are managed together with a unique identifier that
    is capable of transmitting data over the internet without the need for human-computer
    or human-human interaction. Nowadays, the IoT-based devices are beginning to impact
    the vast range of industries from health, manufacturing, communication, and also
    the agriculture in order to increase the performance in all sectors. The IoT and
    allied devices have the capabilities of the basic communication infrastructure.
    This technology also provides a high scope of services ranging from remote; or
    local data acquisition, decision making, user interface, cloud-based intelligent
    information analysis and make agriculture operations automate. These capabilities
    can transform the agriculture industry to a higher level. Engineers and researchers
    around the world are bringing forward distinct techniques and frameworks and from
    these suggestions, huge variations of devices/equipments are available to monitor
    and fetch information regarding different stages of crop production. And to meet
    the market request and many leading manufacturers are now providing a large range
    of robots, communication devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [4], sensors,
    and other machinery to provide sensed data. Most of the recently published articles
    either show limited focus on various IoT based architecture or provide no insight
    for the use of these devices in food quality and other future aspects. This article
    helps engineers and researchers to implement the Internet of Things-based devices
    and technology to obtain the preferred smart agriculture. And the second phase
    of the article will focus on the role of various technologies and equipments like
    robots, sensors, UAVs being used in precise agriculture. The third phase of this
    article focuses on the challenges of IoT based devices in agriculture and the
    last phase contains the conclusion. SECTION II. Major Application of IoT in Agriculture
    Through implementing IoT technologies with the latest sensing devices in agriculture,
    the traditional farming is transformed fundamentally. Currently, by integrating
    these technologies and devices into agriculture, the agriculture will rise to
    a higher level than was previously unimaginable. Through smart agriculture, IoT
    also helps to provide the solution to many issues in traditional farming. Fig.
    2 shows the applications, services, and sensors for smart agriculture. Fig. 2.
    Applications, services, and sensors for smart agriculture Show All A. Soil Quality
    and Sampling The first step in farming is the soil preparation, sampling, and
    examination of soil to obtain field-specific information like fertility, humidity,
    nitrogen level, etc. The main aim of soil quality testing is to find the nutrients,
    and nitrogen levels in the soil, so that further protective measures can be taken
    accordingly. The major factors that are very important to analyze nutrition level
    consist of soil type, fertilizers used, cropping history, topography, irrigation
    level, etc. The soil mapping can be used to sow a different variety of crops in
    a specified field. Nowadays, many agro manufacturers provide a wide variety of
    sensors and toolkits which can help farmers to track the soil quality by using
    these devices. These advanced systems can allow a farmer for monitoring water
    holding capacity, soil properties, absorption, and pollution in the soil. In 2009,
    a satellite named as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) was launched to help
    the farmers, which provides the global soil moisture map for everyone and two
    days of interval. B. Field Irrigation For smart agriculture various controlled
    irrigation methods are available such as sprinkler and drip irrigation are nowadays
    recommended to solve the problem of wastage of water. The crop quantity and quality
    effected very badly due to water shortage. The traditional irrigation methods
    need to be changed by acquiring the IoT-based technologies. The (CWSI)-based irrigation
    management (2) is one of the IoT-based techniques which is helpful to increase
    the crop efficiency. Fig. 3 shows the IoT deployments in agriculture fields. Fig.
    3. IoT deployment in agriculture field Show All C. Use of Fertilizers A fertilizer
    is a composition of nutrients that would be either a natural or chemical substance.
    The fertilizers help in the growth and crop fertility. The major macronutrients
    needed by plants are phosphorus (P) helps in the growth of root, fruit, and flower
    development; nitrogen (N) for leaf growth and potassium (K) helps in the growth
    of stem and movement of water [5]. The excessive use of these fertilizers may
    result in a financial loss as well as it harms the soil and the environment. The
    crop can absorb less than the half of these fertilizers and the rest of the amount
    of these fertilizers emitted to the atmosphere. The fertilizers under smart agriculture
    can be precisely estimated and the required amount of fertilizers will be sprayed
    in the fields. The fertigation [6] and chemigation [12] [13] are the advantages
    of IoT-based technology. In these techniques, fertilizers and pesticides will
    be applied using the irrigation method. D. Crop Disease Many techniques such as
    automatic VRT chemigation [19] and vehicle precise spray are mainly used for fertilization
    and disease treatments. Also, the recent development in agricultural robots provides
    new solutions for crop disease detection and monitoring. When an agricultural-robot
    is equipped with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    the robot can able to deal with the pest problem more precisely. These IoT-based
    robots have major advantages that can decreases the overall expenditures and can
    help to restore the natural climate as well. SECTION III. Literature Review S.
    Navulur, A.S.C.S. Sastry and G.M.N. Prasad [23], proposed a research on agricultural
    management using IoT and wireless sensors. They have proposed a solar power automation
    system for agricultural activities using IoT based devices and wireless sensors.
    The hardware system built on Raspberry-Pi is constructed to connect through a
    user device so, that a user can get access those activities using the internet.
    E. Sisinni, A. Saifullah, S. Han, U. Jennehag, and M. Gidlund [7], proposed a
    review work on the industrial IoT framework. They focus on the major concept of
    industrial IoT, Industry 4.0, and the challenges associated with real time performance
    and energy efficiency, interoperability, coexistence privacy, and security. M.
    Ayaz, M. Ammad-Uddin, I. Baig, and E.M. Aggoune [16], have done a review on the
    civil applications, prototype, and integration of wireless sensors through IoT.
    The research focuses on the recent developments in the area of wireless networks
    and sensors to meet the current challenges in smart agriculture. J. Lin et al.,
    [14], proposed a survey on the framework, enabling technologies, privacy, and
    security of IoT. They explore the relationship between the IoT and the cyber physical
    system. They also illustrate how edge computing-based Internet of Things can be

    SECTION IV. Research Gap After analyzing the literature survey, the following
    research gap has been identified: Traditional farming has a lack of communication,
    automation, real-time forecast, and lack of reach. Very few data analysis techniques
    or tools are available which unable to provide the accurate results. The adoption
    of new and advanced Internet of based-devices in agriculture may increase the
    productivity and preciseness. The Internet of Things-based devices can provide
    the accurate data, and real-time field surveillance. SECTION V. Major Technologies
    Used in Smart Agriculture Most of the tasks in smart farming are nowadays usually
    done by using heavy machinery like tractors, harvesters, and robots which support
    remote sensing technology either fully or partially. In precision farming, the
    tasks like the sowing of seeds, fertilization, irrigation of agricultural land,
    and harvesting of crops are being done by vehicles that contain GPS and GIS features.
    The benefit of a precision agriculture depends upon the accuracy of data collection
    that can be done either by a multifunctional imaginary device using a remote sensing
    platform or by the various sensors deployed for their specific purpose. So, the
    use of major technologies like GIS/GPS-based devices or multipurpose sensors may
    increase the precision of agriculture. Fig. 4 shows the use of major technology
    used in smart agriculture. Fig. 4. Major technologies used for smart agriculture
    Show All A. Wireless Sensors in Agriculture All the majorly required equipments
    needed for smart agriculture is easily available in the market. The wireless sensors
    are key elements when it comes to collecting the data from the agriculture field.
    The wireless sensors either may be used stand-alone or they may be integrated
    into advanced agriculture tools and other machinery. Table I shows major wireless
    sensors used in agriculture fields according to their working procedures and requirement.
    Table I. Show the various sensors used in smart agriculture B. Harvesting Robots
    During the production process, harvesting is the most important stage. This is
    the final stage that is carried out to get crop output. In some crops, harvesting
    is done one time and end of the session and in other crops, it may be done weekly
    or daily basis harvesting. The harvesting of the crop must be done at the right
    time otherwise it affects the crop production. If the harvesting is done early
    or late then the production is affected. Many researchers have done their research
    on the use of harvesting robots in agriculture [20] [22] [27]. They use the robots
    to detect the shape, size, and color of fruits, and then the robots can perform
    the harvesting process depends the data provided to them. Agribots is semi-automatic
    and specialized robots and performs the specific task. They can collect the fruits
    from the crop plants easily. Fig. 5 shows the different Agribots used in agriculture.
    Fig. 5. Different agribots used in agriculture Show All C. Various Important Smartphone
    Apps for Agriculture Table II shows the various Smartphone apps used for agricultural
    applications. Table II. Show the various smartphone apps used in agricultural
    applications SECTION VI. Implementation of Sensors in the Field Fig. 6. Implementation
    of sensors in the field Show All To solve the problem of irrigation and maintaining
    the temperature in the field the above-proposed framework is designed. The temperature
    sensor measures the temperature or provides variations in the temperature and
    it monitors the temperature of the field. The moisture sensor provides the details
    of moisture of soil by which farmers can determine the need for water required
    by the crop. The RFID technology is also used with the sensors as a result of
    which helps to identify that the crop needs variation in temperature and the needed
    water. With the help of RFID, the sensors data like the variation in temperature
    and need for water then can be sent to the receiver or to the end-user as shown
    in fig. 6. SECTION VII. Automated Sprayer Drone for Spray Pesticides in Agriculture
    Field A. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Agriculture Nowadays, the IoT has developed
    to higher levels and it is used in many industries such as farming (fishing, poultry,
    etc.). When the communication is concerned in agricultural fields the communicating
    technologies have their restrictions due to limited range and limited bandwidth
    and also the latest communication is very hard to implement in rural areas. In
    this situation, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are the alternative solution.
    As UAVs can communicate across the entire field through the wireless sensors spread
    over the field. The UAVs can easily collect the data from the fields for further
    processing. The UAVs are also known as Drones, they have equipped with a camera
    of high-resolution, multiple sensors, and can fly through thousands of hectares
    of fields. B. Objective Using necessary components assemble a sprayer drone. To
    propose a mechanism for controlling, spraying, and other parameters like monitoring
    water tank status, spraying speed control, and fixing sprayer at a particular
    location in the field. To spray pesticides and chemicals aerially. C. Method Used
    The Automatic Controlled Aerial Sprayer Drone (ACA SD) consists of two main units:
    The Quadcopter and the Spraying Mechanism. 1. Drone Quadcopter The initial components
    for assembling a Quadcopter are the Flight Controller Board(FCB), Electronic Speed
    Controller(ESC), DC Motors, Global Positioning System(GPS), Wireless Transceiver,
    Propellers, Frame, and Batteries, etc. Fig. 7. Block diagram of automatic controlled
    aerial sprayer drone (ACASD) Show All The movement, positioning, and lifting of
    the drone are managed and maintained by Flight Controller Board(FCB). The FCB
    can be easily programmed to handle a variety of sensors like barometer, GPS, gyroscope,
    accelerometer, and other components such as motor, etc. The functions of the Flight
    Controller (fig. 7) of the Quadcopter are as follows: 2. Attitude Controller The
    drone will hover at the desired altitude at first, then switch to Altitude Hold
    mode, which will keep it there until it is turned back. A current altitude barometer
    is used to determine the current altitude. Additional sensors, like as sonar,
    can be utilized to get more precise height readings. 3. Stability Controller Sensors
    such as an accelerometer and a gyroscope keep the drone stable throughout the
    program. 4. GPS Controller It''s only utilized in self-contained mode. In this
    mode, the FCB uses a feedback mechanism to compare stored GPS data with acquired
    GPS to modify the speed of the motors so that they can navigate the prescribed
    course. After arriving at the final destination, the drone is securely landed.
    5. Motor Speed Controller The speed of the motors can be changed to fulfill the
    desired task based on variations in the values of various sensors. Fig. 8. Spraying
    mechanism of drone Show All 6. Spraying Mechanism of Drone The spraying mechanism
    (Fig. 8) is mostly made up of an Arduino UNO microcontroller that has been configured
    to do a variety of tasks. A 250ml tank with a water pump is also included. A splitter
    is linked to this water pump, which spits the insecticide out to the two nozzles
    connected at opposing ends, allowing for spraying. It also has a motor driver
    circuit for controlling spraying speed and a pesticide level indicator circuit
    with a buzzer for sensing when the pesticide is running low. 9. Pump Control-ON/OFF
    It is used to turn on and off the water pump that sprays. This is accomplished
    by delivering a 5V control signal from Arduino to the motor driver circuit. 10.
    Spraying Speed Control A PWM signal is sent to the motor driver IC to increase
    spraying speed. The speed of spraying can be regulated using the ton time of this
    signal. 11. Water Tank Status Using a water level sensor, the tank''s state will
    be monitored. If the pesticide level falls below the threshold, say 25ml in the
    prototype, a control signal is sent to the Arduino, which activates the buzzer.
    As a result, once the operator hears the buzzer, he can land the quadcopter and
    refill the batteries. SECTION VIII. Challenges Various researchers have done their
    research regarding the impact and usage of the IoT in agriculture. The research
    challenges occur in IoT-based agricultural applications. This study has identified
    a few unfolded IoT-based agricultural challenges. Protection and prevention of
    devices and sensors used in IoT-based agriculture from heavy-rain, winds, fire,
    and extreme weather conditions. A secure transmission of information with high
    ratability and energy-efficient network-based setup. The selection of appropriate
    IoT based devices technologies and tools for the implementation of smart agriculture.
    A highly secure and reliable security mechanism must be proposed for each IoT
    device during design and implementation in smart agriculture. Optimization and
    resource utilization is a major concern in IoT-based smart farming. Mobility and
    cost analysis is also one of the major challenges in smart agriculture. SECTION
    IX. Conclusion The farming in India majorly depends upon the weather conditions.
    Traditionally, the farmers used their knowledge and experiences for performing
    farming practices. But due to a lack of accurate knowledge, it''s become very
    critical to analyze the weather conditions. Smart/precision agriculture can not
    only provide the accurate knowledge about the weather conditions but the Internet
    of things-based devices can help them to monitor the farm and also notify the
    upcoming diseases/pests in the agricultural land. By using sophisticated sensors,
    the farmer can able to determine the soil health, the exact time for sowing of
    the crop, irrigation of crop, pest/disease control, and harvesting of crops. The
    Internet of Things-based devices make the farmer independent and by using those
    farmers can increase the overall productivity of the crops without loss. Moreover,
    a high initial cost is required to invest in sensors, drones, and bots for their
    purchasing and setting up in the field. These sensors require time to time maintenance,
    so the farmers should be familiar with these technologies or may have taken some
    training before setting IoT-based devices in the field. The future crop production
    techniques must be better, smarter, and efficient enough so that the food demand
    of the growing population should be satisfied. The IoT based devices must be used
    to transform the traditional agriculture into smart agriculture. To implement
    the smart agriculture various IoT-based architectures, wireless sensors, UAVs,
    new communication technologies must be used. A summary of current and future technologies
    is provided to help engineers and researchers. Based on this we can conclude that
    by using IoT based devices in agricultural lands, they may help in the enhancement
    of productivity and reduce the risk involved in agriculture. It is possible to
    obtain effective pesticide spraying through successful implementation. Human exposure
    to highly harmful pesticides can be avoided. This method can also be employed
    in areas where laborers are scarce. Pesticide spraying can be sped up to cover
    a wide area in a short amount of time. It is possible to avoid encounters with
    venomous snakes, which can be found in fields regularly. Environmental contamination
    can be reduced because spraying is done from a lower altitude. SECTION X. Future
    Scope The quadcopter''s weight lifting capacity can be improved by increasing
    the number of motors, propeller size, or motor rpm. Increasing the battery capacity
    can extend the flight time. The carrying capacity of pesticides can be improved
    by increasing the tank''s size. A larger area can be covered by using a larger
    number of nozzles grouped in an array. The spraying angle may be regulated for
    precise spraying. ACKNOWLEDGMENT I am very thankful to the Department of Computer

    demand for food, both in order to ensure quality and quantities, has accelerated
    the need of industrial growth and intensive methods of production in agriculture.
    At the forefront of the new agricultural era, there is an emerging Internet of
    Things (IoT) market that is suggesting several creative solutions. Research organizations
    and scientific associations are seeking to increase their own scope and speed
    by connecting with IoT, contributing technologies and goods to a range of different
    agriculture markets. The IoT idea gained prominence in the year 2000, with the
    development of the Auto-ID at MIT and the subsequent market research reports.
    In IoT, these systems communicate, perceive, and connect with internal & external
    state embedded technologies [1]. IoT is widely seen as the next-generation technologies
    with widespread applicability across almost every facet of the market, with the
    ability to increase the degree of integration of end products, systems, and services.
    IoT technologies are ideal for a number of applications, including healthcare
    services, smart communities, traffic management, agricultural systems, and security
    facilities. ICT(Information and Communication Technologies) being integrated into
    conventional agricultural activities is helping to spark a fourth farming revolution.
    An important facet of technologies such as machine learning, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles), Remote Sensing, Big Data Analytics, etc. is having the capability to
    boost farming activities to new heights. A broad variety of agricultural parameters,
    such as environmental factors, production status, soil condition, irrigation water,
    herbicides and pesticides, weed control, and greenhouse output climate, may be
    tracked in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, and maintain
    process inputs. Smart agriculture and the use of reduced pesticides and fertilizers
    in crops will help to mitigate leaching issues and pollution, as well as the effects
    of climate change, in precision agriculture [2]. Burgeoning IoT technology offers
    many new solutions and further growth opportunities, particularly for novel ideas
    in the agricultural sector. We also benefited greatly from recent developments
    in communication systems and protocols [3], primarily on the lower layers, which
    is the physical, network, and link layer. Besides that, the protocols in the topmost
    layers of the network are critical for effective data exchange and gathering.
    There are many applications, procedures, and designs that can be used in the agricultural
    sector as a whole. There are several ongoing developments in IoT agriculture research
    that involve network engineering and applications, device design, security challenges.
    Furthermore, in several nations and institutions around the world, various IoT
    guidelines and policies have been adopted in agriculture. However, an impressive
    amount of research has been done on IoT and there is still a great need for further
    research on the topic in the agricultural field. This survey paper examines numerous
    challenges and trends related to smart agriculture. 2. IoT-based smart agriculture
    The IoT is reshaping the agriculture sector by providing farmers with a diverse
    set of tools to address several challenges faced by them on the field. Farmers
    can connect to their farm from almost anywhere and at any time using IoT-enabled
    technologies. Sensors and actuators are used to regulate farming processes, while
    wireless sensor networks are being used to monitor the farm. Wireless cameras
    and sensors were used to remotely monitor the farm and collect data in the form
    of videos and pictures. Farmers can also use IoT to keep up with the current conditions
    of their agricultural land using a smart phone from anywhere in the world. IoT-enabled
    technologies have the potential to deplete the crop production cost and increase
    productivity of the land. Some of the key role played by IoT in smart agriculture
    is illustrated via Fig. 1. i. Water management: A major challenge in greenhouses
    is determining the exact amount of water required [4]. To prevent unnecessary
    water use, smart sensors are installed and operated using a variety of IoT techniques.
    Water storage in greenhouses is achieved by the use of automated drip irrigation,
    which is regulated by a soil moisture threshold. Water management may be handled
    effectively via IoT technology by avoiding water waste through the use of various
    kinds of sensors. The sensors are used to monitor the amount of water in the tank,
    and data is saved on the cloud through a mobile application. Farmers may monitor
    the water level using their cell phones. The motor will operate automatically
    as a result of this technology. If the water level drops, the motor automatically
    turns on, and if the water level is high, the motor will shut down. Up to 50%
    of this water is lost in conventional irrigation systems owing to over-watering
    due to inadequacies in traditional irrigation techniques and systems [3]. To address
    this issue, smart irrigation systems powered by IoT assist farmers in avoiding
    water waste and improving crop quality via timely watering. Temperature and soil
    sensors are installed on fields in smart irrigation systems; these sensors communicate
    field information to farmers via a knowledge gateway. Weather-based precision
    agriculture controllers monitor and modify irrigation schedules depending on local
    weather information. ii. Irrigation management: It is in charge of anticipating
    the design, improvement, operation and management of irrigation systems. Tracking
    water requirements of crops based on gathered data and actuating the water flow
    in accordance with the anticipated needs without the participation of human operators
    is one of the objective of irrigation systems. It uses dispersed sensors to monitor
    different soil, water body, plant, and micro-climate factors. The irrigation technique
    (e.g., spray, drip, flooding and nebulizer) has an influence on how to properly
    monitor the water body as well as the actuation mechanism. Weather is one of the
    most significant variables in calculating agricultural water needs. The IoT will
    help to upgrade the new irrigation infrastructure in a more fascinating way. By
    tracking weather and soil conditions, a farmer can refine his irrigation system
    in a variety of ways [5]. Weather prediction data, manage and track the whole
    farm from almost anywhere, Ethernet, and WIFI are all exemplars of how IoT technology
    tracks irrigation systems. Smart irrigation systems driven by the IoT make use
    of field-deployed sensors to monitor soil properties, weather and climatic conditions,
    and agricultural terms for irrigation. iii. Soil management: Soil management entails
    determining various soil parameters such as pH, moisture content, and so on. These
    parameters can be conveniently calculated using IoT sensors. Farmers will then
    take measures such as fertilization, drainage, irrigation, and so on. Soil management
    assists in the discovery of the right plant breed. It also assists in the identification
    of fertilizer needs in the soil. It necessitates a low-latency network for urgent
    intervention. For both enterprises and farmers, soil monitoring has been among
    the most challenging activities in agriculture. There are several environmental
    concerns in soil testing that have an impacts on crop productivity. If these types
    of problems are correctly defined, farming patterns and procedures can be readily
    understood. Soil Humidity, Precipitation, Fertilization, and Temperature are among
    the factors being monitored. The moisture content of soil is monitored using moisture
    and humidity sensors. The findings of a soil testing research survey improve crop
    production and propose fertilization options to farmers [6]. Furthermore, using
    IoT technology to identify polluted soil protects the field from over-fertilization
    and crop degradation. Soil management protects and improves the productivity of
    the soil. Additionally, it lowers input costs, avoids pollution, and increases
    agricultural yields and quality. Prior to planting, the topsoil should be in the
    optimal fitness level for the crop in order to promote fast and effective root
    development. While each farm and crop has unique soil needs, there are a few measures
    that may help promote good soil biology such as: organic fertilization, soil analysis,
    proper tillage, measure for chemical soil protection, etc. iv. Weather management:
    Many relevant factors are combined to preserve and establish an optimal ambience
    for plants while staying under strict limits, such as airflow, temperature, ,
    and levels. This can be achieved by deploying an IoT-enabled ecosystem, in which
    smart sensors and devices exchange data for improved decision-making [7]. Weather
    have the greatest impact on crop production. Farmers can decide the best time
    for planting, irrigation, and harvesting using an IoT-enabled weather forecasting
    system. Probabilistic weather analyses were done using sensors in IoT applications.
    Farmers can learn about environmental conditions such as soil moisture, humidity,
    and air temperature by embedding remote sensors in the fields. Farmers should
    prepare accordingly and adjust the harvesting and irrigation period to boost the
    crop based on historical results. Farmers should take proactive measures to ensure
    a safe crop harvest by arranging and reviewing collected data. v. Precision farming:
    It is an IoT-based farming technique which primarily entails the analysis of data
    collected in the field in order to determine the most productive crop. Farmers
    gather data using sensors and analyze it for forecasting in precision farming.
    Farmers may use the information collected to schedule their farming operations,
    including what seeds to sow, how much fertilizer to use, when to harvest, and
    also what crop yields to expect. Farmers may also track the farm through sensors
    that detect moisture levels, crop output, and livestock levels with the deployment
    of IoT. The sensors can effectively monitor irrigation machinery from afar. The
    data collected on the land is analyzed by IoT linked devices, making data-driven
    decisions on resource allocation and crop harvesting. The conventional method
    of farming to maximize yield and preserve crops was focused on physical inspection,
    and if there was a problem, it was typically resolved after a severe event involving
    the farm, and it was performed on a trial and error basis. However, in precision
    farming using IoT applications, anything can be pinpoint sooner and behave in
    compliance with the collected data. IoT innovations are assisting farmers in increasing
    agricultural output quantity while maintaining efficiency, productivity, and cost
    effectiveness. Farmers will face a variety of problems, including water shortages
    and floods, a lack of suitable land for crop plantations, and cost control. Farmers
    can reduce possible missteps and increase returns by implementing the IoT infrastructure
    and associated technology. IoT-enabled farming allows farmers to make fast decisions
    depending on the circumstances. The use of IoT in farming would greatly improve
    operational productivity. For example: A precision agricultural practice is one
    that involves assessing a field’s inherent soil variability. When the soil in
    a particular region retains more water, crops may be sown more thickly and irrigation
    can be used sparingly. Alternatively, if the plot is utilized for grazing, it
    may accommodate a greater number of cattle than a comparable area with lower soil
    quality. vi. Nutrient management: Nutrient management entails making the most
    effective use of crop nutrients while also preserving the environment. Nutrient
    management is based on the concept of matching soil nutrient supplies with crop
    needs. Nutrients help in producing optimal crop yields when supplied in the appropriate
    amounts and at the right times; providing too little will restrict output, while
    applying too much will not make practical sense and may damage the environment.
    Nutrients that are not properly used by crops may leak into surface and groundwater
    waters nearby. For example, too much ammonia, phosphorus, or nitrogen may degrade
    water quality. Measuring the concentration of nutrients in the soil allows for
    selection of the best crop for multiple cropping cycles on the same land. Nutrients
    and technologies are critical for achieving sustainable agriculture while minimizing
    environmental and economic costs [8]. vii. Waste management: The Internet of Things
    (IoT) proposes a waste disposal solution. IoT sensors may be used to create intelligent
    trash cans. This could be used to read, store, and transfer waste-related data
    through a network. Governance of waste can be accomplished with the aid of certain
    intelligent and streamlined algorithms [9]. viii. Livestock monitoring: The growth
    of agricultural production to provide adequate food for the world’s population
    is becoming a growing worldwide issue. As a result, the significance of livestock
    management in farmland is essential for the survival. Farmers, on the other hand,
    are trying to maintain their cattle in the context of rising worry over land and
    water supplies. Apart from that, farmers continue to focus on reducing waste and
    lowering total expenses. New technological advances are critical in helping to
    enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural output. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) enters the scene at this point. It allows farmers to improve the health
    of their livestock via remote access and data-driven decisions. Cattle Watch is
    a system for monitoring livestock. This cloud-based technology is often used to
    remotely track the well-being of livestock and aids in the identification of livestock
    locations using communication and energy sensors [10]. This method obviates the
    use of an alert system. If any state goes outside of a predetermined parameter,
    the users are told by call, text, or email. As a result, people can view real-time
    information from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces using their smartphones.
    The IoT livestock tracking scheme entails implanting sensors in animals that collect
    specific details about their body and their well-being. Farmers may monitor the
    position, counting, and other similar details of livestock using wireless IoT
    applications. The real-time data provided by the livestock tracking system allows
    sick animals to be identified and removed from the herd, preventing disease spread.
    For example: Farmers can monitor their livestock’s cardiac output, blood pressure,
    respiration rate, digestion, and perhaps other vital signs around the clock using
    connected sensors. ix. Farm Management System (FMS): Farm management systems centralizes,
    administers, and optimizes a farm’s output and operations. IoT based farm management
    system automates the collection and storage of farm data, manages business expenditure,
    agricultural budgets, monitors and analyses farm operations and consumption. Smart
    farming raises production while lowering environmental effects, but this smart
    farming approach is only feasible with the help of FMS. For smart farming, FMS
    is an important component for production, planning, and decision-making [11].
    Farmers can track the entire farm with an interconnected FMS that uses Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modules [12],
    and a micro-controller to capture all of the data. On all sensors and devices
    throughout the field, an identifier is used to provide proper awareness of fertilization,
    weather details, automated buffer zone width tracking, and automatic information
    record generation based on daily farm activities. This data is saved in a regular
    format on the server and can be accessed for even further processing through a
    mobile phone or the internet. An automatic irrigation and control system [13]
    is used to maximize the usage of water supplies. In addition to the irrigation
    scheme, the farm is secured from pests and animals [14]. x. Tracking and tracing:
    IoT provides agricultural firms with helpful data to help them make better choices,
    such as organizing, handling, and communicating with business associates intelligently
    while saving resources and time. RFID and GPS are used to map the conditions of
    soil, air, water, herbicides and pesticides in a growing environment. Using wireless
    network connectivity, a GPS device is used to pinpoint the precise location of
    an agricultural areas and track different agricultural parameters. In [15], an
    architecture was developed to remotely track soil condition and soil structure
    in accordance with crop culture requirements. Through using WSN, ZigBee is linked
    to other devices such as CMS, GSM, and GPRS to track and acknowledge real-time
    data processing. When unexpected changes arise, GPS provides an interface to communicate
    with ARM (an intelligent control device to accomplish tasks such as SMS/MMS) and
    sends an alert to the farm manager, enabling the farmers to take appropriate action.
    Despite its high operating and maintenance costs, it is commonly used in agriculture
    because of its accurate positioning identification and control capabilities. xi.
    Crop management: Crop management involves assessing and recording the well being
    of a crop. Plant and crop diseases can be detected using IoT sensors and RFID
    chips. These details can be gleaned from RFID tags and shared across the internet
    by the reader. This data are processed remotely by the farmer, and necessary steps
    are taken. This will keep pests away from the crops. In agricultural sector, production
    tracking and prediction have played an important role in delivering benefits to
    users in order to produce valuable output while minimizing losses. [16] suggested
    using SVM to forecast rice production with the aid of a Chinese monitoring station
    for specific knowledge of geography. [17] has demonstrated an efficient automatic
    counting strategy for coffee fruit, which helps farmers schedule their agricultural
    processes and efficiently prevent risk. Neural Networks has been used to forecast
    crop production and analyze pest management in the context of environmental conditions.
    Analogously, the research scientist used an Artificial Neural Network to predict
    the current agricultural yield [18]. Due to the extreme changeover in spatio temporal
    and also its crop yielding task, the K-means approach has been proposed for evaluating
    the extreme computational measure. Crop production is fully estimated under various
    edaphoclimatic types of environmental conditions. The effect of numerous agricultural
    parameters within the spectrum of obtained loss by applying decision tree algorithm
    on grain loss analysis and prediction has been explored [19]. Furthermore, CNN
    [20] was used to recognize and categorize the generated drop based on an illustration
    of a vein leaf containing red, white, and soya bean. xii. Blockchain with IoT
    for agriculture: The blockchain is a decentralized ledger of transactions that
    all parties contribute and maintain. It offers a trustworthy source of information
    about the condition of farms, inventory, and agreements in agriculture, where
    such data gathering is often extremely expensive. Blockchain technology enables
    the tracking of food’s origin, thus facilitating the establishment of trustworthy
    food supply chains and the development of trust amongst suppliers and consumers.
    As a secure data storage medium, it enables the employment of data-driven technology
    to improve agriculture’s intelligence. Additionally, when used in conjunction
    with smart contracts, it enables payments on time to stakeholders that may be
    prompted by blockchain data alterations [21]. Table 1 highlights few recent findings
    and shortcomings of different IoT based frameworks for performing smart agriculture.

    agriculture This section of the paper gives an overview of different IoT sensors
    and sensor networks being used for making the agriculture sector smart. A sensor
    is indeed a device that monitors several parameters, such as pressure, light,
    moisture level, and so on. Most of the time, the sensor output is an electrical
    signal, which is sent to a micro-controller for the further analysis on a network.
    The development of simple to advanced sensors represents a transformation in the
    way we gather information, conduct analysis, and connect diverse structures in
    order to attain new ideas we may never before have conceived of. Fig. 2 illustrates
    the components and basic structure of a sensor node used for performing smart
    agriculture. An intelligent sensor node comprise of three components namely: Sense,
    Compute, and Communicate. The sensing component is responsible for capturing the
    real-world parameters such as moisture, temperature, etc. The computational component
    pre-processes the captured parameter value and the communication component makes
    sure that the gateway sensor nodes are able to communicate with gateway nodes
    and can share the information among them. A variety of sensors are available for
    measuring and calculating the specifications of a farming field. The underlying
    concepts of different sensors, as well as their corresponding requirements, are
    summarized below: Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Components of sensor node. • PH sensors are being used
    to track the precise quantity of nutrition in soil, which is important for the
    stable germination of seeds and crops. The absorption of chemicals or biomolecules,
    as well as the speed or rate of chemical processes, are both affected by pH [29].
    Soil pH is very important because it affects biological & chemical processes.
    For instance, when pH is low, nutrition, growth, and productivity of most crops
    suffer, and when pH is high/optimal, productivity enhances. Many crops thrive
    in soils with a pH of 6 to 7.5, whereas others favor acidic or alkaline soils.
    For example: In soil management, soil pH acts as an important indicator for crop
    production, therefore its geographical variation must be handled to enhance precision
    management choices. • PIR sensor: A motion detector is integrated into the PIR
    (Passive Infrared) sensor, which tracks the direction of an individual’s movements
    in the field. Additionally, the sensor has a light detector feature: when monitoring
    an object, it converts rise in temperature to voltage for the purpose of examining
    crop production [30]. Everyone produces some IR radiation, with some emitting
    modest levels and others emitting high levels depending on just how hot they are.
    Two slots of IR sensitive material are included in a PIR sensor. Both slots detect
    the same amounts of IR if there is no motion in front of them. When anything hot
    pass in front of the slots, such as an animal, the very first slot detects a variation
    in IR level and produces a positive differential between the two slots. As the
    animal moves from the second slot to the first, the impact is reversed, resulting
    in a negative difference between the two positions. The PIR detects these fluctuating
    amounts of IR. • UV sensor monitors the intensity of ultraviolet radiation for
    optimal crop production [31]. For instance, while using Iot components for weather
    management, it is evident to notice that plants respond to a variety of environmental
    factors, including soil nutrients, airborne chemicals, watering frequency, and
    the amount and type of light they receive. UV radiation has also been shown to
    affect the flavor, fragrance, and appearances of food cultivars, as well as increase
    the terpene concentration of cannabis crops. • Weed seeker is a self-confined
    unit that is usually fitted with opto-electronic components for the purpose of
    weed identification and spraying. The unit is composed of an activated source
    of light and a specific spray sensor that detects chlorophyll. By the use of an
    optical system, the device is capable of detecting and spraying mainly weeds throughout
    the field. The service’s systemic application will greatly minimize herbicide
    use. As a consequence, only a small amount of chemical is needed, lowering the
    implementation cost [22]. While performing crop management, weed control using
    IoT in agriculture is a time-consuming and costly process. Precision weed management
    (PWM) is defined as the administration of the appropriate quantity of inputs to
    the correct target (weeds) at the appropriate time. PWM is centered on using information
    technology to make site-specific weed management decisions. The spectroscopic
    reflectance of the leaves may be used to distinguish between various plant species
    [32]. • Wind speed indicates the speed of the wind at the surface. It is often
    important to observe occurrences in a field, such as changes in wind direction.
    These sensors must be installed at an appropriate height based on the location
    of the crop [33]. The input on wind direction is utilized for weather forecasting,
    crop harvesting, insecticide spraying, and other agricultural operations. Wind
    speed is monitored using a cup-type sensor, with the speed related to the number
    of revolutions. A potentiometer is used to detect the direction of the wind. •
    Water content/Soil moisture sensors for measuring water content are used in a
    broad variety of research fields. The proportion of the quantity of water available
    in the test soil to the overall amount of the test soil denotes the soil water
    content. It is quantified by the variation in capacitance value, that is dependent
    on the soil’s dielectric constant [34]. It can vary from completely dry to the
    saturation porosity of the material. Since the measurements vary according to
    the soil condition, the sensor should be tuned at each location. This sensor tests
    soil water suction, which seems to be a substitute for the effort exerted by the
    plant root in absorbing moisture from the ground. It may be used to determine
    the amount of water contained in the soil or the amount of irrigation necessary
    to achieve a desired level of soil water. The sensor determines the amount of
    water and the degree of moisture present in the field. [35] describes the usage
    of a wireless moisture sensor to track the greenhouse irrigation method. Dielectric
    Soil Moisture Sensors [36] measure an electrical characteristic that varies based
    on the quantity of moisture present in the soil to determine moisture levels.
    • Temperature sensor monitors the temperature changes in the soil that have an
    impact on the absorption of nutrients and moisture. A novel sensing technique
    was developed to precisely map the volume of nutrients in the soil and on the
    surface of the water. A 3-dimensional crop sensing element equipped with photosynthetically
    active radiation technology can be deployed in any field area to measure temperature
    [37]. Ambient condition & asset monitoring are two significant aspects of smart
    agriculture that need temperature sensors. Ice wine cultivation, for example,
    is known to take place within a limited temperature window between −10 °C to −12
    °C throughout a harvesting period. The ice wine business requires very precise
    temperature and humidity for efficient output. Temperature sensors are crucial
    in almost all smart agricultural asset monitoring applications. • Gas sensor determines
    the precise concentration of poisonous gases in farmland, livestock and hydroponics
    by monitoring infrared radiations [38] There are a variety of strategies for reducing
    agriculture’s carbon output, but all of them require the ability to calculate
    and consider existing pollution levels, as well as track improvements. This is
    typically accomplished by the usage of gas sensors equipped with various analytical
    capabilities which could be used to monitor and log the quantities of , , or hydrocarbon
    gases. For example: monitoring is essential for the long preservation of grains
    and cereals. Variations in temperature and relative humidity levels in grain storage
    may be detected using gas sensors, which is significant for freshness and edibility.
    • Humidity sensor captures humidity that has a detrimental effect on plant leaf
    growth, and photosynthesis. As a result, this sensor involves measuring the moisture
    and temperature content of the air to indicate the degree of humidity [39]. Grofit
    offers a variety of climate control instruments that measure air temperature,
    relative humidity, and solar radiation. The device’s data transfer range is up
    to 200 m, and it records measurements for a period of 30 days. • Motion detector
    sensor is often used to locate the position of animals and fields; however, it
    detects the motion of an unexpected entity in the farm and sends warnings to the
    farmer, allowing for prompt intervention and crop loss prevention [40]. • GPS
    (Global positioning system) provides the precise positioning of farm, or livestock
    with respect to latitude, longitude and altitude. With respect to farm management
    systems, drones may be used, that can operate in tandem with sensor and GPS. It
    may be commanded remotely or fly autonomously using software-controlled scheduled
    flights in their embedded devices. Crop condition, irrigation, fertilization,
    sowing, plant enumeration, yield prediction, etc. may all be learned from drone
    data. Drones may be purchased and kept near farmland where they will be charged
    and serviced, or they can be scheduled for agricultural surveys (drone as a service).
    Following the surveys, the drones must be transported to neighboring laboratories
    where the gathered data can be analyzed. • Photodiode helps in identifying the
    soil properties such as organic matter and moisture content using light. It can
    be used by ray attenuation for measuring the soil-water content [41]. • Tensiometer
    detects the force used by roots for water absorption. It measures soil compaction
    using probes. Irrigation scheduling uses tensiometers to assist farm owners and
    other irrigation operators in determining when to irrigate. Tensiometers may be
    used in combination with a water retention curve to calculate how much they should
    water. The subtype of IoT sensors being used in agriculture domain is illustrated

    Precise data analysis is important in agriculture towards growing operational
    reliability and productivity. Based on IoT applications requirement, data analytics
    can be categorized into following types: i. Memory-level [42] ii. Massive analytics
    [43] iii. Business Intelligent data analytics [44] iv. Offline analytics [45]
    v. Real-time analytics [43] Memory-level data analytics deals with analyzing the
    data stored in some storage memory statically. Memory analytics contributes to
    the overall performance of a business intelligence system and offers BI users
    with quicker responses than conventional disk-based BI, particularly for requests
    that take a very long time to execute in a massive database. Massive analytics
    is also referred as big-data analytics. It is the delicate procedure of analyzing
    large amounts of data in order to extract information – such as correlations,
    market trends, and consumer preferences – that may assist companies in making
    sound business choices. While both business intelligence and data analytics include
    the use of data to uncover insights that help the company, there is one significant
    distinction to make. Simply stated, business intelligence is concerned with present,
    whereas data analytics is concerned with the future. Real-time analytics is a
    strategy that involves reasoning and statistics on data in order to provide insights
    that may be used to make faster, and more rational decisions. For certain scenarios,
    real-time analytics simply implies that the analyses are performed immediately
    on the arrival of fresh data. Image analysis has been widely used in agriculture
    for a variety of applications, including disease identification in leaves, stems,
    & fruits, fruit quality assessment, weed identification and irrigation. Lately,
    image processing and IoT have been used in agriculture to boost the efficiency
    of crop production. This entails the need for drones to acquire aerial photographs
    on a regular basis, as well as environmental surveillance using IoT devices. Numerous
    data analytics techniques have been explored in depth in [46]. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the involvement of data analytics in performing smart agriculture. This survey
    paper would not address these techniques in detail. We address the significance
    of data analytics in agriculture and how it can be used to assist in protection,
    estimation, storage management, precise application, and decision-making. Estimation:
    The IoT generates massive amounts of data that can be analyzed over time to determine
    current environmental conditions. Data analytics may be used to analyze data obtained
    from various forms of network sensors, and use intelligent algorithm to forecast
    environmental trends and have data-driven solutions. Even though IoT data could
    also be used to monitor different facets of a field, including irrigation systems,
    it also can be used to forecast and alert farmers about disease and adverse weather
    events, such as flooding or drought [47]. For example, in forestry, sensors may
    be used to detect fire outbreaks and forecast the area within a forest that is
    at risk of igniting. This knowledge will assist firefighters in implementing preventative
    steps at the precise spot. Another field of forecasting is early alert systems
    for natural hazards in order to enhance emergency response. Download : Download

    in smart agriculture. Protection: Landowners are often subjected to harsh climatic
    conditions, which may result in a substandard yield. Fortunately, farmers can
    insure their crops and livestock with the usage of IoT technologies. A sensor
    network can be configured, and remotely unmanned stations can perform surveillance.
    The data may then be analyzed in the cloud. The insurance scheme will have a notification
    device, in which adverse weather events are forecast and insured farmers are notified
    by text message. This encourages farmers to take preventative steps to safeguard
    their activities. An additional value of data analytics in insurance is that insurance
    providers have access to information from distant farms and may trigger an automatic
    payout through IoT digital payment services in the context of adverse weather
    conditions. This will obviate the need for a prolonged claim procedure in which
    the insurance provider visits the farms to determine the degree of the harm. Storage
    management: Agricultural commodities are often destroyed as a result of insufficient
    warehouse control. Although climate, humidity, and some other external conditions
    significantly influence food product, bugs, microorganisms, etc may affect the
    production of food products [48]. The incorporation of IoT and data analytics
    into storage monitoring systems has the potential to significantly increase agricultural
    commodity storage. Sensors may be used to keep an eye on storage warehouses and
    the surrounding environment. The data is stored and processed in the cloud. To
    change the environmental circumstances, a self-automated decision framework based
    on analyzed data can be used. Additionally, when severe circumstances are encountered
    or a pest is found in the warehouse, an alarm signal may be sent to farmers. In
    India, approximately 35% to 40% of fresh produce is lost following harvest due
    to a variety of reasons, like rancidity or pest. Although the IoT has the ability
    to enhance agricultural storage facilities, protection should be incorporated
    into those networks to deter commodity theft during rolling blackouts. Precise
    application: By using sensor data, it is possible to apply pesticides and fertilizers
    precisely to particular areas of the field, increasing production thus decreasing
    farming costs. Although developed countries have already implemented precision
    agricultural practices on farms, developing countries are starting to adopt the
    tech, particularly on research farmlands [49]. Consequently, the implementation
    expense, technology, and knowledge of IoT-based smart agriculture programs in
    different countries continue to confine their adoption. Additionally, since the
    majority of farms in developed countries are small-scale, most farm workers do
    not see the value in implementing such technologies. Developing suitable precision
    farming systems for smallholder farmers remains a testing and design challenge
    for researchers and designers. Another benefit of data analytics in smart agriculture
    is its use of directing machinery to specific positions inside the farm utilizing
    GPS and position details, thus growing farming productivity as opposed to human-driven
    equipment. This will result in time and fuel savings, as well as cost savings
    on operations. Decision-making: Making decisions involves accurate knowledge,
    which can be gleaned from sensor data. The vast volume of data gathered by sensors
    creates resources for learning to enhance decision making in continuously evolving
    environmental scenarios. These choices may be taken in the immediate, intermediate,
    or long term. When those requirements are fulfilled, the IoT device may make automatic
    decisions, requiring little to no human interference. These automatic decisions
    may vary from temperature regulation to irrigation system management. For example,
    in solar farms, machine learning may assist in determining the optimum condition
    for growing a specific crop by analyzing data from sensors measuring nutrients,
    yield, development, transpiration, brightness, smell, and re-transplantation.
    The amount of knowledge gathered from data analytics will also help administration
    and all stakeholders make better policy decisions; thus, it is critical that the
    data is reliable, succinct, full, and timely. Numerous strategic decision-making
    frameworks have been created to assist farmers in making rational agricultural
    and livestock management decisions [50]. The data analytics makes professional
    recommendations to landowners, manages pests and diseases, and makes recommendations
    derived from remote expertise control systems. Machine Learning technological
    farms: Machine learning (ML) may be seen as a breakthrough mechanism for machines
    to mimic human active learning, acquire new information, continuously boost efficiency,
    and attain unique development. On other side humans (in case of agriculture: Farmers),
    are masters at multi-modal processing and can almost immediately integrate incoming
    inputs into an hypothetical knowledge based on their experience [51]. In recent
    years, machine learning models, concepts, and implementations have been very effective
    when coupled with other agricultural methods to reduce crop expenses and increase
    output. On agricultural fields, machine learning technologies may be used in a
    variety of ways, including disease diagnosis, crop identification, irrigation
    management, soil quality, weed tracking, crop quality assessment, and weather
    prediction. After harvest, machine learning may be used to analyze the freshness
    of products (fruits, vegetables, etc.), lifespan, quality of products, and market
    analysis. The application of machine learning in IoT-enabled agriculture could
    be based on a variety of different machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian
    mixture models, Neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), fuzzy clustering,
    etc. [52] present an Iot system with a ML algorithm that anticipates climatic
    conditions for fungal detection and mitigation based on temperature, comparative
    air humidity, speed of wind, and rainfall; furthermore, [53] developed a mechanism
    for disease prevention and monitoring on cotton leaves in conjunction with soil
    quality tracking. In certain scenarios, where the machine learning based IoT model
    faces shortage of streamline flow of data, interactive machine learning proves
    to be fruitful. The interactive machine learning algorithms regulates the learning
    factor of the algorithm by involving humans as agents [54]. The farmers can play
    the role of agents in case of agriculture domain. It has also been presented that
    the intelligence of machines can be improvised by involving human(farmers)-in-the-loop
    [55]. 5. Smart agriculture applications, software and hardware In this section,
    we have highlighted few apps, software and hardware which are playing a crucial
    role in making the agriculture system behave smartly. The apps are responsible
    for collecting the data for further analysis. 5.1. Smart agriculture apps Following
    are some of the most widely used IoT apps in smart agriculture: i. Nutrient ROI
    calculator: eKonimics has launched a revised edition of its highly esteemed ROI
    (return on investment) calculator [56] which aims to assist farmers in optimizing
    yields and earnings. The most recent iteration of the calculator integrates spatial
    uncertainty, providing farmers with a more precise representation of predicted
    nutrient response in production-scale agriculture. Farmers are able to create
    more precise fertilizer application strategies as a result, optimizing the gains
    of farm inputs and therefore can enhance their profitability. ii. Sirrus: It enables
    collaboration between agronomists and farmers by rendering field data available
    and simple to obtain [57]. By linking to the agX framework, users and applications
    can access structured field data offline and exchange it with some other users
    and devices. The advanced advice editor in Sirrus Premium enables service providers
    to offer changes in the field or when consulting with a grower. Users may modify
    fertilizer application rates, costs, and overall product prices. Sirrus credits
    prices dynamically depending on recent or flat rate applications. After selecting
    a product, labeling and safety data sheets (SDS) are widely sufficient to ensure
    proper product safety and usage. iii. FieldAgent: It collects data to create stunning
    agricultural crop health charts, count seeds, plants and identify weeds, among
    other things. It is compatible with the majority of modern DJI (Da-Jiang Innovations)
    drones and takes care of all the flying specifics, allowing you to concentrate
    solely on the targeted map. It displays the comprehensive orthomosaics, plant
    species, weed positions, and precise Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    crop-health items directly on your computer, along with position data to facilitate
    in-field scouting [58]. Task forecasts are given at the start of each trip and
    are revised as the task changes. Prior to takeoff, you can view and change almost
    any part of your flight route. Without regard for size, way-point, or acreage
    restrictions, you may fly vast fields simultaneously. When the drone’s batteries
    run out, FieldAgent would drive it home and drop it off where it departed off.
    iv. OpenIoT: It assists plant breeders in determining the state of various varieties
    of wheat by calculating humidity, temperature of air and soil. This enables farmers
    to forecast harvest dates, irrigation schedules, and nutrient requirements for
    plant development [59]. v. Farmbot: It makes use of open-source hardware and software
    for IoT in farming. It is based on developing an open source autonomous smart
    agriculture machine for the sake of mankind [59]. FarmBot assists customers in
    producing and growing their own food, developer Rory Aronson (CEO of Farmbot Inc.)
    said [60]. “It is something more than just understanding the origins of your food.
    Anyone who wishes to participate and assist us in building the future of agriculture
    has the potential to do so through their open-source technology”. vi. SmartFarmNet:
    It responds in near real-time to requests raised on time-series streaming data
    via sensors. It integrates non-SQL (NoSQL) and conceptual storage arrays. This
    arrangement manages (user, sensor, aggregated) data, and data caching. SmartFarmNet
    gathers, extracts, and aggregates data streams [61] from nearly all Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) system. For data ingestion, the SmartFarmNet gateway makes use of the OpenIoT
    X-GSN feature [62]. Wrappers are used to interact with sensors. A wrapper is a
    platform which enables the gateway to retrieve and transmit data from and to an
    underlying IoT system. At the moment, the SmartFarmNet network supports data ingestion
    from over thirty IoT interface platforms. vii. iSOYLscout: iSOYLscout is an intuitive
    field scouting application which s imply labels areas manually or using the built-in
    GPS when on foot or in a vehicle. The application can be used to monitor crop
    production, weed infestations, and any other function you want to track around
    the field. Each logged function instantly estimates the area. Interest points
    are denoted by a text tag such as ’Broad weed’. Additionally, notes and/or a photograph
    may be included with the point. ISOYLscout files are automatically imported to
    mySOYL, allowing for wireless and quick data sharing among field and office [63].
    Using iSOYLscout app, the farmer/user initially defines the region of interest,
    which may be scaled to include a single field, a portion of the farm, or the entire
    farm. For instance, the user may choose this based on the kind of data they want
    to collect, which may range from weed infestations to water-logging. Using GPS
    signal, the app will correctly record the position of these locations. Furthermore,
    the software has a manual sketching feature that could be used to distantly add
    a tag to a known place of interest even when the user is not in the vicinity.
    In any scenario, the app will inform the user of the estimated area and allow
    them to modify it. This is particularly advantageous for planning purposes. For
    instance, if a farmer has to establish a 1.0 hectare area of wild bird seed, the
    application will capture this and assist the farmer in properly establishing and
    recording the exact area. Along with regions of interest, any additional information
    deemed helpful by the farmer may be recorded at a particular location on the property.
    Users may create and modify a list of farm-related points. GPS data may be recorded
    automatically or manually. Free text changes of any length are also available,
    as well as the addition of pictures. viii. AgVault 2.0: It enables users to navigate
    whole fields with ease using an inspire drone [64]. The software enables the user
    to configure the UAV’s height, sensor settings, overlapping, steering angle, and
    survey region. The UAV is launched from the inside of the app, autonomously completes
    the preset path, and returns automatically. AgVault app helps in inspecting different
    areas of the field for analyzing the growth rate of crops, insect infestation,
    etc. ix. AgriSync: It helps farmers and consultants to communicate and collaborate
    on farm service concerns. Farmers may communicate with several advisors from different
    organizations in near real-time via video to send and request assistance. Advisors
    can monitor several customer requests with a console and remote video, which enables
    them to see exactly whatever the farmer experiences in real time. The advisor’s
    company will view open cases, settlement status, and farmer reviews in real time
    from a Web-based customer support dashboard [65]. x. FARMapper: It is a web-based
    application of the next generation that enables users to rapidly and easily create
    farm maps [66]. Your map is safely stored in the cloud and it can be accessed
    through mobile, tablets and desktop devices. You can view the farm project from
    nearly every platform that supports a Web browser. The app parses public land
    statistical data for the Municipality, Range, Segment, and quarter segment upon
    clicking on any point. It adds information to every clicked point and highlights
    the parcel. Using the app’s drawing tools, you can create custom polygons in no
    time. Additionally, the app assists farmers in maintaining information on water
    resources, easements, and cultivation. In FARMapper app., the different fields
    are clubbed in the form of maps which can be accessed anytime. Custom Polygons
    are in the app represents different field locations owned by any individual farmer.
    All the maps are stored in cloud and can be accessed anytime with a single click
    using the app, thus helping the farmer to monitor several plots easily. Fig. 5

    IoT combines robotics, drones, remote sensors, and computer vision with constantly
    improving machine learning and computational software to track crops, survey and
    analyze fields, and provide evidence to farmers for appropriate farm management
    strategies that save time and money. Table 2 discusses some of the well known
    IoT software being used in agriculture domain. Table 2. IoT software used in agriculture.

    hardware In this section, we highlighted some of the well known IoT hardware being
    used in agriculture domain. The most significant hardware component of IoT could
    be its sensors. Power modules, radio frequency modules, and sensor modules are
    used in these units. Table 3 discusses some of the widely used IoT hardware. Table
    3. IoT hardware used in agriculture. Hardware Description ESP8266 The ESp8266
    [75] is a wifi module that helps in establishing wireless connection between different
    components of IoT-based smart agriculture. RTC module This module helps in setting
    up a real time clock. It enables the module to keep track of precise timings of
    any operation to be performed by the designed IoT system [76] DHT11 The DHT11
    is a widely used sensor for measuring humidity and temperature. The DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor is a widely used component. The sensor is equipped with a
    specialized NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit micro-controller for
    serial data output [77]. Additionally, the sensor is factory tuned, making communication
    with other chipsets easy. The sensor has a precision of ±1 °C and ±1% when measuring
    temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C & humidity between 20% and 90%. Therefore,
    if you need measurements within this range, this hardware might be the best choice
    GSM module It can allow SIM from any GSM network provider and can operate as a
    smartphone with its own specific contact number. The RS-232 protocol can be used
    to link the controller quickly [69]. PIC Micro-controller It is used in defense,
    monitoring devices and domestic appliances. Often included is an EEPROM that is
    being used to permanently store the content [78]. This can be used to store the
    data collected by drones while analyzing the farmland. LM35 The LM35 temperature
    sensor generates an analog O/P voltage equal to the measured temperature. It indicates
    the output voltage in Celsius (C). It is self-calibrating and does not involve
    external tuning circuitry. The LM35 [79] has a sensitivity of 10 mV/degree C.
    If the temperature rises, the output voltage rises as well. 6. Principal advantages
    of IoT in smart agriculture Through remote sensing, smart agricultural systems
    minimize wastage, increase production, and allow management of a wider variety
    of resources. In conventional farming techniques, the farmer was continuously
    out there in the field, checking the farmland condition. However, as farms have
    become bigger, it has become increasingly difficult for farmers to manage everything
    everywhere. This is particularly true in micro-farming, where many distant pieces
    of land could be cultivated for a variety of crops, each of which requires a unique
    set of circumstances and precise control over soil and water. Control systems
    handle sensor input, providing remote monitoring for supplies and decision support,
    as well as automating machinery and equipment to respond to developing problems
    and to assist production. This is not dissimilar to the success criteria for any
    other “smart” marketing strategy; a standardized methodology establishes the better
    utilization of resources enabling production process on the supplier side and
    for satisfying strict demand-side limitations. Thus, in a smart agriculture system,
    it is about controlling agricultural production and, depending on its state, establishing
    the appropriate growth factors – such as moisture, fertilizer, or material content
    – to ensure production of the desired crop. During production, it is all about
    resource management in order to optimize the growth process. Smart and precision
    farming methods, for example, focus on precise sowing using unmanned tractors
    to minimize seed waste and optimize plant spacing to provide the greatest potential
    output per acre. Another example is water usage, which may be improved by using
    precision water delivery techniques such as dripping or subsurface irrigation
    to decrease evaporation and increase soil moisture content by providing water
    only if it is required through sensors and automation. Overall, the whole procedure
    from farm to fork is monitored by sensors and managed by software which reduces
    overall costs, increases overall yield and supply quality, and ultimately improves
    the farmer experience. Following are some of the key benefits of using IoT for
    performing smart agriculture: i. Agility: The improved agility of operations is
    one of the advantages of utilizing IoT in agriculture. Farmers can rapidly react
    to any major change in climate, humidity, quality of air, or the condition of
    soil or crops, thanks to real-time surveillance and forecast systems. Emerging
    IoT technologies aid agricultural experts in saving crops in the face of severe
    weather fluctuations. ii. Clean Process: Precision farming using IoT-based technologies
    not only saves water and energy, making farming more environmental friendly, but
    it also reduces pesticide and fertilizer usage considerably. In comparison to
    conventional farming techniques, this technology provides for a better and more
    organic end result. iii. Automating sowing, irrigation, and harvesting operations
    may help save resources, minimize human error, and lower total costs. iv. Accurately
    monitoring production rates per field over time enables accurate forecasting of
    a farm’s future crop output and value. v. The Internet of Things will aid in the
    advancement of community farming, particularly in remote areas. The IoT can be
    used to encourage services that enable communities to exchange data, knowledge
    and increase contact between landowners and farming expertise [80]. vi. Smart
    agriculture makes extensive use of drones and robotics, which help in a variety
    of ways. This enhancements strengthen the data collection mechanism and facilitate
    wireless surveillance and control. vii. The agricultural sector faces a number
    of challenges, not the least of which is ensuring adequate productivity while
    still ensuring a healthy and nutritious food supply. Numerous allegations of food
    theft have been produced, including adulteration, counterfeiting, and artificial
    manipulation [81]. This kind of fraud is hazardous to one’s health and may have
    a detrimental economic effect [82]. Several of the components of food theft discussed
    in [83] can be resolved by the use of IoT technologies, including product validity,
    procedure integrity, individual truthfulness, and data integrity. The Internet
    of Things can be used to include logistical and analytical regulatory compliance
    for food [84]. viii. One of the alleged benefits of IoT is the opportunity to
    control equipment remotely [85]. The implementation of IoT in agriculture would
    enable significant time and cost savings in inspecting vast fields as contrasted
    to staff personally checking the field by vehicle or foot. Through using IoT to
    determine when and how to apply fertilizers or pesticides, expense and wastage
    may be reduced. ix. The adoption of IoT would enable new business opportunities
    through which independent farmers will escape the manipulation of “middle men”
    and establish direct relationships with customers [86], resulting in increased
    benefit. x. IoT can allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment
    to prevent fraud, expedite component replacement, and ensure routine maintenance
    is performed on time. 7. Key challenges & open research issues We have encountered
    significant technological advancements over the last few decades, and these advancements
    have impacted our daily lives. It is credited with making our lives more convenient
    by putting resources at our fingertips. Among the many innovations in progress,
    IoT, also recognized as M2M, has effectively drawn a large community (in which
    smart sensors gather real-time data and communicate with one another or with the
    internet in order to take appropriate action). IoT as a technology presents both
    prospects and challenges. M2M can be divided into four distinct layers. The first
    component is a sensor that collects real-time data, followed by a communication
    device that handles data transmission. The third computational unit is in charge
    of data analysis, while the service layer is in charge of performing any required
    actions. These four elements are largely carried forward to the Internet of Things.
    The following are the imminent critical issues confronting IoT: i. IoT standardization:
    It is a crucial aspect in developing credibility and establishing a market for
    a novel idea. The introduction of physical objects into the internet creates a
    number of problems in terms of the adaptability of existing internet protocols
    and applications to these objects [87]. In recent years, detailed study has been
    conducted to match current procedures and solutions to these artifacts. The IoT
    includes a diverse variety of heterogeneous devices; if these devices utilize
    disparate standards and protocols, achieving high degree of interoperability is
    challenging. As a result, IoT regulatory agencies such as the IEEE, ETSI could
    prioritize implementing a technical standard to address standardization concerns.
    There are continuing efforts to develop the protocols and specifications necessary
    for millions and millions of IoT devices to communicate with one another. This
    entails interoperability on technological, semantic, conceptual, and organizational
    levels [88]. Interoperability of syntax is synonymous with code formats such as
    XML, JSON, EDI, comma separated variables, etc. as common syntax for data exchange
    [89]. Significant research is expected to be done to promote open standards in
    order to increase interoperability across billions of IoT apps and platforms.
    ii. IoT data: Some of the major issues with data usage in smart agriculture includes
    data reliability, data uniformity, and data volume. (a.) Data uniformity: Agricultural
    data may be lost due to equipment failure or network node breakdown, post-processing
    errors, or pest/disease infestation. Due to the loss of a large number of recorded
    incidents, missing data results in erroneous calculations and degrades the success
    of IoT applications in agriculture. Several researchers have suggested numerous
    imputation approaches over time, including multiple mean matching, kernel smoothing,
    regression technique, and uniform kriging. (b.) Data Reliability: In agriculture,
    the primary cause of missing data is mechanical failure, electricity, weather
    conditions, mislabeled data, and computation error. Numerous implementations of
    data mining techniques [90] exist in smart agriculture, including crop safety
    assistance, irrigation prediction [91], and pesticide reduction [92]. In the other
    side, noisy and abnormal data pose significant impediments to the successful use
    of data mining techniques in smart agriculture. As a result, it is critical to
    manage noisy data using proven techniques [93], (c.) Data Volume: Heterogeneous
    data is another issue with data that arises as a consequence of big data’s existence.
    Agricultural data may be collected using a variety of different technologies,
    including monitors, drones, cameras, and RFID tags. Indeed, since big data is
    heterogeneous, we can employ frameworks that reduce memory requirements and processing
    time correlated with data analysis. iii. Regulatory issues: It is necessary to
    sort out the regulatory and legal structures governing the management and possession
    of farm data between farm workers and data firms [94]. Regulations can vary by
    country in terms of service provision [95] (for example, frequency for wireless
    IoT), technological difficulties, competitiveness, data protection, and security
    [96]. Different laws in different regions of the world can have an effect on how
    IoT is applied in specific applications, such as monitoring and agro-food supply.
    iv. Market issues: Agriculture sector has a very low profit margin, and as such,
    there is a need to coordinate the introduction of IoT-enabling technologies against
    the future benefits. As a result, we address market challenges associated with
    IoT implementation in terms of expense and industry awareness. • Cost: There are
    certain costs associated with IoT implementation in agriculture, which can be
    classified as setup and operating costs [97]. The setup cost covers the expense
    of IoT hardware required for framing a smart environment for agriculture. The
    operating cost is based on a consistent subscription to centralized networks or
    IoT systems that facilitate data processing, maintenance of IoT devices, and knowledge
    exchange, among other aspects. Additional operating costs include those associated
    with data sharing among IoT devices, gateways, and cloud servers, as well as energy
    and maintenance. While certain IoT providers offer free subscription packages
    with restricted features, the amount of linked IoT devices, and the volume of
    information that can be stored is limited. Increased features and facilities result
    in increased payment rates. • Lack of awareness: A significant factor impeding
    IoT adoption in agriculture is a lack of sufficient awareness about IoT and its
    applications, notably among farmers in rural areas. This is a frequent occurrence
    in developed nations, where the bulk of farmers reside in remote areas and are
    often illiterate. If human interference is unavailable, the farmer’s failure to
    use knowledge can be a significant obstacle. v. Security: In smart agriculture
    domain, IoT devices are susceptible to physical tampering, including burglary
    or attacks by rodents and livestock, as well as changes in physical address or
    connection [98]. [99] addressed different security breach cases such as Data Theft,
    SQL Injection attack, etc. at different layers of IoT. Physical components, such
    as sensors and actuators, are the prime focus of the perception layer. Accidental
    or deliberate human activity, malware, or crooks may lead physical equipment to
    malfunction. Consequently, complex and complicated algorithms are challenging
    to incorporate in IoT devices due to their restricted memory, connectivity capacities,
    and low energy usage. Congestion threats, DOS attacks, and routing attacks are
    all possible on the gateway. The protection and positioning of location data and
    IoT-enabled services used in smart agriculture are vulnerable to attacks such
    as system capture [100]. An intruder traps an IoT device and removes cryptographic
    signatures, allowing the attacker unlimited access to the details contained on
    the device’s memory. Such higher-level networking layers may be susceptible to
    denial-of-service (DOS) threats, jamming and man-in-the-middle attacks [101].
    Cloud repositories are susceptible to data tampering and unauthorized resources
    that may disrupt smart farming process [102]. The fast development and widespread
    use of smart mobile technology, and also the combination of IoT with corporate
    digitalization and automation, create new risks and hazards for Information and
    Communication Technologies security on the worldwide market. Potential cyberattacks
    on a variety of different smart agricultural systems may create significant security
    concerns in a dynamic and dispersed cyber–physical context [103]. These risks
    and cyberattacks have the potential to cause significant disruptions to linked
    companies. Additionally, in agriculture’s highly automated environment, smart
    technology and remote administration employed in precision agriculture and smart
    farming are novel to its stakeholders, with the majority of new risks in this
    sector being closely related to comparable concerns in other industries. These
    risks are mostly concerned with cybersecurity, data security, and loss of data
    [104]. Additionally, since the precision agriculture industry makes extensive
    use of heavy equipment that is linked to the internet, there are many new vulnerabilities
    that may have catastrophic effects. Table 4 lists out the different potential
    cyber attacks on smart agriculture. It is important to note that the majority
    of today’s smart agriculture applications are built on IoT technology, which means
    they may directly inherit their security issues. Security features are disabled
    by default in protocols like MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and CoAP
    (Constrained Application Protocol), and the operator must enable it as per the
    project’s objectives. [105] demonstrates a system for predicting irrigation needs
    based on climatic and environmental data. The technology predicts soil moisture
    using sensor data and makes irrigation recommendations. A web page is used by
    the end-user to communicate with the system. In the gathering, transmitting, and
    storing stages, the article presents no security measures, authentication checks
    or failure diagnostics. Because of the absence of security, systems are susceptible
    to different types of the attack, indicating that the system is extremely insecure.
    Data corruption or inaccuracy causes predictions to be incorrect and decisions
    to be made incorrectly. Incorrect actions can undermine the growth and diminish
    the system’s acceptance. Likewise, [106] developed a system that uses soil moisture,
    light levels, humidity and temperature sensor to monitor farms. Irrigation can
    be controlled manually or automatically using web or mobile apps. The system description
    is devoid of any security mechanisms, leaving the system vulnerable to the entire
    array of attacks described in Table 4. Controlling actuators with instructions
    from a web application that lacks strong security safeguards provides an ideal
    chance for malevolent adversaries to manipulate the system via malicious scripts
    and illegal access. Similarly, for data sharing between the host, the gateway,
    as well as the nodes, [107] offer a smart agriculture architecture. The article
    presents the system’s architecture but makes no mention of interactivity or remote
    control, and it exhibits no security issues. The most damaging attacks, such as
    DoS, signal interruption, data transit, and routing, are those that target the
    network layer, since it is a data exchange platform. Some of the open issues [108]
    available for researchers include: (Malicious Scripts, Phishing attack, Deny of
    services) at Application layer, (Signature wrapping, Booting Vulnerabilities,
    Forged control of actuators) at Edge layer, (Signal disruptions, Data transit
    attack, DoS, Routing attack) at Network layer, (Autonomous system disruption &
    Hijacking, Fake node, Sleep deprivation, Node capture) at Perception layer. vi.
    Reliability: The Internet of Things devices are intended to be installed outdoors.
    This exposes the devices to extreme environmental factors, which may result in
    sensor deterioration over time and connectivity failures. Physical security of
    installed IoT devices and networks [109] must be maintained to safeguard expensive
    equipment against adverse weather events such as floods and hurricanes. vii. Scalability:
    In smart agriculture, a significant number of connected devices and sensors are
    installed, necessitating the use of an intelligent IoT management framework for
    the detection and control of every node [110]. Gateways and protocols in use today
    would have to accommodate a massive range of IoT devices/nodes, e.g., Sigfox supports
    nodes. viii. Localization: Numerous considerations must be weighed when deploying
    IoT systems. These considerations include the IoT device’s capacity to accept
    position and play capability, i.e., to be installed anywhere and linked to the
    remainder of the globe without requiring any (or minimal) modification or the
    deployment of external hardware, such as gateways. Other considerations include
    the optimal location for the IoT system to have sufficient knowledge and reliability
    without creating disturbance [111]. ix. Networking issue: Smart agriculture presents
    a difficult communication challenge between various sensor nodes [112]. Sensors
    conduct large computations that consume energy, but sensor batteries have a limited
    capacity. As a result, networks need effective energy storage. These problems
    do not occur just at the hardware implementation stage, yet even at its network
    layer. Wireless connectivity [113] is critical for the implementation of smart
    agriculture owing to the uptick expense of wiring. Physical implementation demonstrates
    that the efficiency of approved transceivers is exaggerated by the proximity of
    humans, temperature, moisture, and a variety of other obstacles inside the region
    in which a wireless system or node wishes to interact. As a result, the most effective
    and stable technology can be used to transmit data in view of environmental problems
    and rural environments [114]. A thorough review of the problems and issues associated
    with IoT-based smart agriculture connectivity is offered in [115]. x. Resource
    optimization: Farm owners require a resource optimization process to decide the
    optimal number of gateways, IoT devices, communicated data and cloud storage required
    to achieve an advancement in profitability. This is made more difficult by the
    fact that various farms have varying sizes and need varying types of sensors to
    detect farm variables for certain crops or livestock [116]. This will necessitate
    the implementation of sophisticated algorithms and statistical models capable
    of determining the optimum resource distribution while mitigating costs and optimizing
    agricultural production and income. After setting different prospects for prolonged
    research efforts, most IoT applications in themselves enable to identify difficulties
    for research and development to get a dependable as well as viable solution. The
    roadmap was drawn up by correctly identifying the research goals and objectives
    based on an assessment of the following criteria: (i) Thorough apprehension of
    the Smart-IoT architecture, (ii) Appropriate establishment of constraint free
    communication interface in the network minimizing the cost and maximizing the
    heterogeneity, (iii) Correct recognition and subsequent signal processing of incoming
    data when items are synced via the Internet via communication devices, there is
    a tremendous data generation. Therefore, correct management of collaborative data
    sharing is one of the top-priority, (iv) Standards should be developed to enable
    a broad variety of applications and meet common criteria for all potential IoT
    Smart-agriculture applications. Table 4. Different security concerns and attacks

    of internet devices, steady progress in all domains, from time to time, attracts
    critical concerns, along with updates, that cannot be neglected or disregarded.
    Over the last several years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has made great strides.
    The resources accessible beneath the hood of IoT have run out, and current situations
    have prompted a slew of questions that must be addressed in some manner before
    expanding to newer dimensions. In light of the ever-expanding scope of the IoT,
    several future-related questions have been raised that must be answered before
    we enter a new horizon of performing smart-agriculture. – Would there be any next
    major step in properly identifying and managing the vast array of sensors being
    introduced to setup smart environment for agriculture? – How will the future generation
    of smart-agriculture systems operate in tandem with IoT, especially when technological
    advances is not incessant? – Safeguarding of electrical circuits in IoT system
    against specific environmental conditions such as fire, heavy rain, winds, excessive
    humidity, etc. Different IoT systems for performing smart-agriculture has been
    proposed by several researchers, but crop residue remains a major environmental
    concern. To address this issue [117], we could indeed develop an IoT system infused
    with biotechnology that can assist in gathering data (which would include climate
    factors for growing bacteria and fungi for various sites and croplands) to solve
    the crop residue problem as well as provide a remedy to biodegrade the residue.
    8. Conclusion and future trends IoT has expanded steadily in last few years and
    a variety of IoT-based frameworks have been formulated in a variety of domains,
    most notably in agriculture. This review article discussed the prevailing state
    of the IoT in agriculture by reviewing key works of literature, analyzing current
    IoT research trends, and investigating common IoT sensors, devices, agriculture
    APPs, benefits & challenges, and analytics in IoT-based agricultural production.
    Despite of many challenges, IoT is an innovative breakthrough with a predicted
    exponential rate of growth of 27.1 billion connected components by 2021. Via its
    ubiquitous internet networking, it links diverse gadgets, devices, and individuals.
    The upcoming studies, inventions, and initiatives mostly in field of IoT-based
    smart agriculture would improve the quality of living for farmers and result in
    significant improvements in the agricultural sector. However, a variety of questions
    remain unresolved in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale
    growers. Security and expense are critical considerations. As competitiveness
    in agriculture intensifies and beneficial policies are adopted, it is projected
    that the increasing adoption of IoT for framing a smart agricultural environment
    will increase proportionately. Some of the future trends of smart agriculture
    includes: construction of generic platform for all sort of crops and livestock,
    QoS (Quality of Service), usage of explainable artificial intelligence to monitor
    crop growth and disease control, Policies standardization, other technological
    and deployment advancements. Explainable AI [51] is one of the major necessity
    in most of the domains for understanding the reasons behind any specific decision.
    It fades away the traditional black box concept of machine learning and enables
    the farmers/users in understanding the factors behind the obtained solution. CRediT

    1. Introduction By 2050, the world''s population will have increased to 9.15 billion
    from the current level of 7.79 billion; the population of South Asia will form
    a large percentage (24.5%) of the global population, with the population of India
    accounting for 17.9% of the total (Table 1). Cereals are an important part of
    the human diet, and hence the annual production of these will need to increase
    by 3 billion tons from 2.1 billion tons today (Diouf, 2009). Wheat, maize, rice
    and, to some extent, millet and sorghum are major food items crucial to the survival
    of billions of people around the world. The South Asian region is one of the world''s
    key breadbaskets, producing almost 20% and 31% of global wheat and rice, respectively;
    these are the main staples of the diet of the majority of the population. The
    International Food Policy Research Institute''s report (IFPRI, 2019) indicates
    that the total cereal production in the world and in South Asia will have increased
    by 50.1% and 62.7%, respectively, by 2050 from the 2010 level under the no-climate-change
    scenario. Whereas, under the climate-change scenario, it will have increased only
    by 38.7% and 48.4% in the world and in South Asia, respectively, indicating the
    serious implications of the effects of climate change for cereal production and
    food security (Table 2). Water availability is related to nearly all the socioeconomic
    and environmental impacts of climate and population changes and their implications
    for sustainability (Elliott et al., 2014). The imbalance between water availability
    and water demand leads to water scarcity, which is one of the most urgent issues
    in the world (Sun et al., 2018). Moreover, global water demand is projected to
    increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, from 3500 to 5425 km3. Evidence has shown
    that climate change will have an adverse impact on world water resources and food
    production, with a high degree of regional variability and scarcity (Lacombe et
    al., 2019). Meeting this projected need in South Asia is doubly challenging considering
    that 94% of the land suitable for farming is already under production, and that
    58% of agricultural areas face multiple climatic hazards such as water shortage
    and extreme heat stress (Amarnath et al., 2017). Sustainably increasing agricultural
    production to meet the growing demand for food, especially with a growing scarcity
    of water, is a major challenge under the changing climate. South Asia is home
    to nearly 25% of the global population, but contains only about 4.6% of the global
    annual renewable water resources, which are very unevenly distributed between
    countries and river basins (FAO, 2016; Lacombe et al., 2019). Except for Bhutan
    and Nepal, per capita water availability is below the world average and continues
    to decline as populations increase. More than 90% of all water extracted in South
    Asia is used by the agriculture sector, compared with 70% globally. Sixty percent
    (60%) of agricultural water use in South Asia relies on surface water and 40%
    on groundwater. Water is the most critical input for agricultural production systems
    in general, and cereal crops are major consumers of water in the region''s agriculture
    sector. Therefore, appropriate strategies and modern tools and technologies for
    cereal production, especially those aimed at producing more with less water and
    still minimizing the impact of environmental externalities due to projected climate
    change, will be crucial for future food security on a sustainable basis. Table

    Washington, DC, pp. 1–157. The average water availability in South Asia is low
    (1137 m3/person/year), but varies widely, however, between different South Asian
    countries (Lacombe et al., 2019), with the lowest availability in Pakistan (1306)
    and India (1458), the two major cereal-producing countries of the region (Table
    3). India, South Asia''s largest geographical area, with over 72% of the region''s
    population, covers 2.4% of the world''s total geographical area and has 18% of
    the world''s population, but only 4% of its fresh water resources. Annual water
    availability in India was about 3000 cubic meters (m3) per capita in 1951, which
    has declined to the current level of 1458 m3 per capita due to increased population
    and increased water use in other sectors of the economy. As per the Falkenmark
    Index, a commonly used indicator of water scarcity, a country with renewable water
    availability below 1700 m3 per capita per annum is categorized as water stressed,
    although this index cannot be directly applied to the South Asian region due to
    variations in lifestyle and water usage as compared to developed nations. However,
    a region with a per capita total renewable water availability of 1137 m3/year
    is by and large a water-stressed region, and the declining per capita availability
    calls for greater restraint in water-use management. Table 3. Water resources

    The major issues related to the variability in available water resources in the
    region are (a) large temporal variability, leading to disasters such as floods
    and droughts; (b) high regional mismatch between availability and rapidly increasing
    demand for water for various uses, while availability remains nearly the same;
    and (c) increasing and unsustainable use of both surface and groundwater resources
    to meet the growing demand. High temporal variability in South Asia is largely
    due to the monsoon climate where about 70% of the annual rainfall takes place
    in a limited span of 4 months, i.e., from June to October. Consequently, in this
    period, the rivers carry about 70%–75% of their annual flow, at times much beyond
    their capacity to safely carry such volumes of water. During the remaining 8-month
    period, river flows account for the residual 25%–30% and many rivers run dry during
    summer months. Groundwater levels also follow a somewhat similar pattern of rise
    and fall, but with some time-lag. Large variability in water availability gives
    rise to a host of problems, including floods and droughts. In addition, there
    are large spatial variations in water availability that lead to scarcity in some
    regions and surpluses in some river basins, normally occurring at the same time.
    Agricultural water use as a percentage of the total water use in South Asian countries
    varies from 90% to 98% with a very high regional average of 91% (Table 3), and
    hence needs high attention and greater efforts in developing and deploying precision
    water management technologies and practices, in order to reduce the volume of
    water used by agriculture by improving water use efficiency. 2. Water in agriculture:
    Present and future scenarios Water is a crucial input in any agricultural production
    system, and plays a role not only as a key constituent of plant food synthesis
    and translocation, but also in reducing stress and vulnerability to climatic risks.
    Across South Asian countries, irrigated agriculture accounts for the major share
    of food grain production. In India, which has the region''s largest population,
    irrigated agriculture accounts for 55% of the total food production, but contributes
    about 74% of the production of major cereals (wheat and paddy rice) of the country
    and is the fulcrum of its food security. Since the area under cultivation has
    already reached saturation point and there are no further opportunities for area
    expansion, the growing food demand has to be met through productivity gains for
    future food security. Since a large proportion (54%) of agricultural land depends
    on rainfed farming (Dhawan, 2017), which under the growing complexities of climate
    change is highly variable, large productivity gains in these areas cannot be expected.
    Therefore, irrigated farming (both surface and groundwater) has to play a major
    role for future production gains in the region through increased cropping intensity
    as well as yield enhancement. An increase in cropping intensity in irrigated areas
    will provide an opportunity to improve the production of agricultural commodities,
    but will require an increased input of irrigation water. 2.1. Current situation
    and challenges Cereal-based systems in general, and rice-wheat (13.5 m ha) and
    rice-rice (10.0 m ha) systems in particular, form the basis for food security
    in South Asia (Jat et al., 2014; Ladha et al., 2009). Rice, a water-guzzling cereal
    crop, is grown on about 42 m ha in different rice-based cropping systems in India
    and consumes a major share of irrigation water. Moreover, due to the irrational
    use of irrigation water and non-scientific use of land, plans that do not consider
    the capability of the land have created a large gap of about 22 m ha between gross
    irrigation potential created (118 m ha) and utilized (96 m ha) in India. This
    gap can potentially be bridged to a large extent by improved irrigation efficiency
    and water productivity using innovative cropping systems and precision water-management
    practices. At the current level of utilized irrigation potential of 96 m ha, India
    uses approximately 650 billion cubic meters (BCM) of irrigation water, giving
    a delta of about 68 cm ha− 1 of gross irrigated area (GIA). Considering 70% of
    the average rainfall of 1170 mm as effective for meeting the demand for water
    for crops, gross irrigation water use works out as 148 cm ha− 1 of GIA, which
    is quite high in comparison to irrigation water use in developed countries (about
    90 cm ha− 1 in the United States) and hence there is high potential for bringing
    more area under irrigation through innovative technologies and production systems.
    The development of groundwater has made a significant contribution to an increase
    in irrigated area, about 63% of which is dependent on groundwater for irrigation.
    Highly subsidized or free power for pumping in many states is being provided to
    incentivize the use of groundwater for irrigation, but it has also encouraged
    users to overexploit deeper aquifers, resulting in depletion of the water table
    and deterioration of water quality in many areas. The latest assessment carried
    out by the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) of India indicates the state of groundwater
    and reveals that of 6584 Development Blocks in the country, 1034 are over-exploited,
    253 are critical and 681 are semi-critical, while 96 are saline. Water logging
    is another challenge that has emerged due both to poor drainage of irrigated soils
    and to over-use of irrigation water in canal commands. Moreover, the projected
    impacts of climate change (rise in temperature, and variability in rainfall due
    especially to a reduction in the number of rainy days and increasing intensity
    of rain) have significant negative consequences on the availability of water for
    agriculture (Jat et al., 2016; Kaur et al., 2013; Narjary et al., 2014; Yadvinder-Singh
    et al., 2014). South Asia in general and India in particular are more vulnerable
    to climate change due to a significantly high pressure on natural resources and
    their overexploitation because of a high density of population, the majority of
    which is dependent on agriculture. Estimates indicate that over 50% of urban India''s
    sewage that enters water bodies is untreated and hence pollutes the groundwater.
    2.2. Future trends in water use Projections (Fischer et al., 2007) indicate that
    developing and developed regions of the world will have an increased irrigation
    water (IW) requirement of 50% and 16%, respectively, between 2000 and 2080. At
    the same time, with the increasing growth of other sectors of the economy, water
    demand has increased and will increase further, creating more competition for
    agriculture and a wider gap between demand for and supply of irrigation water
    in agriculture. Future demand for water by different sectors of the economy such
    as urban centers, industries, and infrastructure in 2030 and 2050 scenarios has
    been estimated to be significantly high (Table 4). It is estimated that by 2050,
    total water demand in India by all sub-sectors (1180 BCM) will surpass the total
    utilizable water resources of the country (NCIWRD, 2015) and that agriculture''s
    share will be reduced to 68% (Table 4); hence, cereal systems that produce the
    major share of food will have to be sustained with a much smaller quantity of
    water, and with poor quality water. Therefore, the productivity of cereal systems
    will have to be improved through precision management of irrigation water while
    protecting the groundwater resources. Table 4. Current and projected future water

    3. Current status of water management in agriculture: Tools and techniques By
    2025, more than one-third of the global population will face a severe shortage
    of water, with availability becoming increasingly scarce (Kassam et al., 2007;
    Rosegrant et al., 2002; Seckler et al., 1999). Semi-arid regions of Asia, the
    Middle-East, and sub-Saharan Africa, where a substantial part of the world''s
    population lives below the poverty line, will be the worst affected areas. The
    demand for food and other agricultural commodities in these areas with fast-growing
    populations is increasing, while the availability of fresh water continuously
    declines. As agriculture is a major consumer of water for irrigation in South
    Asia, there is an increasing need to re-allocate the water used for irrigation
    to domestic and industrial sectors, but this may seriously impair food security
    in the region. Sustainable management of water in agriculture aims to match water
    availability and needs in quantity and quality, in time and space, at affordable
    cost, and with acceptable environmental implications. The sustainability and economic
    health of irrigated agriculture will depend on the ability of producers to adapt
    to growing constraints on water, particularly by improving efficiency of water
    use. Efficient water use not only reduces production costs, but also increases
    profitability by reducing loss of nutrients. Managing irrigation water at field
    scale can be improved by quantifying the water balance and using advanced techniques
    for scheduling irrigation, to achieve a more effective and economic use of limited
    water supplies. Reduced availability of water for irrigation may result in lowered
    productivity of irrigated crops, especially rice that consumes about 120–180 cm
    ha− 1 of water (Bindraban et al., 2006; Chauhan et al., 2012; Jat et al., 2019a).
    However, over years of advancements in research, several tools and techniques
    have been developed for various production systems and ecologies that help in
    saving water and improving water productivity in agriculture. For cereal-based
    systems, different methods of irrigation (flood, furrow, micro-irrigation) are
    being practiced by farmers (Fig. 1), the most common being flood irrigation (Jat
    et al., 2019a; Sidhu et al., 2019). Flood irrigation is the traditional system
    practised in South Asia of providing protective irrigation to crops. In this method,
    fields can be irrigated in two ways: by using earthen (unlined) or brick-lined
    channels, or by using underground cement, concrete or high-density polyethylene
    (HDPE) pipes. The conveyance losses are greater when using unlined channels for
    flood irrigation as compared to using cemented or HDPE underground pipes. The
    efficiency of flood irrigation largely depends upon field size and soil type,
    as the greatest loss of water is due to leaching beyond the root zone. Flood irrigation
    in unlevel fields causes temporary waterlogging in low-lying areas and adversely
    affects the productivity of upland field crops (wheat, maize, and pulses). Waterlogging
    is more severe and prolonged in soils used for growing rice, as puddling leads
    to the development of a hard pan (having low permeability) at shallow depths in
    such soils, which can adversely affect the productivity of upland crops (e.g.,
    wheat) that follow rice (Kukal and Aggarwal, 2003). Download : Download high-res

    cereal-based systems. Furrow irrigation is generally used in raising vegetables
    and potatoes, but furrow-irrigated raised beds (FIRB) are also being used to a
    limited extent for growing wheat, maize and other crops. A saving in the requirement
    for irrigation water (IW) has also been reported for rice and many other crops
    on raised beds (Choudhary et al., 2018; Jat et al., 2005, Jat et al., 2012, Jat
    et al., 2013; Kukal et al., 2009; Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2009). Several studies
    conducted across South Asia show a significant reduction (20%–30%) in the use
    of irrigation water for different cereal crops and cropping systems (Chauhan et
    al., 2012; Choudhary et al., 2018; Humphreys et al., 2010; Ibragimova et al.,
    2007; Jat et al., 2012, Jat et al., 2013; Sarker et al., 2020). 3.1. Micro-irrigation
    in agriculture: Progress and prospects Precision water-management technologies
    like micro-irrigation (sprinkler, surface drip and subsurface drip) help cultivators
    not only in saving irrigation water, but also in reducing the cost of production
    through efficient use of fertilizers and reduced cost of labor and other agricultural
    inputs (Madhavan, 2020; Narayanamoorthy, 2006). Micro-irrigation systems provide
    a 35%–65% saving of water compared with traditional flood irrigation systems,
    along with an appreciable increase in the productivity of crops and the income
    of farmers (ICFA, 2017; Jat et al., 2019a, Jat et al., 2019b; Sidhu et al., 2019).
    The advantages of micro-irrigation in terms of a significant increase in efficiency
    of water use have already been demonstrated beyond doubt (Narayanamoorthy, 2003;
    Palanisami et al., 2011; Rajkhowa et al., 2015; Rajput and Patel, 2012; Soman,
    2020; Soman et al., 2018). Despite multiple benefits and government support, the
    adoption of micro-irrigation in South Asian countries is very low compared to
    that in developed countries like Russia, USA, Brazil, Israel, Spain, China, etc.
    (Fig. 2; ICFA, 2017). In South Asia, the largest acreage under micro-irrigation
    is in India, where it has seen a steady growth over the years. Since 2005, the
    area covered under micro-irrigation systems has grown at a compound annual growth
    rate (CAGR) of 9.6% (Anonymous, 2016). Of the total acreage under micro-irrigation,
    sprinkler systems account for 56% and drip irrigation systems for 44%; drip irrigation
    is increasing at a faster rate, having a CAGR of 9.85% during 2012–2015, while
    sprinkler irrigation has grown at a pace of 6.60% in the same time period (Priyan
    and Panchal, 2017). The current acreage under micro-irrigation in India is 7.73
    m ha, whereas there is a potential of > 42 m ha (ICFA, 2017). Furthermore, there
    is a wide variation in adoption in various states of India (Table 5), with the
    largest areas under micro-irrigation being Rajasthan (1.68 m ha), Maharashtra
    (1.27 m ha), Andhra Pradesh (1.16 m ha), Karnataka (0.85 m ha), Gujarat (0.83
    m ha) and Haryana (0.57 m ha). Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download

    Horticultural Statistics at a Glance 2015. Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi,
    India. 3.1.1. Sprinkler irrigation Sprinkler irrigation technology, a system of
    pressurized micro-irrigation, where irrigation water is generally applied over
    the crop canopy in an identical way to rainfall, was introduced in the world about
    a century ago, but its increased use for larger areas started during the past
    few decades (Shankar et al., 2015). Water is pumped through a system of aluminum
    or HDPE pipes for distribution. Sprinkler systems eliminate water loss through
    leakage and seepage in conveyance channels. Water is more uniformly distributed
    even in an uneven field, thereby reducing wastage (Shankar et al., 2015). Compared
    to conventional flood irrigation, by using the sprinkler system for cereals and
    other field crops, a significant saving in irrigation water (30%–70%) for various
    crops grown in different soil types and agro-ecologies has been reported across
    the globe (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010; Colaizzi et al., 2006; Deen et al., 2012;
    Humphreys et al., 1989; Kahlown et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2004; Liu and Kang,
    2006). 3.1.2. Surface drip irrigation Surface drip irrigation is a low-volume
    irrigation system which applies irrigation water (IW) to plants by trickling water
    drop by drop near their roots at the soil surface. This irrigation system distributes
    water as well as nutrients through a network of pipes, valves, and emitters. Apart
    from highly efficient and uniform IW application and prevention of soil loss due
    to erosion, the fertigation also reduces nutrient loss due to leaching. However,
    the system requires a high initial capital investment and a high cost of labor
    for moving laterals etc. during the cropping season. A large number of studies
    in different crops and especially cereal systems across the world (Chen et al.,
    2015; Chouhan et al., 2015; Leib et al., 2002; Moin and Kamil, 2018; Parthasarathi
    et al., 2015, Parthasarathi et al., 2018; Pawar et al., 2013; Sharda et al., 2017;
    Sidhu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013) have reported that drip irrigation systems
    help make a significant saving (up to 50%) of water in cereals (wheat, rice, corn)
    and other crops in comparison to flood irrigation. 3.1.3. Sub-surface drip irrigation
    In contrast to the surface drip irrigation system, the subsurface drip irrigation
    (SSDI) system reduces the labor cost for anchoring laterals during the cropping
    season and ensures a longer life of laterals (Jat et al., 2019a; Sidhu and Sidhu,
    2019). SSDI minimizes water loss from the soil surface due to evaporation (Ayars
    et al., 1999; Barker et al., 1999; Douh and Boujelben, 2011) and allows direct
    application of nutrients along with water to the crop root zone, which ensures
    a more efficient use of fertilizer, reduces the growth of weeds and cost of labor,
    and enables the performance of cultural operations with ease (Ayars et al., 2015;
    Camp, 1998; Camp et al., 1997; Camp and Lamm, 2003, Camp and Lamm, 2014; Howell
    et al., 1997; Jat, 2020; Lamm, 2002; Lamm and Camp, 2007; Lamm and Trooien, 2003;
    Pablo et al., 2007; Payero et al., 2008; Phene et al., 1991). Conservation agriculture
    (CA) systems integrate three major interventions, viz. zero tillage, crop rotation,
    and soil surface cover (mulch), which can potentially improve irrigation efficiency
    by simultaneously reducing evaporation and runoff and improving soil properties
    that help in better water retention and storage in the soil profile (Camp et al.,
    1999). Sidhu et al. (2019) have reported irrigation water savings of 48%–53% and
    42%–53% in rice and wheat, respectively, under layering of SSDI and CA compared
    to the traditional flood irrigated rice-wheat system. Further, Jat et al. (2019a)
    reported that SSDI saved 46.7% and 44.7% of irrigation water under CA-based RW-mungbean
    and MW-mungbean systems, compared to flood irrigated CA-based systems in the Indo-Gangetic
    plains of India. 4. Scheduling for drip irrigation systems Scheduling irrigation
    for any irrigation method determines the productivity and efficiency of any irrigation
    system. Irrigation scheduling is not necessarily based on the full crop water
    requirement but is designed to ensure the optimal use of allocated water. In irrigated
    areas, water productivity (WP) can be improved with better systems for water conveyance,
    allocation, and distribution, and water losses can be drastically reduced by using
    advanced irrigation methods, including drip irrigation systems that allow water
    to be delivered precisely when and where it is needed (Rolaniya et al., 2015;
    Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2014). Saving irrigation water does not necessarily help
    in saving crop evapotranspiration (ET) that represents aquifer depletion (Humphreys
    et al., 2010). Therefore, optimal use of irrigation water in time and space involves
    scheduling its application with the aim of conserving water and optimizing crop
    yields based on scientific principles. Irrigation scheduling is a systematic process
    of estimating the irrigation water (IW) requirement that will avoid water stress
    in the crop over relatively short periods of time. Several researchers have developed
    improved irrigation schedules (timing and amount of irrigation) for flood-irrigated
    cereal-based systems (Prihar and Sandhu, 1987). Various common approaches for
    scheduling irrigation using different parameters, viz. crop evapotranspiration,
    plant observation, canopy temperature, soil moisture monitoring, etc. are given
    in Table 6 and are described in the succeeding section. Table 6. Various approaches
    for irrigation scheduling under field conditions. Irrigation scheduling approaches
    Parameters Plant observation-based Visible changes in plant appearance, such as
    leaf curling and wilting. Plant moisture status can also be measured using sap
    flow sensors, infrared guns, and pressure bombs, which measure leaf water potential
    Weather data-based Crop water loss is estimated on the basis of either evaporation
    from an open-pan (PE) water surface or historical climate data, such as length
    of the day (sunshine hours), maximum and minimum temperatures during the day,
    wind speed, and relative humidity. Irrigation schedules based on 0.9–1.2 IW/cumulative
    PE have been observed to be optimal for different crops Soil moisture monitoring-based
    Soil moisture used to assess water stress in the plants is measured by gravimetric
    (volume basis) and soil metric potential method. Use of a tensiometer is a most
    practical and simple tool for farmers to use for scheduling irrigation 4.1. Climate-based
    approaches Soil moisture availability and evapotranspiration (ET)-based crop water
    demand are better scientific practices than fixed schedule irrigation (e.g., weekly
    supply through canal commands) because of the low volume of IW application. Climate-based
    approaches to irrigation scheduling involve the use of a measure of cumulative
    potential evaporation (Allen et al., 1998). Potential evaporation is determined
    using open-pan evaporation, and reference ET is calculated from meteorological
    data in a variety of ways, but the modified Penman-Monteith method is generally
    preferred. Crop ET is calculated from potential ET using crop factors. Irrigation
    is scheduled after a pre-determined amount of ET has occurred, and this threshold
    amount varies with soil type (plant available water capacity (PAWC)), crop type
    (e.g., shallow versus deep-rooted crops) and stage of crop growth. The threshold
    is determined using information from past studies on crop water use. Optimal irrigation
    means the application of water precisely equal to the ET of the crop. 4.2. Evaporation-based
    approach Irrigation scheduling based on evaporation involves the application of
    IW based on moisture deficit in the soil profile to a level that does not start
    to affect the crop growth. The frequency of irrigation is set to correspond to
    the time period required for moisture depletion to about 50% of the field capacity
    of the soil. To maintain plant health, the estimated reduction in soil moisture
    due to loss through ET is made up (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Carefully managed deficit-irrigation
    of crops has high potential to significantly reduce IW demand, due to the huge
    extent of area under various crops. State-of-the-art delivery systems based on
    advanced irrigation technologies will be needed to implement successfully deficit-irrigation
    strategies. Prihar et al. (1974) proposed a simple concept for scheduling wheat
    irrigation on the basis of the ratio of the fixed depth of irrigation water (IW)
    to the cumulative pan evaporation (CPE) since the previous irrigation (open pan
    evaporation (Pan E) minus amount of rain). The quantity of IW is worked out depending
    on the permissible moisture deficit in the soil profile (Prihar et al., 1978).
    The deficit-irrigation practice propagates the use of moisture stored in the soil
    profile by extending the depth of the root zone through an increase in the length
    of roots along with the receding moisture front. Deficit irrigation has been reported
    to save two irrigations of wheat out of the six normally applied without any penalty
    on crop productivity (Balwinder-Singh et al., 2011b; Prihar et al., 1976). 4.3.
    Soil-based approach Irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture includes assessing
    the soil moisture status (volumetric soil water content or matric potential) within
    the root zone, and knowing the wilting point for irrigation of a specific crop.
    Initially, the moisture level is raised up to field capacity, and as water is
    consumed by the crop, it is applied to the crop as per requirement. Water budgeting
    is a quantitative method wherein current models to estimate ET based on temperature
    and crop water use are employed. If ET during the season exceeds effective rainfall,
    it is necessary to irrigate to sustain crops in the field. Once the ET rate of
    a location is known, the volume of IW determined may be applied at a known rate
    in a given time through a calibrated irrigation system, and 10% extra water may
    be applied to account for the losses in the delivery system. The available water
    in the root zone is the volumetric soil moisture content between permanent wilting
    point and field capacity of the soil, and the irrigation threshold is generally
    expressed as percentage depletion of total available water. A number of techniques
    used for determining volumetric soil water content are neutron attenuation, time-domain
    reflectometry (TDR), and capacitance (Charlesworth, 2005). Alternatively, irrigation
    can be scheduled based on soil matric potential (SMP), at an explicit depth in
    the soil profile (Balwinder-Singh et al., 2011a; Kakraliya et al., 2018). SMP
    is linked directly to the energy needed by the plant to extract moisture from
    the soil. Tensiometers and granular matrix sensors are most commonly used for
    determining SMP, and these can be logged or manually read. A tube tensiometer
    is an easy to use, robust and relatively inexpensive device. It consists of a
    plastic tube connected to a porous ceramic cup at one end and to a vacuum gauge
    at the other. Tensiometers provide in situ soil moisture content in real time
    and are accurate measures of SMP in the moisture range from 0 to about − 80 kPa,
    which is the moisture range required for major crops. The threshold value of SMP
    for scheduling irrigation depends on the type of crop to be grown. Based on this
    criterion, Kukal et al. (2005) recommended that puddled transplanted rice (PTR)
    should be irrigated at an SMP of − 16 kPa measured at a soil depth of 20 cm. For
    scheduling irrigation under different tillage and mulch treatments, Gupta et al.
    (2016) recommended an SMP of − 35 kPa at a soil depth of 32.5 cm for wheat, and
    − 15 kPa at a 17.5 cm soil depth for dry seeded rice. 4.4. Plant-based approach
    Plant-based irrigation scheduling is based on the physiological and phenological
    conditions of the crop. The physiological condition (water stress level) can be
    judged from canopy temperature (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010) depression relative
    to air temperature (measured by infrared thermometry), and then calculation of
    the cumulative stress degree days (SDD) (Idso et al., 1981) and crop water stress
    index (Jackson et al., 1988; Wang et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2004) can be used
    for scheduling irrigation. Phenological stages can also be used to determine when
    to irrigate. In wheat, critical growth stages for irrigation are crown root initiation
    (CRI), tillering, jointing, flowering, and the grain-filling stage. Water stress
    at any of these stages may result in loss of yield depending upon the severity
    of the stress. Das et al. (1985) reported that the canopy temperature minus the
    air temperature (Tc-Ta) for wheat under stressed conditions was higher than under
    unstressed conditions throughout the season. The Tc-Ta could explain the 55% variation
    in wheat yield in a sandy loam soil, and this index could be used as a tool to
    assess crop water status and hence to schedule irrigation (Buttar et al., 2005).
    Gontia and Tiwari (2008) concluded that the crop water stress index based on Tc-Ta
    and vapor pressure deficit could be used for monitoring plant water status and
    planning irrigation schedules in central India. However, this technique is costly
    and may not be economically feasible for smallholder farmers. Moreover, all irrigation
    techniques require a better understanding of the sensitivity of crops to water
    stress and its ecological and physiological basis, which generally varies through
    the different stages of crop growth (Zhang et al., 1999). 4.5. Deficit-irrigation
    approach Deficit irrigation (DI) is a water-saving irrigation strategy used in
    many parts of the world (Fernández et al., 2013) in which IW is applied at lower
    amounts than the full crop water requirement (i.e., ET), thereby increasing water
    use efficiency (WUE). It has been argued that the level of irrigation supplied
    under DI should be between 60% and 100% of ET. Water productivity (WP) increases
    under DI, relative to its value under full irrigation, since small amounts of
    irrigation increase crop ET more or less linearly up to a point when yield reaches
    its maximum value, and additional amounts of irrigation do not increase it any
    further. The location of that point is not easily defined and thus, when water
    is not limited, irrigation is applied in excess to avoid the risk of a yield penalty.
    The amount of IW saving and improved WP under DI strongly depends on crop (and
    cultivar), planting date, soil, and site specifications, and is generally accompanied
    by no or minor yield loss (Ahmadi et al., 2010b). In particular, many crops have
    different sensitivities to water stress at various stages of development, and
    the DI program must be designed to manage the stress so that yield decline is
    minimized. Information regarding the crop response to DI is essential to achieve
    such objectives when water is limited. In DI, irrigation water is applied during
    the drought-sensitive growth stages of a crop to maximize the water productivity,
    by allowing the crops to sustain some degree of water deficit and yield reduction
    (Fereres and Soriano, 2007). For DI, it is necessary to identify the critical
    growth stages of the various crops with respect to their water demand, and irrigation
    needs to be applied at critical growth stages to realize the maximum WUE. Ali
    et al. (2007) suggested that crown root initiation (CRI) and booting to heading
    are the two most sensitive growth stages of wheat, and that drought stress should
    be avoided during these stages. To quantify the level of DI, it is necessary to
    define the full ET requirements of the crop. When irrigation is applied at rates
    below the ET, the crop extracts water from the soil reservoir to compensate for
    the deficit. Two situations may then develop: in one case, if sufficient water
    is stored in the soil and transpiration is not limited by soil water, even though
    the volume of IW is reduced, the ET and yield are unaffected; in the other case,
    if the soil water supply is insufficient to meet the crop demand, growth and transpiration
    are reduced, and DI induces an ET reduction below its maximum potential (Yadvinder-Singh
    et al., 2014). If the stored soil water that was extracted is replenished by seasonal
    rainfall, the DI practice is sustainable and has the advantage of reducing IW
    use. In some situations, both water use and ET are reduced by DI, but yields may
    be negatively affected. In the rice-wheat (RW) system in Punjab, India, around
    four irrigations are recommended for the wheat crop at different growth stages,
    and the amount of these generally turns out to be lower than the actual amount
    of ET of the crop. It is perhaps the water stored in the profile during the preceding
    rice-crop season that is used for supplying the extra water to be used for meeting
    the ET requirements of the wheat crop. Research indicates that DI can increase
    the WP of wheat, maize, and rice by 10%–42% (Soundharajan and Sudheer, 2009).
    Deficit irrigation (DI) can also save water by reducing the IW depth by watering
    only the plant root zone, and increasing the interval between successive irrigations.
    Results of field experiments conducted in Dhenkanal, Odisha (India) showed that
    with two supplemental irrigations, the WP of maize, groundnut, sunflower, wheat,
    and potato was 0.55, 0.22, 0.23, 0.41, and 2.27 kg m− 3, and the application of
    three irrigations resulted in WP enhancement by 40%, 14%, 22%, 38% and 7%, respectively
    (Kar et al., 2004). It has been suggested that yields and WP could increase even
    more if DI was used in combination with water conservation practices (e.g., mulching)
    or rainwater harvesting techniques (Ali and Talukder, 2008). Studies conducted
    in China showed that ridge furrow planting combined with the DI system significantly
    increased wheat and maize yields and WP compared with the conventional flood irrigation
    method, and this system has been widely adopted in many parts of northwest China
    (Zhou et al., 2011). Another form of DI, partial root-zone drying (PRD), increases
    WP while margining the crop yield under limited water resources. Partial root-zone
    drying is a novel improvement of DI in which each half of the root zone is irrigated
    alternately in scheduled irrigation events (Ahmadi et al., 2010a). From an exhaustive
    review, Sepaskhah and Ahmadi (2010) concluded that in comparison to the DI strategy,
    PRD is a successful alternative irrigation technique compared to full irrigation
    that can save up to approximately 50% of IW without significant yield loss and
    thereby improve the WP. It is necessary with this technique to irrigate the two
    sides of the root system alternately to keep the roots in the dry soil alive and
    fully functional and sustain the supply of root signals (Kang et al., 2004). Alternate
    or every-other-furrow irrigation is also considered as PRD irrigation. Alternate
    furrow irrigation has been successfully used as a water-saving irrigation method
    (Grimes et al., 1968). Partial root drying has been adopted for different crops
    by using alternate furrow irrigation, resulting in higher WP (Sepaskhah and Ahmadi,
    2010). 5. Designing automated drip irrigation systems Irrigation systems in South
    Asia are still manually operated. However, feeding the growing population under
    the projected scenario of limited water availability and increased demand due
    to climate change (Barnett et al., 2005; Kayatz et al., 2019; Misra, 2014), needs
    an infusion of modern tools and technologies especially for making more precise
    use of water resources for irrigation (Ojha et al., 2015). Semi-automated and
    automated field irrigation systems are now being introduced to replace conventional
    uncontrolled surface irrigation systems. An automatic irrigation system can irrigate
    fields according to available soil moisture, soil type and climatic requirement
    for the crop-water relationship. These devices are ideally suited for irrigating
    fields precisely through surface, sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in the
    prevailing situation of water and labor shortages. Intelligent, sensor-based irrigation
    systems can help to achieve better yield per drop with optimal water use, through
    significantly improving water use efficiency (Jha et al., 2018; Ojha et al., 2015).
    5.1. Sensors and methods Automated precision irrigation is a data-centric approach
    and requires real-time data on soil moisture, temperature and weather parameters
    (Awati and Patil, 2012; Giri and Pippal, 2016). The sensors are employed for real
    time monitoring/sensing these parameters, and are useful for planning irrigation
    systems (El-Marazky et al., 2011). As well as monitoring soil moisture content,
    the sensors assess precisely the crop water demand from weather data. Initially,
    tensiometers and granular matrix sensors were used for estimating soil moisture
    to automate the control of irrigation water. Electromagnetic-based sensors (Blonquist
    et al., 2006) were also used and showed promise for the real-time estimation of
    soil moisture. Information from the moisture sensor is provided as input to the
    microcontroller that transforms the data from analog to digital. The microcontroller
    transmits the data using a radio-frequency (RF) module. The Bluetooth- and Wi-Fi-based
    wireless transmitter can transmit these data to the base station (Kim et al.,
    2008). The microcontroller LCD displays the soil moisture and flow levels. This
    facilitates remote assessment of the field conditions and real time monitoring
    of the variable-rate irrigation controller. An irrigation controller is employed
    to operate a solenoid valve that supplies water to crops when soil moisture content
    falls below a pre-defined critical point (Nemali and Van Iersel, 2006). When the
    soil moisture content is low, the power automatically switches on the pump and
    water from the tank starts flowing through the pipe; when the soil moisture reaches
    a pre-defined, soil-specific saturation limit, the power turns off and the water
    stops. A typical example of automation is a wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    drip irrigation system that comprises different types of sensors, viz. soil moisture
    sensors that are positioned over the entire farm, and wind speed and direction
    sensors. Multiple wireless sensor nodes and a gateway consisting of a sensor-based
    wireless monitoring system (Joaquín et al., 2013) provide a unique and easy solution
    with improved spatial and sequential resolutions for automated precision irrigation.
    In some systems, irrigation scheduling is accomplished by using a tensiometer
    to measure soil metric potential (SMP) that determines the soil moisture content,
    for operating drip irrigation through an automated controller system. The fuzzy
    logic system, which works on the principle of assigning a particular output depending
    on the probability of the state of the input, can improve the reliability of the
    estimated value of the irrigation amount and facilitate decision-making. Some
    researchers are also working on variable-rate sensors for improving the efficiency
    of irrigation systems. Various researchers have used different approaches and
    controllers for the automation of drip irrigation systems. Two of the early researchers,
    Phene and Howell (1984) first employed a custom-made SMP sensor to control irrigation
    of subsurface-drip-irrigated tomatoes. They observed that the productivity of
    tomatoes raised under an automated irrigation system was similar to the productivity
    of those irrigated on the basis of pan evaporation (PE), but with substantial
    savings in irrigation water. Meron et al. (1995) operated a control system for
    drip irrigation of apple trees using tensiometers equipped with an analog output
    transducer. The server side was used for data analysis, and the decisions on the
    drip irrigation were taken based on an algorithm of data mining. Jain et al. (2016)
    used an RF module along with a remote monitoring unit for automation of an irrigation
    system. Ojha et al. (2015) undertook a critical review of the available evidence
    on the deployment of WSNs in international and national scenarios, and the potential
    use of these in the advancement of different applications in agriculture. WSNs
    and ICTS play a key role in enhancing the application of precision technologies
    in agriculture, viz. monitoring of soil moisture, weather and crops in real time
    (Blonquist et al., 2006; Chetana and Rutuja, 2012; Fernández et al., 2013; Kim
    et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2014; Nam et al., 2017; Nikolidakis et al., 2015; Ojha
    et al., 2015; Pierce and Elliott, 2008; Watras et al., 2014). Table 7 lists various
    sensors and methods currently being used in automated irrigation systems. Table

    Communication techniques 5.1.1.1. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) Communication
    without using wires reduces the cost and increases the overall efficiency of domestic
    Internet installations. Wireless communication can be put to crucial use for managing
    agricultural land and monitoring farm operations. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
    are recognized as a powerful tool for collecting and processing data for low-cost
    and low-energy precision agriculture (Wang et al., 2006). WSNs provide high spatial
    and temporal resolution for monitoring soil and crop parameters via wirelessly-connected
    sensor nodes installed across the field (Akyildiz and Wang, 2005; Yang et al.,
    2007) that automatically transmit data in multi-hop mode. Technological advances
    in microcontrollers and wireless communication have led to the development of
    embedded devices (nodes) that are smaller and have a higher capability for sensing,
    measuring, controlling, transmitting, processing and storing information. WSNs
    can thus improve the monitoring of plants and soil, and can improve productivity,
    efficiency and profitability while minimizing risks due to climatic aberrations,
    water shortages, pest infestation and other factors hostile to crop growth and
    development. WSNs are helping to achieve better response times due to real-time
    sensing and communication. There are multiple ways for irrigation scheduling to
    use wireless sensors. Based on the threshold values of temperature and soil moisture
    content, the gateway allows automated actuation of the irrigation system. Some
    of the sensors, modules and valves that are commercially available for assembly
    in an irrigation network are quite complex and expensive to be deployed for managing
    fixed irrigation systems. The cost and complexity of installation, operation and
    maintenance of these systems have been limiting factors in their adoption. Sensor-based
    automated systems are of two types: (1) systems that assess soil moisture content
    based on the measurement of various weather and other parameters; and (2) systems
    that measure soil moisture content directly using sensors (Zazueta and Smajstrla,
    1992). A WSN can be used in diverse environments and has advantages over a wired
    network in terms of size, flexibility, distributed intelligence and cost (Sandhya
    and Ramesh, 2018). Certain other advantages of wireless transmission include its
    potential for deployment in areas where cabling is not feasible, as well as its
    greater simplification and significant cost savings over cabling. Soil moisture
    content and temperature are transmitted wirelessly, thereby permitting the adjustment
    of the water supply to daily weather fluctuations or to variations in the volumetric
    soil profile moisture (Grant et al., 2009). Adoption of wireless technologies
    eliminates 20%–80% of cabling costs in the setting up of industries. Water distribution
    in a field for agricultural production can be properly monitored through the use
    of wireless sensor networks. The components of a WSN application are a sensor
    node, master node, database and base station (BS). Wireless sensor networks based
    on communication technology and microcontrollers can improve existing monitoring
    methods to suitably support real-time response for a wide array of applications.
    Recent developments in wireless technology and microelectronics have led to the
    creation of low-power-consuming and low-cost components, crucial for such systems,
    especially WSNs (Vergari et al., 2009). In a sensor network, different communication
    technologies such as Zigbee, WI-FI, Bluetooth, RF, and General Packet Radio Service
    (GPRS)) have been put to use for efficient communication between the elements
    of a network—the sensor nodes and data receiver—and the network itself. Zigbee
    technology that carries small amounts of data over a short distance is suitable
    for a small farm, whereas for automation of multiple sensors in larger areas where
    Wi-Fi technology can be used, Zigbee technology is the preferred choice among
    various wireless technologies due to its efficiency in low-power connectivity
    and its ability to connect a large number of items of equipment into a single
    network. Zigbee technology utilizes a license-free and globally available 2.4
    GHz frequency band. It allows wireless applications for personal area wireless
    networks, using a standardized set of high-level communication protocols sitting
    atop a cost-effective, low-power digital radio based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
    Another mode of communication is based on a cellular internet interface (GPRS
    protocol) using a mobile data service cellular global system. The GPRS permits
    mobile phones a continuous connectivity to the network and transfers desired data
    promptly. The GPRS technology is more practical and useful due to its ability
    to transfer data; it is able to both receive and send data during a call without
    disconnecting it. Internet connectivity allows for real-time data inspection on
    the website. Its low cost permits wider use of the technology in remote control
    applications; mesh networking offers better reliability, and broad range and low
    power use permits batteries to be smaller with a longer life. The software, which
    works on a WSN and nodes, monitors the entire farm from a distant location using
    IoT. The network has two nodes: a camera node to monitor crops and collect images;
    and a sensor node that captures all the soil and environmental data, viz. temperature,
    hours of sunshine, soil moisture, air humidity, etc. Automation of the irrigation
    system is accomplished by linking two wireless sensor units (WSUs) through radio
    transceivers, which enable the transfer of data related to temperature, soil moisture
    and sunshine using XBee software and a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) module
    to convey the information via the public mobile network to a web server. Tracking
    the information online is enabled through devices with internet access or a smart
    phone Wi-Fi network. Pathan and Hate (2016) used a different set of sensors, viz.
    temperature sensor LM35, LDR, and soil moisture sensor. Awati and Patil (2012)
    and Hussain et al. (2013) have demonstrated a Zigbee-based wireless protocol for
    drip irrigation. A WSN application based on radio frequency identification (RFID)
    and quick response (QR) codes was proposed by Nam et al. (2017) for the management
    of irrigation systems. An application of Wi-Fi modules and circuitry design of
    sensors for automated irrigation is depicted in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res
    image (181KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. An application of Wi-Fi
    modules and circuitry design of sensors for automated irrigation. Gutierrez et
    al. (2014) developed and tested a microcontroller and wireless communication-based
    WSN system for an experiment in automated irrigation of malt barley. The system
    comprised two components: wireless sensor units (WSUs) in the field; and a wireless
    information unit (WIU), connected by radio transceivers that enabled the transmission
    of data on soil moisture content and temperature, using Zigbee technology to implement
    a WSN. It was operated by photovoltaics and comprised distributed networks of
    temperature- and soil-moisture sensors installed in the root zone of the crop.
    Every sensor node included a temperature probe, a soil moisture probe, a radio
    transceiver, a microcontroller for data acquisition, and a microcontroller-based
    receiver to which the sensed data were transmitted. This gateway allowed the automatic
    actuation of irrigation as soon as temperature and soil moisture values reached
    the threshold values. The gateway device also handled information from sensors,
    triggered actuators, and communicated the information to the web application.
    Threshold values of temperature and soil moisture were used to develop an algorithm
    that was programmed to control quantity of water through a gateway based on microcontrollers.
    A cellular-Internet interface-based duplex communication connection enabled the
    system to inspect the data and schedule irrigation through web-based programming.
    Mafuta et al. (2013) further improved this WSN-based, solar-powered, robust and
    automated irrigation system. The end nodes sense soil temperature and soil moisture
    content and transmit the information to the coordinator node. Based on this data,
    the coordinator node decides whether to irrigate the field or not. The coordinator
    node forwards the information on soil temperature, soil moisture, valve status,
    battery level and performance of wireless link through an Xbee unit to the gateway
    node that transmits it to a remote station via a cellular network. Major advantages
    of the system are adequate irrigation and higher energy efficiency due to power-saving
    modes. However, the primary issues with the system are that it ignores sunshine
    duration, air humidity, and wind speed when determining reference ET, which reduces
    the efficiency of irrigation, and it has a lower coverage area because of the
    Xbee devices (Yu et al., 2015). 5.1.1.2. Internet of Things (IoT) for precision
    irrigation systems Anbarasi et al. (2019) proposed an IoT application-based smart
    irrigation system to improve crop yield, wherein the decision is taken on the
    basis of real-time data from the soil. This automated irrigation system switches
    the pump ON and OFF based on the moisture content of the soil. A soil moisture
    sensor measures the exact soil moisture content, and this input operates the pumping
    motor through an operational amplifier. Farmers can see the soil moisture status
    in a mobile application or web page using a modem through IoT. They can check
    whether the water sprinklers are turned ON or OFF at any time. This model includes
    a sensor hub and a control hub. In a multi-cropping system, information about
    soil moisture content is required because information about an assortment of yields
    is stored, and this is confirmed with the information detected by the sensors.
    This system reduces the physical contribution of the irrigator and improves efficiency
    and thus productivity. In rural areas with a serious rainfall deficiency, this
    model can be used effectively to achieve extraordinary outcomes with most soils.
    By and large, the water system framework will prompt improvements to tackle the
    social, financial, natural and societal issues of the farming community. Sani
    et al. (2019) designed an IoT-based irrigation monitoring and control system,
    using different sensors and actuators, for facilitating a smart irrigation system
    to provide an autonomous supply of an adequate amount of water from a reservoir
    to crops. The main objective was to enable users to monitor and control the remote
    farm independently, in order to improve crop productivity. The system employed
    a soil moisture sensor to estimate soil water content, a pump to supply the desired
    amount of irrigation water to the crop, and a Wi-Fi module to access sensed data
    via the Internet. The sensor readings that were communicated to the Internet in
    real time were stored on a web server that served as the main base station. The
    flow chart for the process is given in Fig. 4. Based on the analysis of these
    readings, a user can monitor precisely the soil moisture content in the field.
    The system notifies the farmer in real time about any inadequacy or excess in
    the supply of irrigation water, as the water pump is turned off or on depending
    on the moisture content of the soil. Experimental and simulation results validate
    the flexibility and applicability of the proposed system, and are of the utmost
    importance for the users because through remote monitoring and control of irrigation
    supplies, the system reduces the cost of supervision. Source: Modified and updated

    system for mobile communications (GSM)-based wireless network for automated irrigation
    systems There are several studies on different crops around the world that have
    used the GSM-based wireless network for an automated irrigation system. Chaware
    et al. (2015) proposed an automatic irrigation system for shallow-rooted crops
    like vegetables, where the moisture sensors were mounted near the root zone of
    the plants to sense and provide the output. These measured values were then fed
    to the controller that sent these to the user via the GSM modem. Information about
    the time of sensing, status of water availability and water requirement of the
    crop would be provided along with the starting of the motor. The system navigates
    through a controller that can optimally handle the sensors for soil moisture assessment
    with a low requirement of energy. Tope and Patel (2016) designed a system consisting
    of two units: a transmitter unit and a receiver unit, to determine the parameters
    effectively with the use of sensors for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
    A soil moisture probe comprising several moisture sensors measures the soil moisture
    content. 2.4 GHz ISM band, XBee modules are commonly employed for efficient wireless
    data transmission without a license. The solar-powered system has a duplex communication
    link based on a cellular-Internet interface that permits data inspection and programming
    of the irrigation schedule through a web page. In this irrigation system, the
    use of solar power is significantly appropriate in situations where the supply
    of electrical power is expensive. A real-time system based on GSM and a Zigbee
    module is extremely versatile and cost-effective. A significant drawback of a
    GSM technology-based WSN is that the water level in this system is not continuously
    monitored. 5.2. Case studies of different irrigation automation schemes 5.2.1.
    Tensiometer and capacitance-based automation Tensiometers and capacitance are
    used for detecting soil moisture in designing automated irrigation systems. Testezlaf
    et al. (1997) designed and evaluated an automated irrigation system for real-time
    water management in greenhouses. The irrigation system consisted of a pressure
    transducer-mounted tensiometer to monitor the soil water content in pots. The
    pressure transducers were chosen due to their high-level analog performance, low
    cost, low range of operating pressure, and accuracy. The transducers'' output
    voltages were interfaced to a PC via the input port of a digital/analog board
    responsible for the acquisition of data and the control system. The strategy for
    automated control utilized a closed loop unit that supplied irrigation water on
    demand. This strategy helped the system to sustain constant soil moisture content
    (soil metric potential set point). The control interface paused for a preset time
    interval termed “sensor response time” to continue to monitor the tension in the
    container for the next irrigation activity to take place. This was necessary to
    account for the time taken after water application for change in SMP to be measured
    by the tensiometer. The pumps were controlled by solid state relays. The system
    monitored accurately the water status of plants in the container, applied water
    according to the plants'' demand, and kept a record of applied water. However,
    Testezlaf and colleagues suggested further testing of the system at field level
    to assess its feasibility on a commercial scale. During testing at lower tension
    values, a significant variance was observed in the data recorded by sensors placed
    in similar substrate conditions in different containers. This variation in sensed
    data suggests that in managing an irrigation system relying on sensors that measure
    SMP, the number of plants being monitored, and whether these form a substantial
    sample of the total number of plants or of the experimental plot in the irrigation
    station should be considered. Lakshmiprasad et al. (2014) developed an intelligent
    irrigation system consisting of a server equipped with a microcontroller processor
    to measure different parameters. It utilized only one parameter at a time, e.g.,
    a soil moisture sensor to assess the moisture content. For instance, if we are
    using a soil moisture sensor for irrigation control in an automated drip irrigation
    system, then whenever the soil moisture level falls below the threshold value,
    then and only then does the system direct the valve to change from the OFF to
    the ON position, and when the soil moisture level reaches the optimum preset level
    then the system is switched OFF automatically. To measure the soil moisture content,
    a 10 HS coded soil moisture sensor was used. The sensor 10 HS used in this system
    has a low power requirement and a much higher resolution, and uses a capacitance
    technique to estimate the volumetric moisture content of the soil by determining
    its dielectric constant; it enables measurement as many times as required over
    a long period with a low battery usage. It has a GSM communication device that
    transmits the data to a farmer or receives it from a farmer who can take appropriate
    action. The system is also equipped with electrochemical sensors to assess the
    spatial variability of various chemical properties of the soil. The capacitance-based
    sensor consists of two metal plates separated by a polymer film that is non-conductive.
    This film gathers air moisture, which causes minor changes in voltage between
    these plates. These changes are converted into digital values indicating the moisture
    content of the air. The RS 232-level converter which performs between − 15 V and
    + 15 V, is used for serial communication. Recently, an automatic subsurface drip
    irrigation system based on WSNs using tensiometer-mounted SMP sensors has been
    designed and is being evaluated in the rice-wheat system at the research farm
    of BISA, Ladhowal (Ludhiana), Punjab, India. Results from initial observations
    reveal that the new automatic system performed well and delivered the desired
    quantity of irrigation water whenever SMP values fell below the pre-fixed threshold
    value (H.S. Sidhu, personal communication, 2018). The system is being evaluated
    on a large farm for its performance and further improvements if necessary. Stone
    et al. (1985) developed a magnificent, microcomputer-based, low-cost data-acquisition
    system to assess soil moisture potential continuously. The system comprises a
    tensiometer-mounted pressure transducer that performs well under field conditions.
    5.2.2. Smart phone and solar power-based irrigation automation A recent development
    in irrigation automation technology includes the use of sensor-based smart phone
    apps (Gutierrez et al., 2015). On activation of the app, the lighting circuit
    is switched on and the app takes a photograph of the soil; the lighting circuit
    is then switched off to save power. The RGB photo of the soil is transformed to
    a grayscale image wherein white pixels represent a dry area and dark pixels represent
    a wet area. Thereafter, the process of pixel segregation is started to determine
    the number of saturated pixels, which is the difference between the gray and light
    field matrices. A number is computed from the relatively wet soil, and the router
    node communicates this to the gateway node that controls the time of application
    of the irrigation water. This system has the advantages of reduced complexity
    of hardware, wide-ranging network coverage due to the use of Wi-Fi, and more energy
    efficiency due to being able to tap the mobile to put it into sleep mode. To arrive
    at a cumulative relatively wet soil area, more irrigation sensors have to be embedded
    in the smart phone, but that increases the cost of the system. Merlin et al. (2015)
    designed and tested an automated irrigation system using WSNs that is solar powered,
    reliable, and economical. As soon as wireless sensor nodes determine soil moisture,
    the measured value is compared with reference values by means of an on-stream
    camera. This actuates the valve for irrigation. When irrigation is not required,
    the microcontroller is in sleep mode, and when irrigation is required it shifts
    to active mode. The major advantages of the system are increased energy efficiency
    through using the power-saving mode, and dynamic irrigation. However, as air temperature,
    hours of sunshine, and wind speed are not considered for working out reference
    ET in this case, the irrigation efficiency of the system is reduced. 5.2.3. Combination
    of soil and weather sensors-based automation A combination of soil moisture sensors
    and weather sensors has also been advocated for automated irrigation by several
    researchers. Gokul et al. (2016) reviewed existing automated irrigation technologies.
    At present, mainly wireless LAN, Bluetooth, and Zigbee are used as transmission
    mediums from end nodes to sink node, which results in coverage of a lesser area.
    Some of the current methods only use soil moisture content and humidity values
    for deciding when to irrigate. However, crop water demand is also dependent on
    the duration and intensity of sunshine, wind speed, and air temperature, which
    contributes to a flawed estimation of the irrigation schedule. Further, use of
    an algorithm based on threshold values and fuzzy logic affects the precision of
    output. Several factors—the algorithm for determining reference ET, the capabilities
    of the sensor node to communicate and process the information, and likely exceptions
    during the application of irrigation—need special attention for efficient automated
    irrigation systems. Therefore, to achieve high precision, the combination of soil
    moisture sensors and weather-based sensors is highly useful. John et al. (2015)
    described a WSN for sensing the relative humidity of air, soil moisture, and temperature.
    The system comprises clusters of nodes, and the lifetime of the network node is
    improved through a sleep-wake up plan. A drip irrigation system automated with
    an effective routing protocol termed Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing Protocol
    (ECHERP) was evaluated by Nikolidakis et al. (2015). All the data sensed by the
    sensor nodes are forwarded to the base station that acts as a gateway to transmit
    these data to the server. This system employs the Priestley-Taylor method for
    determining the reference ET. The system also considers the historical data to
    make the irrigation automation process more useful by taking optimal irrigation
    decisions. This system has higher energy efficiency than other routing protocols
    like LEACH, TEEN and PEGASIS, and decisions based on historical data help in achieving
    high-impact optimal irrigation. The system has limitations, as humidity and duration
    of sunshine are not considered for estimating reference ET; in addition, irrigation
    efficiency is low, and the overall coverage range of the Zigbee protocol is also
    low. Similarly, Anurag et al. (2008) developed a WSN for precision irrigation
    wherein weather and environmental data are sensed and transmitted to a central
    repository in real-time. The network consisted of three separate sections: (i)
    sensor nodes; (ii) wireless mesh network; and (iii) actuation devices based on
    standards laid out in IEEE-802.15.4; the selection was based on four attributes
    suitable for commonly grown crops. They developed a new algorithm of static routing
    suitable for sensing applications. The tree-based routing can be most efficiently
    used as compared to other Zigbee-supported routing algorithms. Chikankar et al.
    (2015) used a Zigbee technology-based WSN with a tree-based structure to control
    soil moisture, air humidity, and temperature. They first prepared a pictorial
    topology with routers installed along the path at suitable distances. A basic
    algorithm was used to determine the address of various routers. The algorithm
    operated on an algorithm of the lowest depth first, i.e., the first address was
    assigned to the deepest router, and then it “worked up” the topology. The tracking
    needs to permit us for advance setting of addresses to maintain the tree structure.
    The actuation was accomplished based on information provided by the sensors. The
    system generated automatic warning messages on the console after the threshold
    value was exceeded, so that the requisite action could be initiated. At the controller
    end, these valve-based actuators were operated by discrete electrical switches.
    An RFID device was attached to each actuator to uniquely identify and control
    it. An automated drip irrigation system powered by photo photovoltaically and
    consisting of a distributed wireless network of temperature and soil moisture
    sensors is deployed in the crop root zone. Every sensor node includes a soil moisture
    sensor, temperature sensor, data acquisition microcontroller, and radio transceiver;
    the sensed data is communicated to a receiver that is also based on a microcontroller.
    The automated drip irrigation system developed by Nalini and Ramakrishna (2018)
    has three parts, viz. a humidity-sensing part, a control unit, and an output segment
    for deciding irrigation. The moisture content of the soil is sensed through a
    YL-69 soil sensor (a resistance-type sensor). The control unit consists of an
    Arduino microcontroller. The switching controls are of an on/off type that depends
    on soil moisture content. The soil moisture module consists of two parts, an amplifier
    circuit and the probes. The analog output provides information regarding plant
    moisture in real-time, and this output is used by the system. A water pump connected
    to the relay module works when this module receives such instruction from the
    microcontroller. The Arduino board is energized using a 7 V to 12 V solar panel,
    a plug-in adaptor or a wall wart. The smart irrigation system for automatic watering
    is depicted as a Block diagram in Fig. 5. Whenever the soil moisture content is
    low, the sensors detect the moisture change and signal to the microcontroller
    to start the pump. Download : Download high-res image (513KB) Download : Download

    on crop productivity and water saving Several studies carried out in different
    production systems and geographical areas across the world have demonstrated the
    tangible benefits of automated irrigation systems using different sensors (Table
    8) over traditional water management practices. In the extremely arid climatic
    conditions of Saudi Arabia, Al-Ghobari et al. (2017) measured crop productivity
    and water saving. They reported on the performance of an ET controller-based automated
    drip irrigation system on yields of wheat and tomato, and found significantly
    higher irrigation efficiency for the automated drip irrigation system (1.64 kg
    m− 3 for wheat and 6.50 kg m− 3 for tomato) than for the traditional drip irrigation
    control system (1.47 kg m− 3for wheat and 5.72 kg m− 3 for tomato). Thus, an automated
    drip irrigation system provides significant (up to 26%) saving of water along
    with higher crop productivity as compared to the conventional control system.

    sensor-based automated drip irrigation system with a non-automated drip system
    for okra (Abelmoschus esculents) and reported a substantial reduction in water
    use with the automated drip system. Using a microcontroller-based automated drip
    irrigation system for sweet corn that was irrigated when soil moisture content
    reached 70% of field capacity, Deekshithulu et al. (2018) reported 36% less water
    use as compared to the flood irrigation method, with respective water use of 332
    and 520 mm. 6. Artificial intelligence-based automated irrigation system Limited
    information is available for the prediction and analysis of agricultural data-based
    automated irrigation using wireless sensor-based systems and machine learning
    (to date, most such systems are either partly automated or even fully automated
    in some cases but limited to a small area). With the advances in machine-to-machine
    (M2M) platforms (Antón-Haro et al., 2013) that are a part of IoT, it has become
    possible for different devices to communicate with each other without human intervention.
    Machine learning has been used to monitor agricultural fields for the selection
    of crops, estimation of yields, and forecasting of diseases. This technology uses
    a rule editor tool to derive the irrigation rule. The tool also permits visualization
    of the measuring constraints and evaluated status. Several research studies have
    already been carried out on the use of wireless sensors and mobile computing for
    automating irrigation systems. Research is also being done on the application
    of machine learning in agricultural systems. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication
    is evolving as a scene-changing technology, as it allows objects and devices to
    interconnect with each other and transmit information to a server or a cloud through
    a core network. Shekhar et al. (2017) have developed an IoT-based intelligent
    automated drip irrigation system where moisture and temperature sensors have been
    placed in the field to capture data for its irrigation. The information supplied
    by the sensors to the gateway unit is forwarded to the control unit Raspberry
    pi that holds a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) machine learning algorithm for activating
    the water pump to irrigate the field. Information regarding the data analyzed
    is recorded in the Cloud server which can be accessed by farmers from their smart
    phone. The information from the temperature and moisture sensors is received as
    an input to the microcontroller to which these are connected. This is a fully
    automated system where the devices communicate with each other and use artificial
    intelligence for deciding the amount and timing of the water to be applied to
    the field. It reduces the requirement for human resources in carrying out irrigation.
    This automated drip irrigation system has been observed to be feasible and economical
    for optimal use of irrigation water for crop production. The irrigation system
    can be modified to meet the specific needs of the crop, and the maintenance requirements
    of such systems are also minimal. A comprehensive process for an intelligent irrigation

    of automated drip irrigation systems in cereal systems of South Asia 7.1. Plot-scale
    evidence on automated drip irrigation in the rice-wheat system A plot level study:
    one of the first experiments on an automated micro-irrigation system in a Conservation
    Agriculture (CA)-based rice-wheat rotation was carried out at the Borlaug Institute
    for South Asia (BISA), International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),
    Ludhiana, Punjab, India. The automated sensor was evaluated for both surface drip
    (SD) and subsurface drip (SSD) irrigation systems, and compared with conventional-till
    (CT) and zero-till (ZT) flood irrigated systems with rice-wheat rotation. The
    sensor-based, real-time irrigation systems (IRROMETER tensiometer with a magnetic
    switch having switching capability at the desired soil metric potential (SMP)),
    which sent a signal to the electrically operated tube-well and solenoid valve
    whenever the SMP fell below a predetermined critical level (− 15 kPa) in rice
    and (− 35 kPa) in wheat, were evaluated for crop yields and use of irrigation
    water. The grain yield of the rice-wheat systems varied significantly under four
    management scenarios with automated irrigation (CT with flood irrigation, ZT with
    flood irrigation, ZT with subsurface drip (ZT-SSD) and ZT with surface drip (ZT-SD).
    The results revealed that no-till coupled with the automated drip-irrigation system
    produced a significantly higher rice-wheat yield compared with the automated flood-irrigated
    system; conventional tillage coupled with the flood-irrigated system produced
    the lowest yield. The irrigation water productivity of the rice-wheat system was
    doubled from 1.13 to 2.28 kg/m3 under the no-till rice-wheat system coupled with
    automated subsurface drip irrigation, compared to the conventional-tillage, flood-irrigated
    system (Fig. 7). The results showed that MPS6 sensors could be used effectively
    for automated irrigation under both subsurface drip and flood conditions in rice-wheat
    rotation with a suitable communication device. Download : Download high-res image

    on automated drip irrigation systems A landscape-scale project on solar-powered
    micro-irrigation (Fig. 8), the first of its kind in the region, was commissioned
    in the Hoshiarpur district of Punjab by the Department of Soil and Water Conservation,
    Government of Punjab, India in 2017. In this landscape model, an automated micro-irrigation
    pilot project covering 664 ha of land owned by1200 smallholder farmers, 15.7 cusec
    of water is lifted from three different points of a canal, conveyed to fields
    through underground pipelines, and used for irrigation at plot level through drip-
    and sprinkler-irrigation systems only. As a self-sustaining energy source, the
    system consists of around 3800 solar photovoltaic panels, generating 1.1 MW of
    energy and powering 46 pump sets of 20–25 hp capacity that convey water to farmers''
    fields through a fully remotely-automated system, combined with 8.6 km of HDPE,
    356.46 km of PVC underground pipelines, and 735.80 km of laterals (LLDPE) along
    with 213 solar tracking devices and 38,100 sprinkler units. The area under the
    pilot project has been divided into 378 smaller sections of 1.5 ha, each connected
    through 18 distribution lines equipped with pre-programmed time-based sensors
    and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) that transmit radio signals to the central server
    room; this is equipped with dedicatedly-developed Supervisory Control and Data
    Acquisition (SCADA) software for switching on/off the water supply as per availability
    and requirement. The duration of water flow in a particular distribution line
    to each section is pre-programmed as per type of crop and its water requirement,
    and regulated with valves controlled from the central server station, thus disseminating
    only a dedicated volume of water. Thus, over-irrigation and water wastage are
    prevented. The sectional valves are connected to drip or sprinkler irrigation
    systems, depending upon the crop grown for on-farm irrigation. The whole pilot
    is managed by 18 Water User Associations (WUAs), formed among participating farmers,
    that are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the project. The results
    indicate that there has been a significant increase in acreage under irrigation,
    cropping intensity, water productivity, and farmers'' income (GoP, 2020). This
    is one successful example of a landscape-scale automated micro-irrigation system
    in smallholder systems in South Asia. Download : Download high-res image (659KB)

    remains the backbone of South Asia''s economy and the largest (~ 90%) consumer
    of renewable water. With the increasing water scarcity in the region, particularly
    Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), agricultural production even at the current level
    might not be sustainable. Moreover, climate change is already negatively impacting
    the productivity of cereal crops in many parts of the region, and will have more
    serious impacts on future water availability and hence on cereal production. Therefore,
    major efforts are needed to conserve water through making the best use of every
    drop to produce more with it. Bundling new cutting-edge technologies such as micro-irrigation,
    and especially drip irrigation, coupled with automation in water application can
    help to increase efficiency of application and water productivity, especially
    in high water-consuming, cereal-based systems. Studies have shown that the use
    of appropriate irrigation methods (e.g., drip irrigation systems) coupled with
    soil- and climate-based approaches will lead to a large saving in irrigation water
    and increase in water productivity. However, recent advances in the development
    of WSNs have introduced a new dimension into the automation of drip irrigation,
    promoting the precision application of water and nutrients simultaneously. Research
    efforts are being made in irrigation automation to reduce investment, and in the
    operation and maintenance costs of the systems, while optimizing the output and
    improving energy efficiency. Most of the techniques discussed in this chapter
    use wireless LAN, Bluetooth, and XBee as the medium of communication between end
    nodes and sink nodes which results in lower area coverage. The technology issues
    at present are the optimization of the data measurement interval, optimal and
    efficient deployment strategies, routing protocols and energy-efficient medium
    access. Some of the existing methods rely mainly on soil moisture content and
    humidity values to decide the timing and amount of water for irrigation. Threshold-based
    algorithms and fuzzy logic are used in many existing techniques, which affects
    the accuracy of the output. The advances in sensor technology, i.e., time-domain
    reflectometry (TDR) and impedance-capacitance-based approaches, have contributed
    to the development of robust and less expensive devices that are better suited
    for different types of soils and for continuous monitoring of soil moisture content,
    and thus offer an opportunity for efficient irrigation-water management in most
    cropping systems. Several factors are responsible for the effective automation
    of irrigation, viz. algorithms for finding reference evapotranspiration, capability
    of sensor nodes in terms of communication, and storing and processing information.
    New technological advances, viz. sensor-cloud computing with improved data management
    and access control, big-data analytics for decision support systems to improve
    water productivity, and the Internet of Things (IoT), can provide flexible control
    mechanisms in real time for on-field parameters, and offer new opportunities in
    the development of futuristic applications for automated drip irrigation systems
    that can help to save water, energy and labor costs while improving crop and water
    productivity, as compared to traditional systems. 9. The way forward However,
    although during the past decade, there have been noteworthy advances in the use
    of WSNs for precision irrigation scheduling; many challenges in its field-scale
    application still remain. An “ideal” automated irrigation scheduling system should
    (i) have a low initial cost and minimal operating and maintenance costs; (ii)
    be reliable and robust; (iii) be able to reduce labor requirements significantly
    through automation; (iv) be sensitive to small changes in evaporative demand,
    soil moisture content, and plant responses; (v) be readily adaptable to different
    crops, their stages of growth or their environments without requiring much recalibration;
    (vi) permit continuous monitoring of soil water status, and rapidly respond to
    changing weather conditions in real time; and (vii) be user-friendly and require
    minimal training for users to operate and maintain. Further, to optimize the permissible
    benefits to the users and address their legitimate concerns, additional research
    and development efforts are required to standardize WSN protocols and communication
    frequencies, work with large datasets, and the calibration of sensors and equipment
    and their maintenance. Development of predictive models for the efficient use
    of irrigation water and nutrients is fast-maturing, but these need to be validated
    and verified for use in different environments. From the user point of view, there
    is a need to develop WSNs that are rapidly deployable in the field and have maximum
    utility at a minimal cost. The nodes should have low energy requirements, possibly
    with recharge options. The user, through a software interface, should be provided
    with an easily interpretable summary of the data collected by the sensors in real
    time, preferably as a customized output that allows large flexibility in actuating
    the irrigation control valves and other control devices. WSNs are rapidly maturing
    as a technology for precision irrigation scheduling and are likely to be propagated
    in future for promoting efficient water use in agriculture. The development of
    intelligent irrigation systems is going to play a crucial role in improving the
    sustainability of cereal systems and thereby the food security of nations in the
    future. Acknowledgments We sincerely acknowledge the support and contributions

    Water Management Citation Excerpt : It is therefore important to use suitable
    irrigation systems and management techniques that both save water and reduce leaching
    by reducing deep percolation. Deficit irrigation (DI) is a water-saving technique
    used in recent years in many parts of the world and especially in areas where
    water supply is limited, leads to improved water productivity and water use efficiency,
    since the amount of water applied is less than the total water needs of the crop,
    without compromising production (Fereres and Soriano, 2007; Asrey et al., 2018;
    Sidhu et al., 2021). Whereas, Partial Root-zone Drying (PRD) is a new form of
    DI that has significantly improved yield per unit of water applied compared to
    conventional irrigation (Sadras, 2009; Ahmadi et al., 2010), as well as improved
    water use efficiency without significant reduction in yield (Kang and Zhang, 2004;
    Ben Nouna et al., 2016). Show abstract Optimization of drip irrigation and fertilization
    regimes to enhance winter wheat grain yield by improving post-anthesis dry matter
    accumulation and translocation in northwest China 2022, Agricultural Water Management
    Citation Excerpt : However, the scarce water resources resulting from the low
    precipitation and frequent drought especially over the growing period of winter
    wheat, is a major factor that limits the wheat production in northwest China (Lu
    et al., 2022; Si et al., 2020). Water deficiency negatively influences crop growth
    and yield formation, because drought stress results in many plant physiological
    and biochemical reactions (Jiang et al., 2020; Sidhua et al., 2021; Liu et al.,
    2016). Irrigation, especially drip irrigation is conductive to saving water and
    improving crop photosynthesis and promoting dry matter accumulation, grain filling
    and yield formation (Cao et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Madani et al., 2010; Yan
    et al., 2022). Show abstract Efficiency dynamics among onion growers in Maharashtra:

    in Agriculture by Machine and Deep Learning Techniques: A Review of Recent Developments
    Article 21 April 2021 Smart Agricultural Solutions Through Machine Learning Chapter
    © 2023 1 Introduction Artificial Intelligence is our chance to save the future
    of how we tend to our global food supply. Currently, the use of major herbicides,
    pesticides and fungicides are restricted or even forbidden in parts of the world,
    and for the past couple of years, this trend has grown in popularity [2]. While
    this at first glance is great for the environment, it has drastic consequences
    for farmers that now need an alternative to protect their crop and yield. With
    the world demand for food rising continually, it gets increasingly difficult to
    find manual labor to replace any already unpopular chemical-based treatment methods.
    Theoretically, precise spraying technology can tremendously reduce the use of
    chemicals and automated mechanical weed control can replace any missing manual
    labor. What keeps farmers from resorting to a technological solution is its unavailability:
    Currently available detection and application devices are very limited in the
    different types of weeds and plants they can recognize, have mediocre performance
    (as a trade-off for high detection speeds) or do not scale into high precision
    use cases due to cheap sensor and lighting techniques. Additionally, their precision
    and the granularity of their detections are often not suitable for effective crop
    protection and sufficient reduction of chemical use. To overcome this unavailability,
    Deepfield Robotics (a division in the Bosch Group) presents their approach to
    apply modern AI methodology in real world field tasks that alleviate the two major
    issues coming up in crop protection: Replacing manual labor due to missing work
    force, and greatly reducing the use of chemicals. To enable the effective use
    of AI, and more specifically of Deep Learning methods, Deepfield Robotics gathered
    a tremendous amount of training data for plant classification. This makes their
    algorithms able to act as the workhorse for a task currently only human labor
    can solve efficiently and effectively: Recognizing plants in multiple growing
    stages, making automated selective field treatment possible. A precursor technology
    to their current approach is the Bosch BoniRob robot [6]. This article documents
    the learnings from past studies and prototype developments, and the resulting
    Deepfield plant classification system addressing the above points. Different applications
    enabled by this classification are discussed, learnings from past developments
    are presented, and a perspective for future developments and promising use cases
    is given. 2 Plant Classification via Semantic Segmentation To make fine-grained
    decisions about plant treatment on diverse fields, Deepfield Robotics developed
    a Deep Learning based framework for semantic segmentation of plants on fields.
    As its input this method requires well-defined camera images of the field ground.
    These images contain color (RGB) channels and an additional near infrared (NIR)
    channel (similar to the images presented by [5]) to make use of the high reflectance
    of organic material in the non-visual infrared range. For each image, all pixels
    (based on larger super pixel patches) are either classified as part of a specific
    crop or weed and are marked as desirable and undesirable plant species for the
    current, particular field and application. A fusion mechanism stitches all image
    patches together using a precise localization system to a larger image, representing
    the entire field plot. Figure 1 depicts such a fusion result. Crops are blue while
    weeds are red. Depending on the treatment strategy applied, one sort is treated
    and the other one is spared. In the case of weed management, a weeding tool might
    target the red weeds but keep its distance from the blue crops. Fig. 1 Long patch
    of sugar beet plants classified as sugar beet crops (blue) and different weeds
    (red) Full size image Whether a particular plant is considered a crop or a weed
    strongly depends on the current situation. This is accounted for using different
    expert classifiers that specialize on specific crops. Amaranth for example can
    be a cultivated plant, but when found within sugar beet fields it is considered
    an undesirable weed. The same applies to different soil types: Should the color
    or texture of a given field’s soil type strongly differ from other regions although
    the same plants are present, the classification results are prone to degradation.
    Specialized classifiers, at the cost of additional labeled datasets of the new
    soil type and subsequent training effort, can help solve this issue. Generating
    Deep Learning based classifiers capable of identifying crops and weeds to a degree
    applicable for effective ground treatment requires large amounts of diverse, properly
    labeled training data. Over the last couple of years, Deepfield Robotics amassed
    more than 4.3 million pixel-wise labeled images with more than 40 crop and weed
    classes captured in various growing stages, light conditions, weather situations,
    and on different soil types. This data basis combined with a very careful Deep
    Learning neural network design and a heavy-duty training hardware infrastructure
    enables the current system to distinguish crops from weeds in real world situations
    with an average precision of about 93% (area under precision-recall curve) and
    a total accuracy of 98.4% (98.4% correct classification rate per pixel). The respective
    curves are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Classification Quality of Deepfield Deep Learning
    based Plant Classifiers Full size image 2.1 Deep Learning Network Architecture
    As already denoted in [3], the variations in plant size (and thus growing stages)
    to consider complicate the topic of building a uniform network for plant classification.
    In addition to that, generalization to various fields and illumination conditions
    are the main challenges. To account for these challenges, Deepfield Robotics has
    trained networks with different network architectures that work together in an
    ensemble: ResNeXt [7] and DenseNet [8] backbones are combined with either an FCN
    [9] or a U-NET [10, 11] fashion for semantic segmentation. 2.2 A Challenge in
    Larger Crops: Stem Detection For proper treatment of larger plants with a wide
    canopy, knowledge of their approximate stem position helps in both, avoiding hurting
    desired plants and effectively removing undesired ones. As [4] put it, “The stem
    positions are a prerequisite in selective, high precision treatments [...]”. To
    this end, we strive to incorporate a Deep Learning based approach that specializes
    in reliably detecting plants stems. The intrinsic structure of plant leafs can
    hint at the approximate stem position of a plant. A Deep Learning based approach
    can exploit this structure to give a prior on where the actual stem might reside.
    This requires manual guessing and labeling of the actual stem positions in a training
    dataset used for creating a suitable classifier but would result in a stable classification
    mechanism that predicts the approximate stem center. Since this method is more
    prone to inaccuracy caused by errors in the training data and due to differently
    sized stem diameters, a larger treatment safety distance must be considered to
    not unintentionally hurt a crop plant’s stem. A much easier, but also much cruder
    approach would be to guess the stem position based on the plant’s visual center
    of mass. Since a plant’s leafs are not necessarily uniformly distributed, this
    approach yields highly uncertain results requiring a rather large safety radius
    around the guessed stem position, rendering the overall approach ineffective.
    Stem detection is especially important for mechanical weeding applications in
    which weeds must be removed that grow very closely to crop plants. In herbicide
    applications, farmers carefully select the herbicides applied to ensure that the
    cultivated crop is unaffected. The gain in herbicide spotting applications is
    hence neglectable. 3 Treatment Methods Based on Classification Results Protecting
    crops especially in early growth stages requires effective methods for suppressing
    weeds close to the crop. There are two dominant, traditional methods for selective
    plant treatments in agriculture: Weed control by manual hoeing, and spraying chemical
    herbicides. The former is essential for organic farmers, as they are required
    to grow plants completely free of chemical weed control substances. Both methods
    require new perspectives: Manual labor is increasingly difficult to find and gets
    more expensive, while more and more herbicide agents are either restricted or
    outright forbidden [2]. In addition to that, the broad acre spraying practice
    of the past lead to multi-resistant weeds and affected areas are no longer arable
    due to missing proper weed control options [1]. Fig. 3 Mechanical Weeding Tool
    Prototype Full size image AI supported methods alleviate part of both problems:
    Automated systems can eliminate or reduce the need for human labor, and offer
    precise spot spraying techniques rather than spraying entire fields with control
    substances. In terms of mechanical weeding, Fig. 3 shows a mechanical weeding
    tool that allows automated machinery to remove unwanted plants from the field.
    Fig. 4 Classification results after fusion (crops are blue, weeds are red) Full
    size image Fig. 5 Two generated paths (green) based on classification results
    Full size image Figures 4 and 5 show one example of how an automated system can
    assess the required weeding effort on a given field, helping to reduce the need
    for human labor. In Fig. 4, a patch of field is classified and stitched together
    (weeds to remove are shown in red; crops to protect are shown in blue). A path-planning
    algorithm subsequently generates a traveling path for a tool as shown in Fig.
    3. The resulting path and affected ground regions are shown in Fig. 5. Here, two
    weeding tools were operated in parallel to increase the overall machine’s efficiency;
    hence, two travelling paths were generated. The bright green lines are the weeding
    tools’ center points; the transparent green area is the affected area. The path
    planner applied in this scenario can be adjusted for a certain “aggressiveness”.
    The more aggressive the planner is the more reward it gains when removing weeds
    even close to crops. In its conservative setting, the planner always keeps a minimum
    distance from any crop detected. Several parameters of the physical weeding tool
    affect the parametrization of the planner: Maximum movement speed, acceleration
    and jerk, and the tool’s area of effect, but also the movement speed of the tool’s
    host machine—a robot or a tractor implement. This approach operates on a moving
    window—the planned path results from a classification sensor (a camera in this
    case) and is executed by a tractor implement tool further back on the same machine,
    only requiring one field treatment. 4 Platform Development The current system
    design as described above is the result of a multi-tier study. In total, four
    robot platforms were evaluated of which the first three are depicted in Fig. 6
    and the latest design is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 6 Past robot designs developed
    by Deepfield Robotics Full size image Fig. 7 Newest robot design, able to perform
    autonomous weeding Full size image The above robot platforms are reference architectures
    that carry the initially described plant classification and actuator control module.
    The newest design shown in Fig. 7 is an autonomous platform that can perform weed
    control including all steps from online-classification, fusion of the results,
    actuator path planning, down to the mechanical treatment. Besides that, the robot
    is also capable of recording new image data for training the plant classifiers.
    The availability of this kind of autonomous robot class relieves part of the manual
    labor required for weed management, and shifts some of the effort into manual
    image labeling, classifier development and mechanical engineering. 5 Outlook Based
    on the insights gained through the above robot platforms and algorithm refinement,
    the system developed by Deepfield Robotics is now in a stage mature enough for
    addressing more diverse use cases. Besides mechanical weeding and spot spraying,
    additional tasks include targeted fertilization, nano irrigation, and automated
    phenotyping connected to downstream data businesses. An active, secure internet
    connection allows Deepfield’s robots to communicate with the data backbone in
    a centralized data center and archive recorded data, as well as receive new parametrizations
    during deployment on the field. The same is true for the tractor implement modules
    originating from the robot reference architecture: Batches of modules in a tractor
    implement can store diagnostics data on remote servers, receive new versions of
    classifiers, and even store recorded image data for offline classifier improvement.
    6 Conclusion The presented development results justify AI as a prominent candidate
    for supporting crop protection tasks, which is a major challenge faced by farmers
    in the near and long term future. Deep Learning has found many applications in
    industrial automation, the entertainment industry, and many security related fields.
    Successfully applying AI and Deep Learning to agricultural plant classification
    and the diverse characteristics found on agricultural fields is a huge feat, but
    can greatly ease farming at large. References Union of concerned scientists. The

  description: Burkina Faso ranges amongst the fastest growing countries in the world
    with an annual population growth rate of more than three percent. This trend has
    consequences for food security since agricultural productivity is still on a comparatively
    low level in Burkina Faso. In order to compensate for the low productivity, the
    agricultural areas are expanding quickly. The mapping and monitoring of this expansion
    is difficult, even on the basis of remote sensing imagery, since the extensive
    farming practices and frequent cloud coverage in the area make the delineation
    of cultivated land from other land cover and land use types a challenging task.
    However, as the rapidly increasing population could have considerable effects
    on the natural resources and on the regional development of the country, methods
    for improved mapping of LULCC (land use and land cover change) are needed. For
    this study, we applied the newly developed ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal
    Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) framework to generate high temporal (8-day)
    and high spatial (30 m) resolution NDVI time series for all of Burkina Faso for
    the years 2001, 2007, and 2014. For this purpose, more than 500 Landsat scenes
    and 3000 MODIS scenes were processed with this automated framework. The generated
    ESTARFM NDVI time series enabled extraction of per-pixel phenological features
    that all together served as input for the delineation of agricultural areas via
    random forest classification at 30 m spatial resolution for entire Burkina Faso
    and the three years. For training and validation, a randomly sampled reference
    dataset was generated from Google Earth images and based on expert knowledge.
    The overall accuracies of 92% (2001), 91% (2007), and 91% (2014) indicate the
    well-functioning of the applied methodology. The results show an expansion of
    agricultural area of 91% between 2001 and 2014 to a total of 116,900 km2. While
    rainfed agricultural areas account for the major part of this trend, irrigated
    areas and plantations also increased considerably, primarily promoted by specific
    development projects. This expansion goes in line with the rapid population growth
    in most provinces of Burkina Faso where land was still available for an expansion
    of agricultural area. The analysis of agricultural encroachment into protected
    areas and their surroundings highlights the increased human pressure on these
    areas and the challenges of environmental protection for the future.

    keyboard_arrow_down     Browse Figures Versions Notes Abstract Burkina Faso ranges
    amongst the fastest growing countries in the world with an annual population growth
    rate of more than three percent. This trend has consequences for food security
    since agricultural productivity is still on a comparatively low level in Burkina
    Faso. In order to compensate for the low productivity, the agricultural areas
    are expanding quickly. The mapping and monitoring of this expansion is difficult,
    even on the basis of remote sensing imagery, since the extensive farming practices
    and frequent cloud coverage in the area make the delineation of cultivated land
    from other land cover and land use types a challenging task. However, as the rapidly
    increasing population could have considerable effects on the natural resources
    and on the regional development of the country, methods for improved mapping of
    LULCC (land use and land cover change) are needed. For this study, we applied
    the newly developed ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance
    Fusion Model) framework to generate high temporal (8-day) and high spatial (30
    m) resolution NDVI time series for all of Burkina Faso for the years 2001, 2007,
    and 2014. For this purpose, more than 500 Landsat scenes and 3000 MODIS scenes
    were processed with this automated framework. The generated ESTARFM NDVI time
    series enabled extraction of per-pixel phenological features that all together
    served as input for the delineation of agricultural areas via random forest classification
    at 30 m spatial resolution for entire Burkina Faso and the three years. For training
    and validation, a randomly sampled reference dataset was generated from Google
    Earth images and based on expert knowledge. The overall accuracies of 92% (2001),
    91% (2007), and 91% (2014) indicate the well-functioning of the applied methodology.
    The results show an expansion of agricultural area of 91% between 2001 and 2014
    to a total of 116,900 km². While rainfed agricultural areas account for the major
    part of this trend, irrigated areas and plantations also increased considerably,
    primarily promoted by specific development projects. This expansion goes in line
    with the rapid population growth in most provinces of Burkina Faso where land
    was still available for an expansion of agricultural area. The analysis of agricultural
    encroachment into protected areas and their surroundings highlights the increased
    human pressure on these areas and the challenges of environmental protection for
    the future. Keywords: Africa; agriculture; Burkina Faso; data fusion; ESTARFM

    considerable changes. Since the year 2000, the population grew by about 56% from
    11.6 million to 18.1 million people in 2015 [1]. Burkina Faso still ranks among
    the least developed countries in the world (Human Development Index, HDR = 0.402,
    rank 183 of 188 countries, [2]), even though the gross domestic product (GDP)
    exhibited a sustained growth during recent years with a plus of 6.7% in 2013 [3,4].
    Since the economy is relatively undiversified and relies heavily on rainfed agricultural
    production, the country is highly vulnerable to climatic and economic shocks such
    as droughts, international market price fluctuations or political instability
    [4,5]. Thus, poverty, especially in rural areas, still prevails, and with a rapidly
    growing population also the number of undernourished people increased in recent
    years [4]. Despite the fact that the country is said to have a high agricultural
    potential [6,7] and more than 90% of the country’s labor force is working in the
    agricultural sector, the crop productivity per hectare did not rise considerably
    during the last 50 years [1]. Thus in order to improve the situation in Burkina
    Faso, amongst others agricultural systems food security must be further developed.
    Agriculture in Burkina Faso is characterized by small-scale rainfed subsistence
    farming with average farm sizes of less than 5 ha [8]. The lack of own capital
    and access to credits results in extensive farming as characterized by a low level
    of agricultural inputs, mechanization, fertilizer application, as well as irrigation
    [4,5]. With a rapidly increasing population and little improvement in agricultural
    productivity, farmers compensate by expanding cultivated area. As a consequence,
    it is estimated that the country will reach its limits of arable land by the year
    2030 [5]. Furthermore, this expansion also threatens natural resources, and the
    pressure on the last remnants of natural vegetation is increasing [9]. In order
    to capture the whole anthropogenic need of space for agricultural production,
    (rainfed) agricultural area is defined here as farmed land with partial tree cover
    (<10%, potentially fruit trees) including the prevailing crop-fallow rotation
    system of annual crops and intensive pasture, i.e., shrub-free, partially fenced
    areas frequently used for grazing. Even though accurate spatial documentation
    of the past and current extent of agricultural areas is essential information
    for decision makers, such information is currently missing. For Burkina Faso,
    statistical data on cropped area exist which are derived from household surveys
    conducted by the National Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Fishery Resources
    but these are of varying quality and only available at province level [10]. Agricultural
    extent can be deduced from global land cover maps such as the 500 m MODIS (Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) product MCD12Q1 [11], the 300 m ESA CCI
    (European Space Agency, Climate Change Initiative) land cover product [12] or
    the Chinese 30 m products FROM-GLC (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring
    of Global Land Cover) and GLOBELAND30 [13,14]. However, the usability of this
    data is often limited for detailed regional scale applications due to low spatial
    resolution, missing thematic complexity, temporal availability or regional accuracy
    [15,16,17]. Regionally optimized land cover information for West Africa based
    on moderate resolution (250 m) remote sensing data [15] give a good overview of
    the distribution of agriculture in Burkina Faso. Nonetheless, they face difficulties
    in the discrimination of small-scale agriculture from natural vegetation classes
    and are so far not available for recent years. Lambert et al. [18] derived croplands
    from 100 m PROBA-V data for the Sudanian and Sahelian region of West Africa for
    the year 2014. This interesting approach however is also struggling with some
    spatial resolution based errors in heterogeneous areas. Furthermore, high to medium
    resolution (5–30 m) remote sensing based land cover maps exist which are regionally
    optimized but they only cover small parts of the country [9,19,20,21]. In general,
    remote sensing is a highly suitable tool for large scale and cost efficient mapping
    of agricultural area. However, remote sensing based monitoring of the spatio-temporal
    development of agriculture in Burkina Faso and Africa in general is a challenging
    task. The above described small-scale extensive farming systems require high temporal
    and spatial resolution data for an accurate delineation. Landsat data may have
    a sufficient spatial resolution (30 m) to capture single fields but due to frequent
    cloud cover [22] and limited data availability for West Africa during the past
    decades (Landsat-5 and Landsat-7), gap-free coverage of the country is mainly
    limited to the dry season when the agricultural area is difficult to delineate
    from other natural land cover types. Because of its high temporal resolution and
    its globally uniform acquisition scheme, the MODIS sensors deliver data more continuously
    but the spatial resolution of 250 m or less is not satisfactory to delimit small-scale
    agricultural areas [23]. Thus, in this study, a data fusion approach was chosen
    to combine the strengths of the two sensor systems (MODIS and Landsat) and to
    generate a high temporal (8-day) and high spatial (30 m) resolution time series
    for a better delineation of agricultural area in Burkina Faso. For this purpose,
    the ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model)
    framework for large- and cloud-prone area processing was employed [24,25]. The
    goals of this study are to derive high spatial (30 m) resolution information of
    agricultural area for entire Burkina Faso for the years 2001, 2007, and 2014.
    Based on these maps, the spatio-temporal development of the major food-producing
    land use types (rainfed agricultural area, irrigated agricultural area and plantations)
    is identified. Furthermore, the connection between agricultural expansion and
    population growth and the regional differences within Burkina Faso are outlined.
    Finally, the influence of agricultural expansion on natural reserves with different
    protection status is examined with a buffer analysis for selected protected areas
    and their surroundings. 2. Study Area Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in
    the center of West Africa with a size of approx. 274,000 km² (Figure 1). The climate
    is characterized by a North-South moisture gradient and mainly influenced by the
    interaction between the West African Monsoon bringing rainfalls from the Southwest
    during the rainy season and the Harmattan blowing hot winds from the North during
    the dry season. The annual rainfall ranges from less than 300 mm in the North
    to more than 1100 mm in the South with distinct rainy and dry seasons. The rainy
    season occurs between May and October for four to five months with shorter duration
    in the North [26,27]. The mean monthly temperatures range between 23 °C and 34
    °C in the North and 25–31 °C in the South [28]. Figure 1. Study area of Burkina
    Faso showing the position of the used Landsat and MODIS tiles. The northern part
    of Burkina Faso is located in the Sahel zone or Sahelian Acacia Savanna. The natural
    vegetation of this area predominantly consists of wooded grassland and deciduous
    shrubland with a sparse tree layer [29]. The southern part of the country is located
    in the West Sudanian savanna; its natural vegetation is characterized by a more
    dense deciduous shrubland and woodland and is known for its high agricultural
    potential [7,30,31]. The major staple crops in Burkina Faso are maize, millet
    and sorghum while cotton is the most important agricultural export commodity [1,4].
    Some irrigated areas of minor extent can be found mainly in the direct vicinity
    of dammed lakes. In the southwest of Burkina Faso, especially around the city
    of Banfora, plantations of fruit trees such as mango and citrus fruits as well
    as nut trees (e.g., cashew and shea nuts) are located [32,33]. In recent years,
    these plantation products experienced a considerable rise in production and export
    value (compare Section 4.1.1) [34]. The overall number of inhabitants in Burkina
    Faso has increased significantly during recent years, from about 12 million in
    2001 to more than 17 million people in 2014 [1]. The rural population, which predominantly
    works in the agricultural sector, is concentrated in the central provinces around
    the capital of Ouagadougou (Figure 2). Since 2001, the rural population increased
    in most parts of the country, even in the remote, northern provinces bordering
    the Sahara [35]. Figure 2. Development of rural population density in the provinces
    of Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014 [35]. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Landsat
    Data and Preprocessing A total number of 504 surface reflectance scenes from Landsat
    sensors 5, 7, and 8 were obtained for a total of 17 tiles (Figure 1) from the
    USGS Landsat Archive [36]. The data covers the periods December 2000–January 2002
    (Landsat-7), December 2006–October 2007 (Landsat-5) and December 2013–January
    2015 (Landsat-8). For the year 2007, no Landsat-5 data were available after October
    and generally no images were available in 2007 for the two southwestern tiles
    (path/row: 193/52, 192/52). The surface reflectance datasets are atmospherically
    corrected with the L8SR algorithm [37] and include cloud and cloud shadow masks
    derived with the CFmask algorithm [37,38]. These masks were applied to the red
    and near infrared (NIR) bands of the scenes and from these, the NDVI was calculated.
    3.2. MODIS Data and Preprocessing Daily 500 m MODIS nadir bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) adjusted reflectance datasets (MCD43A4, Col. 6) were
    obtained for the tiles h17v07, h17v08, and h18v07 (Figure 1), and for the same
    periods as the Landsat data. MCD43A4 is a 16-day rolling composite product with
    the center date of this period associated to the daily dataset [39]. On the basis
    of the data in this compositing period, the best possible BRDF is derived for
    the correction of the reflectances [24,39]. From the red and NIR bands of the
    MODIS datasets, daily NDVI was calculated and further processed with the software
    TIMESAT [40]. First, outliers that deviate more than 0.2 times from the standard
    deviation in a moving window (width = 104 days) were removed from the time series
    [40]. For the interpolation of the resulting gaps and in order to reduce residual
    noise, the adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter [41] implemented in TIMESAT was then
    applied to the time series. For this purpose, a filter window size of 30 days
    and an adaptation strength of 2 were selected. The values of the filter as well
    as the factor of 0.2 for outlier removal were determined based on a visual analysis
    of their effects in the TIMESAT graphical user interface [40]. Detailed information
    on the time series filtering can be found in [40]. After filtering, the MODIS
    datasets were reprojected to UTM zone 30°N, automatically co-registered and resampled
    to Landsat 30 m spatial resolution with nearest neighbor method (Figure 3). Figure

    of maps of agricultural area for entire Burkina Faso. 3.3. Reference Data Collection
    In order to generate an accurate remote sensing based land cover and land use
    (LULC) classification a high quality reference database for training and validation
    of the classifier is required. However, such a database is not readily available
    for entire Burkina Faso. From several field trips within the scope of the WASCAL
    (West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use) [42]
    project during recent years, a range of LULC ground sampling points are available.
    Nonetheless, these do not cover the whole country and are not available for all
    focus years. However, the field data and the gathered field trip knowledge were
    used for the interpretation of very high resolution (VHR) imagery as provided
    by Google Earth. In this way, a comprehensive reference dataset for training and
    validation was generated. Such an approach was conducted previously by various
    authors for large-scale remote sensing based studies [15,43,44]. Samples were
    selected for eight general thematic LULC classes with a focus on agriculture.
    These classes were defined based on existing regional LULC descriptions [45] and
    expert knowledge of the region (Table 1). A Simple Random Sampling set [46,47]
    of 700 locations was generated in order to ensure an unbiased distribution of
    reference points across the study area. As suggested by Congalton and Green [47],
    at least 100 samples were collected for phenologically heterogeneous classes (e.g.,
    rainfed agricultural area) and a minimum of 50 samples were assembled for temporally
    stable classes (e.g., water). In Google Earth, the closest spatially homogeneous
    area (of at least nine Landsat pixels) to the respective random point was delineated
    by a polygon and the class was identified for each of the three focus years (2001,
    2007, 2014) with available Google Earth data for interpretation. Even though an
    unbiased distribution of ground truth data is important for an accurate classification,
    the Simple Random Sampling results in a low number of samples for less frequent
    LULC classes. Thus, additional reference data was collected for these classes
    to fulfill the above-mentioned minimum number of samples by directly targeting
    known areas of the respective class. The final reference dataset for training
    and validation contained 771, 836, and 1147 polygons for the years 2001, 2007,
    and 2014, respectively. Table 1. Classification scheme. 3.4. Generation of High
    Spatial and Temporal Resolution Time Series and Classification Features The ESTARFM
    framework was designed by Knauer et al. [24] as a further development to ESTARFM
    [25] in order to generate high temporal and spatial resolution time series in
    an automated and time-efficient way for large-scale, cloud-prone and heterogeneous
    areas. For this purpose, a filling of cloud-gaps prior to the time series generation
    was included to make best use of partly cloud-covered Landsat input images. Further
    enhancements of the original ESTARFM method focus on the user-friendly, consistent,
    and accurate application of the algorithm for large areas. In this study, the
    ESTARFM framework was applied to generate 30 m, 8-day NDVI time series from the
    MODIS and Landsat input data for the years 2001, 2007, and 2014 for entire Burkina
    Faso based on the procedure generally described in Knauer et al. [24]. On the
    basis of these time series, a number of temporal features such as land surface
    phenology (LSP) metrics of the different LULC types of Burkina Faso can be delineated
    (compare Figure 3). This is valuable information for the discrimination of classes
    which are spectrally similar but show a different phenological development, e.g.,
    agricultural area, grassland, and savanna. As previous studies in the same latitudes
    of West Africa have shown, the differentiation of such classes is highly challenging
    when using only mono-temporal remote sensing data [18,19,48]. In total, 57 features
    were generated for the classification of 2001 and 2014 (Table 2). For the classification
    of the year 2007, only 41 features were used since not the whole annual time series
    could be generated due to a lack of Landsat input data towards the end of the
    year. The NDVI of all available 8-day time steps was used as classification features
    (45 layers for 2001 and 2014 and 33 layers for 2007). In addition, eight phenological
    metrics for 2001 and 2014 (four for the year 2007) were derived with the TIMESAT
    software [40]. Furthermore, the mean NDVI, the maximum NDVI as well as a seasonal
    sum of NDVI (DOY 119-263) were calculated for each of the three annual time series.
    An additional 1 km WorldClim precipitation dataset [28] of annual long-term average
    rainfalls (1960–1990) was resampled to 30 m and included as input for the classification.
    The precipitation dataset represents the North-South moisture gradient of Burkina
    Faso and the changing phenology of different LULC types along this gradient which
    has been demonstrated in previous studies [23,48,49,50]. Table 2. Features used
    for the classification. The top eight features were generated with TIMESAT [40].
    Features marked with an * could not be generated from the Landsat data available
    for 2007. 3.5. Classification Approach and Accuracy Assessment In this study,
    the random forest classification approach (RF) was applied for the delineation
    of LULC classes from the fused earth observation time series [51]. The classifier
    has been frequently used during the recent decade due to its strong and quick
    performance, its robustness to noise and overfitting, as well as its user-friendliness,
    since it does not require extensive tuning of its parameters [15,43,51]. The RF
    classifications in this study were conducted using the randomForest package implemented
    in the programming language R [52] and based on Breiman’s random forest algorithm
    [51]. The final RF models, which were built independently for the three years,
    were based on a sufficiently high number of 500 decision trees and a default mtry
    value of 12, which is the number of randomly sampled variables at each split of
    a decision tree. The reference database was split randomly into sets of 70% and
    30% of the sample polygons as commonly recommended [43,53]. The 70% reference
    set was used for the training of the classifier and the 30% reference set was
    applied for the validation of its performance. The accuracy of the classifications
    was analyzed on the basis of confusion matrices, which highlight the separate
    user’s and producer’s accuracies for each class as well as the overall accuracy
    and indicate which classes are over- or underrepresented in the result [47]. In
    order to increase the accuracy of the classification as well as to sharpen the
    focus on agricultural areas several post-classification rules were applied. First,
    the classes Woody Vegetation, Grassland, Temporarily Flooded, and Forest were
    merged into one Savanna class, since they are not in the focus of this study but
    were classified separately due to their different spectral characteristics. Furthermore,
    areas with an annual mean NDVI of less than 0.2 were excluded from the Irrigated
    Agricultural Area class. The extent of lentic waterbodies varies significantly
    with the seasons in Burkina Faso. Since some of these temporarily flooded shore
    areas were misclassified as Irrigated Agricultural Area, but are clearly not cultivated
    (due to low NDVI and confirmed by visual inspection), they were reclassified as
    Temporarily Flooded. In addition, Rainfed Agricultural Area was overestimated
    in protected areas where frequent fires during the dry season seriously influence
    the phenology of vegetation and lead to misclassifications. In order to overcome
    this, the MODIS burned area product MCD45A1 [54] was applied for such regions
    to identify affected areas and reclassify them as Woody Vegetation. 3.6. Analyzing
    Connections to Population and Natural Reserves The relationship between agricultural
    expansion and rural population growth was investigated by highlighting the changes
    of the two variables on a provincial level. Furthermore, per province agricultural
    area and rural population were correlated for the years 2001, 2014 and the respective
    change between those years and the dependency was assessed with the Pearson product-moment
    correlation coefficient [55]. In addition, the change in agricultural area per
    rural person between 2001 and 2014 was determined to examine the development of
    available farmland for self-subsistence. In order to analyze the influence of
    agricultural expansion on natural reserves, two focus areas were selected and
    the development of agricultural area in their vicinity was monitored over the
    three years. This was done by a buffer analysis measuring the density of agriculture
    in the reserve itself and in five 2 km distance zones (0–2 km, 2–4 km, 4–6 km,
    6–8 km, 8–10 km) surrounding the reserve. 3.7. Ancillary Data Several supplementary
    datasets were used for the analyses in this study. The shapefile of protected
    areas (Figure 1) was acquired from the Institut Géographique du Burkina Faso (IGB)
    [56]. It contains natural reserves of different protection categories and represents
    the status of the year 2005. Furthermore, the rural population numbers of the
    provinces (Figure 2) were derived from census data obtained from the Institut
    National de la Statistique et de la Démographie (INSD) [35]. In addition, information
    about national harvested area of primary crops and estimations of agricultural
    area for the years 2001 and 2013 were downloaded from FAOSTAT [1]. For the direct
    comparison with the classification results of 2014, agricultural statistics are
    so far unavailable in the FAO database. 4. Results The results are presented in
    three major sections: first, the novel Burkina Faso wide high resolution agricultural
    classifications are shown and regional differences and developments of agricultural
    patterns are highlighted giving examples of plantations, as well as rainfed and
    irrigated agricultural area. Then, the implications of agricultural expansion
    for protected areas are exemplarily analyzed and outlined based on two focus regions.
    Lastly, the link between agricultural area expansion and rural population increase
    is highlighted. In the following sections, the agricultural classification of
    2007 is only used and presented for focus regions since it does not cover the
    whole country due to a lack of Landsat input data as described in Section 3.1.
    4.1. Agricultural Area in Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014 The extent of agricultural
    area at a 30 m spatial resolution for the years 2001 and 2014 can be seen in Figure
    4. In 2001, rainfed agricultural area covers about 60,441 km² which corresponds
    to 22% of Burkina Faso’s land surface (Table 3). It is mainly accumulated in the
    central area around the capital Ouagadougou and in the regions southeast of it.
    The more remote areas such as the northern Sahel region, the East bordering Nigeria
    and Niger as well as the moist southwestern regions were for the major part not
    cultivated in 2001. With an approximate extent of 561 km² in 2001, almost all
    of the plantations are established in these southwestern regions where the climate
    is more humid and the rainfalls are highest. In terms of size, the irrigated areas
    only play a minor role (about 78 km²) and are mainly located around the water
    reservoirs in the same regions as the rainfed agricultural areas. Figure 4. Extent
    of agricultural area of Burkina Faso for the years 2001 (top) and 2014 (bottom).
    Framed areas mark the locations of the focus sites of Section 4.4, the Tiogo classified
    forest (A) and the Kaboré Tambi National Park (B). Table 3. Agricultural area
    in km² and percentage change for the years 2001 and 2014. Between 2001 and 2014,
    the rainfed agricultural area increased by about 90% to 114,994 km² and now covers
    about 42% of the country area. While the already densely cultivated central region
    of Burkina Faso only marginally expanded its rainfed agricultural area, it spread
    into all parts of the country, also into the above mentioned remote areas. The
    plantation area in 2014 almost tripled to 1568 km² and two main regions are clearly
    visible: one is located in the northwest of the city of Banfora, mostly in the
    provinces Kénédougou and Léraba, and one is situated in the southeast of Banfora,
    in the provinces Comoé and Poni. With an increasing number of water reservoirs,
    also the irrigated area expanded significantly by about 340% although the total
    number of 345 km² is still low in comparison to the other forms of agriculture.
    The overall accuracies for the three classified years are 92% for 2001, 91% for
    2007, and 91% for 2014, and can be investigated in Table 4 including class-specific
    user’s and producer’s accuracies. While rainfed agricultural area displays user’s
    and producer’s accuracies of more than 80% for all three years, irrigated agriculture
    shows some underestimation and thus lower producer’s accuracies for the years
    2007 and 2014 due to some confusion with temporarily flooded vegetation. For plantation
    areas, the user’s and producer’s accuracies range between 77% and 97%. Some overestimations
    occur along rivers confusing plantation with gallery forests. Table 4. Confusion
    matrices indicating overall accuracies as well as user’s (UA) and producer’s accuracies
    (PA) for each agricultural class in percent for the years 2001 (top), 2007 (middle),
    and 2014 (bottom). 4.1.1. Development of Plantation Area Between 2001 and 2014,
    a significant increase in plantation area of 179% from approximately 56,000 ha
    to 157,000 ha can be observed (compare Table 3). The six southwestern provinces
    of Comoé, Kénédougou, Léraba, Poni, Houet, and Noumbiel (Figure 5 left) make up
    99% of Burkina Faso’s plantation area. The Comoé province alone contains about
    71,000 ha of plantation in 2014, which corresponds to 46% of the total plantation
    area of Burkina Faso. Figure 5 right reflects this development in detail, exemplarily
    for a focus site in the Kénédougou province, one of the major plantation regions
    of Burkina Faso. While the plantations in 2001 (light green) are rather small,
    scattered, and have undefined outlines, they increased considerably in size and
    numbers towards 2014 (dark green). Also the shapes of the plantations are much
    more distinct in 2014. Figure 5. Major plantation provinces and their plantation
    coverage for 2001 and 2014 (left) and development of a plantation area in the
    province of Kénédougou between 2001 and 2014 (right); position marked by red rectangle
    in the left figure. 4.1.2. Development of Irrigation Area Efficient irrigated
    agriculture could be a key to improving food security in Burkina Faso and mitigating
    the negative effects of the varying timing and length of the rainy season for
    cultivation [57]. The country has an estimated potential of about 233,500 ha irrigable
    land but as highlighted above only a small fraction of this area is currently
    under irrigation (34,500 ha in 2014) [57,58,59]. The main areas of irrigation
    lie in the central, northern, and westernmost provinces of Burkina Faso (Figure
    6). Especially in the central and northern regions of Burkina Faso, the irrigation
    areas are mainly located around natural lakes or small water reservoirs established
    through the damming of rivers. Although, the smaller reservoirs are often used
    for household water supply and livestock than for irrigation, the distribution
    of reservoirs derived from the classification results partially reflects the provinces
    with higher irrigation area. Figure 6. Irrigated area per province for the year
    2014 and locations of artificial water reservoirs for the years 2001 and 2014
    derived by digitization from the classification results; the white rectangle marks
    the location of Figure 7. Figure 7. Development of an irrigation area at the Bagré
    dam in southern Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014; Location of focus area within
    Burkina Faso is marked in Figure 6. However, the highest values of irrigation
    area per province can be attributed to respective single major irrigation systems
    (confirmed by visual inspection). These areas receive their water supply directly
    from the major rivers of Burkina Faso and their tributary streams and not from
    reservoirs. One exception is the irrigation area at the Lake Bagré (Figure 7 and
    white rectangle in Figure 6), which developed with the construction of a hydropower
    dam retaining the water of the White Volta river in 1994. In 2001, the area under
    irrigation at the Lake Bagré covered approximately 9.26 km². In 2007 and 2014,
    it increased to 21.67 km² and to 37.28 km² respectively which equals an expansion
    of about 300% over the 14 years. Today, Lake Bagré is one of the biggest connected
    irrigation systems in Burkina Faso. 4.2. Feature Importance The respective importance
    of input features for the discrimination of different classes in the study area
    is shown in Figure 8. Precipitation is the most important feature representing
    the North-South moisture gradient of Burkina Faso and the general occurrence of
    classes along this gradient. In general, wetlands and forests are more frequent
    in Burkina Faso’s southern regions. The Start of Season (SOS) shows early dates
    for the irrigated agricultural areas which are more independent of the onset of
    rainfalls, while rainfed agricultural areas generally show later SOS than the
    natural vegetation classes. This can be explained by the reaction of natural vegetation
    to the first rainfalls while rainfed agricultural areas are commonly sown later.
    The NDVI of DOY 271 (end of September) represents the peak of rainy season, similar
    to the Middle of Season (MOS) feature. For dense vegetation classes such as forests
    and plantation, the NDVI of DOY 271 is generally higher and the MOS tends to be
    later. Figure 8. Mean feature importance of the 20 most important features for
    the years 2001–2014 scaled between 0 and 100. 4.3. Relationship between Agricultural
    Expansion and Population Growth The total population of Burkina Faso grew rapidly
    during the period of investigation from approx. 12 million in 2001 to more than
    17 million people in 2014 [1]. As outlined in Section 2, also the rural population
    increased in almost all provinces during that time. Especially the more remote
    provinces like Tapoa (TAP), Comoé (COM) or Houet (HOU) increased in rural population
    by up to 244,000 people (Figure 9 left) [35]. The central provinces with an already
    high population density in 2001 as well as the central southern provinces only
    increased moderately in population numbers. The only province with a negative
    rural population development is the province of Zondoma (ZON) decreasing by about
    58,000 rural inhabitants. Figure 9. Change of rural population in the provinces
    of Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014 (left) [35] and expansion of agricultural
    area in the provinces derived from the classification results (right); the province
    names are abbreviated by three letters. Similar patterns as for the rural population
    growth can be observed for the expansion of agricultural area in the provinces
    between 2001 and 2014 (Figure 9 right). Agriculture spread into all remote and
    so far rather uncultivated regions of Burkina Faso. The above mentioned provinces
    Tapoa (TAP) and Comoé (COM) are among the provinces with the biggest agricultural
    expansion with an increase of about 323,000 ha and 315,000 ha, respectively. However,
    the highest numbers of expansion are observed for the two Northern provinces Kossi
    (KOS) with a plus of 392,000 ha and Soum (SOM) with an increase of 386,000 ha
    between 2001 and 2014. Similar to the changes in population growth, the central
    provinces show only moderate levels of agricultural expansion between 600 ha for
    the Koulpélogo province (KOP) and 60,000 ha for the Bazèga province (BAZ). In
    a quantitative comparison of agricultural area and rural population in the provinces,
    a direct relationship becomes evident. For 2001, the numbers of rural inhabitants
    correlate with the extent of agricultural areas (r = 0.84) with highest numbers
    primarily for the larger central provinces like Sanmatenga (SMT), Boulgou (BLG),
    and Yatenga (YAT) (Figure 10a). For 2014, the numbers for the two variables generally
    increase in the provinces but the relationship between them stays the same (r
    = 0.84) (Figure 10b). While the leading provinces of 2001 are still among the
    highest in 2014, the above mentioned remote provinces of Comoé (COM), Soum (SOM),
    and especially a group of provinces from the region Est, Tapoa (TAP), Gourma (GOU),
    and Gnagna (GNA), joined the provinces with highest population numbers and biggest
    agricultural area. Though there are various reasons and pathways for different
    developments of the two variables, it is obvious that agricultural expansion and
    rural population growth go in line for multiple provinces (Figure 10c). Besides
    some single provinces, the more remote regions of Est, Sahel and Boucle de Mouhoun
    exhibit the highest changes in both variables. The central and generally smaller
    provinces of the regions Centre-Est, Centre-Sud, and Plateau Central only increased
    in rural population numbers without considerable agricultural expansion. Figure
    10. Scatterplots of agricultural area versus rural population in the provinces
    for the years 2001 (a) and 2014 (b) and the changes between the two years (c);
    the coloring of the points refers to the regions of Burkina Faso (d). The average
    agricultural area per rural inhabitant rose from 0.63 ha to 0.88 ha (Figure 11).
    Especially in the more remote provinces like Oudalan (OUD), Soum (SOM) or Kossi
    (KOS) the agricultural area grew considerably while there was only a moderate
    population growth resulting in increases of up to 1.24 ha/person. While most provinces
    registered a plus in agricultural area per person, some provinces in the central
    and southwest of Burkina Faso almost did not change or decreased. Especially the
    provinces Zoundwéogo (ZOU), Kouritenga (KOT), and Koulpélogo (KOP) lost up to
    0.66 ha per person. These are also the provinces with the smallest agricultural
    expansion while still increasing their rural population numbers by up to 240,000
    people (ZOU) over the considered 14 years. Figure 11. Change of agricultural area
    (in ha) per person (rural) in the provinces of Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014;
    the province names are abbreviated by three letters. 4.4. Implications for Natural
    Reserves In this section, an in-depth study of two protected areas (compare Figure
    4) was conducted showing the development of agricultural area in their vicinity.
    The first one is the Kaboré Tambi National Park, which was founded in 1976 and
    directly adjacent in the Northwest, the classified forest Nazinon which lie about
    60 km south of Ouagadougou (Figure 1 and Figure 12). In 2001, the agricultural
    area inside the boundaries of the two protected areas was very low (3%) and was
    almost exclusively found in the Nazinon forest. Also the direct surroundings of
    the Kaboré Tambi are only marginally cultivated because of an apparent buffer
    zone around parts of the park borders. Figure 12. Maps of agricultural area in
    the Kaboré Tambi National Park and its surroundings for 2001, 2007, and 2014 (top)
    and plot of the development of agricultural area in the protected area and in
    2 km distance zones around it between 2001 and 2014 (bottom); Location of focus
    area within Burkina Faso is marked in Figure 4. Between 2001 and 2007, the agriculture
    in these protected areas did not change but it increased in all distance zones
    with a maximum of 43% within the 8–10 km zone. In 2014, the cultivated area in
    this zone increased by another 8% and values of dense agriculture are drawing
    closer to the park, but the protected area remains unaffected. This indicates
    a functioning protection of the park despite the concentration of agricultural
    area in its vicinity. However, this concentration also increases the isolation
    of the park and hinders animal movement to other habitat areas with a decreasing
    number of natural patches (stepstones) in between. The second example, the classified
    forest of Tiogo is located about 130 km west of Ouagadougou and is a formally
    protected area adjacent to other areas with the same status (Figure 1 and Figure
    13). However, Tiogo does not underlie an exclusive park management as the Kaboré
    Tambi National Park [60]. Figure 13. Maps of agricultural area in the classified
    forest Tiogo and its surroundings for 2001, 2007, and 2014 (top) and plot of the
    development of agricultural area in the protected area and in 2 km distance zones
    around it between 2001 and 2014 (bottom); Location of focus area within Burkina
    Faso is marked in Figure 4. In 2001, some croplands were detected in the northeastern
    part of Tiogo but so far they only cover 3% of the total area. The agricultural
    area in the surroundings of the park is moderately dense and reaches up to 36%
    in the 4–6 km distance zone. In 2007, the fields in the Northeast of Tiogo advance
    towards the center of the protected area and increased significantly to 13% of
    the total forest area. Also the surrounding agriculture increases in all distance
    zones with a maximum of 51% in the 8–10 km zone. Finally in 2014, the agriculture
    in the northeastern part of Tiogo intensifies (18% of total area) and dense agricultural
    area covering more than 50% starts right at the border of the Tiogo classified
    forest increasing the pressure on the remaining protected area. 5. Discussion
    5.1. Classification of Agricultural Area Based on Dense Time Series In this study,
    a novel approach was applied for the derivation of countrywide agricultural classifications
    with a high spatial resolution (30 m) for entire Burkina Faso and three years.
    On the basis of the ESTARFM framework, an 8-day time series was generated and
    in combination with subsequently derived phenological metrics it was used to delineate
    different agricultural use types from savanna vegetation in Burkina Faso. The
    overall classification accuracies of 92% (2001), 91% (2007), and 91% (2014) show
    the suitability of this approach. The possibility to use a dense time series instead
    of single scenes with at the same time high spatial resolution is an important
    feature of this method. The frequent cloud coverage in West Africa decreases the
    data availability of common satellite sensors significantly [22] and often limits
    gap-free coverage of the country to the dry season when agricultural area is difficult
    to delineate. Furthermore, the small-scale extensive farming systems in Burkina
    Faso require a sufficiently high spatial resolution for the delineation of single
    fields. Thus, the sole use of high temporal (≤8 days) but lower spatial resolution
    time series (≥250 m, e.g., of MODIS or the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer,
    AVHRR) leads to high amounts of mixed pixels. To deal with this issue, alternative
    approaches such as fractional cover of agricultural area would have to be applied
    [19]. To our knowledge, there are so far no other products in this high spatial
    resolution and thematic complexity focusing on the accurate delineation of agricultural
    area in entire Burkina Faso for several years. For 2014, Lambert et al. [18] derived
    croplands from 100 m PROBA-V data for the Sudanian and Sahelian region of West
    Africa. The use of time series contributed to a suitable classification result
    but spatial resolution based errors still occurred in heterogeneous areas. Different
    global land cover maps like the MODIS MCD12Q1 [11] or GLOBELAND30 [13] also include
    agricultural area, but their usability for detailed regional scale applications
    is often limited due to spatial or temporal resolution as well as thematic complexity
    [15,16,17]. In our study, one limiting issue in the derivation of a multi-year
    countrywide agricultural classification was the data availability from the earlier
    Landsat generations 5 and 7. Though, the ESTARFM framework includes an automated
    filling of cloud gaps and can thus make use of also partially cloud covered scenes,
    for some tiles and years there was no or not enough data available. Especially
    for the year 2007, no Landsat-7 data were available for the southeast of the country
    and for several other areas the cloud coverage over the whole year was at exceptionally
    high levels. Thus, the classification of this year could only be used for local
    analyses. However, the classification of 2014 has shown that limited data availability
    should not be an issue for future applications of the developed methodology since
    the Landsat-8 sensor delivers sufficient amounts of input data. In addition, data
    from the Sentinel-2 satellites [61] will be an option enhancing future data availability
    for the presented methodology. For a repeated application of the developed methodology
    for monitoring purposes, the automation of the classification procedure and the
    automated generation or update of the reference dataset would be desirable. Such
    an operational framework could significantly improve the overall processing time
    from data download to the final maps. However, this is beyond the scope of this
    study which aimed at the development of the general classification approach and
    the delineation of agricultural area for certain years. A further challenge of
    the applied approach was the reference data collection. A reference dataset of
    land use for multiple years covering entire Burkina Faso is so far not available
    and thus, this information was collected from high resolution Google Earth images.
    Since in Google Earth there are often no multi temporal datasets available for
    a single year of interest, it can be difficult to visually distinguish active
    cropland from crop-fallow rotation systems or even recently abandoned land. The
    aim of this study was to delineate total agricultural area comprising fallow and
    intensive pasture and not strictly limit the classification to harvested crop
    area. The inclusion of these types of agricultural area provides a valuable picture
    on the overall need and expansion of land for agricultural production in Burkina
    Faso. However, the derived dense ESTARFM time series have the potential to also
    distinguish harvested crop area, if a suitable reference dataset would be available.
    A comparison of classification results to official statistics of agricultural
    area is difficult since they are either so called ‘manual estimations’ or focus
    on only harvested area [1]. For the year 2001, the FAO estimates that 105,700
    km² were used as agricultural area in Burkina Faso and 123,000 km² in 2013 while
    numbers for 2014 are currently unavailable [1]. However, in these values a constant
    number of 60,000 km² for ‘permanent meadows and pastures’ is included. Such a
    stable expanse of rangelands seems rather unrealistic since several processes
    like the conversion to cropland or the exploitation of new areas should alter
    this extent. According to the FAO, an area of 49,600 km² of primary crops was
    harvested in Burkina Faso in 2001 and 70,200 km² in 2013 with missing numbers
    for 2014 [1]. These values indicate the strong increase of agriculturally used
    area during the past years, which is also visible in the classification results
    of this study. 5.2. Land Cover Changes in the Context of Socio-Economic Development
    While the rapid population growth in Burkina Faso seems to be the main driver
    for the expansion of rainfed agricultural area, the development of plantations
    and irrigation systems requires investments which are not feasible for the majority
    of Burkinabe. The considerable growth of plantation area and the formation of
    distinct plantation shapes (compare Section 4.1.1) indicate a substantial driving
    force of development and a professionalization of tree crop agriculture in the
    region. And indeed, this progress goes in line with the establishment of a predominantly
    Fairtrade business of cashew nuts and mangos in Burkina Faso during the past years.
    Since the beginning of the 21st century, several external organizations started
    to invest in and promote the development of plantations of cashew nuts and mangos.
    Amongst others, the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) initiated
    the African Cashew initiative (ACi) [32] optimizing the whole value chain of cashew
    production and distribution for several West African countries including Burkina
    Faso. Also in the mango production, professionalization was advanced by international
    projects as well as the implementation of local companies such as Fruiteq [33,62,63].
    These promoted the establishment of farmer co-operatives, the training in mango
    cultivation, as well as the transport and Fairtrade marketing in Europe. Though
    there are other tree crops in Burkina Faso, e.g., citrus fruits or other nuts,
    these are obviously not responsible for the significant growth of plantation area
    since their numbers rather stagnate or decrease over the period of investigation
    [1]. In contrast, the success of these international projects can be seen in the
    rise of trade values and amount of exported cashew nuts and mangos, a development
    which is well reflected in the observed expansion of plantation area (Figure 14).
    Figure 14. Amount (left) and trade value (right) of exported cashews and mangos
    from Burkina Faso as well as the total observed plantation area for the years
    2001, 2007, and 2014; error bars describe the possible range of plantation area
    due to data gaps in the classifications [34]. While in 2001, the amount of exported
    cashews and mangos from Burkina Faso was at 224 and 580 tons, respectively, it
    rose rapidly to 74,303 and 7256 tons in 2014 [34]. Also the trade value of Burkinabe
    cashews and mangos increased considerably from 0.73 to 42.85 million US$ for cashews
    and from 0.56 million to 8.54 million US$ for mangos [34]. While the development
    of the cashew sector is even more remarkable than that of mangos, it can be noted
    that there has been a price increase (US$ per ton) for mangos from Burkina Faso.
    This could be attributed to rising world market prices but also to the improved
    quality of Burkinabe mangos and their Fairtrade marketing. Besides the expansion
    of plantation area, also the increase in irrigated agricultural areas is remarkable
    (compare Section 4.1.2). In recent years, the government of Burkina Faso has been
    investing considerable amounts of money in the development of irrigation systems
    in the framework of their National Programme for the Rural Sector (PNSR) [64].
    In addition, several international organizations are promoting irrigated agriculture
    within local projects in Burkina Faso. One example is the above mentioned Bagré
    dam located about 140 km southeast of Ouagadougou (Figure 7). Within the Bagré
    Growth Pole Project, the World Bank, the Global Water Initiative (GWI) and others
    are developing irrigation infrastructure and are advising and promoting smallholder
    farming in the region [58,59,65]. The success of these efforts can be seen in
    an expansion of irrigated areas by about 300% to 37.28 km² in 2014. However, this
    value is still far below the estimated potential irrigable area for the region
    of 299 km² [58]. 5.3. Mapping of Agricultural Expansion for the Planning and Monitoring
    of Measures The results of this study show links between agricultural expansion
    and the rapidly growing population of Burkina Faso. While the population increased
    by about 40% in almost all provinces between 2001 and 2014, the agricultural area
    nearly doubled and spread into all remote and previously almost unused regions.
    Until now, there has been an overall increase in agricultural area per person
    in the rural regions of Burkina Faso (from 0.63 ha to 0.88 ha during the period
    of investigation). However, some provinces which were already intensively cultivated
    in 2001 show a decrease in agricultural area per person. By the year 2030, it
    is estimated that Burkina Faso could reach its limit of arable land [5] and the
    population is expected to grow from 17 million people in 2014 to more than 26
    million people in 2030 and even to about 41 million in 2050 [1]. Against this
    background, an overall positive trend in agricultural area per person cannot hold
    for a longer time. In addition, in the calculation of this factor, only the rural
    population was included since most of the smallholders cultivate for self-subsistence
    with only casual access to the market [4]. However, in order to improve food security
    and to avoid booming food prices during drought years, a self-sustaining agriculture
    would be desirable in Burkina Faso, meaning that also the increasing urban population
    would have to be taken into account in such a calculation. In this case, the agricultural
    area per person would be considerably lower. In combination with additional statistical
    data, the derived results could be valuable information for the analysis of regional
    migration and rural-urban development. As highlighted by the analyses of Section
    4.4, the pressure on protected areas has increased significantly in Burkina Faso
    during recent years. With population growth and agricultural expansion as the
    main drivers, some of the less guarded reserves have considerably decreased in
    size or even vanished completely. Because of an increase of agricultural area
    and rural settlements in the surroundings of the protected areas, the suitability
    of these areas as a habitat for a number of species is also decreasing. Maintaining
    a critical size and connectivity between natural habitats is important for many
    species to provide crucial habitat functions and to guarantee genetic exchange
    between populations and preserve biodiversity [66]. For the protection of the
    remaining natural reserves, the local communities have to be involved in order
    to prevent them from exploiting the forests for firewood or expansion of agricultural
    areas [60]. This is currently under development on the basis of funds from the
    Forest Investment Program (FIP) of the Climate Investment Funds financed by the
    World Bank [67]. Burkina Faso is one of eight pilot countries, given a 30 million
    US$ grant to reduce deforestation and promote sustainable forest management. The
    Tiogo classified forest, investigated in Section 4.4 is one of six focus reserves
    of this program within Burkina Faso. Since the agricultural expansion will have
    to come to an end in the near future, there is a serious need to increase the
    efficient and sustainable use of existing agricultural areas. However, since the
    1960s, the cereal productivity of Burkina Faso only rose very slowly from about
    0.4 tons per hectare and year to approximately 1.16 t/ha/year [1]. Other developing
    and thresholding countries like e.g., Brazil improved their cereal productivity
    in the same time from 1.34 t/ha/year to about 4.8 t/ha/year while the productivity
    in Western Europe is already at more than 7 t/ha/year. Several international projects
    like the examples given in Section 5.2. promote the development of sustainable
    and more efficient agricultural areas. However, most of them are focusing on geographically
    small areas rather than targeting the majority of rainfed agricultural regions.
    For this purpose, a countrywide approach is necessary. During the past decade,
    the government of Burkina Faso made a considerable effort to support and develop
    the agricultural sector. More than 10% of the national budget was allocated to
    agriculture [4]. In the framework of the Rural Development Strategy (SDR), staple
    crop production was supported by subsidies on fertilizer, by distributing improved
    seeds and by supporting the improvement of irrigation systems [4]. These efforts
    will especially advance an intensification of existing agricultural areas and
    improve agricultural productivity. By promoting local focus areas such as the
    above mentioned Bagré Growth Pole Project, the government wants to attract private
    investment and initiate positive effects on the rest of the economy [4]. However,
    most of the national investments still focus on the production of cotton which
    is the major agricultural export commodity in Burkina Faso. It has to be awaited
    to see if these efforts have a considerable impact on the broad agricultural community
    and on the improvement of food security and sustainability in the country. The
    continuous application of the developed methodology could play a crucial role
    in the monitoring of Burkina Faso’s efforts to develop a sustainable land management
    and to protect the remaining natural reserves. An annual or biennial mapping of
    Burkina Faso’s focus areas and the development of the countrywide agricultural
    area in combination with regional population numbers could detect discrepancies
    between planning and implementation and identify potential hotspots of undesirable
    processes. In addition, the developed methodology could also improve the agricultural
    monitoring efforts planned by ESA’s S2-Agri project [68]. This project explores
    methods to generate cropland maps from Sentinel-2 time series on a frequent basis
    applicable for various regions on the globe. However, recent tests showed difficulties
    for their focus site in Burkina Faso due to the small-scale extensive farming
    practices as well as the persistent cloud coverage in the region [69,70]. The
    presented approach for the generation of a gap-free high temporal and spatial
    resolution time series with the ESTARFM framework could contribute to overcoming
    these issues and increase the classification accuracies in such difficult regions.
    6. Conclusions In this study, the ESTARFM framework was applied for the generation
    of a high temporal (8-day) and high spatial (30 m) resolution time series for
    the country of Burkina Faso, with an area of approx. 274.000 km². The fused time
    series were further used as a basis for the delineation of agricultural area in
    a spatial resolution of 30 m for entire Burkina Faso and for three years—2001,
    2007, and 2014. To our knowledge, there is no other national product available
    at this spatial, temporal, and thematic resolution with an equal quality. Prior
    studies outline the challenges in the derivation of agricultural area from remote
    sensing data in West Africa [17,18,19,48]. The predominant small-scale rainfed
    subsistence farming and the low productivity of the fields complicates the separation
    of agricultural area from other land use and cover types. Despite these difficulties,
    the overall accuracies of 92% (2001), 91% (2007), and 91% (2014) of the presented
    results indicate the well-functioning of the method applied here. The possibility
    to use the whole phenological cycle of NDVI in a sufficiently high spatial resolution
    as input for the classification is a key factor for the delineation of agricultural
    area in the region. Furthermore, the presented results give insight into the development
    of plantations, the establishment of irrigation systems, and the protection of
    natural reserves in Burkina Faso. This information can be important for decision
    makers in order to understand and quantify if recently initiated measures for
    the development of agricultural systems have the intended effects. For this purpose,
    the mapping and monitoring with the developed method could also be continued for
    subsequent years. The results and analyses presented in this study highlight major
    challenges in terms of food production systems and food security Burkina Faso
    is facing and will face in the future. The massive expansion of agricultural area
    (from 61,100 km² in 2001 to 116,900 km² in 2014) is pushing towards the limit
    of available arable land and potentially more and more unsuitable regions will
    be used for cultivation. With a rapidly increasing population, this expansion
    is likely to continue if the productivity will not be improved significantly in
    the near future. These trends are also threatening the remnant natural reserves
    of Burkina Faso with illegal logging and cultivation on protected land. In future,
    the introduction of new satellite systems such as Sentinel-2 and -3 should improve
    the input data availability and facilitate subsequent applications of the developed
    approach for the delineation of agricultural area. This study also highlights
    the great potential of the dense time series generated with the ESTARFM framework
    beyond its use for agricultural studies in Burkina Faso [24]. Further applications,
    where a combination of high temporal and spatial resolution would be essential,
    could be the analysis of land degradation or changes in the land surface phenology
    in Burkina Faso [24]. Acknowledgments This work was conducted in the WASCAL (West
    African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use) project
    and supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)
    under Grant FKZ 01LG1202D. We thank Xiaolin Zhu for providing the code of the
    original ESTARFM. The new MODIS collection 6 time series were kindly provided
    by Crystal Schaaf and Qingsong Sun, School for the Environment, University of
    Massachusetts Boston, before the official distribution via the USGS MODIS websites.
    We would also like to thank Benjamin Mack for assistance and feedback on the random
    forests classification as well as the four anonymous reviewers for their helpful
    comments. Author Contributions Kim Knauer conducted the processing of the time
    series and the classification of agricultural areas and together with Ursula Gessner
    conceived and conducted the analyses of the results; Gerald Forkuor, Rasmus Fensholt,
    and Claudia Kuenzer guided the processing and interpretation. Kim Knauer wrote
    the first version of the manuscript and all authors jointly improved the version
    based on critical discussion. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflict

  description: 'The world population is expected to increase by a further three billion
    by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing countries that rely
    on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being of human kind. The
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report
    (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced
    since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and
    ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has
    been successively warmer at the earth''s surface than any preceding decade since
    1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data
    as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85°C (0.65–1.06°C) over the
    period of 1880–2012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the
    hottest year on record. Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development
    in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task
    of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water
    resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view
    of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural
    resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over
    the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6°C, which is likely to impact
    many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers.
    There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in
    some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction
    in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under
    medium-term (2020–39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by
    4.5–9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture
    currently contributes about 15% of India''s gross domestic product (GDP), a negative
    impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7%
    to 1.35% of GDP per year. Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders
    (<0.5 ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed
    agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural
    to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed
    climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts,
    cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being
    severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas
    have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion.
    Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity,
    shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals,
    severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods
    of rural poor. Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for
    ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor,
    small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of
    planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood
    security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural
    loss in 2030 is expected to be over $7 billion that will severely affect the income
    of at least 10% of the population. However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective
    climate resilient measures are implemented. Climate risks are best addressed through
    increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate
    benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient
    agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices
    in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various
    climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such
    disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall
    pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience
    is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious
    and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources
    through adoption of best bet practices. CRA is a way to achieve short- and long-term
    agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as
    a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other
    actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to
    enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes
    in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience
    and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change,
    and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and
    increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation,
    and mitigation) are referred to as the “triple win” of overall CRA. The concept
    of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to
    provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through
    livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts,
    cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development
    of CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and
    empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from
    climate risks. The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village
    level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC),
    custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks,
    commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on bottom-up approach
    with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional
    requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support
    from experts. In our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate
    Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving
    farmer''s participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation
    anywhere in the world. Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building
    of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization
    (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level,
    Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural
    Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated
    Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology
    divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing
    the project at village level through farmers’ participatory approach. To address
    the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions
    were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under
    each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic
    vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention
    modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture
    conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health
    card–based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary
    or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages,
    conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production
    module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant
    varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops
    to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice
    Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables,
    community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient
    farm machinery through village CHC with timely completion of farm operation in
    limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry
    systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation
    of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters
    for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water
    scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy.
    (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups,
    introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment
    of automated weather stations. Impacts of these climate resilient interventions
    in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly,
    improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village
    level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration,
    groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of GHG emissions
    which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance
    and overall contribution to global warming potential. These 151 CRVs are learning
    sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts
    so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led
    climate change mitigation mission in the country.'

    rights and content Abstract The world population is expected to increase by a
    further three billion by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing
    countries that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being
    of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth
    assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal
    and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed,
    the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of
    the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth''s surface than
    any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean
    surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85°C
    (0.65–1.06°C) over the period of 1880–2012. World Meteorological Organization
    (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record. Climate change poses many challenges
    to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system
    faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4%
    of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to
    climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive
    pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming
    trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6°C, which
    is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security
    of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield
    of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water
    stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have
    been projected under medium-term (2020–39) climate change scenario, for example,
    yield reduction by 4.5–9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming.
    Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India''s gross domestic product
    (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly
    range from 0.7% to 1.35% of GDP per year. Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers
    being smallholders (<0.5 ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent
    rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from
    rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with
    changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of
    droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and
    2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought
    prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater
    intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops,
    fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration
    of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening
    the livelihoods of rural poor. Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore,
    is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the
    resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In
    the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change
    on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated
    countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $7 billion that will
    severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population. However, this could
    be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented.
    Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building
    resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse
    impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the
    incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases
    the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances
    by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events
    such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks,
    and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the
    system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management
    of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption
    of best bet practices. CRA is a way to achieve short- and long-term agricultural
    development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to
    other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in
    securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them
    to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to
    meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the
    capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3)
    seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase
    carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation)
    are referred to as the “triple win” of overall CRA. The concept of climate resilient
    village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to
    farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification
    in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms,
    heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of CRVs warrants establishment
    of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making
    process to manage and recover from climate risks. The overall program of establishing
    CRVs have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management
    Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed
    and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on

    accounts for about 2.3% of world''s geographical area and 4.2% of its water resources
    but has to support almost 18% of world''s human population and 15% of the livestock.
    Agriculture remains the most important sector of Indian economy with 18% share
    in gross domestic product (GDP) at 2011–12 prices, 11% of exports and 53.3% share
    in total employment or workforce in 2013–14. As per the Agriculture Census 2010–11,
    the total number of operational holdings in the country has almost doubled from
    71.01 million in 1970–71 to 138.35 million in 2010–11 (Fig. 1). During the same
    period, the average size of operational holding has declined to 1.15 ha from 2.28
    ha in 1970–71 (GOI, 2014). The small and marginal holdings taken together (below
    2.0 ha) constituted 85.01% with operated area of 44.58% in 2010–11 against 83.29%
    with 41.14% of operated area in 2005–06. Download : Download full-size image Figure
    1. Number of operational holdings in India. Adapted from GOI (2014). 1.1. Food
    Production The country''s production of cereals is next only to China and USA.
    Among the important cereals, India is the second largest producer globally of
    rice and wheat, and the top producer of pulses. India is also the largest producer
    of milk and second largest producer of groundnut, vegetables, fruits, sugarcane,
    and cotton. As per the fourth advance estimates for 2013–14, total food grain
    production in India has been estimated at 264.77 Mt (DAC, 2015). Total production
    of pulses and oilseeds estimated at record levels of 19.27 and 32.88 Mt, respectively.
    Total production of rice in the country is estimated at 106.54 Mt which is a new
    record, higher by 1.30 Mt than the production of rice during 2012–13. Production
    of wheat, estimated at record level of 95.91 Mt is also higher than the production
    of 93.51 Mt during 2012–13. The production of coarse cereals is estimated at 43.05
    Mt. Similarly, the production of milk (137.7 Mt), eggs (73.4 billion nos.), and
    wool (47.9 million kg) was also higher during 2013–14 compared to previous years.
    1.2. Food Demand Long-term trends in household-level consumption patterns show
    that per capita direct consumption of food grains has been declining and of livestock
    products, fruits, and vegetables has been increasing for a fairly long time (Kumar
    et al., 2007, Mittal, 2007, Chand, 2009). Despite this shift, food grains are
    of paramount importance for household food and nutritional security because cereals
    and pulses are staple foods and the cheapest sources of energy and protein for
    low-income groups, and the requirement as livestock feed is growing rapidly as
    the demand for animal products is increasing rapidly. Any slackness toward their
    production translates into persistent price rise with adverse impact on the nutritional
    levels of common people (Venkateswarlu and Prasad, 2012). The consumption pattern
    of food grains, which contribute to major nutritional intake, is decreasing; it
    was 64% during the base year 2000, and may decrease to 57 and 48% during the projected
    years of 2025 and 2050, respectively (Amarasinghe et al., 2007). Contributions
    from nongrain crops and other animal products are increasing. The contribution
    from nongrain crops was 28% during 2000, and is projected to be 33 and 36% during
    2025 and 2050, respectively. Contribution from other animal products was 8% during
    2000, and is projected to increase to 12 and 16% during 2025 and 2050, respectively.
    Taking these trends into consideration the total food grain demand is estimated
    to be 291 Mt by 2025 and 377 Mt by 2050, whereas the total production is estimated
    to be 292 Mt by 2025 and 385 Mt by 2050, which is 2.0% more than the demand. However,
    production deficits are projected for other cereals, oilseeds, and pulses. The
    projected deficit is 33 and 3% in 2025 and 43 and 7% in 2050 for other cereals
    and pulses, respectively. Another study by Singh (2009) found that the food consumption
    levels in India will increase from the current level of 2400 kcal/capita per day
    to about 3000 kcal/capita per day in 2050 and the demand for cereals will rise
    to 243 Mt in 2050. The rainfed crop yields are expected to increase to 1.8 t/ha
    in 2030 and 2.0 t/ha in 2050. The irrigated cereal yields are projected to increase
    from 3.5 to 4.6 t/ha during the same period. The cereal production in India is
    thus projected to increase by 0.9% per year between 1999–2001 and 2050, and is
    expected to exceed the demand by 2050 even if the projected growth is about 0.9%
    per year. The projected food demand made by several studies is given in Table

    Food Security and Climate Change The concept of food security has been undergoing
    an evolutionary change during the last 50 years. In the 1950s, food security was
    considered essentially in terms of production. More recently, it is becoming evident
    that even if availability and access are satisfactory, the biological absorption
    of food in the body is related to the consumption of clean drinking water as well
    as to environmental hygiene, primary health care, and primary education. Finally,
    even if physical and economic access to food is assured, ecological factors will
    determine the long-term sustainability of food security systems (Swaminathan,
    2001). The Asia-Pacific region has achieved the Millennium Development Goals’
    hunger target (MDG-1c) of halving the proportion of undernourished people in 2015.
    The region has also achieved the largest reduction in the absolute number of undernourished
    people (236 million). However, this was not sufficient to meet the target set
    by the World Food Summit of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015
    (FAO, 2015). There are large disparities among subregions and countries in the
    region. India still has the second-highest estimated number of undernourished
    people in the world. The number of undernourished people in India is 194.6 (15.2%)
    million during 2014–16 compared to 210.1 million (23.7%) during 1990–92; “Global
    Hunger Index-2015” released by International Food Policy Research Institute ranks
    India at 25 with a score of 29 among 117 countries. About 54% of pregnant women
    suffer from anemia in India. The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in the population
    is also very high in India (62% in 2003). The Indian Government has been responding
    with a number of measures to overcome hunger and malnutrition. India''s Targeted
    Public Distribution System (TPDS) is an example of a food price subsidy that reached
    about 45% of the population in 2010–11 and was expected to reach about two-thirds
    of the population (75% of the rural and half the urban population) from 2013.
    The TPDS has had a strong poverty-reducing impact: the poverty headcount rate
    in 2009–10 would have been 4.6 percentage points higher in the absence of the
    TPDS and the midday school meal (Himanshu and Sen, 2013). India enacted the National
    Food Security Act in 2013, which is one of the largest social safety net programs
    in the world. It seeks to “provide food and nutritional security by ensuring access
    to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people.” The act
    entitles two-thirds of India''s total population of 1.25 billion to 5 kg of rice,
    wheat, or coarse cereals per person per month at the highly subsidized price of
    Rs. 1–3 (US $0.015–$0.045) per kilogram. Agricultural production in India is closely
    linked to the performance of summer monsoon (June–September) which contributes
    about 75% of the annual precipitation (Fig. 2). Apart from the interannual variability
    in summer monsoon rainfall, occurrence of many of the hydrometeorological events
    is found to influence Indian agriculture at different spatial scales. Apart from
    the summer monsoon rainfall, India receives about 15% of annual precipitation
    during the winter months of December–March. This precipitation is very important
    for rabi (winter) crops. Though rainfall and its distribution have profound influence
    on the Indian food grain production, other climatic elements like radiation and
    temperature are also exerting considerable effect. Changes in many components
    in the climate system including floods, cyclones, heat wave, hailstorms, etc.
    also have been observed. Projected climate change may exacerbate the extreme climatic
    events and aggravate the risks of drought, flooding, pest infestation, and water
    scarcity to agroecosystems already under great stress (Beddington et al., 2012).
    Climate change may affect food systems in several ways (Gregory et al., 2005),
    although not all effects of climate change may be adverse to agronomic/food production
    (Lal, 2013). Download : Download full-size image Figure 2. Monsoon rainfall versus
    deviation in food grain production during kharif (rainy season) during different
    years. Compiled by authors. In spite of the uncertainties about the precise magnitude
    of climate change at regional scales, an assessment of the possible impacts of
    changes in key climatic elements on agricultural resources is important for formulating
    response strategies (Rajeevan, 2013). Climate change may affect agricultural crops
    in four ways (Hulme, 1996). First, changes in temperature and precipitation will
    alter the distribution of agroecological zones. An increase in potential evapotranspiration
    is likely to intensify drought stress, especially in the semiarid tropics and
    subtropics. Second, carbon dioxide effects are expected to have a positive impact
    due to greater water use efficiency and higher rate of photosynthesis. Third,
    water availability (or runoff) is another critical factor in determining the impact
    of climate change. Fourth, agricultural losses can result from climatic variability
    and the increased frequency of extreme events such as droughts and floods or changes
    in precipitation and temperature variance. Estimating the effect of a changing
    climate on crop production in India is difficult due to the variety of cropping
    systems and levels of technology used (Mall et al., 2006). Several crop models
    including DSSAT series, ORYZA, WTGROWS, INFOCROP, and INFOCANE have been used
    in large number of studies to evaluate the impacts of changes in CO2, rainfall,
    and temperature on agriculture in India. The predicted changes to agriculture
    vary greatly by region and crop. The increases in temperature (by about 2°C) are
    predicted to reduce potential grain yields of wheat in most places. Regions with
    higher potential productivity (such as northern India) are likely to be relatively
    less impacted by climate change than areas with lower potential productivity.
    Climate change is also predicted to lead to boundary changes in areas suitable
    for growing certain crops. Reductions in yields as a result of climate change
    are predicted to be more pronounced for rainfed crops (as opposed to irrigated
    crops) and under limited water supply situations because there are few coping
    mechanisms for rainfall variability. Rice production in eastern regions is predicted
    to be most impacted by increased temperatures and decreased radiation, resulting
    in relatively fewer grains and shorter grain filling durations. By contrast, potential
    reductions in yields due to increased temperatures in northern India are predicted
    to be offset by higher radiation, lessening the impacts of climate change. Although
    additional CO2 can benefit crops, this effect is predicted to be nullified by
    an increase of temperature. Birthal et al. (2014) projected the effects of climate
    change on crop yields for three timescales (2035, 2065, and 2100) at minimum and
    maximum changes in temperature and rainfall. In general, the production of pulses
    will be affected more by climate change than other crops. By the year 2100, with
    a significant change in climate, the yield of chick pea and pigeon pea will be
    lower by around 25% vis-a-vis without climate change (Table 2). The climate impacts
    on cereals will vary widely in rainy season as well as winter seasons. In the
    winter season, wheat yield will be less by about 22%, almost 3 times that of barley.
    Similarly, among rainy season cereals, rice will be affected more than maize and
    sorghum by the climate change. Rice yield will decline by over 15% with significant
    changes in climate as compared to loss of 7% in sorghum and of 4% in maize. Groundnut
    also stands to lose, but rapeseed-mustard is likely to gain by a small margin.
    If the climate does not change significantly, yield losses will be much smaller.
    However, the climate impacts will not be so severe in the short-run (2035). Table

    The direct impacts of climate change would be small on rainy season crops but
    the crops will become vulnerable due to increased incidence of weather extremes
    such as changes in rainy days, rainfall intensity, duration and frequency of drought
    and floods, diurnal asymmetry of temperature, change in humidity, and pest incidence
    and virulence. Winter crop production may become comparatively more vulnerable
    due to larger increase in temperature, asymmetry of day and night temperature,
    and higher uncertainties in rainfall (Rajeevan, 2013). The effects of climate
    change on food production are not limited to crops. It will affect food production
    and food security via its direct or indirect impact on other components of the
    agricultural production systems, especially livestock production which is closely
    linked with crop production. Livestock in India are raised under mixed crop–livestock
    systems deriving a substantial share of their energy requirements from crop by-products
    and residues. Any decline in crop area or production will reduce fodder supplies.
    Heat stress on animals will reduce rate of feed intake. The higher temperatures
    and changing rainfall patterns may cause increased spread of the existing vector-borne
    diseases and macroparasites, alter disease pattern, give rise to new diseases,
    and affect reproduction behavior. All these factors will affect performance of
    the livestock (Birthal et al., 2014). By 2065, India''s population is likely to
    cross 1.7 billion mark demanding more and diversified foods. With climate change,
    ensuring food security with more food production under limited resources will
    be a big challenge. It is, however, possible for farmers and other stakeholders
    to adapt to climate change and reduce the losses. Simple adaptations, such as
    change in crop variety, planting dates, rainwater conservation, adoption of resilient
    intercropping systems, particularly in rainfed areas could help in reducing impacts
    of climate change. For example, losses in wheat production can be reduced from
    4–5 to 1–2 Mt, if a large percentage of farmers could change to timely planting
    (Aggarwal, 2008). 2. Climate Change Scenario Climate change projections are associated
    with a range of limitations and uncertainties, driven mainly by the model and
    scenario uncertainties. Further, climate projections are generally more reliable
    at the global scale than at smaller regional scales (Taylor et al., 2012). However,
    several researchers have made climate projections for India using different climate
    models (Bhaskaran et al., 1995, Lal et al., 1995, Lal et al., 2001, Rupa Kumar
    et al., 2003, Kumar et al., 2011, Chaturvedi et al., 2012, Garg et al., 2015).
    The UKMO GCM model (Bhaskaran et al., 1995) predicts a total precipitation increase
    of approximately 20% and increase in winter or rabi crop season temperature by
    1–4°C with doubling of CO2 concentration. The model also predicts a greater number
    of heavy rainfall days during the summer monsoon or kharif period, and an increased
    interannual variability. Lal et al. (2001) projected between 1–1.4 and 2.23–2.87°C
    area-averaged annual mean warming by 2020 and 2050, respectively. Rupa Kumar and
    Ashrit (2001) have projected 13% increase in monsoon or kharif season rainfall
    in India using ECHAM4 model, while HadCM2 suggests reduction in kharif rainfall
    by 6%. However, both GCMs suggest an increase in annual mean temperature by more
    than 1°C (1.3°C in ECHAM4 and 1.7°C HadCM2). Kumar et al. (2011), using CMIP3
    multimodel data, reported that monsoon seasonal rainfall over India in the latter
    half of the 21st century may not be different in abundance to that experienced
    at present. However, their intensity and duration of wet and dry spells may change
    appreciably. On the other hand, the near term future would witness substantial
    increases in both day and night temperatures and increase in frequency and intensity
    of extremes. These temperature changes are likely to trigger abrupt responses
    in agricultural productivity and human mortality. Representative concentration
    pathways (RCP)-based climate projections are now available from a number of climate
    models under the CMIP5 experiment. CMIP5 models are generally of higher resolution
    compared to their CMIP3 counterparts (Stouffer et al., 2011). Chaturvedi et al.
    (2012) made climate projections for India using 18 CMIP5 coupled models. The range
    of temperature increase for all the RCPs by 2099 compared to the preindustrial
    period (1880s, i.e., climatology over the period 1861–1900) is 1–8°C, while this
    range comes down to 0.5–7°C as the reference period shifts to 1961–90. Under RCP
    2.6 the mean temperature increases by approximately 2°C over the period 1880s
    to 2070–99, and 4.8°C for RCP 8.5. For RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0, which represent the
    moderate scenarios, the projected increase in temperature ranges from 2.9 to 3.3°C
    (Fig. 3). Similarly, the projected all-India ensemble-mean annual precipitation
    is 7, 9.4, 9.4, and 18.7% for RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, respectively,
    by 2099 compared to the 1961–90 baseline (Fig. 3). However, all-India precipitation
    projections have larger uncertainties as evident from the large spread of the
    precipitation change projections in Fig. 3, which ranges from –20% to 60% toward
    the end of the century. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. CMIP5 model-based
    time series of temperature and precipitation anomalies (historical and projections)
    from 1861 to 2099 relative to the 1961–90 baseline for the RCP scenarios. Chaturvedi
    et al. (2012). Studies based on the observed precipitation records of India Meteorological
    Department (IMD) have shown that the occurrence of extreme precipitation events
    and their variability has already gone up in many parts of India (Goswami et al.,
    2006, Ghosh et al., 2012). Chaturvedi et al. (2012) projected consistently increasing
    trends in frequency of extreme precipitation days (e.g., >40 mm/day) for decades
    2060s and beyond (Fig. 4). The decline in heavy rainfall events in the 2050s is
    likely related to circulation changes on decadal variability in the model. Download

    rainfall days for future decades relative to the 1861–70 baseline based on the
    MIROC-ESM-CHEM model for RCP 4.5 scenario. Chaturvedi et al. (2012). The percentage
    area in India that is projected to experience above 2°C change between 2016 and
    2099 was estimated for all the RCPs using the data from the CMIP5 models (Garg
    et al., 2015). Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, which is the most representative scenario,
    about 10% of the country is projected to witness more than 2°C increase in air
    temperature by 2035. Moreover, under the RCP 8.5 scenario, 35% of the country
    is projected to experience rise of more than 2°C in air temperature. Mean annual
    temperature is projected to increase by 1–1.5°C under all the RCPs in the near
    (2016–45) term climate. However, based on multimodel ensemble mean projections,
    mean annual temperature is projected to increase between 1.8 and 3.0°C in the
    midterm climate (2046–75). Multimodel ensemble mean monsoon season precipitation
    is projected to increase by 10–15% under near and midterm climate in most of the
    RCPs. However, under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the monsoon season precipitation is
    projected to decline in the near (2016–45) term climate especially in the Central
    India. 2.1. Microlevel Assessment of Vulnerability to Climate Change and Variability
    Climate change projections made for India indicate an overall increase in temperature
    by 1–4°C and precipitation by 9–16% toward 2050s (Krishna Kumar et al., 2011).
    However, different regions are expected to experience differential change in the
    amount of rainfall that is likely to be received in the coming decades. Another
    significant aspect of climate change is the increase in the frequency of occurrence
    of extreme events such as droughts, floods, and cyclones. All of these expected
    changes will have adverse impacts on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture,
    forest, and coastal ecosystems and also on availability of water for different
    uses and on human health. Historical trends also show a noticeable increase in
    mean temperature in the country though there is no discernible trend in the rainfall
    during the last several decades. However, regional variation in behavior of monsoon
    rainfall was observed over the years. Vulnerability to climate change varies across
    regions, sectors, and social groups. To develop and target appropriate adaptation
    measures, it is important to identify regions that are more vulnerable to climate
    change and variability (Rama Rao et al., 2013). In the context of climate change
    and agriculture, vulnerability refers to the propensity of the entity to face
    a climate shock and suffer loss in production and/or income from agriculture,
    though the latter is not always specified explicitly (Kavi Kumar et al., 2007).
    Vulnerability is essentially an ex ante concept and refers to the possibility
    of being hit or propensity to be harmed by a stress or shock (Ionescu et al.,
    2008). The vulnerability assessment of 572 rural districts in India was carried
    out by Rama Rao et al. (2013), as per the definition of vulnerability given by
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). At present, many districts in
    states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka and some districts in
    Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand exhibit high
    and very high vulnerability. Most districts along the eastern and western coast,
    northeastern states are less vulnerable (Fig. 5A). By midcentury (2021–50), districts
    in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh,
    Tamil Nadu, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar exhibit very high and high vulnerability.
    Districts along the west coast, northern Andhra Pradesh, and northeastern states
    are relatively less vulnerable (Fig. 5B). Toward end of the century (2071–98),
    almost all districts in Rajasthan and many districts in Gujarat, Maharashtra,
    and Karnataka and a few districts in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab,
    Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Andhra Pradesh exhibit very high vulnerability.
    A majority of districts with low and very low vulnerability are located along
    the west coast and southern and eastern parts of the country (Fig. 5C). Download

    to climate change, (A) present, (B) midcentury (2021–50), and (C) end of the century
    (2071–98). Rama Rao et al. (2013). 2.1.1. Droughts Drought has been a recurring
    feature of agriculture in India. During the period 1900–2014, the number of occasions
    in which large Indian population got affected from drought was more than any other
    natural disaster. In the past, India experienced 24 large-scale droughts with
    increasing frequencies during the periods 1891–1920, 1965–90, and 1999–2012. Long-term
    rainfall data for India indicate that rainfed areas experience 3–4 drought years
    in every 10-year period. Of these, two to three are in moderate and one or two
    may be of severe intensity. Occurrence of drought is very frequent in the meteorological
    subdivisions like West Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, and Telangana
    (Table 3; NRAA, 2013). The risk involved in successful cultivation of crops depends
    on the nature of drought (chronic and contingent), its duration, and frequency
    of occurrence within the season. Table 3. Probability of occurrence of drought
    in different regions of India. Region Frequency of occurrence of drought Assam
    Very rare, once in 15 years West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Konkan, Bihar, and Odisha
    Once in 5 years South interior Karnataka, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Vidarbha
    region of Maharashtra Once in 4 years Gujarat, East Rajasthan, and western Uttar
    Pradesh Once in 3 years Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, and Telangana Once in 2.5
    years West Rajasthan Once in 2 years Source: Adapted from NRAA (2013). Loss of
    assets in the form of crop and livestock (mortality, loss in productivity, health,
    and fertility); productive capital damage as a direct consequence of water shortage
    or related power cuts; agro-based industries, domestic water availability, health,
    household activities, etc. are some of the major causalities due to drought. Analysis
    of top six most severe droughts during 1877–2005 in India indicated that the rainfall
    deficit varied from –19% to –29.1%, whereas the geographical area affected ranged
    from 49% to 63%. Rainfall deficiency in the month of July (crop sowing period)
    was agronomically more critical for agricultural production and the deficit was
    highest during the drought of 2002 with the most severe economic losses (Samra,
    2006). For example, the impact of 2002 drought was such that the water storage
    in 70 major reservoirs was 33% less than the average of previous 10 years, 22
    Mha area was not sown and 47 Mha of the sown area was subsequently damaged and
    food grain production was reduced by 29 Mt, and agricultural GDP was reduced by
    3.1% (DAC, 2004). In 2009, the whole country (about 352 districts were declared
    drought hit) suffered from the effects of a severe drought which led to immense
    agricultural loss and affected the life and living of about 400 million people.
    The seasonal (June–September) mean rainfall recorded a deficit of 22% of its long-term
    mean. The food grain loss was about 15 Mt. Similarly, the year 2012 was unique
    in experiencing a delayed onset and deficient monsoon in the initial phase, followed
    by heavy rainfall, cloud burst, extended withdrawal, and floods in various parts
    of India. About 5.68 Mha of area was not sown during kharif (June–September) with
    a loss of about 12.76 Mt of kharif food grain production. Distress sale of animals
    were reported especially from Karnataka. In 2014–15, the country''s food grain
    production is estimated to have declined by 4.66% to 252.68 Mt due to poor monsoon
    (12% deficit rainfall) and unseasonal rains in February–March. Very high incidence
    of drought (>20%) is observed in a few districts in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The
    incidence is relatively low in the Western Ghats and eastern and northeastern
    India (Fig. 6). The incidence of drought, measured in terms of occurrence of number
    of severe droughts per 100 years, is likely to increase in a few districts in
    Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh,
    northeastern states, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, and in a majority
    of districts in Kerala. Some districts in eastern Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
    Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka are projected to experience drought less frequently
    (Rama Rao et al., 2013). Download : Download full-size image Figure 6. Probability
    of drought occurrence in India. Rama Rao et al. (2013); derived from Gore et al.
    (2010). 2.1.2. Cyclones The major natural disaster that affects the coastal regions
    of India is cyclone and as India has a coastline of about 7516 km; it is exposed
    to nearly 10% of the world''s tropical cyclones (TC). On an average, about five
    or six TC form in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, and hit the coast every year.
    Out of these, two or three are severe (Sikka et al., 2016). When a cyclone approaches
    to coast, a risk of serious loss or damage arises from severe winds, heavy rainfall,
    storm surges, and river floods. Most cyclones occur in the Bay of Bengal followed
    by those in the Arabian Sea and the ratio is approximately 4:1. The incidence
    of cyclonic storms, with wind speeds between 65 and 117 kmph and severe cyclonic
    storms with wind speeds between 119 and 164 kmph, reaching Tamil Nadu and Andhra
    Pradesh is high during the northeast monsoon season (October–December), whereas
    the highest annual number of storms and severe storms occur in the Odisha-West
    Bengal coast. Though several studies by De and Joshi (1999), Srivastava et al.
    (2000), Bhaskar Rao et al. (2001), and De et al. (2005) show a decreasing trend
    in frequency of TC and Monsoon Depressions (MD) over the North Indian Ocean (The
    Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea) in recent years, their potential for damage
    and destruction still continues to be significant. The districts along the west
    coast, except those in Gujarat, are relatively less cyclone prone compared to
    those on the east coast (Fig. 7). Most of the districts in Odisha state are prone
    to both cyclones and floods. Balasore, Bhadrak, Jaipur, Kendrapara, Malkangiri,
    Nabarangpur, Nuapada, and Rayagada districts have vulnerability levels higher
    than the other districts of the state. Balasore, Bhadrak, and Kendrapara are the
    coastal districts, while the remaining five districts are noncoastal (Bahinipati,
    2014). Download : Download full-size image Figure 7. Areas prone to cyclones in
    India. Rama Rao et al. (2013); NDMA website. 2.1.3. Floods Twenty-three of the
    36 states and union territories in the country are subject to floods. About 49.8
    Mha land (15.2% of geographical area) is flood prone and about 10–12 Mha is actually
    flooded each year. India''s vulnerability to floods can be visualized from the
    flood damages at current prices during 1953–2010 of Rs. 8.12 trillion. Floods
    occur in almost all river basins in India. The main causes of floods are heavy
    rainfall, inadequate capacity of rivers to carry the high flood discharge, and
    inadequate drainage to carry away the rainwater quickly to streams/rivers. Ice
    jams or landslides blocking streams, and cyclones also cause floods. Flash floods
    occur due to high rate of water flow as also due to poor permeability of the soil.
    Most of the floods occur during the monsoon period and are usually associated
    with tropical storms or depressions and active monsoon conditions (Sikka et al.,
    2016). The extent of area affected and damage caused to agriculture due to floods
    that occurred during 1953–2011 is given in Table 4. Table 4. Flood/heavy rain

    In the period between October 2013 and October 2014, floods in three states—Odisha,
    Assam, and Jammu and Kashmir—have affected more than 19.3 million people. Over
    62,000 people have been affected by floods in Gujarat and Bihar in the same period.
    Paddy crop on 31,000 ha and other crops on 7,000 ha were damaged in 509 villages
    of Odisha. The floods in Kashmir, its worst ever in four decades, affected about
    five million people and caused an immediate loss of Rs. 54–57 billion to the state''s
    economy. More than 20% of geographical area is prone to incidence of floods in
    a majority of districts in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal
    and in a few districts in northeastern states, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala,
    and Odisha (Fig. 8). Download : Download full-size image Figure 8. Areas prone
    to floods in India. Rama Rao et al. (2013). 2.1.4. Hailstorms Hail formation requires
    environments with strong upward motion of air and/or lowered heights of freezing
    level. In the middle latitudes, hailstones are formed near the interior of continents
    while in tropics, they tend to be confined to higher levels of freezing (Rao et
    al., 2014). Out of 597 hailstorms in India, 153 yielded hailstones of diameter
    3 cm or greater. These events killed 250 persons and caused extensive damage to
    winter wheat crops. A cropped area of 0.46 Mha in 1994–95, 0.74 Mha in 1995–96,
    1.2 Mha in 1997–98, and 2.9 Mha in 1998–99 in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal
    Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and erstwhile Andhra Pradesh was
    badly hit by hailstorms. In January 2002, many parts of Karnataka state were lashed
    by hailstorm and the estimated loss suffered by the farming community was around
    Rs. 275 million. In the state of Odisha, about 375 villages were affected due
    to hailstorms and whirlwinds in 2005. In the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, hailstorm
    caused a huge damage to 77,000 ha of agricultural fields in 2005–06. The state
    of Madhya Pradesh was badly hit during March 2006 by heavy hailstorm causing widespread
    damage to standing winter crops. In March 2007, heavy rains accompanied by hailstorm
    damaged wheat, sugarcane, and oilseed crops in thousands of hectares in Punjab
    and Haryana. The estimated loss ran into billions of rupees and crops were severely
    damaged over 50,000 ha of land (Bhardwaj et al., 2007). In 2014, a series of hailstorms
    struck Central India during February 26th to March 15th. The loss due to the hailstorms
    is estimated between Rs. 100 and 150 billion, with all fields and orchard crops
    put together. Apart from crop damage, loss to livestock and infrastructure was
    also substantial (Rao et al., 2014). The authors used hailstorm data of 38 years
    for the period 1972–2011 (excluding 1977 and 1984, for which data are not available)
    for mapping areas prone to frequent hailstorms. More than 61% of the districts
    experienced at least one hail event in a 38-year period. Highest frequency is
    noticed over districts in the northern parts of Vidharbha region of Maharashtra
    that are adjoining the state of Madhya Pradesh (Fig. 9). Download : Download full-size

    Cold Wave Cold wave/frost is a localized seasonal phenomenon prevalent in the
    country except in southern India. Prevalence of extreme low temperature in association
    with incursion of dry cold winds from north into the subcontinent is known as
    cold waves. The cold waves mainly affect the areas to the north of 20°N. In India,
    a cold wave is considered to be severe when the night temperature drops below
    its daily normal by 7°C or more, when normal minimum temperature is 10°C or more.
    If the normal minimum temperature is less than 10°C, then 5°C or more below normal
    is called the severe cold wave condition. Maximum number of cold waves generally
    occur in Rajasthan followed by Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. The frequency
    of events over different time periods indicates that in recent years the state
    of Rajasthan is experiencing more cold waves and Jammu and Kashmir is experiencing
    a few (Sikka et al., 2016). Depending upon the time of occurrence, they are either
    beneficial or harmful to the field and orchard crops. Cold wave conditions that
    prevailed during winter of 2010–11 and 2011–12 coincided with flowering and seed
    formation stage of wheat in Punjab resulting in good yields (Samra et al., 2012).
    Frost and cold waves greatly impact legume crops. During flowering stages, these
    crops are likely to be adversely affected at temperature of −2 to −3°C. Those
    in pod formation stage are a bit more tolerant but are likely to be damaged at
    a temperature of −3 to −4°C. The number of cold waves in Gujarat and Maharashtra
    is almost one per year although these states are located more to the south. Occurrence
    of cold waves is expected to increase in whole of Gujarat, in a large number of
    districts in Rajasthan, and in some districts in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,
    Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, and northeastern states. In
    the rest of the country, the number of days with cold wave conditions is expected
    to decrease. Occurrence of frost is projected to decrease by more than 5 days
    in a few districts in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab,
    Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Arunachal Pradesh. Frost occurrence is expected to decrease
    by a maximum of 5 days in most parts of Central and northern India. 2.1.6. Heat
    Wave Extreme positive departures from the normal maximum temperature result in
    heat wave in different parts of the country. The maximum number of heat waves
    occur over East Uttar Pradesh followed by Punjab, East Madhya Pradesh, and Saurashtra
    and Kutch in Gujarat (Raghavan, 1967). During the decade 1991–2000, a significant
    increase in the frequency, persistency, and spatial coverage of heat wave/severe
    heat wave was observed in comparison to that during the earlier decades 1971–80
    and 1981–90 (Pai et al., 2004). These changes might be the regional impact of
    the observed general increase in the global warming during the decade (1991–2000),
    which was the warmest decade during the past 140 years (WMO, 2001). During March
    2004, heat wave conditions prevailed over different parts of North India coinciding
    with maturity phase of wheat, rapeseed, and vegetables. The minimum temperature
    was also higher than normal in several places of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh,
    Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, for many days continuously. This resulted in a loss
    of about 4.6 Mt of wheat production (Ranuzzi and Srivastava, 2012). Coconut, banana,
    cardamom, black pepper, cashew etc. were affected in Kerala due to heat wave–induced
    lower humidity and soil moisture. Milk production was affected slightly due to
    early disappearance of green fodder. A few districts in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal
    Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and northeastern
    states are likely to experience more frequent hot days compared to the baseline.
    In a recent study, sensitivity of wheat yields to minimum temperature during postanthesis
    period was quantified and it was found that wheat yields in India for the period
    1980–2011 declined by 7% (204 kg/ha) for a 1°C rise in minimum temperature. Exposure
    to minimum temperature exceeding 12°C for 6 days and to maximum temperature exceeding
    34°C for 7 days during postanthesis period are thermal constraints to achieving
    high productivity levels in wheat (Bapuji Rao et al., 2015). 2.1.7. Seawater Intrusion
    Seawater intrusion (or salt water intrusion) is the encroachment of saline water
    into fresh groundwater regions in coastal aquifer settings (Werner and Simmons,
    2009). Coastal zones contain some of the most densely populated areas in the world
    as they generally present the best conditions for productivity. However, these
    regions face many hydrological problems like flooding due to cyclones and wave
    surge, and drinking water scarcity due to problem of salt water intrusion (Bhosale
    and Kumar, 2002). As seawater intrusion progresses, existing pumping wells, especially
    close to the coast, become saline and have to be abandoned, thus reducing the
    value of the aquifer as a source of freshwater. It is well known that seawater
    intrusion is affected by both natural and anthropogenic processes. In particular,
    sea-level rise associated with climate change (by way of changes to atmospheric
    pressure, expansion of oceans and seas as they warm, and melting of ice sheets
    and glaciers) is one potentially significant process that is expected to play
    a role in seawater intrusion. On December 26, 2004, devastating tsunami waves
    caused a terrible human disaster affecting thousands of kilometers of the coastal
    belt in Southeast Asia. Many coastal wetlands were affected by the large inflow
    of salt seawater and littoral sediments that were deposited during the tsunami,
    with longer-term effects that include changes in the local hydrogeology caused
    by changes to coastlines and damage to sea defenses (Gupta, 2005). Serious problems
    pertaining to salinity changes were encountered in coastal South India and the
    consequent loss of fertility of agricultural land was also reported in these regions
    (Kontar, 2007). In Indian Sundarbans, out of total 3500 km of embankment, 800
    km is vulnerable to breach during high-intensity weather events. Present trend
    in sea level rise will have serious impacts on the embankments making these more
    vulnerable and susceptible to breach and overtopping (Mondal and Bandyopadhyay,
    2014). 3. Climate Resilient Villages 3.1. Concept of Climate Resilient Village
    Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) involves integration of adaptation, mitigation,
    and other practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system
    to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting or tolerating
    the damage and recovering quickly. Such perturbations and disturbances can include
    events such as drought, flooding, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, long
    dry spells, insect or pest population explosions, and other perceived threats
    caused by changing climate (NAAS, 2013). CRA includes an inbuilt property in the
    system for the recognition of a threat that needs to be responded to, and also
    the degree of effectiveness of the response and focuses on judicious and improved
    management of integrated genetic resources along with natural resources namely,
    land, water, and soil through adoption of best bet practices (Venkateswarlu and
    Shanker, 2009). The focus of CRA has been on the implementation of these best
    bet farm practices, and the ways and means by which they can be further improved
    in the context of a changing climate. Climate resilient agricultural practices
    are crop and location specific and can be tailored to fit into the agroecological
    and socioeconomic conditions and priorities of farmers (Rosenstock et al., 2015).
    Similarly, climate smart agriculture is an integrative approach to address the
    interlinked challenges of food security and climate change that explicitly aims
    for three objectives: (1) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity to
    support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security, and human development;
    (2) adapting and building resilience of agricultural and food security systems
    to climate change at multiple levels, and (3) reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    from agriculture (including crops, livestock, and fisheries) to the extent possible
    (FAO, 2013). CRA also consists of elements of preparedness such as documentation
    of aberrant weather conditions, weather-based agroadvisory, awareness about the
    impacts of weather, etc. In case of water, resilient practices consist of aquifer
    and groundwater recharge, in situ moisture conservation, farm ponds, efficient
    application system, etc. Some of the crop-based practices consist of drought-
    and flood-tolerant varieties, intercropping systems, etc. and interventions related
    to carbon, fertilizer, and institutions in the village (Fig. 10), which are similar
    to the climate smart interventions indicated by Scherr et al. (2012) and Aryal
    et al. (2015). Download : Download full-size image Figure 10. Components and technology
    framework of climate resilient villages (CRV). CHC, Custom hiring center; INM,
    integrated nutrient management; SSNM, Site-specific nutrient management; VCRMC,
    Village Climate Risk Management Committee. The concept of climate resilient villages
    (CRVs) consists of implementing these resilient practices at a scale to cover
    the entire village in a saturation mode depending on the resource endowments of
    the farmers with one or several interventions for imparting resilience to the
    production systems. A village consists of contiguous farms, well integrated in
    a landscape and also contains habitations. Each village is a local administrative
    unit within which the communities own the land and can take decisive actions.
    It is similar to a landscape, can vary from 500 to 1500 ha area depending on the
    size of the habitation, contiguous in area and all the biophysical and socioeconomic
    variables interact and operate. The CRVs adopt a portfolio of interventions that
    cover the full spectrum of farm activities consisting of adaptation, mitigation,
    natural resource management, better crop management, livestock production, etc.
    (Fig. 11). Through climate resilient agricultural landscapes/villages, important
    synergies for agricultural production, climate adaptation, and mitigation, as
    well as other livelihood and environmental objectives can be fulfilled by coordinated
    action at farm and landscape scales (Scherr et al., 2012). Download : Download
    full-size image Figure 11. Conceptual outlay of CRV. 3.2. Process of Development
    of CRVs To address the issues related to climate variability and to enhance the
    adaptive capacity of communities, extensive farmer participatory demonstrations
    of location-specific climate resilient technologies were initiated on farmers’
    fields in each of the 151 climatically vulnerable districts of the country (Fig.
    12) as part of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA). The
    climatically vulnerable districts of the country were identified based on a scientific
    analysis of climate-related problems, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity
    in relation to climate change (Rama Rao et al., 2013) and adaptation and mitigation
    strategies were identified following a bottom-up approach. The objective of the
    program is not only to demonstrate the CRA technologies but also to institutionalize
    mechanisms at the village level for continued adoption of such practices in a
    sustainable manner. Download : Download full-size image Figure 12. Identified
    151 climatically vulnerable districts of the country where resilient technologies
    are being implemented. Resilience to climate change is context specific and subject
    to the priorities of farmers, communities, and governments where it is implemented
    (Rosenstock et al., 2015). A number of technologies developed by the national
    agricultural system in India have been tested and refined in outreach programs
    and subsequently recommended for various agroclimatic conditions of the country.
    These technologies can effectively address the climate change and food security
    concerns and meet the objectives of enhanced agricultural productivity, increase
    resilience of farming systems to climate change, contribute to the mitigation
    of climate change, and thus can contribute to CRA, if implemented in synergetic
    manner. The primary goal of all the interventions is to impart resilience to agriculture
    and ensure household food security. However, communities can effectively adopt
    these practices when they are aware of the performance of these technologies.
    Hence technology demonstration is one of the effective means in showing the worth
    of the practice. Participatory demonstration of climate resilient technologies
    helps in training to build the knowledge and capacity to change local practices
    and improve planning for adaptation to changing climatic conditions. Testing of
    portfolio of climate resilient interventions helps in farm households to make
    progressive changes to crops and cropping patterns as well as introducing new
    livestock systems which can contribute toward resilient production systems (Kinyangi
    et al., 2015) and when adopted on a significant scale, contribute to CRVs. The
    strength of the approach lies in its inclusiveness as farmers’ village communities,
    multidisciplinary researchers, nongovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders,
    all come together to test a range of options in an integrated way. A village or
    a cluster of villages from each of these 151 vulnerable districts were selected
    for this purpose and the program is piloted by the KVK or Farm Science Center,
    and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Institutes and state agricultural
    university (SAU) systems located in that particular district. Planning, coordination,
    implementation, and monitoring of the program at national level is done by Central
    Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) in association with eight Agricultural
    Technology Application Research Institutes that coordinate the project in their
    respective zones. At the district level, the project is being implemented by selected
    KVK/ICAR institute/SAU and at the village level by institutions established in
    the villages through farmers’ participatory approach, such as Village Climate
    Risk Management Committees (VCRMCs). 3.2.1. Identifying Technological and Institutional
    Interventions The type of climate vulnerability and farming situation in the agroecological
    region were taken as basis to identify location-specific climate resilient interventions
    in the 151 villages by involving farming community, and personnel from various
    organizations working in the villages. To sensitize the participating institutes,
    an orientation workshop was organized for ground level implementation staff with
    the major objective of providing the background information, the methodology to
    be adopted, and the available technological options for addressing the climatic
    variability in the districts. During the workshop, proven technological options
    available for addressing particular climatic vulnerability were discussed. The
    participants were divided into groups, each group representing partners from three
    contiguous states having similar agroclimatic conditions. Each group deliberated
    on the issues concerning their respective zones and identified the constraints
    and possible interventions for addressing the climate variability and extreme
    weather events and also scope for convergence with other development programs
    and probable stakeholders of the project. Sensitization of various groups toward
    the possible climate resilient interventions is necessary as the prioritization
    of the interventions from among the basket of options available for the particular
    village is done by them depending on their expertise and knowledge (Fig. 13).
    This enabled finalization of various adaptation and mitigation options for addressing
    the climate vulnerability of selected villages. Download : Download full-size
    image Figure 13. Framework for developing CRVs. Planning for agricultural adaptation
    and mitigation has to lean on informed decision making and stakeholder involvement,
    integration of comprehensive information, and expertise for technology targeting.
    Inputs from interdisciplinary team consisting of specialists from plant breeding,
    natural resource management, agronomy, horticulture, plant protection, livestock,
    fisheries, agricultural economics, extension etc. were obtained for finalizing
    climate resilient interventions. Inputs from the relevant development departments
    of the state, zonal agricultural research stations of agricultural universities,
    and progressive farmers were also obtained and used in finalizing the interventions
    and action plans. Resource endowments of the individual farmers are important
    in targeting climate resilient technologies such as access to inputs, financing,
    markets, etc. (Campbell and Thornton, 2014). Among the resilient practices available,
    interventions which give long-term and sustainable benefits, address resource
    conservation, and strengthen village level institutions were identified. An integrated
    package consisting of specific interventions related to each of the four modules
    namely, natural resource management, crop production, livestock and fishery, and
    institutional mechanism were identified (Prasad et al., 2015). 3.2.2. Coverage
    of the Interventions Though it is planned to saturate the entire village gradually
    with the resilient interventions, the number and kind of interventions implemented
    are largely determined by the resources available, and vulnerability status and
    involvement of communities. Some of the technologies such as farm ponds and percolation
    tanks require significant resources and hence locations were identified based
    on catchment and other technical requirements, either for individual or community
    farm ponds. In situ moisture conservation and improved agronomic practices, intercropping
    and new varieties were introduced on a significant scale in the villages. To enhance
    the coverage of the interventions, convergence with the development programs operational
    at the village level was sought so that large number of farmers could be covered
    with the specific technology. It was also ensured that each intervention had the
    farmers’ practice as control to assess the impact of interventions and successful
    interventions get expanded to adjoining villages or cluster of villages. 3.3.
    Innovative Institutional Setup in CRVs and Their Roles It is essential to have
    institutional structures at the village level to guide the implementation, and
    continuation of interventions for long lasting impact. VCRMC was conceptualized
    as a central point for development of CRVs. Institutional structures like community
    seed bank, fodder bank, custom hiring center (CHC) for farm machinery, etc. were
    established in the villages (Fig. 14) depending on the need, through active involvement
    of farmers, and by making use of the existing democratic structures operational
    at the village level (Venkateswarlu et al., 2012). A user group was created for
    each activity so that the users of that particular activity are involved in its
    operation, maintenance, and addressing specific problems associated with the continuity
    of that particular activity. The capacity of the group was built on each of these
    specific activities so that the communities understand the intricacies involved
    in the respective activities which enable them for their effective management.
    Well-organized committees in a village manage their natural resources in a sustainable
    way and take a collective action in response to external shocks, including those
    related to climate. The community-based institutional structures foster group
    action among the communities, mobilize individual resources for addressing community
    problems, generate understanding among the community and harness synergies, effectively
    manage resources based on shared utilization, and promote collective action. Some
    of the institutions established at the village and their modus operandi are presented
    in this section. Download : Download full-size image Figure 14. Village level
    institutional setup in CRV. AWS, Automatic weather station; CHC, custom hiring
    center; VCRMC, Village Climate Risk Management Committee. 3.3.1. Village Climate
    Risk Management Committee VCRMC, a unique institution at the village representing
    all categories of farmers, was formed in all CRVs with the approval of the gram
    sabha (village level decision-making body). Each VCRMC comprises of 12–20 villagers
    with President, Secretary, and Treasurer elected among themselves unanimously,
    and has at least one woman member (Fig. 15). This committee is responsible for
    the overall program implementation. VCRMC participates in all discussions related
    to finalizing interventions, their implementation, and provides community perspective
    about location of water conservation structures, particularly selection of target
    farmers, and coordinates with gram panchayat (village level elected organization)
    for the implementation of interventions. A bank account was opened in the name
    of VCRMC in every CRV which is used for all financial transactions under the program
    including farmers’ contributions toward implementation of different activities.
    Various interventions implemented in the village are shared on cost basis by the
    project as well as the farmer. For example, a farmer has to contribute nearly
    25–50% of the cost of seed of high yielding drought escaping varieties and the
    collected money is deposited in the bank which is maintained by the VCRMC. The
    utilization of money is taken up by the committee and decisions are taken unanimously.
    Farmers’ contributory share toward inputs like fertilizer, improved animal breeds,
    etc., is also deposited in the bank account. The revenue and expenditure details
    are shared with the general body periodically. Extensive capacity building of
    VCRMC was taken up at village level as well as in research institutes regarding
    interventions, their implementation, and handling of resources (Venkateswarlu
    et al., 2012). Download : Download full-size image Figure 15. Discussion of the
    VCRMC (A) and shed for farm implements/machines (B). 3.3.2. Custom Hiring Centers
    for Farm Implements Timeliness of agricultural operations is crucial to cope with
    climatic variability, especially for sowing and intercultural operations as soil
    moisture status provides a limited sowing window, particularly in rainfed agroecosystems
    (Reddy et al., 2015). With increasing climatic variability, timely sowing or resowing
    is important, for ensuring optimum plant population and better crop growth. However,
    smallholding farmers often are not able to take up sowing in time due to the need
    of labor and implements. Though farm machines are used for completing farm operations,
    their access is limited (Mehta et al., 2014). An innovative institutional mechanism
    was put in place at each of the 151 villages, for management of the CHC for farm
    machinery. The essential farm tools and implements required for the smallholder
    situations depending on the agroecosystem of each village were procured and made
    accessible at a central location in the village called CHC under the supervision
    and management of the community (Fig. 15). These machines/implements can be used
    by any farmer by paying usage charges. The kind and number of machines/implements
    were decided by VCRMC and village level extension experts. The hiring charges
    for machines and implements were decided by the VCRMC, displayed on the board
    and the amount collected is maintained by the VCRMC (Fig. 15). The committee uses
    the revenue generated from custom hiring for repair and maintenance of the implements
    and the remaining amount goes into the revolving fund which is used for other
    needful farm activities of the community. Much of the machines and equipment purchased
    are related to tillage, sowing, intercultural operations, weeding, spraying, harvesting,
    and postharvest operations and for performing special operations such as transplanting
    of paddy, breaking up of hardpans under the plough layer, etc. Different types
    of farm machinery are stocked in CHCs and the most popular are rotavator for good
    seedbed preparation, zero till drill, and drum seeder for sowing of paddy, multicrop
    planter, power weeder, and chaff cutter. 3.3.3. Village Seed Banks Providing seeds
    of improved and stress-tolerant varieties to farmers in time is one of the important
    interventions for imparting resilience against climate variability. The purpose
    of a village seed bank is to serve as an emergency seed supply when farmers experience
    shortage of seeds, where there is a need for resowing of crop. Further, community
    seed banks are essential instruments for conserving local varieties, restoring
    lost varieties, sharing of indigenous traditional knowledge (ITKs) and expertise
    among farmers for improving availability and accessibility of quality seeds, and
    for providing seed at lower cost than through purchase from seed vendors. Seed
    banks ensure sufficient seed of the right varieties available at the right time
    and at an affordable price, thus enhancing seed security (Boef et al., 2010).
    Seed banks serve as backup to the informal seed sector, and they motivate farming
    communities to rely on their own institutions and remain autonomous in their food
    and seed security. The community seed bank is emerging as an effective rural institution
    at the village level that strengthens local farmers’ access to diverse crop genetic
    resources while conserving the agrobiodiversity on farm (Maharjan et al., 2011).
    Small-scale farmers not only in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, but also in Europe
    and North America, use farm-saved seed and rely to a large degree on the informal
    system for accessing new materials (Louwaars and de Boef, 2012). A group of 20–25
    farmers were selected for seed production of relevant varieties for 2–4 important
    crops of the village (Venkateswarlu et al., 2012). The farmers group was trained
    and given seed and guidance to multiply the seed. Initially the group is being
    supplied with the foundation seed and training on seed production, processing,
    and storage. Participatory village level seed production of short-duration, drought-
    and flood-tolerant varieties was demonstrated in several villages with the support
    of KVKs in rice, soybean, groundnut, green gram, finger millet, foxtail millet,
    and pigeon pea. The resilient varieties are multiplied on the farms, processed,
    and stored by the communities to ensure more farmers access the improved seeds.
    Seeds are obtained from the farmers and are selected and stored depending on the
    prevalent storage system of the region. Community seed banks can take different
    forms, for example, seeds can be stored in pots in a shed or community buildings,
    in clay pots on the floor, or in a family granary. 3.3.4. Community Fodder Banks
    Smallholder farmers in developing countries generally manage intensive, mixed
    crop–livestock systems where animals are extremely important components and contribute
    to food and nutritional security of the household, provide for system diversification,
    generate income, spread risk, provide draft power and transportation, and are
    important assets for investment and savings (de Hann et al., 1997). Livestock
    producers generally meet their fodder requirements through a combination of crop
    residues, grazing on community and private property resources, cultivable fallows
    and crop lands after harvest apart from cultivation of forage crops to a limited
    extent. It is widely believed that changes in temperature, rainfall regime, and
    CO2 levels will affect grassland productivity and species composition and dynamics,
    resulting in changes in animal diets and possibly reduced nutrient availability
    for animals (Izaurralde et al., 2011, Thornton and Herrero, 2014). During the
    wet season these lands provide adequate forage whereas during the dry season,
    the quantity and quality of forage greatly decreases and is generally low in nutritional
    value and livestock sustained on such diets often are less productive. Providing
    animals with quality feed to augment dry season forages through concentrates or
    supplemental feeding is one of the options but associated with the high cost and
    limited availability of supplements and may not be affordable for smallholders.
    A more practical option is to establish fodder banks where significant area is
    under pasture in the village. Fodder bank consists of planting of high-quality
    fodder species which can provide high biomass in short time and bridge the forage
    scarcity during the annual dry seasons (Bayala et al., 2014) and also during the
    long dry spells within the growing season. Planting of high biomass yielding and
    fast-growing grasses and shrubs suitable for fodder not only increases fodder
    availability, but also reduces erosion and landslides that originate in these
    areas. These fodder banks also help in the preservation and storage of surplus
    fodder, availability of nutritious fodder during the period of fodder scarcity,
    and enhance nutritive value of crop residue and other cellulosic waste for animal
    feeding (Dhyani et al., 2013). Fodder banks do not meet 100% of feed requirements,
    but supplement the available dry season forage. Community fodder banks were established
    in different villages, particularly, in villages which face acute scarcity of
    fodder during dry/summer seasons. 3.3.5. Automatic Weather Stations Rainfed agriculture
    in India is highly dependent on monsoon and gets impacted by rainfall variability.
    Access to weather information on real-time basis enables farmers to manage the
    risk. This can be accomplished by establishment of good network of weather observatories
    with rapid communication facilities. Weather and climatic information plays a
    major role in the entire crop cycle right from selecting the most suitable crop/variety
    up to postharvest operations and marketing; and if provided in advance can help
    farmers to organize and activate their own resources to reap the benefits by judicious
    use of costly inputs. A network of automatic weather stations (AWS) is the best
    way of getting real-time weather data, which will help the scientists to develop
    location-specific forecasts and aid in farm management decisions. In addition
    to the real-time weather data, weather forecast and agrometeorological advisories
    help to stabilize crop yields through management of agroclimatic resources as
    well as other inputs such as irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticides (Rathore,
    2013). AWS were established in majority of the KVK experimental farms and mini
    weather observatories in project villages to record real-time weather parameters
    such as rainfall, temperature, sunshine hours, and wind speed. The collected information
    is stored, archived, and shared with the needy. Regular capacity-building activities
    on collection of weather data and its utilization as agroadvisories are undertaken.
    3.4. Technological Modules of CRVs Planned adaptation is essential to impart resilience
    to agricultural production against climate variability. Several improved agricultural
    practices evolved for diverse agroecological regions over time by the National
    Agricultural Research System (NARS) in India have potential to enhance climate
    change adaptation, if deployed prudently. Management practices that increase agricultural
    production under adverse climatic conditions also contribute to adaptation because
    they increase resilience and reduce yield variability under variable climate and
    extreme events. Practices that help adapt to climate change in Indian agriculture
    can be broadly categorized into crop-, natural resource-, livestock-, horticulture-,
    and poultry- and fishery-based interventions (Table 5a–h). Institutional interventions
    promote collective action and build resilience among communities. Capacity building
    by extensive participatory demonstrations of location-specific agricultural practices
    helps farmers to gain access to knowledge and provides confidence to cope with
    adverse weather conditions. Efforts were made to deploy available location-specific
    farm technologies that have adaptation potential and demonstrate them in farmers’
    fields in the most vulnerable districts of the country through a participatory
    approach. Table 5. Resilient interventions implemented in CRVs toward adaptation

    Crop-Based Interventions Farmers traditionally grow local varieties of crops which
    are of long duration resulting in exposure of the part of the crop growth to deficit
    or excess rainfall which will have adverse effect on crop yield. The quantum of
    impact on crop growth and yield depends on the frequency and duration of the dry
    spells or excess moisture conditions. Majority of the improved and high yielding
    varieties are of short duration and hence escape drought which normally occurs
    at the end of the crop growing season particularly in regions which receive a
    rainfall of less than 750 mm. Some of the varieties besides short duration are
    also tolerant to moderate drought, saturated moisture conditions for few days,
    and can tolerate flooding for varying periods (Kinyangi et al., 2015) which can
    help to tide over the deficit or excess moisture condition with little negative
    impact on yield. Under rainfed conditions, deficit and excess moisture conditions
    commonly occur in the same season, particularly in regions receiving more than
    1000 mm rainfall. Varieties selected for these regions should withstand both excess
    and deficit moisture. Intercropping with a combination of short- and long-duration
    crops, shallow- and deep-rooted crops, legume and nonlegume crops is a resilient
    practice as the system can perform better in the event of variable rainfall (Ghosh
    et al., 2006). Further, by combining the legume and nonlegume crops, the synergies
    and the complimentarity between the crops are better harnessed. Diversifying with
    crops which give assured income and high returns to the farming community were
    explored and demonstrated in the villages. The criterion for selection of new
    crops was also that the crops are more tolerant to moisture stress or withstand
    rainfall variability better than the existing crops in the village. In regions
    receiving rainfall of more than 1000 mm, opportunity for double cropping exists
    even under rainfed conditions wherever soil moisture storage is high (Vertic and
    Vertisols) and presowing irrigation is feasible. Cropping intensification with
    a provision for double cropping is one of the resilient measures in comparison
    to the single cropping as farmer can maximize income from both the crops in the
    years of good rainfall and can sustain himself from the second crop even if the
    first crop gets affected due to the deficit or excess moisture. Sustainable cropping
    intensification is possible when short-duration crops are selected both during
    the rainy and postrainy seasons as both the crops have to complete their life
    cycle from the rainfall which is normally received during the months of June–October.
    Introducing drought/temperature-tolerant varieties, advancement of planting dates
    of winter crops in areas with terminal heat stress, frost management in horticulture
    through fumigation, community nurseries for delayed monsoon, location-specific
    intercropping systems with high sustainable yield index are some of the interventions
    that were widely demonstrated in varying rainfall regions. 3.4.2. Natural Resource
    Management Although large areas of the country receive relatively high rainfall,
    much of the rainfall occurs in a brief period as high intensity storms. Due to
    the temporal and spatial variability and skewed distribution of rainfall, crops
    invariably suffer from moisture stress at one or the other stages of crop growth
    and this gets compounded due to increasing rainfall variability resulting in prolonged
    dry spells and frequent droughts. About 33% of the net sown area of the country
    receives a rainfall of less than 750 mm whereas 67% of rainfed area of the country
    receives rainfall more than 750 mm in India. The strategy of crop production in
    arid and semiarid regions receiving rainfall less than 750 mm consists of selection
    of short-duration and low water requiring crops and conserving as much water as
    possible in situ so that crops can escape moisture stress during the growing period
    (Jat et al., 2004). In addition to in situ moisture conservation, efforts need
    to be made to divert the surplus water into storage structures which can be used
    either as standalone resource or in conjunction with groundwater for meeting the
    critical irrigation requirements. In relatively high rainfall regions, the strategy
    is to conserve as much rainwater as possible and to harvest the surplus water
    for life saving irrigation or for enhancing the cropping intensity and to maximize
    returns from the harvested water. Small-scale water harvesting structures at individual
    farm level enable reuse of harvested water during critical periods of growth stage
    or for providing presowing irrigation to winter crop. Rainwater harvesting and
    recycling through farm ponds, restoration of old rainwater harvesting structures,
    percolation ponds for recharging of open wells, and injection wells for recharging
    groundwater were taken up for enhancing farm level water storage (Prasad et al.,
    2014). Planting methods including ridge and furrow, bed and furrow, and broad
    bed and furrow (BBF) sowing provide opportunities for moisture storage as well
    as draining the excess water in the event of heavy storms thus reducing the impact
    of both the drought as well as intense storms during the cropping season (Patil
    et al., 2010, Praharaj et al., 2011, Mishra et al., 2012). Soil health is the
    key parameter that determines the resilience of crop production under changing
    climate. A number of interventions were taken up to build soil carbon, control
    soil loss due to erosion, and enhance water holding capacity of soils, all of
    which build resilience in soil. Mandatory soil testing was done in all villages
    to ensure balanced use of chemical fertilizers, including improved methods of
    fertilizer application, matching with crop requirement to reduce nitrous oxide
    emission (Srinivasarao et al., 2013b). Particularly in paddy–wheat systems in
    Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, where large quantities of paddy straw
    is commonly burnt after the harvest of paddy, demonstrations were taken up on
    recycling of paddy residues, and wheat sowings by using the zero till planter.
    Recycling of paddy residues followed by zero till wheat cultivation is an important
    intervention and has multiple advantages; namely, reduces the CO2 emissions into
    the environment by avoiding burning of paddy residues, reduces the soil disturbance,
    and saves water and energy for pumping water (Hobbs and Gupta, 2003, Sapkota et
    al., 2015). Opportunities exist for green manuring where irrigation facilities
    are available particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plains region. Green manuring
    reduces the nitrogen requirements for the succeeding crop and enhances the crop
    productivity (Srinivasarao et al., 2014a). Similarly, possibility of introducing
    summer legumes exists in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh after the
    harvest of the wheat crop. Soil test–based fertilizer application is one of the
    important technologies where adequate soil analysis facilities exist (Srinivasarao
    et al., 2011). Application of soil test based–fertilizer helps to minimize the
    excess use of a nutrient, identify deficient nutrients, and optimize the nutrient
    use efficiency (Srinivasarao et al., 2012). Tank silt application is another important
    intervention which can enhance the water holding capacity of the soil and prolong
    the availability of moisture to the crops. Tank silt also contains substantial
    quantities of nutrients and helps to improve the crop growth and yields. Desilting
    of tanks and its application to cultivated fields also enhances the water storage
    capacity of reservoirs or tanks in the villages (Osman et al., 2015). 3.4.3. Horticultural
    Systems Fruit trees can withstand the variability of rainfall better than annual
    crops due to the deep root systems and the perennial growth habit. Diversification
    into fruit tree–based systems generates high returns to the farmer and creates
    opportunities for value addition and avenues for employment creation at the village
    level (Dhyani et al., 2013). Emphasis was placed on identification of suitable
    fruit tree species based on the resource endowments of the region, supplying quality
    planting material, mulching with crop residues and agricultural wastes, efficient
    irrigation systems, capacity building of farmers on these aspects and also on
    the market opportunities, export specifications, opportunities for export, etc.
    3.4.4. Livestock- and Fodder-Based Interventions Livestock-based farming systems
    make significant contribution for livelihood security of farmers particularly
    in arid zone of India. Although arid zones are less suitable for crop production
    due to inherent soil constraints, some grasses and tree species of forage value
    and economic importance can grow well and help in augmenting forage production.
    Interventions in low rainfall regions focused on enhancing the availability of
    fodders and its quality, improving shelter for alleviating the heat stress in
    animals, introducing improved breeds of small ruminants, improving the health
    of animals as better health makes animals more tolerant to climatic stresses (Kinyangi
    et al., 2015), and conserving fodder during the rainy season so that it can be
    used during the dry period. In high rainfall regions, the emphasis was on enhancing
    the productivity of animals and returns from the livestock by cultivation of high
    biomass producing improved fodder varieties for enhancing the green fodder production,
    and efficient recycling of resources by development of farming system–based models.
    Use of community lands for fodder production during droughts/floods, improved
    fodder/feed storage methods, feed supplements, micronutrient use to enhance adaptation
    to heat stress, preventive vaccination, improved shelters for reducing heat/cold
    stress in livestock, and management of fish ponds/tanks both during water scarcity
    and excess water are some key interventions in livestock/fishery sector (Thornton
    and Herrero, 2014). 3.4.5. Poultry- and Fishery-Based Interventions Introduction
    of improved breeds of poultry for various agroclimatic conditions is one of the
    flagship interventions across rainfall regimes. Improved shelter for poultry which
    helps to withstand the high temperatures during the day and protection during
    the night were widely demonstrated. In case of fishery, quality fingerlings, reducing
    the cost of fingerling production by involving the communities in large-scale
    fingerling production, introduction of fish into the existing water bodies, particularly
    in relatively high rainfall regions, creating community institutions for their
    maintenance, operation and benefit sharing, and capacity building are some of
    the common interventions taken up in fisheries. 3.5. Impacts of Climate Resilient
    Interventions Several agricultural practices evolved over time from the NARS can
    reduce the impact of the variable weather on agriculture and can contribute toward
    adaptation to climate change, if deployed prudently. Further, management practices
    that can reduce the yield variability or increase agricultural production under
    variable climate and extreme events can contribute to resilience (Mall et al.,
    2007, Singh et al., 2012). 3.5.1. Crops and System Productivity As agriculture
    particularly in rainfed areas is risky due to weather aberrations and frequent
    droughts, selection of appropriate crops and cultivars based on the biophysical
    and climatic constraints of an area are essential prerequisites for successful
    crop production and for maximizing productivity and profitability. Many criteria
    have been set out for selecting appropriate crop varieties for rainfed areas and
    some of them are of short duration, drought tolerance and the capacity to produce
    reasonable yields under limited soil moisture conditions (Webber et al., 2014).
    Selection of appropriate crops, varieties, and systems such as mono cropping,
    intercropping, sequence cropping, etc. for a location can be effectively made
    based on the analysis of long-term climatic data in terms of probability of the
    onset and withdrawal of monsoon, occurrence of dry spells, and the soil moisture
    supplying capacity (Udmale et al., 2014). 3.5.1.1. Resilient Crops and Stress-Tolerant
    Varieties Drought, which indicates scarcity of water for ecosystems consequently
    soil moisture deficit, affects crops, livestock, livelihoods, and human health,
    and affects more people than any other climatic variability in India. Drought
    occurring at different stages in crop development in different soil types and
    under various management regimes affects crop growth differently; hence, patterns
    of drought occurrence may require different sets of adaptive traits (Srinivasarao
    and Gopinath, 2016). Among the various options for addressing climate variability,
    improved cultivars play an important role in stabilizing productivity in rainfed
    environments (Reddy et al., 2014). In view of the frequent occurrence of drought,
    several short-duration cultivars were assessed for their suitability in various
    drought prone regions of the country. In regions receiving low rainfall (<750
    mm), the cropping season is restricted to 10–14 weeks and the delay in the onset
    of the monsoon and early withdrawal are the most commonly occurring contingencies
    limiting the crop production (Niranjan Kumar et al., 2013). Short-duration varieties
    which can complete life cycle within the growing period of a region can escape
    drought during early withdrawal of monsoon and can also be grown under delayed
    onset of monsoon conditions as an adaptation strategy. For example, Rajkot district
    in Gujarat state receives 660 mm of rainfall annually with irregular distribution
    and midseason droughts in July and August resulting in lower yields of traditional
    spreading-type groundnut varieties which are of 120 days duration. Bunch-type
    high yielding groundnut cultivars were introduced (GG-5, TG-38, GG-20) which are
    short in duration (95–100 days) and performed better under late planted conditions
    with 10–15% higher yield than that of traditional varieties of groundnut. Similarly,
    in black soil (Vertisols) regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Kota district
    of Rajasthan, soybean is an important crop cultivated in about 9 Mha with significant
    area under JS-335 variety which is of 110–115 days duration. Due to delay in onset
    of monsoon in recent years, planting of soybean is extended up to first fortnight
    of July and the crop at maturity stage is vulnerable to late season dry spells.
    Hence, a short-duration variety JS-93-05 (95–100 days) in Maharashtra, and JS-95-60
    (85–95 days) in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were introduced which gave 15–20%
    higher yield compared to the farmers’ practice (Prasad et al., 2014) (Table 6).

    and drought-tolerant varieties of pigeon pea (BDN-708), green gram (BM 2002-1),
    and chick pea (Digvijay and Vijay) were introduced on selected farmers’ fields
    in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra (rainfall of 645 mm), which gave 20–25%
    higher yield than the local varieties. Similarly, drought-tolerant, short-duration
    varieties of sorghum (CSH-14) and pigeon pea (AKT-8811) were introduced in the
    villages of Amravati district, Maharashtra (rainfall of 877 mm). Sorghum and pigeon
    pea gave about 60 and 37% higher yields, respectively compared to local varieties
    (Reddy et al., 2014) (Table 7). Table 7. Yield improvements in farmers’ fields

    by authors from different sources. In black gram, Azad Urd-1, a high yielding
    and YMV-resistant short-duration variety (65 days) was demonstrated on 50 ha in
    Tikamgarh (rainfall 846 mm), Madhya Pradesh which gave 14–20% higher yield than
    that of the local variety. Short-duration variety of green gram (TARM-1) (60–65
    days), tolerant to yellow vein mosaic disease, and K-851, a short-duration variety
    of green gram (65–70 days), were demonstrated in Odisha and realized higher yields
    to the extent of 43% compared to local cultivars despite rainfall shortages during
    crop growth in 2013. In high rainfall regions of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West
    Bengal, Assam, and Northeast India with more than 1000 mm rainfall, paddy is the
    predominant crop and staple food of the communities and long-duration crop varieties
    are generally grown which mature in 180 days. Rainfed and less water consuming
    paddy systems in vogue such as puddled transplanted, direct seeded, dry seeded
    rice etc. are significantly influenced by the delay in onset, prolonged breaks,
    and early withdrawal of monsoon affecting paddy production in these regions (Soora
    et al., 2013). Short-duration and drought-tolerant varieties of rice which can
    withstand up to 2 weeks of exposure to dry spells in rainfed areas were demonstrated
    to manage rainfall variability. Some of the drought-tolerant rice cultivars demonstrated
    were Sahbhagi dhan which is of 105–110 days duration in plain areas and 110–115
    days in uplands of Jharkhand state, Naveen (115–120 days) in Odisha, and Anjali
    (90 days) for Jharkhand (Prasad et al., 2014). Other early maturing varieties
    in the eastern states of India such as Birsa Vikas Dhan 109 (85 days), Abhishek
    (120 days) were also assessed. Average yield obtained in farmers’ fields with
    Sahbhagi dhan was 3.5 t/ha with a yield advantage of 26% over traditional long-duration
    variety in seasons that experienced deficit rainfall situation as in 2013 at Jehanabad,
    Aurangabad, Buxar, Saran, and Supaul districts in Bihar; Koderma, Palamu, and
    Gumla districts in Jharkhand; and Jharsuguda district in Odisha, whereas average
    yield of Anjali variety was 4.1 t/ha with a yield advantage of 41% in Gumla and
    Chatra districts of Jharkhand in 2013 during which these districts received a
    deficit rainfall of 15% during the monsoon season. Yield advantage with these
    varieties in drought years ranged between 8% and 38% as compared to the existing
    practice of growing long-duration varieties which often get affected due to drought
    resulting in lower yields (Kumar et al., 2014, Prasad et al., 2014). Long-duration
    varieties of pigeon pea which mature in 220–250 days suffer from drought during
    the cropping period due to irregular rainfall distribution and also frost during
    December–January in some regions of northern India. Short-duration pigeon pea
    varieties of 130–140 days duration, not only escape drought and frost but also
    provide opportunities for taking up succeeding crop during the postrainy season
    (December–April) in some of the potentially double cropping areas of northern
    India. Cropping intensification with two short-duration crops in sequence is an
    important resilience measure as income from at least one of the crop is assured
    even under variable climatic situations (Campbell et al., 2014). As chick pea
    is largely grown during postrainy season with the receding soil moisture in Vertisols
    of Central India, short-duration varieties have distinct advantage as they complete
    their life cycle much before the soil moisture gets exhausted thus escaping terminal
    drought situations (Udmale et al., 2014). Short-duration varieties of chick pea
    (GNG-663, GJG-3, JG-11, and Digvijay) were demonstrated during the postrainy season
    of 2013 and 2014 in the villages of Rajkot, Jhunjhunu, Morena, Baramati, and Aurangabad
    districts which receive rainfall of 400–700 mm. Improvement in yields was 30–35%
    than that of traditional varieties of the region (Table 6). In some of the districts
    of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, significant area is affected with increased salinity.
    Introduction of salt-tolerant wheat varieties, KRL-213 and KRL-210 resulted in
    uniform germination and good crop stand producing a yield of 3.4 and 3.9 t/ha,
    respectively, which was higher by 31 and 40% over the farmers’ practice (Prasad
    et al., 2015). 3.5.1.2. Flood-Tolerant Paddy Varieties Flooding associated with
    intense rains and cyclonic activity with overflow of rivers and canals are the
    major constraints for rice production in the country particularly in the eastern,
    northeastern, and coastal regions, and in some of the flood plains of the rivers
    such as Ganges, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna etc. High-intensity storms and
    associated high-speed winds lead to water logging, inundation of paddy fields
    and lodging of the crop at grain filling and maturity stages causing significant
    crop loss. The problem is accentuated due to flat topography with poor drainage
    and siltation of existing drainage channels resulting in impedance of fast drainage
    from crop lands (Sarkar et al., 2009). Apart from improving the drainage and other
    preventive measures, adoption of flood-tolerant varieties which can withstand
    inundation for an extended period can reduce the risk from flood damage and minimize
    losses (Dar et al., 2013). Rice varieties, Swarna-sub1, MTU-1010, MTU-1001, and
    MTU-1140 are high yielding with good grain quality apart from possessing submergence
    tolerance and can perform better under flooded situation. Swarna-sub1 was demonstrated
    in flood-prone villages in Nimpith and Cooch Behar districts in West Bengal; Supaul
    and Jehanabad in Bihar; Kushinagar, Maharajganj, and Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh
    which gave an average yield of 4.4 t/ha with a yield advantage of 40% compared
    to the traditional varieties (Prasad et al., 2014). MTU-1010 and MTU-1140 are
    short-duration, dwarf varieties that can tolerate lodging, withstand moderate
    wind velocity, and also possess long and slender grain quality. Varieties such
    as Indra(MTU-1061) with a seed dormancy of 2–3 weeks was non-lodging and tolerant
    to inundation up to 10 days (Fig. 16). In regions where depth of water was more
    than 1 m and duration of flooding was more than 10 days submergence-tolerant varieties,
    such as Jalashree and Jalkuwari produced about 53% higher grain yield compared
    to traditional rice varieties in Dhubri district, Assam (Table 8). Download :

    3.5.1.3. Resilient Cropping Systems In scarce rainfall zones of India, practice
    of sole cropping is predominant but is risky and often results in low yields or
    sometimes even in crop failure due to erratic monsoon rainfall and skewed distribution.
    Intercropping is a potential option to minimize risk in crop production, ensure
    reasonable returns at least from one of the intercrops during the years of low
    rainfall and also to maximize returns during the years of favorable rainfall,
    utilize the natural resources such as light and moisture effectively, and contribute
    to the soil fertility build up (Ghosh et al., 2006). Intercropping systems with
    the predominant crops of the region were assessed in various drought-prone regions
    of the country. Intercropping of foxtail millet with pigeon pea (5:1 ratio) sown
    under delayed onset of monsoon conditions showed that the system was more profitable
    with highest B:C ratio (5.1 compared to 1.5–2.6 in sole cropping) in all the 3
    years and can also tolerate dry spell up to 25 days without impacting yields (Fig.
    17). Intercropping of soybean + pigeon pea (4:2), pearl millet + pigeon pea (3:3),
    pigeon pea + green gram (1:2), and cotton + green gram (1:1) performed significantly
    better than respective sole crops at Aurangabad, Maharashtra which receives an
    average rainfall of 645 mm (Prasad et al., 2015). In regions receiving rainfall
    of more than 750 mm, intercropping systems of groundnut + pigeon pea (4:1) at
    Gumla, pigeon pea + black gram (2:4) and pigeon pea + pearl millet (3:3) at Koderma,
    outperformed the sole crops. Among rabi (winter) crops, intercropping of sorghum
    + chick pea (6:3) performed well compared to farmers’ practice of sole cropping
    of either crops at Belgaum (Table 9, Table 10). Download : Download full-size

    Management in Various Rainfall Regions of India The strategy of water management
    consists of selection of short-duration and low water requiring crops and conserving
    as much rainwater as possible so that crops can escape moisture stress during
    the growing period particularly in the rainfed regions. In irrigated regions,
    focus is on efficient utilization of water, reducing the application losses, enhancing
    the water use efficiency, and maximizing the returns from applied water. Conjunctive
    use of rain water and irrigation water offers one of the best options for optimizing
    water use in water scarce regions for better crop production (Pandey et al., 2003).
    In rainfed regions, the focus is on in situ conservation measures as these measures
    help in even distribution of rainwater in the field and prolong the availability
    of moisture to the crop thus minimizing the impact of water scarcity on crop growth
    (Fig. 18). In situ moisture conservation practices require relatively less resources
    and hence, smallholders can effectively implement these practices with less cost
    (Srinivasarao et al., 2015). Download : Download full-size image Figure 18. Various
    water management strategies implemented in CRVs of India. 3.5.1.5. In Situ Moisture
    Conservation Measures in Different Rainfall Regions In situ water harvesting using
    simple technologies enables greater water infiltration, temporarily impounds water
    on the surface of the soil to increase the opportunity time for infiltration,
    prolongs the availability of moisture to the crop, and enables crop to survive
    under variable rainfall conditions (Srinivasarao and Gopinath, 2016). Good in
    situ soil and water conservation practices improve soil porosity, increase infiltration
    and soil hydraulic conductivity, and consequently increase soil water storage
    and promote crop growth (Srinivasarao et al., 2016a). Emphasis was given to in
    situ measures such as conservation furrows, bunding, land leveling, compartmental
    bunding, sowing across the slope, ridge and furrow, trench cum bunding, contour
    farming, etc. (Fig. 19). Selection of appropriate soil and water conservation
    measure for a location depends on the amount and the distribution of rainfall,
    slope and soil type, depth and texture, especially the clay content and clay type,
    which greatly influence water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity impacting
    runoff and soil erosion (Pathak et al., 2005). Download : Download full-size image
    Figure 19. In situ moisture conservation through bunding (A), trench cum bunding
    (B), ridge and furrow (C), and contour cultivation (D). Adoption of conservation
    furrows at specified interval in a crop was helpful to improve the soil moisture
    availability at the root zone and eventually increased the productivity of crops
    by 15–20% in dry regions of the country compared to the traditional practices
    of farmers. Formation of conservation furrow in between rows of castor, cotton,
    and pigeon pea improved the crop productivity by 11–15% compared to the farmers’
    practice of without furrow across various locations in peninsular India receiving
    less than 750 mm of rainfall (Table 11). Table 11. Impact of in situ water conservation

    in Vertisols of Madhya Pradesh receiving less than 750 mm rainfall as an in situ
    moisture conservation and planting method in different crops like pigeon pea,
    black gram, green gram, and soybean. Crops performed better under ridge and furrow
    method of sowing and the seed yields increased by 22% in pigeon pea, 28% in black
    gram, 39% in green gram, and 27% in soybean when compared to farmers’ practice
    of flat bed method of sowing across several locations. In Alfisols of peninsular
    India which receive a rainfall of less than 750 mm, in situ soil moisture conservation
    through ridge and furrow planting in black gram, green gram, and soybean resulted
    in a yield of 0.5, 0.6, and 1.3 t/ha, respectively, despite prolonged dry spells
    during the crop season in 2014. Similarly, ridge and furrow planting of soybean
    in Datia district of Madhya Pradesh gave a yield of 1.1 t/ha compared to 0.8 t/ha
    in conventional practice. Land leveling and compartmental bunding resulted in
    15–20% higher yield of finger millet compared to without leveling and bunding.
    Trench cum bunding was taken up at several locations which were found to improve
    the crop yields by 12–30% over without bunding. During intense rainfall events,
    most of the top soil from the cultivated fields was retained in the trenches leading
    to conserving fertile top soil in trenches and allowing safe disposal of excess
    rainwater. The soil trapped due to trench cum bunding was in the range of 11.5–21.2
    m3/acre per year and farmers could save the valuable top soil being eroded from
    their fields. Similarly, in situ moisture conservation measures like ploughing
    across the slope and contour bunding increased the crop yields by 12–22% over
    no bunding. Tank silt (fine soil particles deposited in tanks) application was
    done for improving water holding capacity and productivity of soils which increased
    the yields of finger millet by 16–22% over no tank silt application. In high rainfall
    regions receiving rainfall of more than 1000 mm, moisture conservation through
    mulching especially in high value vegetable crops helped to overcome drought-like
    situations where the second crop was grown with both the residual moisture and
    harvested water during the postrainy season. This enabled less weed growth, pest
    infestation, and less water application, thereby increasing the crop yield and
    water productivity. Crops such as broccoli, tomato, capsicum, etc. were some of
    the high value crops grown with the harvested water which provided higher returns
    to the farmers even though the volume of production was less due to less quantity
    of the harvested water. Similarly, in high rainfall regions such as Khagribari
    village of Cooch Behar district of West Bengal which receives a rainfall of 2983
    mm, raised bed cultivation of cucumber with plastic mulching gave higher yield
    (29.1 t/ha) compared to flat bed cultivation (26.2 t/ha) due to favorable soil
    moisture and temperature conditions (Table 11). 3.5.1.6. Effect of Supplemental
    Irrigation on Crop Yields in Various Rainfall Regions The importance of rainwater
    harvesting has increased in recent years due to the increased rainfall variability
    and depletion of groundwater levels. Rainwater harvesting in farm pond, check
    dam, percolation tank, recharge pits, and wells with recharging structures enables
    to collect excess runoff during high intensity rains, facilitates groundwater
    recharge, and thus provides opportunity to farmers to give supplemental irrigation
    to crops during deficient monsoon season and also opportunities for double cropping
    depending on the availability of water (Fig. 20). Download : Download full-size

    Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu, receives annual rainfall of 400 mm, has undulating
    topography, and experiences frequent droughts during crop growing season. Desilting
    has increased the storage capacity of village tanks by 36,617 m3 which further
    resulted in recharging of 22 bore wells, 10 open wells and increased groundwater
    table by 2–2.5 m, met the drinking water needs of livestock during summer months,
    provided opportunities for supplemental irrigation to crops such as groundnut,
    sorghum, and onion in 137 ha, and improved the crop yields by 20–30% during 2012–14.
    In the village of Kutch district, which receives an annual rainfall of 360 mm,
    renovation of defunct check dams resulted in enhancing the water storage capacity
    to the extent of 5000 m3 and contributed to recharge of adjoining wells. Utilization
    of this harvested water with drip method of irrigation increased crop yields by
    15–26% during 2013. In D. Nagenahalli village of Tumakuru district of Karnataka,
    which receives annual rainfall less than 700 mm, intensive rainwater harvesting
    was taken up involving about 72 new farm ponds, 5 check dams, 13 percolation ponds,
    4 cement/plastic lined storage structures, 15 renovated farm ponds, 8 renovated
    check dams, 2 renovated community tanks, desilting and widening of catchment channel
    for enhancing the water storage capacity of the village tank to harvest as much
    water as possible and to saturate the village with water harvesting structures
    and provide access to harvested water for every farmer in the village. This resulted
    in creating a water harvesting potential of 196,560 m3. Seventeen out of 32 open
    wells and 11 out of 29 bore wells were recharged due to creation of water harvesting
    structures. The water harvested in these structures increased the area under irrigation
    by 75 ha of the village out of the total cultivated area of 190 ha and contributed
    to increase in cropping intensity to 139%. Efficient methods of irrigation such
    as sprinkler and drip methods resulted in reducing the application losses and
    enhanced the income of farmers through high value crops with optimum use of harvested
    water (Sharma and Sharma, 2015). The quantum of water harvested in low rainfall
    regions depends on the catchment area, the intensity, distribution of the rainfall,
    and the capacity of the water harvesting structures. The benefits from these structures
    can be maximized by sharing the precious water and selection of high value crops.
    In regions receiving rainfall of more than 750 mm, several options for harvesting
    and storing of rainfall such as farm ponds, check dams, percolation tanks exist
    which can be effectively used for coping with droughts by providing supplemental
    irrigation. One of the low cost methods is polybag check dam which can be taken
    up at multiple locations in the stream to augment the water storage. The augmented
    groundwater in wells was used for providing lifesaving irrigation to soybean and
    groundnut during pod formation stage in 71 ha, which enhanced the crop yields
    by 26–32% with an additional net return of Rs. 5000–8000 per hectare in a village
    which receives a rainfall of 743 mm in Datia district of Madhya Pradesh. The harvested
    rainwater was also used for providing presowing irrigation to postrainy season
    crops such as mustard and chick pea (Table 12). Table 12. Impact of water harvesting

    Source: Compiled by authors from different sources. In regions receiving rainfall
    of about 1000 mm or more, though the total amount of rainfall received is sufficient
    for crop growth and production, crops suffer from moisture stress due to erratic
    distribution of the monsoon. Small-scale harvesting structures at individual farm
    level enabled farmers’ to use the harvested water during critical periods of crop
    growth and in some cases second crop was taken by providing presowing irrigation.
    For example, in Gumla district of Jharkhand, which receives a rainfall of 1450
    mm, a sand bag dam across the seasonal rivulet augmented water storage significantly
    in the stream and lifting of this water for irrigation provided opportunity for
    double and triple cropping. In the same village, during 2012, about 50 ha were
    brought under wheat cultivation during the postrainy season which was about 10%
    of the total cultivated area of the village. During 2013, about 89 farmers cultivated
    wheat in 50 ha area which gave a yield of 3.2 t/ha. With this guaranteed water
    source, some of the farmers opted for cultivation of high value crops such as
    vegetables which further improved their incomes. In much of eastern India, with
    the rainfall of 1000 mm and above, rice is grown under rainfed conditions. Delay
    in the onset of monsoon often affects the transplanting resulting in overaging
    of the seedlings which reduces the crop yields. Water harvesting and storage in
    the villages helped in use of harvested water for taking up field operations timely
    so that the transplanting operation does not get delayed. During 2014–15, though
    the onset of monsoon was delayed by almost 15 days, farmers in East Singhbhum
    district of Jharkhand prepared their nursery, puddled the main field, and took
    up transplanting of rice using harvested water. In hilly areas of Central and
    Eastern Himalayas, with rainfall during rainy season >1500 mm, water scarcity
    is a major problem particularly during offseason. In West Garo Hills, the Jalkund
    (traditional farm pond) of dimension 5 × 4 × 1.5 m with silpaulin as lining material
    created a storage capacity of 30 m3 of harvested water during rainy season which
    was used for providing critical irrigation during dry spells in winter vegetables
    like cabbage, cauliflower, and tomato and farmer realized a total net income of
    over Rs. 0.1 million during 2014. 3.5.1.7. Improved Planting Methods in Various
    Rainfall Regions Improved planting method reduces the velocity of runoff water,
    increases the opportunity time for water to infiltrate and spread in the soil
    profile, and reduces sediment losses. Improved planting methods also play a major
    role in providing opportunity for safe disposal of excess water in deep black
    soils where the rate of infiltration is low (Patil et al., 2010, Praharaj et al.,
    2011, Mishra et al., 2012). Formation of BBF in soybean in Vertisols of Central
    India served as conservation as well as for draining excess water and increased
    yields to the extent of 23% and also enhanced net benefit by Rs. 6223 per hectare
    than that of flat method of sowing. Demonstrations on BBF method of soybean planting
    in farmers’ fields of Datia district of Madhya Pradesh gave about 15–20% higher
    yield compared to the farmers’ practice. Similarly, BBF method of sowing resulted
    in postrainy season sorghum yield of 1.3 t/ha compared to 0.4 t/ha in control
    plots (Table 13). Table 13. Impact of planting methods on crop yields in various

    North Indian states, wheat sowing by conventional methods requires two to three
    tillage operations to prepare a fine seedbed after harvesting of paddy crop which
    costs both time and money for the farmers. A delay in sowing of wheat may result
    in coinciding of wheat maturity with high temperature which will have a bearing
    on yields. Providing irrigation after the harvest of paddy and subsequent tillage
    and seedbed preparation requires at least 15 days’ time and leads to delay in
    sowings. Zero tillage allows timely sowing of wheat, enables uniform drilling
    of seed, improves fertilizer use efficiency, saves water, and increases yield
    up to 20% (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Zero till sowing using the seed drill also
    enables wheat sowing in residues of paddy and can reduce the need for burning
    which can minimize the emissions of GHGs due to burning of paddy residues (Sapkota
    et al., 2015). Zero tillage wheat sowing with paddy residues was demonstrated
    in several wheat growing states of India, such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh,
    and Madhya Pradesh. Zero tillage planting reduced the cost of cultivation by Rs.
    3760 per hectare, increased grain yield by 5–6%, reduced weed infestation due
    to the presence of straw mulch, and saved water and energy in comparison to the
    conventional method of wheat sowing. Wheat sowing with Happy Seeder provided an
    alternative to burning of paddy residues and allowed direct drilling of wheat
    seed in standing as well as loose residues thus effectively reducing the emissions
    to the extent of 5.71 t CO2 per hectare per year (Hobbs and Gupta, 2003, Sapkota
    et al., 2015). 3.5.1.8. Foliar Sprays to Mitigate Midseason Drought Foliar nutrition
    is often timed to meet the demand of nutrients at specific crop growth stages
    to aid plants in recovering from transplant shock, drought, hail damage, and other
    damaging environmental conditions. Foliar fertilization supplements, macro- and
    micronutrients, plant hormones, stimulants, and other beneficial substances are
    found to increase crop yields, impart tolerance to diseases and insect pests,
    drought, and enhance crop quality. Urea is one of the most common N sources used
    for foliar applications because it is highly soluble, inexpensive, and has a relatively
    low potential of injuring foliage (Bowman and Paul, 1992). Foliar spray of 2%
    KCl at flowering stage in rapeseed increased yields by 51% over no spray (499
    kg/ha) at Biswanath Chariali. Similarly, spray of KNO3 (twice) recorded 12–25%
    higher yields of cotton and soybean compared to no foliar spray (Table 14). Table

    3.5.2. Household Income and Livelihood 3.5.2.1. Integrated Farming System Models
    for Enhanced Resilience The household, its resources and the resource flows, and
    interactions at the individual farm levels are together referred to as a farm
    system (FAO, 2001) and the proportion and the arrangement of farming enterprises
    depends on physical, biological, and socioeconomic environment and in accordance
    with farmer''s goals, preferences, and resources (Shanwad et al., 2015). No single
    farm enterprise is likely to sustain the small and marginal farmers without resorting
    to integrated farming systems (IFSs) for the generation of adequate income, gainful
    employment year round, and minimizing the risk in farming. Hence, it is necessary
    to integrate different enterprises like livestock, poultry, duckery, apiary, field,
    and horticultural crops, etc. within the biophysical and socioeconomic environment
    of the farmers to make farming more profitable and reduce risk in farming particularly
    under smallholder situation (Das et al., 2014, Shanwad et al., 2015). Diversification
    of farming activities improves the utilization of labor, reduces unemployment
    in areas where there is a surplus of underutilized labor, and provides a source
    of living for those households that operate their farm as a full time occupation.
    The farming systems approach is considered as important and relevant especially
    for the small and marginal farmers as location-specific IFS will be more resilient
    and adaptive to climate variability (Gopinath et al., 2012). Livelihood diversification
    opportunities were explored and demonstrated by adopting location-specific IFS
    models combining small enterprises such as crop, livestock, poultry, piggery,
    fish and duck rearing in several districts. In regions with rainfall of 500–700
    mm, the focus of the farming systems was on livestock with promotion of low water
    requiring grasses, trees, and bushes to meet fodder, fuel, and timber requirements
    of the farmers. In some of the low rainfall regions, such as Datia in Madhya Pradesh,
    IFS model with a farm pond was demonstrated for efficient utilization of harvested
    rainwater to cultivate field crops, vegetables, and dairy and fish production.
    Fish fingerlings of Catla, Rohu, Mrigal, and grass carp were introduced into the
    pond. A net return from the IFS model was Rs. 52,000 per year. About 50% of the
    cost of dugout pond could be recovered in the first year. In 700–1100 mm rainfall
    regions, crop-, horticulture-, and livestock-based farming systems are introduced
    depending on the soil type and the market demand. In areas where the rainfall
    is more than 1100 mm, IFS module integrating paddy with fisheries is ideal and
    can harness synergies among the components of the system and give significantly
    higher returns in comparison to the arable cropping alone (Fig. 21). Download
    : Download full-size image Figure 21. Integrated farming systems (IFSs) models
    for household food, livelihood, and ecological sustainability. In Bhongeri village
    of South 24 Parganas district (rainfall >1000 mm), which is frequently affected
    by TC, through land shaping treatment monocropped paddy area was converted to
    an area with multiple cropping options in addition to transforming into an IFS
    model. In the lowland paddy fields which were prone to water logging, 20% area
    was excavated to create a dugout pond of 8–9 ft. depth. The excavated soil was
    spread in the main field with embankments and improved short-duration rice cultivars
    in kharif and vegetables were grown during rabi which significantly enhanced the
    income from crop diversification. Fish and duck rearing was taken up in the dugout
    pond resulting in a revenue of Rs. 60,200 per hectare per year which was significantly
    higher than that of sole arable cropping. In high rainfall regions of eastern
    India (West Bengal and Odisha) and Kerala in South India introduction of composite
    fish farming significantly increased the income. Six fish species namely, Catla,
    Rohu, Mrigal, Silver Carp, Grass Carp, and Common Carp were stocked in the tank
    for 8 months which gave a net return of Rs. 82,580 per hectare (Table 15). Table

    Breeds of Livestock Climate change has posed new challenges to the sustainability
    of livestock production system with serious implications to smallholders. The
    availability of natural resources that support livestock is sensitive to climate
    change thus impacting the productivity of livestock. In developing countries,
    livestock are important for contributing to the resilience of small and marginal
    farmers through risk minimization. Besides, livestock offers multiple benefits
    such as a source of protein, organic manure, and income to poor and marginal farmers.
    However, improving productivity of livestock including small ruminants (sheep
    and goats) under smallholder farming systems is faced with challenges of unfavorable
    climatic events. As the productivity of the indigenous breeds is low and they
    often show poor recovery from drought and disease, changes to the breeds and rearing
    practice can help adapt better to the climatic variability and with greater productivity
    (Kinyangi et al., 2015). Improved breeds of goat such as Sirohi (Ahmednagar, Aurangabad,
    and Nandurbar districts), Jamunapari and Lalitpuri (Datia), and sheep such as
    Tellicherry and Nari Suvarna (Namakkal) were introduced in the villages. Improved
    breeds of pig such as Hampshire Cross, Ghungroo, Duric, and White Yorkshire were
    introduced in the northeast districts of the country where pig is an important
    component of the farming system. Initially, breed improvement was focused in small
    ruminants as it takes less time and labor to raise them compared to large cattle,
    and the meat and milk gains of small ruminants far exceed cattle because they
    have shorter reproductive cycles and maximize the available grass and fodder use
    from grazing sheep and browsing goats. Stress-tolerant and productive breeds of
    poultry were introduced in villages including breeds of Vanaraja and Gramapriya
    (Dimapur, Dibrugarh, East Sikkim, Lunglei, Ri-Bhoi, Senapati, Cooch Behar), Rajashree
    (Anantapur), Kalinga Brown (Cachar), Chabro (Jhansi), and Kadaknath (Balaghat)

    With Improved Cultivars Adequate availability of fodder, either green or dry,
    is one of the limiting factors for enhancing the productivity of the livestock
    particularly in rainfed areas during the lean season (offseason) of fodder availability
    that is, December–May (Sati and Singh, 2010). Introduction of livestock in the
    regions should go hand in hand with ensuring fodder availability particularly
    in drought prone districts in southern and western parts of India. Short- and
    medium-duration fodder cultivars of several crops for both rainy and postrainy
    seasons and perennial fodder crops were introduced in farmers’ fields under rainfed
    conditions with limited irrigation to enhance the fodder production and income
    from the animal component. For example, in Sakrorha village of Jehanabad, with
    rainfall of 439 mm during June–September which was about 46% of the normal rainfall
    of 839 mm in 2014, interventions were taken up with livestock farmers on cultivation
    of fodder sorghum and pearl millet during the rainy season, and oats (JHO 822)
    and berseem (Vardan) in postrainy season. Increase in availability of quality
    fodder throughout the year improved the milk production by 39% and farmer''s income
    was increased by Rs. 70 per day per animal. In salt affected regions of Baramati
    district, Maharashtra, introduction of salt-tolerant marvel grass (Dichanthium
    annulatum Forssk.) Phule Govardhan resulted in 29% increase in biomass over fodder
    sorghum under deficit rainfall conditions (Prasad et al., 2015) (Table 17). Table

    available during the dry period (December–May) is an important intervention for
    sustaining the productivity of livestock in CRVs. Silage making of green fodder
    was introduced in perennially drought prone districts of Maharashtra. Silage making
    using polybags, plastic drum sand silo pits was demonstrated for crops like fodder
    maize, giant pearl millet, and multicut fodder sorghum. The practice saved costs
    toward purchase of green fodder from the market while increasing the income by
    Rs. 0.04 million by way of increase in milk yield and thus stabilized household
    income of farmer during worst drought affected years. In Yagantipalle village
    of Kurnool, ensiled chopped green fodder from maize in silage bags of 500 kg capacity
    sufficient to feed one milch animal @ 5 kg/day resulted in increase in milk yield
    by 15.5% compared to the farmers’ practice of feeding only dry fodder (Prasad
    et al., 2015). Addressing the deficiency of specific nutrients and providing balanced
    feed contributed to improved animal health besides milk productivity. In Sitara
    village of Bharatpur district, balanced ration coupled with feeding of urea molasses
    bricks and mineral mixture supplementation increased milk yield by 15–20%. The
    practice was then adopted by several other cattle owners in the adjoining villages
    leading to increase in milk production to the extent of 5 L/day per animal (Table
    18). Table 18. Improvement in income due to use of mineral mixture/urea molasses

    for Livestock and Small Ruminants Proper housing buffers the animal from climate
    extremes particularly heat stress, rainstorm, cyclone, cold wave etc. allowing
    optimal animal performance in terms of growth, health, and reproduction. A semiintensive
    system of rearing of goats in a slatted floor with proper roof to provide shelter
    to the animals was adopted to tackle heat stress during summer when temperature
    often reaches 46°C in western and southern regions of the country and also to
    protect the animals from rainstorms during monsoon. Locally available wooden planks
    were used for making slatted floor. The roof of the shelter was made with bamboo
    and covered with either thatched material or coarse cereal crop residues which
    are locally available. This model of a semiintensive system of rearing of goats
    in a slatted floor was demonstrated in Vadhavathur village at Namakkal, Tamil
    Nadu. Due to the gap between the slats, collection of fecal material was easy
    and there was no accumulation of ammonia in the shed during rainy and winter seasons.
    The problem of spread of coccidiosis and tape worm infestation to healthy animals
    was controlled to a great extent. This resulted in decreased mortality from 10%
    to 2% and expenditure for treatment of affected animals was also avoided. The
    live weight gain of animals was enhanced from 60–70 to 78–86 g per day as a result
    of protection from heat stress. Such locally made shelter management systems were
    introduced in several districts namely, Khammam (Telangana), Srikakulam (Andhra
    Pradesh), Kota and Jodhpur (Rajasthan), Kutch (Gujarat), West Tripura (Tripura),
    Mokokchung (Nagaland), West Garo Hills (Meghalaya), Lunglei (Mizoram), Phek (Nagaland),
    Jehanabad and Saran (Bihar), Namakkal (Tamil Nadu) etc. 3.5.2.6. Housing for Backyard
    Poultry Backyard poultry farming requires less inputs and is affordable by the
    poor farmers, and its high return on investment is known to improve the farmers’
    living standards (Patel et al., 2014). Backyard poultry farming is an inseparable
    part of rural households in the Northeast region as it plays an important role
    in improving the economic status and fulfilling the protein requirement thus contributing
    to the food and nutritional security of the households (Khadait et al., 2011).
    In Kyrdem village of Ri-Bhoi, Meghalaya about 32 farmers adopted 20 birds each
    of Vanaraja breed. Farmers were advised on low-cost poultry housing made from
    locally available materials like bamboo and thatch grass. The low-cost housing
    improved survival of birds, their weight gain, and egg production compared to
    local breeds without housing. In Jehanabad (Bihar), low-cost portable poultry
    housing for heat tolerance was made using sand, mud, grass, and paddy husk. Birds
    were kept in the mud house during the day time to prevent heat stress and protection
    from predators. In Amravati district of Maharashtra, backyard poultry cages provided
    to the farmers protected the birds from direct winds, sunlight, and rain and mortality
    rate was reduced by 21%. In East Sikkim, a brooder house was made using locally
    available materials such as bamboo and wood and optimum night temperature was
    maintained in the shelter with the help of light bulbs during cold stress period.
    Breed improvement was also made with the introduction Vanaraja chicks. 3.5.2.7.
    Fish Rearing—A Livelihood Opportunity in Flood Prone Area Climate change impacts
    on various fish species include decrease in habitat area through a number of mechanisms,
    with temperature having a dominant effect among various environmental factors
    which may not necessarily operate independently with the possibility of synergy
    or interactions between factors. Captive rearing of fish seed that is, rearing
    of early stages (spawn to fry and fry to fingerling stages) through appropriate
    feed and health management in nursery pond was demonstrated in Sirusuwada village,
    Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh. Fishermen of Sirusuwada village practiced
    fresh water fish culture during August–September in community tank. Earlier these
    farmers used to stock the tank with fish seed at fry stage of 2–3-cm size resulting
    in poor survival and inappropriate stocking ratios. During 2013–14, about 25,000
    numbers of fish seed at fry stage were released in nursery pond. Rearing to fingerling
    size was done for 29 days and then harvested to release into the village tank.
    This intervention saved about Rs. 10,500 on cost of fish seed, and farmers of
    entire village adopted the intervention (Prasad et al., 2014). In many districts
    of high rainfall regions, fish component was included in IFSs including rice–fish
    system, fish rearing in farm ponds, community tanks in the villages etc. This
    resulted in regular income, household nutrition, and overall livelihood security
    of farming community in CRVs. 3.5.3. Environmental Services Various climate resilient
    interventions being taken up in CRVs across the country to address the climatic
    vulnerabilities can also contribute to the reduction in the GHG emissions and
    to the carbon balance in the village. Reducing the GHG emissions from agriculture
    and increasing the carbon sequestration not only has positive benefits on agricultural
    productivity, enhancing resource use efficiency and soil quality but also has
    associated mitigating effect on climate change (Srinivasarao et al., 2016b). For
    every ton per hectare increase in SOC stock in the root zone, there was an increase
    in grain yield (kilogram per hectare) of 13 for groundnut, 101 for finger millet,
    90 for sorghum, 170 for pearl millet, 145 for soybean, 18 for lentil, and 160
    for rice under rainfed agroecosystems of India (Srinivasarao et al., 2013b, Srinivasarao
    et al., 2014b). Quantification of carbon balance in the CRVs due to various resilient
    practices is important to assess the quantum of emission reductions and enhancement
    of carbon sinks from the agriculture and the allied sectors, without compromising
    on the food production. Ex-Ante Carbon balance Tool (EX-ACT) developed by FAO
    based on the IPCC default values was used to study the impact of resilient management
    practices on carbon balance in the CRVs. EX-ACT model compares the impacts of
    interventions, between “with project” and “without project” scenarios, followed
    in agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors. EX-ACT is a useful tool
    which can be used for developing country environments and allows the user to input
    their own emission factors to take a Tier-II approach, and can also be used for
    landscape and project-based accounting (Bernoux et al., 2010). Ex-Ante project
    assessment compares the impacts of planned interventions to the business-as-usual
    scenario. The main output of this tool consists of the C-balance resulting from
    the difference between the two alternative scenarios namely, “with project” and
    “without project” (business-as-usual) scenarios. The carbon balance of seven villages
    from the state of Maharashtra in western India showed that the adaptation and
    mitigation measures implemented in these villages resulted in net sink and contributed
    to the mitigation of GHGs to the extent of 1796 t CO2-eq./year (Fig. 22). The
    maximum mitigation potential was from the arable systems due to the adoption of
    management practices such as improved cultivar, fertilizer management, and efficient
    irrigation systems (Srinivasarao et al., 2013a). Download : Download full-size
    image Figure 22. Greenhouse gas (GHG) balance (t CO2-eq./year) from climate resilient
    practices in the seven study villages in Maharashtra (“negative” values indicate
    net sink and “positive” values indicate net emissions). Adapted from Srinivasarao
    et al. (2013a). Much of the agricultural mitigation potential lies in developing
    countries where systems are dominated by smallholder farmers and the GHG mitigation
    potential from the agricultural sector is set to increase in coming decades. Opportunity
    exists for smallholders not only from the environmental benefits of C-friendly
    practices but also to receive much needed financial input either directly from
    C financing or from development agencies looking to back C-friendly activities
    (Srinivasarao et al., 2013a). Precise quantification of C gains from adaptation
    and mitigation activities carried out by smallholder farmers is important particularly
    at the landscape level involving several farms and systems (Milne et al., 2012).
    3.6. Supporting Systems Toward Climate Resilient Villages 3.6.1. Weather-Based
    Agroadvisories Advance information on possible weather conditions that are likely
    to occur in the next 2–3 days is very useful in deciding farm operations as Indian
    agriculture is highly vulnerable to aberrant weather. This information is also
    useful for minimizing losses due to adverse weather conditions through modification
    of crop environment, protection from frost, strong wind, and also irrigation scheduling
    leading to efficient water management and drought preparedness, thereby improving
    agricultural productivity. IMD started weather services for farmers in the year
    1945. Subsequently, in the year 1976, IMD started Agrometeorological Advisory
    Services (AAS) from its State Meteorological Centres, in collaboration with agriculture
    departments of respective state governments. However, these forecasts provided
    1 day in advance were inadequate for planning weather-based agricultural practices
    because the lead-time needed for taking precautionary measures in agriculture
    is longer. Therefore, there was a requirement to provide these services in the
    medium range scale at a location to enable the farmers to carry out various agricultural
    operations such as sowing of weather-sensitive high yielding varieties, need-based
    application of fertilizer, pesticides, efficient irrigation, planning for harvest
    etc. (Maini and Basu, 2016). As a result, AAS based on medium-range weather forecast
    was initiated in 1991 in 127 agroclimatic zones of the country in a phased manner
    by the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF). The NCMRWF
    under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India in collaboration
    with IMD, ICAR, and State Agricultural Universities had been providing AAS at
    the scale of agroclimatic zone to the farming community based on location-specific
    medium-range weather forecast. Since 2007, the entire framework of AAS, developed
    and successfully demonstrated by NCMRWF, has been relocated at IMD for extending
    the service (in operational mode) to districts under these agroclimatic zones.
    It is now called the Integrated Agrometeorological Advisory Service of MoES. Thus,
    the AAS set up exhibits a multiinstitutional, multidisciplinary synergy to render
    an operational service for use of the farming community (Maini and Rathore, 2011).
    AAS is disseminated through multiple modes of delivery such as mass and electronic
    media including radio, television, print (local newspaper in different vernacular
    languages), Internet, and cell phone (Fig. 23). The use of electronic media such
    as email or the Internet is picking up as the access of these methods to the farming
    community is on significant rise. Download : Download full-size image Figure 23.
    AAS disseminated in local vernacular language through cell phones. The ICAR has
    started a web-based dissemination of agromet advisories through its All India
    Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology (AICRPAM) located at CRIDA (Fig.
    24). Further improving the advisory system at local level and extrapolating to
    national level, AICRPAM has envisaged a web-based National Agromet Advisory Services
    for effective and timely dissemination of advisories for the benefit of farming
    community. Download : Download full-size image Figure 24. Agromet advisory system
    in ICAR. AICRPAM, All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology; IMD,
    India Meteorological Department; NCMRWF, National Centre for Medium Range Weather
    Forecasting. Adapted from Rao and Bapuji Rao (2013). 3.6.2. Microlevel Agrometeorological
    Advisory Services With advancements in technology, blanket recommendations of
    AAS at district level become grossly inadequate. The district-level weather forecast
    could be used along with current crop and weather condition for preparation of
    block-level advisories by respective district-level farm science centers (KVKs).
    A pilot methodology for preparing and issuing agromet advisories at block level
    has been tested at KVK, Belgaum in Karnataka. The main innovation in this project
    is to set up an architecture involving KVKs, state line departments, and field
    information facilitation for collection of real-time crop data, formulation of
    an appropriate advisory, and its dissemination. Field Information Facilitators
    were appointed in 10 blocks of the district to collect information on weather,
    crops, disease, and pest incidence. They supply information by phone or by email
    to contact staff at KVK who in turn develop a qualitative agromet advisory specific
    to the village/farmers, in consultation with agrometeorologist of SAU and scientists
    of KVK. This helps in further value addition in terms of management options. The
    weather-based agroadvisories have been helping the farming community to take advantage
    of prognosticated weather conditions and thereby form a response strategy. The
    AAS has helped in bringing out substantial awareness among farmers about adoption
    of weather-based advisories, their timely availability, and quality of service.
    It has also helped in encouraging the adoption and use of modern agricultural
    production technologies and practices, in promoting weather-based irrigation management,
    pest/disease management, etc. along with greater use of postharvest technologies
    and commercial marketing of commodities. A pilot study by Maini and Rathore (2011)
    revealed that the AAS farmers accrued a net benefit of 10–15% in the overall yield
    and a reduction by 2–5% in the cost of cultivation over the non-AAS farmers. Over
    the years, there is a definite increase in the economic benefits with improvement
    in the outreach and worthiness of the service which is direct fallout of improved
    weather predictions as a result of the huge investments being made by Government
    of India (Maini and Basu, 2016). However, there exists a wide gap between different
    organizations issuing microlevel AAS and farmer as the end user. The outreach
    of AAS system to deliver the information at block and village level, in a timely
    manner, needs to be improved. The Common Service Centre of Department of Information
    Technology is one of the solutions to bridge the information gap by exploiting
    advances in information technology, which has witnessed phenomenal use in dissemination
    of information in the recent past (Rao and Bapuji Rao, 2013). 3.6.3. Risk Management
    Through Weather-Based Crop Insurance The vulnerability of resource poor farmers
    is aggravated by the multitude of uninsured risks in conditions where the full-insurance
    opportunities are absent. The idea of crop insurance which emerged in India during
    the early part of the 20th century was fiercely debated postindependence (Hazell
    et al., 1986) and was significantly operational only in the 1990s (Mishra, 1995).
    It is still evolving in terms of scope, spread, and structure. The Government
    of India has introduced several insurance schemes for protecting farming community
    from nonpreventable risks in agriculture including drought, floods, cyclone etc.
    (Table 19). The crop yield–based insurance schemes have been largely unsuccessful
    with low coverage and high claims to premium ratio. There are also problems with
    both the design and implementation of the schemes. Table 19. Major insurance schemes
    introduced in India during 1979–2016. Insurance scheme Year of launch Region Crop
    Risks covered PCIS 1979 Implemented in 13 states Cereals, millets, oilseeds, cotton,

    Source: Compiled by authors from different sources. The alternative index-based
    weather insurance products (microinsurance products) that were developed to overcome
    the defects in the traditional crop insurance schemes could address the problems
    of moral hazard, adverse selection, high administrative costs, inadequate indemnification
    levels, and large units of insurance. Weather-based crop insurance uses weather
    parameters as “proxy” for crop yields in compensating the cultivators for deemed
    crop losses. The first index-based weather insurance was a rainfall insurance
    contract underwritten by ICICI-Lombard General Insurance Company for groundnut
    and castor farmers of BASIX''s water user associations in Mahabubnagar district
    of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh in 2003. In 2007, the Government of India piloted
    a Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) across India to explore its effectiveness
    as an alternative to the national agricultural insurance scheme. The scheme covers
    weather perils including deficit rains, unseasonal/excess rains, frost, heat (temperature),
    relative humidity, etc. However, there are several limitations for successful
    implementation and further upscaling of the scheme including distance of the farm
    from the weather station, noncoverage of perils other than weather, wider sowing/planting
    window of the crop, differences in soil types and management practices, shift
    in climatic and weather patterns, etc. leading to weak correlation between the
    yield and the weather indices. Further, the specialized nature of product development,
    the esoteric terminology used in a term sheet, and the concoction of agrometeorology,
    statistics and economics within the underlying parameters have the undesirable
    effect of turning weather insurance into an incomprehensible device (AFCL, 2011).
    The density of AWS and IMD observatories holds the key to better pricing of risk
    products with passage of time and enabling the introduction of weather insurance
    based on other parameters. Warehouse of daily rainfall data for weather insurance
    is also very important for disaster management as well as weather advisory service.
    Services of private and third-party weather data providers are critical for authentic
    and timely settlement of claims in many areas and in situations where no other
    alternative is available. The value of products can be enhanced by adding services
    to the insurance. For example, insurance providers can offer agroadvisories to
    farmers as part of the insurance package. 4. Government Policy and Support India,
    as a developing country, has reasons to be more concerned about the adverse impact
    of impending climate change on its economy and particularly on agriculture sector
    for food security. Agriculture remains the most important sector of Indian economy
    with about 53% share in total employment or workforce. India has a very comprehensive
    framework of legal and institutional mechanisms in the region to respond to the
    tremendous challenges to the environment it is facing, owing to population growth,
    poverty and illiteracy augmented by urbanization, and industrial development (Prasad
    and Kochher, 2009). The country has had, over the last six decades, major programs
    addressing climate variability concerns. These include cyclone warning and protection,
    coastal protection, floods and drought control and relief, major and minor irrigation
    projects, food security measures, research on CRA, and several others. A summary
    of major policy initiatives and programs toward climate change is presented in
    this section. India is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
    Change. It has established the National Clean Development Mechanism Authority
    in 2003. A council has also been set up under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister
    of India in 2007 to coordinate national action for assessment, adaptation, and
    mitigation of climate change. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)
    was launched in 2008 to address climate change concerns and promote sustainable
    development. There are eight National Missions including that on sustainable agriculture,
    which form the core of the NAPCC, representing “multipronged, long-term and integrated
    strategies for achieving key goals in the context of climate change.” The National
    Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) aims to support climate adaptation in
    agriculture through the development of climate-resilient crops, expansion of weather
    insurance mechanisms, and agricultural practices. All Indian states are also developing
    State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with the NAPCC to define
    how they will integrate adaptation and mitigation of climate change into their
    ongoing government schemes and practical actions. The ICAR, focal organization
    for agriculture research, technology development, and transfer of technology,
    has accorded high priority to understanding the impacts of climate change and
    developing adaptation and mitigation strategies to meet the challenges posed by
    climate change on the agricultural system. The ICAR launched a Network Project
    on Climate Change in 2004 with 15 centers which were expanded later covering 23
    centers across the country. The results of the project through crop modeling have
    helped in understanding the impacts of changes in rainfall and temperature regimes
    on important crops and livestock. In 2011, the ICAR launched a megaproject called
    NICRA with four main modules—natural resource management, improving crop production,
    livestock and fisheries, and institutional innovations to make the farmers self-reliant
    for adaptation under changing climate. One of the major objectives of the project
    is to develop CRVs in about 151 districts of the country experiencing various
    weather aberrations and extreme events such as droughts, floods, cyclones, heat
    wave, cold wave, frost, hailstorm, seawater intrusion toward stabilizing agricultural
    production and livelihoods, with low GHG emissions and carbon positive practices.
    These villages will serve as models and also as learning sites for scaling up
    or expanding to the cluster of villages, blocks, and districts. A good convergence
    among research organizations and various government programs such as national/state
    action plans, NMSA, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Mahatma Gandhi
    National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), National Agriculture Development
    Programme, soil health schemes, water mission, and green climate fund etc. will
    further contribute to scaling up of CRVs (Fig. 25). Download : Download full-size
    image Figure 25. Expansion of climate resilient research and development program
    in Indian agriculture sector. The country has adopted National Agroforestry Policy
    in 2014 to encourage and expand tree plantation in an integrated manner with crops
    and livestock to improve productivity, employment, income, and livelihoods of
    rural households, to protect and stabilize ecosystems, and promote resilient cropping
    and farming systems to minimize risks during extreme climatic events. The policy
    also envisages meeting the raw material requirements of wood-based industries,
    and small timber for the rural and tribal populations, and reducing the pressure
    on forests. Further, afforestation, natural resource management, and drought-related
    programs are being promoted through schemes such as MGNREGA and National Afforestation
    Programme. Similarly, under Green India Mission (GIM), forest restoration, afforestation,
    agroforestry, and urban forestry are being promoted. 5. Conclusions Climate change
    impacts on agriculture are being witnessed all over the world, but countries like
    India are more vulnerable in view of the huge population dependent on agriculture,
    excessive pressure on natural resources, and poor coping mechanisms. Significant
    negative impacts on crops, livestock, poultry, and fishery have been projected
    with medium-term and long-term climate change. Enhancing the resilience of agricultural
    production to climate change, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional
    security for all, particularly the resource poor small and marginal farmers of
    developing countries like India. To address this challenge, the ICAR launched
    NICRA in 2011, with one of the objectives to develop model CRVs which enhance
    farm productivity and profitability, particularly during years of weather aberrations
    and extreme climate, through adaptation to different climatic stresses. The 151
    villages selected are in areas vulnerable to different stresses such as drought,
    cyclone, flood, heat/cold wave, seawater intrusion etc. Appropriate climate resilient
    interventions were tailored for each village in consultation with farming community
    along with village extension workers, rather than following a “blanket recommendation”
    approach. Institutional interventions including establishment of VCRMCs, CHCs
    for farm implements, seed banks for access to improved crop cultivars, and fodder
    banks were promoted through collective action to build resilience among communities.
    Capacity building by extensive participatory demonstrations of location-specific
    agricultural practices, trainings, and exposure visits helped farmers gain access
    to knowledge and gave confidence to cope with adverse weather conditions. Location-specific
    integrated action plans including demonstration of resilient technologies, management
    practices, and institutional and policy interventions have shown promising results
    at several locations. Case studies of different villages have demonstrated significant
    enhancement of system productivity and livelihoods, and adaptation to weather
    aberrations with mitigation cobenefits. Some of the successful technologies and
    practices that promoted resilience to climatic stresses are being mainstreamed
    in many national and state government programs for their upscaling in applicable
    domains. The developed CRVs have become model villages for gradual expansion horizontally
    in the cluster of villages and bring the element of resilience in overall Indian
    agriculture. The dual benefits envisaged in the strategy of CRA in India, is to
    improve and sustain the country''s food security by adapting agriculture sector
    to weather aberrations and extreme climatic events along with environmental services
    in terms of reducing GHG emission. 6. Way Forward Enhancing the resilience of
    Indian agriculture to cope with climate variability and climate change is vital
    to the livelihood security at household and village level, and to meet the food
    requirement of the country. It is much more essential in the context of increased
    frequencies of droughts of various magnitude, cyclones, hailstorm, and terminal
    heat in postrainy season, and floods in different parts of the country. Our experiences
    from location-specific implementation of technical and institutional action plans
    for development of CRVs indicate the potential of such technology package to enhance
    climate change adaptation, if deployed prudently. Practices that help adapt to
    climate change in Indian agriculture are soil organic carbon build up, in situ
    moisture conservation, residue incorporation instead of burning, rainwater harvesting
    and recycling for supplemental irrigation, cultivation of drought- and flood-tolerant
    varieties, water saving technologies, location specific agronomic management,
    and improved livestock feed, and feeding methods which also have potential for
    mitigation of GHG emissions. Suggested measures for judicious up- and outscaling
    of proven climate resilient technologies and CRV models include the following:
    • Develop and diffuse crop varieties tolerant to drought, heat, and flood. Establish
    village seed banks for easy and timely access to these varieties. • Indigenous
    traditional knowledge (ITK) in collecting germplasm, protecting natural resources,
    etc. needs to be promoted at village level. • Encourage diversification of rural
    income in vulnerable regions through off-farm activities for sustainable livelihoods.
    • Development of CRVs needs well-structured institutional support with strong
    government policy and convergence among various institutions. The technological
    and policy inputs for developing CRVs is expected to come from national agroforestry
    policy, NAPCC, SAPCC, district contingency plans, and NARS. On the other hand,
    up- and outscaling of proven climate resilient technologies and CRV models should
    be taken up in convergence with several national missions and schemes including
    NMSA, Prime Minister''s Agriculture Irrigation Scheme/PMKSY, MGNREGA, Water Mission,
    National Afforestation Mission, National Agriculture Development Programme/Rashtriya
    Krishi Vikas Yojana, etc. (Fig. 26). Download : Download full-size image Figure
    26. Expansion strategy of CRVs in India. • Establish institutional mechanisms
    at village level including farmers’ cooperative societies, self-help groups, climate
    risk management committees, and CHCs for mobilization and active participation
    of village communities, sharing of information, planting material, and farm implements.
    • Manage climate risks through weather-based agroadvisories and affordable weather
    insurance products. Enhance the density of weather observatories and establish
    rain gauges at block/village level. • Large-scale awareness on climate change,
    adaptation, and mitigation benefits through human resource development and capacity
    building of all stakeholders including officials, extension workers, and farmers
    for better adaptation to climate change. • Provide incentives and concessional
    credit to farmers for adoption of resource conserving and climate resilient agricultural
    practices. • Strengthening of agricultural extension and other technology delivery
    services including advanced ICT modules to enhance farmers’ capability to respond
    to climatic stresses. • Climate research and policy in agriculture sector to manage
    various extreme climatic events and implementation of climate friendly agriculture
    programs at grass root level. Acknowledgments We are thankful to ICAR and CRIDA

  description: Crop production in the Caribbean is dominated by small open field holdings
    that are almost totally reliant on rainfall. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.
    Lam. [Convolvulaceae]) has been identified as an important commodity to attain
    food and nutrition security goals of the region, particularly in light of a changing
    climate.The crop has high nutritional value, innate drought-tolerant properties,
    and can be grown with relatively low inputs. The routine use of crop models for
    yield optimization is largely absent in the Caribbean. In this study, an attempt
    was made to parameterize the FAO AquaCrop model for sweet potato for the first
    time. AquaCrop is a simulation model for crop water productivity, designed primarily
    for use in irrigation management. Parameters were developed using data from three
    sweet potato cultivars grown in two agroecological zones in Jamaica under rainfed
    and irrigated conditions. Digital photography was combined with an automated canopy
    estimator to track canopy development, and sample harvesting was done throughout
    the crop season.The overall simulation of biomass was good, with deviations of
    <28% for four out of six simulations, and season-long performance of the model
    was commendable. The simulation of yield presented more challenges, especially
    given the nonlinear rate of tuber development. The results, however, indicate
    that AquaCrop could be a useful tool for Caribbean agriculture in predicting the
    productivity of sweet potato under varying water availability.

    in the Caribbean is dominated by small open field holdings that are almost totally
    reliant on rainfall. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L. Lam. [Convolvulaceae]) has
    been identified as an important commodity to attain food and nutrition security
    goals of the region, particularly in light of a changing climate. The crop has
    high nutritional value, innate drought-tolerant properties, and can be grown with
    relatively low inputs. The routine use of crop models for yield optimization is
    largely absent in the Caribbean. In this study, an attempt was made to parameterize
    the FAO AquaCrop model for sweet potato for the first time. AquaCrop is a simulation
    model for crop water productivity, designed primarily for use in irrigation management.
    Parameters were developed using data from three sweet potato cultivars grown in
    two agroecological zones in Jamaica under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Digital
    photography was combined with an automated canopy estimator to track canopy development,
    and sample harvesting was done throughout the crop season. The overall simulation
    of biomass was good, with deviations of <28% for four out of six simulations,
    and season-long performance of the model was commendable. The simulation of yield
    presented more challenges, especially given the nonlinear rate of tuber development.
    The results, however, indicate that AquaCrop could be a useful tool for Caribbean
    agriculture in predicting the productivity of sweet potato under varying water
    availability. Abbreviations AWS automatic weather station CC canopy cover DAP
    days after planting WUE water use efficiency Sweet potato is a dicotyledonous
    herbaceous trailing vine of the Convolvulaceae family that is characterized by
    its starchy storage roots and lobed leaves (Caribbean Agricultural Research and
    Development Institute, 2010). It is regarded worldwide as the sixth (fifth in
    developing countries) most important crop (http://cipotato.org/sweetpotato-1/)
    and in Jamaica is the third most widely grown root tuber (http://rada.gov.jm/?p=462).
    The expansion of its cultivation and use is seen as essential for the future development
    of Jamaica''s agricultural sector (http://rada.gov.jm/?p=462) and for the food
    and nutrition security of the entire Caribbean region (Hutchinson, 2013) through
    reduced reliance on imported cereals. Agricultural production in the Caribbean
    is dominated by small open field holdings that are highly reliant on rainfall
    with little supplemental irrigation (http://www.rlc.fao.org/). The rainfall climatology
    of the Caribbean is characterized by dry winters and wet summers (Taylor and Alfaro,
    2005). The wet season is bimodal, with peaks in May to June and September to October
    (Chen and Taylor, 2002) separated by a brief dry period in July and August referred
    to as the “midsummer drought” (Magaña et al. 1999; Curtis and Gamble, 2008). During
    the late rainfall season (late August–November) as much as 40% of the total annual
    rainfall is received (Taylor et al., 2011; Climate Studies Group, Mona, 2012).
    There is strong year-to-year variability in annual rainfall amounts due to modulation
    by gradients in sea surface temperatures in and between the tropical Atlantic
    and Pacific (Taylor et al., 2002). Droughts are of particular concern for farmers
    in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean given the reliance on rainfall (Gamble et al.,
    2010). In this context, sweet potato assumes great importance for food and nutrition
    security. The advantages of sweet potato are its adaptability to different growing
    conditions, its low susceptibility to natural hazards including hurricanes and
    other tropical systems (Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute,
    2010; Abdissa et al., 2011), and its innate drought-tolerant properties, including
    shading of the soil by its extensive canopy and an extensive and deep root system
    (Romero and Baigorria, 2008; Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute,
    2010; Stathers et al., 2013; Kunstelj et al., 2013a, 2013b). The vulnerability
    of the climate-sensitive Caribbean agricultural sector is expected to be exacerbated
    under climate change, and crop modeling has been identified as part of a wider
    adaptation strategy (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean,
    2011; Hutchinson, 2013). Crop models are useful for their ability to estimate
    potential yields under varying environmental scenarios such as might occur under
    current and/or future climate change assuming optimal farm management. This, however,
    requires crop models that are calibrated and validated for the local conditions.
    With the exception of Cuba, there is little or no use of crop models in the Caribbean
    (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 2011; Hoogenboom, 2012).
    The objective of this study was to parameterize the AquaCrop model for field-grown
    irrigated and rainfed sweet potato using its conservative parameters. AquaCrop
    is a crop water productivity model developed by the Land and Water Division of
    the FAO. The conceptual framework, underlying principles, and distinctive features
    of AquaCrop were documented by Steduto et al. (2009), while its structure and
    algorithms have been documented by Raes et al. (2009). AquaCrop simulates the
    yield response to water of herbaceous crops and is particularly suited to address
    conditions where water is a key limiting factor in crop production. It uses few
    input variables, which require comparatively simple methods for their determination
    (Steduto et al., 2008). The model uses canopy cover instead of leaf area index
    to monitor canopy expansion and has a good balance between simplicity and robustness,
    making it well suited for use in the Caribbean where agro-meteorological data
    are scarce. The global applicability of AquaCrop is dependent on its being tested
    in a variety of locations under differing soil conditions, crops, agronomic practices,
    and climatic conditions (Sam-Amoah et al., 2013). For example, the calibration
    and evaluation of the performance of AquaCrop has been done for cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) in northern Syria (Farahani et al., 2009; García-Vila et al., 2009),
    for maize (Zea mays L.) in various locations (Heng et al., 2009; Hsiao et al.,
    2009), for hot pepper (Capsicum sp.) in south-central Ghana (Sam-Amoah et al.,
    2013), and for potato (Solanum tuberosum L., known as Irish potato in Jamaica)
    in Lima, Peru (Izzi, 2008). However, like most of the other crop models in current
    use, AquaCrop has not been parameterized for root crops like sweet potato or for
    the Caribbean region. In this study, field trials were conducted at two sites
    in Jamaica for the parameterization of AquaCrop over two crop seasons. MATERIALS
    AND METHODS Site Characteristics and Biometry Parameters for the model were determined
    from data collected from field tests undertaken at Devon, Manchester, in 2012
    and 2013 and Ebony Park, Clarendon, in 2013, located in different agroecological
    regions of south-central Jamaica (Fig. 1). General site characteristics are summarized
    in Table 1. Devon has clay loam soil with lower total available water content
    than the clay soil at Ebony Park. The full details of the soil characteristics
    are given in Table 2. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Location of field test sites

    included three popularly cultivated sweet potato cultivars (Ganja, Uplifta, and
    Yellow Belly) and two water treatments, irrigated and rainfed. Treatments were
    allocated in a randomized complete block (RCB) design with five replications.
    At each location there were two sets of experimental RCBs, one irrigated and the
    other rainfed. The plots at Devon were 26 m2 (20.7 m2 in 2012), with larger plots
    at Ebony Park (53 m2). In all cases, sweet potato slips were planted on both sides
    of four raised ridges at a spacing of 30.5 cm (1 ft) on the ridge. Before planting,
    the slips were soaked in a synthetic organophosphate pesticide (O,O-diethyl O-[6-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl]
    phosphorothioate) solution (0.5% in water) for 20 min and then drained (as recommended
    by the Rural Agriculture Development Authority). Treatment of the planting material
    was conducted to reduce the risk of infestation of the sweet potato weevil (Cylas
    formicarius). Row spacing was 1.08 and 1.55 m for Devon and Ebony Park, respectively.
    Drip irrigation lines (1.27-cm diameter) were run along the length of each ridge
    in the irrigated plots. For planting material, potato slips of 30- to 40-cm (12–15-inch)
    length were obtained from vines of nursery-grown sweet potato, mainly from the
    apical regions. This is in keeping with recommendations for field planting in
    Jamaica (Fielding and Ryder, 1995; Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development
    Institute, 2010). The slips used as planting material developed roots and new
    foliage after being transplanted. There were up to 224 plants in each plot, sufficient
    to allow periodic destructive sampling. Fertilization was done once in each crop
    season at the recommended rate. Weather Data and Irrigation The sites are part
    of the network of stations maintained by the Meteorological Service, Jamaica,
    and have an automatic weather station (AWS) measuring multiple parameters and
    reporting at intervals upward from 30 min. The AWS provided the daily weather
    parameters needed for the climate component of the AquaCrop model in 2013. For
    the crop at Devon (2011/2012), data were used from an automatic weather station
    (at Kirkvine) located 14 km away. Variables measured included maximum and minimum
    temperatures, rainfall, (net) solar radiation (not available for 2011/2012), wind,
    and relative humidity (not available for Ebony Park). The variables (except rainfall)
    were used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for each site
    using the Penman–Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998) and the FAO ETo calculator
    (Raes, 2009). This ETo represents an upper limit for evapotranspiration (assuming
    no water shortage), which is used by the AquaCrop model to simulate daily crop
    evapotranspiration. In 2013, the mean daily ETo for the crop season at Ebony Park
    was higher than at Devon (Table 3; Fig. 2). Ebony Park had a mean crop season
    (2013) temperature that was 5°C warmer than Devon (Table 3). Table 3. Crop season

    sites is shown in Fig. 1, and the climatological mean rainfall (1971–2000) for
    the sites is given in Table 1. On average, Devon (Manchester) receives nearly
    twice as much rainfall as Ebony Park, but both locations exhibit the characteristic
    bimodal rainfall pattern (Fig. 3). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Monthly pattern
    of rainfall for field sites (1994–2013). Total rainfall during the 2011/2012 cropping
    season at Devon was 622 mm (Table 3; Fig. 4). The rainfall occurring in the first
    59 d after planting (3 Nov.– 31 Dec. 2011) was 71 mm. This amount was only 34%
    of the 30-yr (1971–2000) mean rainfall for these months at this location (Fig.
    4 and 5). As a consequence, severe drought conditions (as classified by the Meteorological
    Service, Jamaica) were experienced during this period. Irrigation of 197 mm was
    applied in this cropping season, with the highest amounts supplied during the
    drought period (Fig. 5). In the 2013 cropping season, rainfall was more evenly
    distributed and no drought was experienced. Rainfall summed to 645 mm, and this
    was supplemented by irrigation of only 44 mm as described below. Figure 4 Open
    in figure viewer Monthly precipitation and irrigation for the 2011/2012 crop season
    at Devon, Jamaica. During the period of drought stress in the first 59 d after
    planting (November–December 2011), site rainfall was 34% of the 30-yr (1971–2000)
    mean rainfall. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Daily rainfall (black bars) and
    irrigation (gray bars) measured for days after planting (DAP) at (a) Devon 2011/12,
    (b) Devon 2013, and (c) Ebony Park 2013 in Jamaica. Immediately after planting,
    when the plants were most sensitive to water stress, both irrigated and rainfed
    plots were watered (Fielding and Ryder, 1995; Caribbean Agricultural Research
    and Development Institute, 2010). Initial soil moisture was therefore at field
    capacity. In the first crop season at Devon, irrigation was automated by an inline
    timer (2-cm [3/4-inch] valve, 106 L [28 gallons] min−1, battery-operated digital
    controller) that triggered watering of the crops four times per day. Irrigation
    (mean of 4.5 mm d−1) was applied for a total of 43 d. In the 2013 crop season,
    a different irrigation schedule was used. Davis Vantage Pro Plus AWS moisture
    probes were used to monitor soil moisture (Davis Instruments, 2006). Irrigation
    was done once daily, only when a reading of 30 kPa (30 cbar) was recorded for
    soil moisture tension. The total number of irrigated days was 11, with a mean
    daily application of 4 mm. This new schedule, along with the more evenly distributed
    rainfall, resulted in the large difference in irrigated amounts (greater than
    four times more in 2012) between these two seasons. Planting took place at Ebony
    Park only in 2013, and at this location the total rainfall for the crop was 470
    mm with an irrigation total of 432 mm. Irrigation was done when moisture tension
    of 30 kPa (30 cbar) was registered on the onsite irrometer (Model R 24). The mean
    daily irrigation was 6 mm, and application lasted a total of 72 d. Crop Parameters:
    Yield, Biomass, and Canopy Cover Above- and belowground biomass were assessed
    destructively at least two times during the crop season and at final harvest.
    Yields were calculated from the cultivar average of four to eight plants from
    each plot and extrapolated to give yield per unit area in megagrams per hectare
    (1 Mg = 1 tonne). For the first crop at Devon in 2012, there was selective harvesting,
    when plants with marketable tubers were chosen for measurement of yield. Thereafter,
    for Devon and Ebony Park in 2013, all tubers harvested in the sample were measured
    without separation of marketability. Samples were dried to constant weight to
    obtain dry mass. Cultivar averages were determined from the mean of all five replicates
    as well as one cross-cultivar average calculated for each treatment. Measured
    values (observed) were compared with those calculated (simulated) by AquaCrop
    (Hsiao et al., 2011). Canopy cover (CC) was measured every 20 to 30 d during the
    crop season using a combination of above-canopy digital photography and one of
    two software packages. The photographs were taken with a digital camera (Fujifilm
    12.2 megapixels, 18× optical zoom Finepix S1800 lens). A new approach developed
    in the course of this research was used to estimate canopy cover (Coy et al.,
    unpublished data, 2013). The new technique is called the Automated Canopy Estimator
    (ACE) and was applied at all sites. The ACE converts a digital photograph from
    red–green–blue (RGB) to the CIE L*a*b* color space (Wright, 1929; Guild, 1932;
    Commission Internationale de l''Eclairage, 1931). One major benefit of working
    in the CIE L*a*b* is that it is device independent and therefore a single approach
    can be used in the segmentation of captured images without the negative effects
    of differing color representations. Images are segmented based on an assessment
    of the bimodality of the probability distribution of the a* color values. The
    method was rigorously tested against ground truth segmentations of oat (Avena
    sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), rape (Brassica napus L.), and maize.
    The estimated CC values yielded high coefficients of correlation, highlighting
    the technique''s consistency in estimation across different crop types. In all
    cases, the mean CC for each cultivar was obtained from the average of the five
    replicates in each treatment (irrigated and rainfed separately) for use in the
    AquaCrop model. One mean value across all cultivars was also obtained for each
    treatment. Data Analysis Goodness of fit of the simulated results with the measured
    field test data was assessed on the basis of two statistical measures: the root
    mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of efficiency (E) (Nash and Sutcliffe,
    1970): (1) (2) where Si and Oi are the simulated and observed values of samples
    taken during the season (for biomass, canopy cover or yield) or at the end of
    the season (e.g., tuber yield), N is the number of observations, and Ō is the
    mean value of Oi (Heng et al., 2009). The RMSE measures the overall mean deviation
    between simulated and observed values. The closer the value is to zero, the better
    the model performance. The coefficient of efficiency measures how the overall
    deviation between observed and simulated values departs from the overall deviation
    between observed values Oi and their mean value (Ō) during the crop season. The
    values are of E are unitless and can range from –∞ to 1. The closer the values
    are to 1, the better the model''s simulation efficiency. Similar statistical analyses
    (comparing measured and simulated values using E and RMSE) have been used successfully
    by a number of other AquaCrop parameterization studies (Heng et al., 2009; Hsiao
    et al., 2009; Farahani et al., 2009). The deviation percentage (Hsiao et al.,
    2009), defined as Deviation = [(simulated – measured)/measured] ×100, was also
    used as a measure of how well the model performed. Plots with experimental data
    are presented with standard deviation bars to give an indication of the random
    error size. Model Parameters Conservative Parameters The AquaCrop model Version
    4.0 (2012) was used in the parameterization. The approach taken was to calibrate
    the model with the 2 yr (2011/12 and 2013) of data from Devon, Manchester. During
    the simulations, emphasis was placed on the progression of green canopy cover,
    total and belowground biomass, and to a lesser extent total reference evapotranspiration,
    after Hsiao et al. (2009). Conservative parameters are those that vary little
    among different cultivars of the same crop and so can be applied directly (unaltered)
    or with minimal adjustments even across different agroecological zones (Raes et
    al., 2009; Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2012). Values for these parameters
    may be obtained from the literature or previous studies, but in the case of sweet
    potato there were no previous values available. Initial (best guess) values for
    conservative parameters of sweet potato were therefore selected from values reported
    in the literature for Irish potato (calibrated for Lima, Peru) and knowledge gained
    of the crop. This approach, i.e., using the closest crop (Irish potato) to calibrate
    a totally new crop (sweet potato), was recommended by Steduto et al. (2012). Refinements
    to these initial values were obtained through trial and error after repeated simulations
    to ensure the best match of simulated to measured variables. By taking the average
    across cultivars, one set of conservative values was obtained and used in calendar
    mode for emergence date, physiological maturity, and senescence. Some differences
    were noted among the cultivars, especially Yellow Belly, which appeared to senescence
    earlier than the others. Notwithstanding, mean values were observed to give more
    favorable results than values for the individual cultivars. The same set of conservative
    parameters was used across treatments. Once reasonable agreement was obtained
    with the measured values, the model was switched to the growing degree day (GDD)
    mode and more adjustments made to the parameters. The final set of parameters
    was tested against data from the crop at Ebony Park (2013). This followed the
    recommended approach for parameterization of AquaCrop by Steduto et al. (2012).
    The full set of conservative parameters is given in Table 4. In addition, the
    following are noted about parameter choices: Canopy parameters: Canopy cover,
    as determined by vine growth, varies for each of the three growth phases of sweet
    potato, with characteristics of the initial phase of slow vine growth and rapid
    growth of adventitious roots, an intermediate phase of rapid growth of vines and
    an increase in leaf area and storage root initiation; and the final stage of bulking
    of tubers but no further vine growth (Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development
    Institute, 2010). The size of individual leaves also varies among cultivars from
    small almost divided leaves for Ganja to large-lobed leaves for Uplifta. Both
    factors pose a challenge to estimating canopy cover parameters. The default value
    for a high initial canopy cover was adjusted to a best-fit value of 0.9% for the
    initial values for canopy cover (CCo). The canopy growth coefficient (CGC), which
    determines canopy development from emergence to maximum canopy cover, was determined
    by the CGC estimator spreadsheet of the FAO. This was later adjusted until the
    best match with measured values was obtained. The measured maximum canopy value
    from the field tests (94%) was used, while the canopy decline coefficient (CDC,
    which controls the rate of canopy decline after senescence), also was adjusted
    until the best match was obtained. Normalized water productivity: Water productivity
    (WP) is measured in grams of biomass per square meter and per millimeter of cumulated
    water transpired (or kilograms of biomass per cubic meter of water transpired)
    during the time period in which the biomass is produced (Raes et al., 2011, Steduto
    et al., 2012). In AquaCrop, WP is normalized for atmospheric demand and air CO2
    concentrations. Used in this way, it behaves conservatively and expresses the
    strong relationship between photosynthetic CO2 assimilation or biomass production
    and transpiration independently of the climatic conditions. Steduto et al. (2007)
    suggested that the conservative nature of WP is fundamental to the robustness
    of the model. Water productivity for C3 crops like sweet potato lies in the range
    of 15 to 20 g m−2 mm−1 (Raes et al., 2011). Using this range, the most appropriate
    value derived for sweet potato from the experimental data was 20.0 g m−2 mm−1.
    Water stress parameters and harvest index (HI): Adjustments were made to all the
    default stress parameters used for Irish potato while noting the moderate sensitivity
    of sweet potato to water stress and the limitation to only two water treatments
    (irrigated vs. rainfed). The effects of water stress on the HI are categorized
    in two stages. Before yield formation, there is a moderately positive (8%) increase,
    and during yield formation there are two (sub) adjustments: (i) for leaf expansion
    (1.16, moderately positive) and (ii) for stomatal closure (0.92, slightly negative).
    The value of reference harvest index (HIo) used was 55% based on the best fit
    between measured and simulated data. Aeration stress: Sweet potato is regarded
    as being moderately tolerant to aeration stress. For waterlogging (aeration) stress,
    a value of –4% of the saturated volume was used. Growing degree days (GDD): The
    simulations of GDD used a base of 15°C and an upper temperature of 35°C. These
    values were chosen based on published work on the base temperature as well the
    optimal range for sweet potato production (Romero and Baigorria, 2008; Ramirez,
    1992; Villordon et al., 2009; Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development
    Institute, 2010; Stathers et al., 2013). The effect of temperature stress could
    not be tested because temperatures remained within the optimal range for most
    of the crop season in both years. Table 4. Conservative (constant) parameters

    data and knowledge of the crop. The following considerations were made when choosing
    parameter values for emergence time, rooting depth, canopy senescence and physiological
    maturity. Emergence time: This is the time by which 90% of seedlings or new shoots
    have emerged from the soil. It is regarded as the starting time (first day of
    appearance) of the crop canopy. The emergence time was fairly uniform across the
    cultivars, and the mean value of 77 GDD was used. Rooting depth: Sweet potato
    is considered a deep-rooted crop, with the maximum effective rooting depth generally
    being 1 to 1.5 m (Allen et al., 1998). In this study, we found that roots exceeded
    these limits. The measured value of 1.6 m was used for both Devon and Ebony Park.
    Canopy senescence and physiological maturity: The time to senescence was taken
    as 1091 GDD. It was taken to be the time when yellowing was noticed in >40% of
    leaves. However, it was noted that late-season rainfall veiled some of the senescence,
    especially at Ebony Park, where significant green canopy (overlying older senescent
    leaves) was evident even at harvest. Physiological maturity varied slightly among
    the different cultivars and in general exceeded the 120 calendar days reported
    for local cultivars by the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute
    (2010). The crop season at both sites lasted in excess of 130 d, and maturity
    was taken as 1294 GDD. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of the simulation are
    presented and discussed by location. For each cropping season, comparisons were
    made between the simulated and measured values of canopy cover, (total) biomass,
    and yield. Additionally, some results are presented for measured (by AWS) vs.
    simulated daily crop ETo at Devon in 2013. In the experiment, as explained above,
    three cultivars were included, two high yielding (Uplifta and Ganja) and one lower
    yielding (Yellow Belly). Besides serving as a measure of the robustness of the
    model (because AquaCrop simulations pre-suppose modern high-yielding cultivars),
    the inclusion of Yellow Belly was to assess how its deeper roots might affect
    drought tolerance. Devon, Manchester 2012 Crop Season In the first crop season
    (2011/2012), AquaCrop underestimated canopy cover for both the irrigated and rainfed
    treatments for about 66 d after planting (DAP), though results were slightly better
    for the rainfed plots (Fig. 6a and 6b). However, the maximum canopy cover value
    for both rainfed and irrigated sweet potato (occurring at 122 DAP in the model)
    was closely simulated. The large disparities between initial values resulted in
    large RMSE and relatively low E values (negative for the irrigated treatment),
    as shown in Table 5. The discrepancies might be attributable to a number of factors:
    the severe drought stress that was experienced in the first 60 DAP and the differential
    response of the cultivars to drought, which was not captured by AquaCrop. Several
    studies (Bourke, 1984; Martin and Carmer, 1985; Fielding and Ryder, 1995; Ku et
    al., 2008; Lebot, 2009) have reported that sweet potato water requirements are
    site and time specific. These researchers also noted that cultivars differ in
    their response to stress conditions including drought. AquaCrop does not simulate
    well under high-drought-stress conditions (Heng et al., 2009; Hsiao et al., 2009;
    Patel et al., 2011). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs. measured

    Further, the onsite weather station was inoperable during this crop season and
    ETo was calculated using data from the nearest station (Kirkvine Bauxite Company),
    which is 14 km away. The absence of solar radiation in this data set seemingly
    affected the estimation of ETo, given the known dependence of ETo on this parameter
    for accurate estimates (Allen et al., 1998; Droogers and Allen, 2002; Alkaeed
    et al., 2006; Rahimikhoob, 2014). There was no measurement of canopy cover after
    the onset of senescence in this crop season, so the performance of the model during
    this period was not assessed for this variable. The simulation of biomass is shown
    in Fig. 6c and 6d. There was good (E = 0.74) agreement between simulated and measured
    total biomass for the initial and final values for the irrigated treatment (Table
    5). The irrigated sample taken at 122 DAP was inadvertently lost. Figure 6d shows
    a divergence between measured and simulated values of biomass in the rainfed plots
    as the season progressed. In general, rainfed yields were higher than those of
    the irrigated plants (Table 6). It appears that the low rainfall during the first
    third of the crop life did not adversely affect yields of the rainfed plants.
    On the other hand, it seems that irrigation did not benefit tuber development
    and possibly contributed to a reduction in yield relative to the rainfed plants.
    This is in agreement with observations made by Lebot (2009) in their research
    in Taiwan that over-irrigation tended to reduce storage root yields in areas of
    high rainfall, whereas a short period of drought stress appeared to stimulate
    root development. Table 6. Simulated vs. measured values of total biomass and
    tuber yield of rainfed and irrigated sweet potato at Devon and Ebony Park, Jamaica.

    of three cultivars. While an adequate water supply through rainfall or irrigation
    is essential for the optimum development of storage roots, excess water can result
    in poor aeration. Like Lebot (2009), it was noted in this study that if sweet
    potato was irrigated when the total available water in the soil was depleted to
    about 40%, the highest yields were produced. There are exceptions, however, especially
    in areas where rainfall is usually low. For example, at another location in the
    dry southern fringe of Jamaica (Bodles, St. Catherine) a lack of rain was experienced,
    and without irrigation the rainfed plants died due to severe drought stress. There
    was a large deviation between the simulated and observed final yields (–43.6%
    for irrigated, –76.0% for rainfed) (Table 6). The lower standard deviation (14.9
    for rainfed vs. 5.7 for irrigated) for the irrigated treatment suggests that irrigation
    reduced the variability of yield by allowing more uniform development of tubers
    (Table 6). The reduced variability seemingly increased the potential for making
    better yield predictions. The poor simulation results and large deviation in final
    yields is likely to have been influenced by the high yield variations occurring
    even within the same field trial of different cultivars, which is a known trait
    of sweet potato (Bourke, 1984; Martin and Carmer, 1985; Fielding and Ryder, 1995;
    Ku et al., 2008; Lebot 2009). Further, the demonstrated inability of AquaCrop
    under high-water-stress conditions noted in other studies (Heng et al., 2009;
    Hsiao et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2011) could also have affected the results.
    The lack of solar radiation data in the computation of ETo is also noted again.
    The selective harvesting of plants with marketable tubers also inflated the final
    yields and exaggerated the disparities between measured and simulated data. The
    simulated water use efficiency (WUE) and ETo for rainfed and irrigated sweet potato
    was calculated at all sites using the simulated values from AquaCrop (Table 7).
    The WUE is a measure of how efficiently the crop is using water for yield or biomass
    production and can be expressed as the ratio of biomass (or yield) to evapotranspiration.
    Although the ETo for the irrigated treatment was considerably higher (by 188 mm)
    than for the rainfed treatment, the WUE was nearly identical for both yield and
    biomass. This suggests that WUE can be optimized at this location without irrigation.
    Table 7. Total reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and water use efficiency (WUE)
    simulated by AquaCrop for rainfed and irrigated sweet potato for two sites in
    Jamaica. The WUE values were calculated using simulated values of biomass or yield.
    The ETo data for Devon 2012 was obtained from the Kirkvine station 14 km away
    because the onsite automated weather station at Devon was inoperable in 2012.

    2013 Crop Season Model performance for canopy cover was much improved over 2011/2012,
    with greater agreement between simulated and measured values for the entire crop
    season (Fig. 7). This is also seen in the smaller measures of RMSE (10.9 and 4.5%
    for irrigated and rainfed, respectively) and higher values of E (0.86 for irrigated
    and 0.97 for rainfed) than for the previous crop season (Table 5). The use of
    weather data obtained onsite and more evenly distributed rainfall seemingly improved
    the simulation. Data were also available for the period after senescence. Significantly,
    the ACE software still performed well during this period, notwithstanding the
    dual coloration of leaves. We suggest that ACE has adequate skill to distinguish
    between green and senescent vegetation, which might account for the high agreement
    between measured and simulated values during canopy decline. The ACE software
    fulfills the requirement of high-quality measured data for accurate parameterization
    of AquaCrop noted in other studies (Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2012).
    Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs. measured canopy cover (filled
    circles) and biomass (filled squares) of sweet potato at days after planting (DAP)
    for (a,c) irrigated and (b,d) rainfed treatments at Devon, Manchester, Jamaica,
    in 2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean.
    The accumulation of biomass was well simulated for both treatments, except at
    final harvest, where the model gave an underestimation of 20 to 24% (Table 6).
    The model was slightly more efficient in simulating biomass for irrigated sweet
    potato (E of 0.79 vs. 0.75 for rainfed). The underestimation in the final biomass
    was possibly due to the difference (of 7 d) between the actual harvest date and
    that simulated by the model. It should also be noted that the model assumes that
    there is no further accumulation of biomass once physiological maturity is reached.
    As such, if harvest does not take place on the expected date (and sometimes it
    is not practical to do so), there will be differences between the actual and simulated
    biomass. The identical simulated value for biomass and yields for rainfed and
    irrigated treatments was due to the small amount of irrigated water applied to
    the irrigated plants (equivalent to only 6.8% more total water than for rainfed
    plants). The progression of yield is shown in Fig. 8. Together with the data presented
    in Tables 5 and 6, it is noted that the model was much more proficient at simulating
    rainfed yields (E of 0.90 vs. 0.22 for irrigated). In 2013, water was applied
    according to the evaporative demand of the crop as measured by the moisture probes
    rather than at predetermined intervals by automated irrigation as in 2011/2012.
    The lower yields in the 2013 season compared with those of 2011/2012 are attributed
    to the selective final harvesting (of marketable tubers) in 2012 and the reuse
    of the same plots in the 2013 season. Best practice suggests that, among other
    factors, crop rotation should be done to prevent the bioaccumulation of pests
    (arthropods and pathogens) that have a deleterious effect on yields (Caribbean
    Agricultural Research and Development Institute, 2010). This was, however, not
    possible given the space constraints at Devon. This is also in keeping with the
    practice adopted by farmers due to limitations in land space. Final yields for
    2013 were slightly overestimated by the model, with deviations of 16.5 and 8.7%
    for the irrigated and rainfed treatments, respectively. However, this was a marked
    improvement over the simulations of the previous crop season. The non-selective,
    representative harvesting of tubers and accurate weather data are considered to
    be major contributing factors to this enhancement. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer
    Simulated (line) vs. measured (filled circles) yield of sweet potato at days after
    planting (DAP) for (a) irrigated and (b) rainfed treatments at Devon, Manchester,
    Jamaica, in 2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below
    the mean. From the results for both crop seasons, it is noted that there is often
    correspondence between model simulations of canopy cover with biomass but not
    always with yield. When canopy cover is well simulated, so also is biomass. This
    is expected, given that the model is driven by canopy cover (Raes et al., 2009;
    Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2012). The lack of correspondence for the
    simulation of yield with those of CC and to a lesser extent biomass suggests the
    need for further investigation, particularly because sweet potato is known to
    have cultivar-dependent incongruence between leaf area (canopy cover) and tuber
    yield (Bourke, 1984; Fielding and Ryder, 1995). The inherent differential growth
    rate of the canopy and tubers throughout the crop season (Caribbean Agricultural
    Research and Development Institute, 2010) and lower correspondence between final
    canopy cover and final yield present unique challenges for deriving mean model
    parameters for sweet potato. There was fair agreement (RMSE = 0.79, E = 0.61)
    in the values of ETo computed by the AWS and that computed by the FAO ETo calculator
    (plot not shown). Notwithstanding, there were occasional deviations in some of
    the daily values measured by the AWS, presumably due to the differences in computation
    method. The seasonal totals were close: 534 mm (AWS) vs. 560 mm (FAO calculator),
    a difference of only 4.6%. The general correspondence is important given that
    many of the production areas in Jamaica do not have automatic weather stations.
    As such, ETo might have to be computed by the FAO ETo calculator, which can give
    reasonable estimates even with limited weather parameters. The simulated WUE values
    (Table 7) for yield of 1.38 (rainfed) and 1.39 (irrigated) kg m−3 are close to
    the upper range for C3 crops like sweet potato (Sadras et al., 2007; Erickson
    et al., 2012). This emphasizes the important role for sweet potato cultivation
    in local and regional food security in light of projections for reduced water
    availability (Taylor et al., 2013). Ebony Park, Clarendon (2013) At Ebony Park,
    the AquaCrop simulation for canopy cover did not agree well with measured values
    for the irrigated crop (RMSE = 17.25, E = 0.29). However, there was a better fit
    for the rainfed plants (RMSE = 16.06, E = 0.67). Actual canopy development followed
    a slightly different pattern from that simulated by the model (Fig. 9). Figure
    9 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs. measured canopy cover (filled circles)
    and biomass (filled squares) of sweet potato at days after planting (DAP) for
    (a,c) irrigated and (b,d) rainfed treatments at Ebony Park, Clarendon, Jamaica,
    in 2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean.
    The model underpredicted growth in both treatments up to 41 DAP, more so for the
    irrigated treatment, and then overpredicted the canopy cover for at least 30 d.
    However, there was better agreement as canopy closure was approached. The divergence
    of measured vs. simulated values in the decline phase was in part due to a heavy
    rainfall episode that occurred on 120 DAP. The added moisture served to stimulate
    further growth in the canopy, so that even at harvest a considerable portion of
    the canopy was still green, i.e., there was limited senescence. There was better
    agreement also between simulated and measured biomass for the rainfed (E = 0.89)
    treatment than for the irrigated (E = 0.39) treatment. The simulated and measured
    rainfed biomass values were nearly identical except at the final harvest (Fig.
    9c), which the model underpredicted by only 7.8%. For the irrigated plants, AquaCrop
    only slightly underestimated the biomass up to 96 DAP but gave a significant underprediction
    of 51.4% for the final measurement. The variance between the measured and simulated
    values at the end of the crop season was affected by the earlier maturity date
    of the model, which differed by 34 d from the actual harvest date. Linear interpolation
    between 32 and 135 DAP (R2 = 0.98) suggested that the actual deviation could be
    lower (–23.8%), with improved values of RMSE (2.75) and E (0.79). The robustness
    of the model in reasonably estimating the biomass up until just before final harvest
    is notable, particularly in light of the poorly simulated canopy cover. Overall,
    the model was efficient at simulating yields for the irrigated (E = 0.64) but
    not rainfed (E = –13.48) treatment (Fig. 10; Table 5). There was good agreement
    with measured yield up to 65 DAP for both rainfed and irrigated sweet potato.
    As the crop developed, differences between modeled and observed values increased,
    resulting in an underestimation of the final yield for irrigated plants of 34%
    and a large overestimation of 182% for rainfed plants (Fig. 8–10; Table 6). The
    underprediction for the irrigated treatment was influenced by the earlier maturity
    date in the model relative to the actual harvest date. The large disparity in
    the final simulated yield for rainfed sweet potato reflects the failure of these
    plants to form tubers. It was noted at harvest that very few tubers had formed
    in any cultivar under rainfed conditions at Ebony Park. Compared with the irrigated
    treatment, rainfed plants received only about half the total amount of water.
    Compared with the crop at Devon in the same season, the adverse effects of 27%
    less rainfall at Ebony Park was compounded by the higher evaporative demand (20%
    higher ETo). Without taking into account evapotranspiration, the recommended minimum
    rainfall is 750 mm for sweet potato production (Caribbean Agricultural Research
    and Development Institute, 2010), about 60% more than that experienced by the
    rainfed crop at Ebony Park. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs.
    measured (filled circles) yield of sweet potato at days after planting (DAP) for
    (a) irrigated and (b) rainfed treatments at Ebony Park, Clarendon, Jamaica, in
    2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean. Harvest
    index in AquaCrop for grain crops is assumed to linearly increase from anthesis
    onward, after a lag phase. This type of yield development does not occur in root
    crops like sweet potato, which has differential growth rates throughout the season
    (Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute, 2010), partly accounting
    for the disagreement between measured and simulated yields. Hsiao and Heng (2011)
    also noted that the model tended to underestimate biomass or yield under the lowest
    water supply (24% irrigation). Due to poor development of tubers in the rainfed
    treatment, it was difficult to accurately assess the skill of the model to simulate
    rainfed production at this location. The WUE at this location was higher (than
    at Devon) for both yield and biomass (Table 7), which further confirmed the crop''s
    ability to successfully adapt its productivity to different environmental conditions.
    CONCLUSIONS Overall, it appears that parameterizing root and tuber crops in AquaCrop
    is more challenging than for other types of crops. Hsiao and Heng (2011) reported
    that potato (of all the crops already parameterized in AquaCrop) has the least
    reliable parameterization. Although significant changes were made to the Irish
    potato parameters in arriving at the current ones used for sweet potato, additional
    work is needed to refine the parameterization and to test other water-limited
    treatments, including deficit irrigation. Further data are needed from additional
    locations and crop seasons than the two used in this study to rigorously test
    the parameters derived. This testing should take into account the interactions
    that can take place between cultivars and their environments, location, and date
    of sowing (Fielding and Ryder, 1995). Additionally, more frequent sampling of
    biomass than could be done in this study would provide more insights into the
    physiological influences on the development of tubers in sweet potato and improve
    performance of the model during the crop life. The dynamics of belowground crops
    like sweet potato need to be further explored, especially the impacts of water
    stress on the harvest index. Other studies (Hsiao et al., 2009; Heng et al., 2009)
    have suggested that AquaCrop does not simulate well under high-water-stress conditions.
    The good agreement between simulated and measured canopy cover (especially for
    the 2013 season at Devon) suggests that the ACE software can be used in the estimation
    of canopy cover from inexpensive digital photographs. The ACE software also appears
    to overcome some of the limitations faced by other techniques like the Green Crop
    Tracker (Liu and Pattey, 2010) that automate CC estimation, particularly as canopy
    closure and senescence are approached. With access to more reliable values of
    CC, existing relationships between CC and leaf area index can be validated or
    refined. Testing of the software on other crops should be undertaken. The results
    presented in this study suggest that the AquaCrop model gives fairly accurate
    prediction of sweet potato yield and biomass under both rainfed and irrigated
    conditions. Canopy cover was reasonably well simulated by the model, but some
    divergence was noted for biomass and yield. The overall simulation of biomass
    was good, with deviations of <28% for four out of six simulations, and season-long
    performance of the model was commendable, with E values of 0.29 to 0.97 for the
    four crops in 2013. The simulation of yield presented more difficult challenges,
    especially given the differential rate of tuber development in sweet potato throughout
    the crop season. The incorporation of sweet potato into AquaCrop adds a second
    belowground crop and the first root crop to its portfolio of crops. While further
    work is needed to refine the parameterization and to test the parameters across
    a wider combination of cultivars, climates, and soils, an important first step
    has been made in encouraging the use of AquaCrop as a tool for the agricultural
    sector in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Global to Local

    segmentation: 1439s/km2) compared with visual interpretation (Landsat TM: 109s/km2;
    SPOT: 166s/km2; and aerial photography: 276s/km2); however, processing speed of
    semi-automated techniques can be further increased without compromising accuracy.

    John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. INTRODUCTION Water resource development threatens biodiversity
    in the world''s rivers and wetlands (Nilsson et al., 2005; Sparks, 1995; Vörösmarty
    et al., 2010), altering physical processes such as hydrological dynamics and sediment
    transport upon which aquatic ecosystems depend (Tockner and Stanford, 2002). Floodplains,
    key geomorphologic features of large river systems, are among the world''s most
    modified landscapes (Bayley, 1995; Sparks, 1995; Tockner and Stanford, 2002).
    Earthworks on the world''s floodplains facilitate flood mitigation, erosion control,
    river transport and provision of extractive water. Levees, channels, off-river
    storages and tanks are the most common earthworks throughout most human-settled
    or agricultural floodplains in the USA (~40 000 km) (FEMA, 1992), Europe (Carluer
    and Marsily, 2004), Middle East (Hritz and Wilkinson, 2006; Jones et al., 2008),
    Asia (Xu, 1993; Tsujimoto et al., 2006) and Australia (Kingsford and Thomas, 2002;
    Callow and Smettem, 2009; Steinfeld and Kingsford, 2011). Earthworks block or
    confine lateral flow pathways, changing flood frequency and often disconnecting
    the main river channel from its floodplain (Gergel, 2002; Steinfeld and Kingsford,
    2011). Encroaching floodplain development increased flow stage (Criss and Shock,
    2001; Heine and Pinter, 2011) and flood risk (Yin and Li, 2001). Some temperate
    and semi-arid floodplains have been disconnected almost entirely from their channel,
    mainly by earthworks: 80% of the Middle Elbe River floodplain (Leyer, 2004); 90%
    of the Lower Mississippi floodplain (Kesel, 2003); 73% of the Macquarie floodplain
    (Steinfeld and Kingsford, 2011); and 59% of the Lower Murrumbidgee floodplain
    (Kingsford and Thomas, 2002). This disconnection alters inundation patterns, affecting
    ecosystem productivity and function (Tockner and Stanford, 2002; Thoms, 2003;
    Opperman et al., 2009) including compromised growth, recruitment and survival
    of flood-dependent vegetation (Slavich et al., 1999; Steinfeld and Kingsford,
    2011), reduced aquatic habitat availability (Larsen et al., 2006), impaired delivery
    of inorganic and organic particulates (Thoms, 2003) and reduced microbial activity
    (Kang and Stanley, 2005). Little is known of the non-linearities (Werner and McNamara,
    2007), lag effects (Heine and Pinter, 2011) and compounded disturbances including
    dams and climate change (Gergel, 2002) associated with earthworks in regulated
    and unregulated rivers. Earthworks may opportunistically harvest lateral flows,
    compromising water security for downstream users and ecosystems, a considerable
    concern with increasing competition for limited water supplies, investment in
    environmental water and presence of water markets (Vörösmarty et al., 2010). Knowledge
    of earthwork distribution at multiple scales is critical for effective floodplain
    management (Stein et al., 2002; Thoms et al., 2005), particularly for managing
    flood risk, licensing, regulating access to water resources and assessing ecological
    impacts. However, detecting earthworks is technically challenging because, unlike
    dams, they are small, ubiquitous structures, varied in morphology and distributed
    across large regions of public and private land (Steinfeld and Kingsford, 2011).
    Past scholarly investigations manually identified and digitized earthworks using
    remote-sensing imagery and/or field observations to assess hydrological impacts
    (Carluer and Marsily, 2004: aerial photography and field observations; Colvin
    and Moffitt, 2009: aerial photography), ecological impacts (Kingsford and Thomas,
    2004: Landsat TM; Steinfeld and Kingsford, 2011: SPOT) and trace ancient earthworks
    (Adams, 1981: aerial photography and Landsat TM; Crutchley, 2006: LiDAR; Erickson,
    2000: aerial photography). Few organizations currently hold comprehensive spatial
    data sets of earthworks due to the labour and financial investment required in
    manually acquiring location, orientation, height, classification, construction
    date and licence status for each structure. Despite this, increasing cumulative
    impacts of earthworks continue to reduce water security, increase flood risk and
    degrade freshwater ecosystems. There is a clear imperative for developing high
    quality, cost-effective techniques to generate accurate, inexpensive spatial data
    sets of earthworks at multiple scales. Highly functional and versatile geographic
    information systems (GIS) can analyse and compile spatial information at large
    spatial scales. Cost-effective and reliable semi-automated GIS techniques are
    used to detect linear features such as road networks (Wang et al., 1992; Baltsavias
    and Zhang, 2005). These techniques require human guidance or correction leaving
    the precise, time-consuming or repetitive tasks to software (Gruen and Li, 1997;
    Doucette et al., 2001). Early investigations into semi-automated extraction of
    drainage networks proved challenging in low relief floodplain environments (O''Callaghan
    and Mark, 1984) but this was soon overcome (Jenson and Domingue, 1988). Semi-automated
    techniques for detecting natural drainage networks have been extensively developed
    (Tribe, 1992) but application to artificial structures has only recently occurred
    (Bailly et al., 2008). We aimed to develop new semi-automated GIS techniques for
    locating and classifying floodplain earthworks, comparing their efficiency and
    efficacy with traditional visual techniques. METHODS The regulated Gwydir River
    forms a characteristic dryland floodplain within the Murray–Darling Basin, eastern
    Australia (Figure 1), with low rainfall (500 mm/yr), flat relief (average elevation
    decreases 63 cm/km across 150 km) and large area (>1 million km2). Episodic flood
    pulses inundate floodplain, channels, pools and swamps. The floodplain supports
    aquatic fauna and flora, floodplain grazing, dryland agriculture and irrigated
    agriculture predominantly for cotton. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Twenty-four quadrats (calibration and validation) were randomly selected across
    the Gwydir floodplain of the Murray–Darling Basin, southeastern Australia Four
    classes of earthworks exist on the Gwydir floodplain (Figure 2). Levees (embankments
    or dykes/dikes) are long, straight or curvilinear, occasionally vegetated, earthen
    ridges (>0.1 m) that act as flow barriers for agriculture, flood mitigation and
    erosion control (Figure 2A). Channels (ditches, canals or trenches) are elongated,
    straight or curvilinear, open-cut depressions for water transportation. They are
    usually flanked by levees (Figure 2B). Off-river storages are impermeable sections
    of the floodplain (≥0.02 km2) usually enclosed by levees (>1-m high) for water
    retention (Figure 2C). Tanks (farm dams, ring dams or turkey nests) are depressions
    (<0.02 km2) for storing stock and domestic water, usually surrounded by levees
    and sometimes fed by drains (Figure 2D). Other features on the Gwydir floodplain,
    not defined as earthworks, included roads, dirt tracks, built-up land, natural
    watercourses and cleared agricultural land. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Four classes of earthworks on the Gwydir floodplain. (A) Levees were earthen barriers
    up to 5 m in height. (B) Channels distributed water and were usually bound by
    levees. (C) Off-river storages (≥0.02 km2) stored water for irrigation. (d) Tanks
    (<0.02 km2) stored stock and domestic water, sometimes rainfall fed by channels,
    flanked by small levees, called bore drains We developed three semi-automated
    earthwork detection techniques and then investigated their efficacy and efficiency
    compared with visual interpretation techniques on the Gwydir floodplain. For model
    training, five independent calibration quadrats (1 km2, Figure 1) were randomly
    selected within the LiDAR coverage (Fugro Spatial Solutions Pty Ltd, 2009). For
    model validation, 23 independent quadrats were initially selected within LiDAR
    coverage of the Gwydir floodplain (north 6 774 700; south 6 736 900; east 695 400;
    west 775 800, zone 55), but four were removed because of discrepancies in development
    across imagery sources leading to temporal error, leaving 19 validation quadrats
    (1 km2, Figure 1). Each quadrat was buffered by 1 km to prevent truncated earthworks
    causing edge effects during accuracy assessment, but this was excluded from assessment.
    Quadrats were randomly stratified across four earthwork density classes (channel
    length per square kilometre): 0; <0.5; 0.5–1; and >1, calculated from a national
    channel (canal) inventory (GA, 2006) using a kernel density analysis with a 2-km
    bandwidth. All quadrats were randomly spaced at least 2 km from the nearest quadrat
    to minimize spatial autocorrelation. Earthwork detection and classification time
    were recorded per quadrat for each technique. Calibration time for semi-automated
    analyses was not recorded because of high variability due to feature complexity
    and user ability. Performance was evaluated using standard map accuracy metrics
    in comparison with a reference. Technique 1: visual interpretation Visual interpreters
    independently digitized and classified operational and remnant earthworks in 19
    validation quadrats. For this study, 30 participants (age 20–43 years) were randomly
    allocated to one of three equal-sized groups for analysis of commercial or free
    imagery of differing resolution: digital aerial photography (0.3 m), SPOT (2.5 m)
    and Landsat TM (30 m). Groups were gender-balanced by spreading 12 men and 18
    women evenly among imagery sources. Interpreters experienced with ArcGIS software
    or familiar with floodplain earthworks were randomly distributed among groups
    (Landsat TM: 4; SPOT: 5; aerial photography: 2). Digital aerial photography was
    captured using spectrum medium format digital cameras (February–September 2008).
    Raw SPOT imagery, acquired in 2004, was pan-sharpened and displayed in pseudo-natural
    colour. Two Landsat TM scenes (March 2008 and February 2009) were the nearest
    available cloud-free image selected from online archives, displayed in natural
    colour (USGS, 2009). All imagery was georectified into the Map Grid of Australia
    Zone 55 coordinate system (Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994). Participants initially
    viewed a PowerPoint presentation (Supporting Information), which familiarized
    users with different earthworks, tested their ability to recognize earthworks
    and outlined instructions for digitizing using ArcGIS version 9.2 (ESRI, 2008).
    Participants zoomed to each quadrat, started the stopwatch, visually examined
    the quadrat, manually digitized and classified earthworks, saved their data, then
    stopped the stopwatch and recorded time taken. Visual interpreters did not estimate
    earthwork height as stereo pair images for height derivation were unavailable.
    Post-processing eliminated overshooting lines and ensured topological and attribute
    consistency. Linear earthworks were assigned an areal extent that represented
    a procedural buffer of the minimum mappable distance at the scale users were mapping
    (4-m wide). A preliminary practice quadrat was digitized by each interpreter but
    excluded from the main study due to learning effects (Christensen, 1991). The
    sequence of 19 validation quadrats was randomized for each participant to balance
    carryover effects (Griffin et al., 2006) such as learning, fatigue and sensitisation
    that may bias results. Learning effects were quantified by comparing the metrics
    for first and last quadrats. This last quadrat was an exact copy of the first
    but rotated 90° counterclockwise to ensure it was unrecognisable. Technique 2:
    image segmentation (semi-automated) Image segmentation is a semi-automated technique
    for earthwork delineation and classification, driven by expert knowledge. For
    image segmentation, we aggregated pixels within a raster image into objects and
    then classified objects by shape, spectra and texture. We used georectified, non-compressed
    SPOT imagery (bands 1, 2, 3), resampled to 1 m using a nearest neighbour filter
    (ESRI, 2008). A multi-resolution segmentation algorithm in Definiens Developer
    8 software (Definiens, 2009) aggregated adjacent pixels until object homogeneity
    approached a specified threshold. Eight thresholds were assessed (300, 250, 200,
    150, 100, 50, 25 and 10) with 25 best-matching earthwork scales. Homogeneity was
    defined by object shape, colour, compactness and smoothness. We weighted these
    properties to best preserve elongated earthworks (shape: 0.9, colour: 0.1, smoothness/compactness:
    0). Classification rules were developed for calibration earthwork classes using
    spectral, geometric, topological, contextual and functional properties of the
    earthworks (Appendix A Definiens, 2009). Rules were developed using the K-nearest
    neighbour classifier, a lazy learning algorithm (Aha, 1997) which stores raw data
    until the closest calibration object is classified (k = 1) in multi-dimensional
    feature space. Subsumptive categories created for channels (wet and dry) and levees
    (irrigation and bore drain) improved classification by partitioning within-class
    object diversity. Three additional unclassified classes (cultivated, uncultivated
    and road) segregated background from earthworks. Technique 3: digital elevation
    model (DEM) analysis (semi-automated) Earthworks were narrow regions of abrupt
    relief intruding into and protruding from the floodplain. We were unable to identify
    earthworks by elevation thresholds because the floodplain was gradually sloped,
    so we developed a semi-automated technique to extract earthworks from a DEM regardless
    of slope. The DEM was based on LiDAR (acquired February–September 2008). LiDAR
    point clouds integrated airborne sensor trajectory and airborne laser scanner
    range measurements, using the Leica ALS50-IIM ALS and Leica ADS40 digital sensor
    (0.13-m horizontal resolution; 0.06-m vertical resolution) (Fugro Spatial Solutions
    Pty Ltd, 2009). Ground returns were extracted, corrected for sensor displacement
    and orientation offset and interpolated as a 1-m DEM. We excluded natural channels
    on the basis of the Geoscience Australia Geodata Topo 250 K Series 3 (GA, 2006).
    Earthworks were located where DEM elevation differed from an earthwork-free DEM,
    then removed from the DEM by assigning the median height of absolute DEM pixels
    within an annulus-shaped filter (inner radius 25 m; outer radius 30 m) to the
    central cell. After two iterations, local earthwork relief (<25 m) was eliminated
    but natural landscape undulations, e.g. hills (>30 m) were retained. Adjacent
    pixels exceeding ±0.1 m elevation difference were aggregated into polygons, the
    vertical accuracy of LiDAR. Single, isolated pixels were discarded. Polygon height
    was based on the intersecting DEM difference contour line (0.1-m interval) with
    maximum absolute value. Area, perimeter, compactness index (perimeter2/area) (de
    Smith et al., 2006) and vertices were calculated for each polygon. A regression
    model was calibrated for each earthwork class on the basis of shape and height
    variables from classified objects (2%) within the five independent calibration
    quadrats (1 km2). We used multinomial logistic regression to predict odds of an
    earthwork class relative to a ‘non-earthwork’, with continuous independent variables
    and dichotomous dependent variables: where r = maximum height above smoothed DEM,
    c = compactness index, v = number of polygon vertices and A, B, C and D were statistically
    significant coefficients derived from the calibration set. Four calibrated regression
    models for levees, channels, off-river storages and tanks respectively were produced:
    Levee Odds = e3.228r + 0.008c − 0.003v − 6.322 pA < 0.01, pB < 0.01, pC < 0.01
    Channel Odds = e-8.393r + 0.005c − 6.670 pA < 0.01, pB < 0.01 Off-river storage
    Odds = e−5.83r − 0.012c + 0.005v − 6.010 pA < 0.01, pB = 0.04, pC = 0.03 Tank
    Odds = e−9.564r − 6.498 pA < 0.01 The model yielding the highest probability (Odds/(1 + Odds))
    was used to classify each object if probability exceeded 95%, otherwise classification
    was non-earthwork. Technique 4: integrated analysis (semi-automated) Integrated
    analysis combined two-dimensional and three-dimensional imagery sources (SPOT,
    Landsat TM and LiDAR DEM), using semi-automated image segmentation. The difference
    DEM (see Section on 4) was segmented using a multi-resolution algorithm (Definiens,
    2009) with a homogeneity index threshold of 50, which best preserved linear earthworks
    compared with other thresholds tested (300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 25 and 10). Additional
    segmentation criteria promoted elongated objects by weighting object shape (0.9)
    over colour (0.1) and smoothness/compactness (0). We developed simple, transferrable
    classification rules for calibration objects based on six of 59 spectral, geometric,
    topological and contextual properties (Table 1). Object density and object border
    contrast distinguished elongated levees and channels. Object density measured
    the distribution of object pixels in space; the most dense shape is a square and
    the least dense is threadlike (Definiens, 2009). Border contrast was the ratio
    of mean relative height, based on the different DEMs (see Section on 4), of outer
    and inner pixels along the object border. Water bodies were identified using Landsat
    TM (object mean band 1: 0.45–0.52 µm) and SPOT imagery (ratio of object mean band
    1 (0.50–0.59 µm) to object mean band 3 (0.78–0.89 µm)). Water bodies were classified
    as an off-river storage using area and border index (jaggedness) or a tank using
    area and object density. Table 1. Objects were assigned a fuzzy class membership

    using fuzzy set theory to describe membership strength and incorporate uncertainty.
    Parameters were based on existing knowledge and visual experimentation of selected
    properties, defined iteratively for each property by setting maximum and minimum
    membership values and specifying a Gaussian or linear set boundary. Off-river
    storages and tanks were assigned precise values as membership rules were known
    (≥0.02 and <0.02 km2, respectively; Steinfeld and Kingsford, 2011). Earthworks
    were classified only if membership exceeded 0.1. Thematic and spatial accuracy
    We quantified thematic and spatial accuracy (Table 2) using a spatial reference
    data set (5-m pixel size), compiled manually by an experienced image analyst,
    utilizing all available georectified imagery: LiDAR DEM, digital aerial photography,
    Landsat TM (7 bands), SPOT (3 bands) and the national channel layer (GA, 2006).
    Channels, levees, off-river storages and tanks were manually digitized as polygons
    in ArcGIS (ESRI, 2008) and classified according to height, visual properties and
    contextual information. Visual interpretation error matrices were averaged within
    image source and standard error reflected variation among and within interpreters
    (Allan, 1999). Classification error results were reported with a 25-m reference
    polygon buffer, which best tolerated positional displacement compared with 0 and
    12.5 m buffers. Non-buffered error matrix values were used for unclassified predictions
    (top row of error matrix), as buffering falsely lowered producer''s accuracy when
    pixels predicted as unclassified overlayed reference buffer zones. The resulting
    matrix accounted for positional offset of predicted earthwork pixels without distorting
    producer''s accuracy. Carryover effects for visual interpretation were quantified
    by differencing accuracy metrics (overall accuracy and kappa), between initial
    and final quadrats for each individual, and then averaged across each imagery
    group. We quantified spatial accuracy at a 1-m scale (16% and 17% of median levee
    and channel width, respectively). To partition positional accuracy from classification
    accuracy, results were grouped according to displacement character: no displacement
    (0 m), boundary irregularities due to image misregistration or human error (0–12.5 m),
    displacement (12.5–100 m) and incorrectly classified rather than inaccurately
    positioned (>100 m; Foody, 2006). Table 2. Thematic (A–D; Cohen, 1960; Story and

    earthwork maps produced from visual interpretation and semi-automated techniques
    (Figure 3). Image segmentation and integrated analysis overestimated total classified
    extent of earthworks, whereas DEM analysis and visual interpretation underestimated
    earthworks (Table 3). Total classified extent was influenced by earthwork abundance
    and volume (Figure 3). All techniques detected four earthwork classes, except
    for DEM analysis (no off-river storages). Integrated analysis was the only technique
    where ranked percentage of earthwork class corresponded to the reference. Figure

    ORS, off-river storage; DEM, digital elevation model. Mapping performance varied
    for earthworks classes and no technique performed best for all classes (Figure 4).
    Consideration of class-based accuracy metrics is therefore critical for interpreting
    results. For levees, DEM analysis had highest user''s and producer''s accuracy.
    For channels, integrated analysis yielded near-perfect results for user''s accuracy
    but image segmentation performed poorly (Figure 4). For visual interpretation
    of channels, user''s and producer''s accuracy increased with image resolution.
    DEM analysis performed best for producer''s accuracy, although some small channels
    containing dense vegetation remained unidentified. For off-river storages, image
    segmentation yielded highest user''s accuracy with only 2911 of 3189 pixels correctly
    classified (Table 4). Visual interpretation of Landsat TM was best for producer''s
    accuracy, with accuracy decreasing with increasing image resolution (Table 4).
    Thirty visual interpreters detected more filled off-river storages (16) than empty
    (11). No off-river storages were detected using DEM analysis. For tanks, visual
    interpretation of Landsat TM yielded highest user''s accuracy and DEM analysis
    yielded highest producer''s accuracy. Positional error acted non-uniformly across
    earthwork classes, causing producer''s accuracy for levees to be underestimated
    at zero displacement (0 m: 38.64%; 12.5 m: 50.43%; 25 m: 52.40%) but not for off-river
    storages (0 m: 32.10%; 12.5 m: 32.42%; 25 m: 32.51%) in the integrated analysis
    (Appendix B). Positional accuracy results are shown in Figure 5. Only visual interpreters
    digitized a small number of earthworks with zero positional error and this improved
    with image resolution (Figure 5). Visual interpretation of aerial photography
    had the highest percentage of earthworks within 0-m and 12.5-m thresholds (9.63%
    and 66.97%, respectively). DEM analysis had the highest percentage of earthworks
    in the 25-m and 100-m thresholds (78.2% and 100%, respectively). Image segmentation
    yielded the lowest positional accuracy for all thresholds (12.5 and 25 m were
    15.56%; 100 m was 35.56%). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Distribution
    of root mean square error (RMSE; m) for earthworks, expressed as a percentage,
    across image analysis techniques, plotted in order of increasing RMSE. DEM, digital
    elevation model There were clear differences in efficiency among techniques (Figure 6).
    Visual interpretation was more efficient than semi-automated techniques for 19
    quadrats. Average digitization time per quadrat (1 km2) increased with image resolution
    as interpreters investigated image detail (Landsat TM: 109 s; SPOT: 166 s; aerial
    photography: 276 s). DEM analysis (27 418 s) and integrated analysis (27 737 s)
    relied on the processing-intensive DEM differencing procedure. By comparison,
    image segmentation was significantly faster (1439 s). There was no evidence for
    a trade-off between time and classification accuracy, or average positional accuracy
    (Figure 6A–C). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Scatterplots showing
    (A) overall accuracy, (B) Kappa and (C) positional accuracy (average root mean
    square error; RMSE), relative to average time taken to digitize a 1km2) quadrat.
    Error bars show standard error variation among ten visual interpreters (A and
    B) and among earthworks (C). DEM, digital elevation model Our comparison of identical
    initial and final quadrat (rotated 90º) mapped by visual interpreters suggested
    visual interpreters experienced carryover effects. Overall accuracy declined (mean
    difference: −0.028 ± 0.001 (SE); n = 22). Kappa also decreased (mean difference:
    −0.075 ± 0.021 (SE); n = 14) although there were some improvements (mean difference:
    0.040 ± 0.010 (SE); n = 8). Positional accuracy improved for the majority (mean
    difference −36.30 ± 12.77 m (SE); n = 11) but decreased for others (mean difference
    38.65 ± 8.78 m (SE); n = 5). DISCUSSION Floodplains cannot be managed adequately
    without knowledge of earthwork distribution. It is critical to locate earthworks
    so their impacts on ecology, flood risk and water security can be managed (Criss
    and Shock, 2001; Leyer, 2004; Konrad et al., 2008; Opperman et al., 2009; Steinfeld
    and Kingsford, 2011). We demonstrated that GIS techniques can be used to determine
    the distribution of earthworks with different implications for accuracy, efficiency
    and cost. Semi-automated techniques for detecting and classifying floodplain structures
    had clear advantages in performance over visual interpretation (Figures 4 and
    5). With repeatability, transferability and economy of scale, semi-automated techniques
    for producing spatial data sets of earthworks could be implemented across large
    scales and provide fundamental information for managing floodplains. Some techniques
    may be preferable depending on the context and application. Semi-automated analyses
    Digital elevation model analysis outperformed all techniques for kappa and overall
    accuracy in detection of most earthworks (Figure 4). Spatial accuracy for DEM
    analysis was almost equivalent to the highest performing visual interpretation
    technique (aerial photography; Figure 5). DEM analysis was not sufficient for
    detecting flat-based off-river storages because the technique relied on elevation
    differencing. This could be improved by defining off-river storages as the area
    bounded by levees (>4-m height), incorporating spectral information or integrating
    techniques with superior off-river storage detection (Figure 4). Positional accuracy
    was low for DEM analysis because there were few misclassified earthworks; however,
    errors arose from consistently wider boundary delineation than the reference.
    Image segmentation relied on spectral reflectance, so water-filled channels and
    off-river storages within dry surroundings were well detected but tanks were often
    misclassified (poor user''s accuracy; Table 4) as their characteristics varied
    considerably: filled, not filled, vegetated and non-vegetated. Low user''s accuracy
    (Figure 4) and high root mean square error (RMSE) (64% of earthworks >100 m; Figure 5)
    occurred because bright, elongated streaks within furrowed fields were incorrectly
    classified as levees. This could be overcome using integrated analysis which segmented
    furrowed fields on the basis of relief rather than spectral information, improving
    user''s accuracy (Figures 4 and 5). However, integrated analysis with spectral
    and elevation data did not exceed overall accuracy of DEM analysis, suggesting
    spectral information adds little value where elevation data are available, except
    for off-river storages and water-filled features impenetrable by LiDAR. Visual
    analyses Visual interpreters traced along earthwork centrelines, not boundaries,
    creating narrow earthworks contained within the reference with zero displacement
    (Figure 5). Visual interpreters misclassified some levees as gravel roads, dirt
    tracks, fence lines, field boundaries and dry channels, resulting in low user''s
    accuracies (Figure 4). Road maps and cadastral information would aid classification.
    Visual interpreters had trouble detecting vegetated levees and levees flanking
    channels (poor producer''s accuracy; Figure 4). Full or partially filled off-river
    storages were 45% more likely to be detected than empty storages; selecting images
    with filled off-river storages would improve accuracy. Paradoxically, off-river
    storages were more successfully detected using coarse rather than fine resolution
    imagery (Figure 4C). Only five of 20 off-river storages were identified using
    high-resolution aerial photography, but their bounding levees were mostly detected
    (17 of 20). Some dry, vegetated off-river storages were overlooked by interpreters
    not trained to recognize them. Improvements in user''s and producer''s accuracy
    with image resolution (Figure 4B and C) were probably because irrigation pumps,
    pipes and erosion rills became more discernible. Cost There were clear cost implications,
    as digitization time depended on technique (Figure 6). Visual interpretation was
    efficient for small regions but not large floodplains, offering no economy of
    scale. Visual interpreters would take approximately 151 (Landsat TM), 230 (SPOT)
    and 383 h (aerial photography) to detect earthworks in a 5000-km2 floodplain.
    Digitization speed may improve marginally with experience but substantial increases
    would probably compromise accuracy. For the same floodplain, pre-calibrated semi-automated
    techniques would require 38 524 (image segmentation), 38 081 (DEM analysis) and
    1999 h (integrated analysis) with a dual core 2.53-GHz processor and 2-GB RAM.
    Time savings from parallel processing and/or distributed processing and increased
    computer power could increase processing speeds without affecting the quality
    of results, making semi-automated techniques an efficient alternative to visual
    interpretation. Importantly, semi-automated processing time is not affected by
    factors influencing visual processing time (e.g. expertise, image resolution,
    earthwork density and land cover heterogeneity). Furthermore, semi-automated methods
    offer complete operational autonomy in detecting earthworks and assigning their
    attributes. Labour costs are only required for initial investment in algorithm
    development and model set up. Management implications Earthwork detection techniques
    can be applied to floodplain wetlands worldwide for ecological impact assessment,
    hydrological modelling, flood risk management and water security protection (Table 5).
    End-user applications and accuracy assessment are critical considerations when
    determining the most appropriate technique for producing spatial data sets of
    earthworks, given variation in classification accuracy (Figure 4B and C; Cihlar
    et al., 1998). We recommend integrating techniques to improve mapping accuracy
    for specific applications (Table 5). For example, image segmentation at a broad
    scale may be followed by visual interpretation (Landsat TM or aerial photography)
    or DEM analysis for examining hotspots. These techniques and accuracy metrics
    may be used to define quality standards for spatial data sets of earthworks. For
    the Gwydir floodplain, earthworks maps could be used to critique the effectiveness
    of floodplain management guidelines (WRC, 1978) and to improve the delivery of
    environmental flows to Ramsar wetlands through scenario testing of earthwork configurations
    (Wilson et al., 2009). On a global scale, such techniques could increase our understanding
    of the important, and often overlooked, role of earthworks in governing hydrology
    in floodplain wetlands globally, where biodiversity is among the most threatened
    of all ecosystems worldwide (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Table 5.

    2006) High spatial accuracy, height data DEM analysis DEM, digital elevation model.
    There is considerable value in widespread use of semi-automated techniques. They
    are systematic, providing consistent results regardless of the interpreter. They
    also captured small, isolated, vegetated earthworks such as tanks that were sometimes
    overlooked by visual interpreters. The national inventory (GA, 2006) based on
    visual interpretation, contained only 119 km of channels, about half of the length
    of channels in our reference data set (231 km). Semi-automated techniques may
    have systematic errors that are normally easier to overcome than random errors
    or other biases associated with subjective techniques (Benz et al., 2004). Reduced
    classification accuracy over time was due to carryover effects including fatigue,
    sensitisation and increasingly hurried digitization. Increased RMSE over time
    was likely due to improved manual dexterity and better utilization of zoom functions.
    These results captured interpreters'' first exposure to digitizing earthworks
    but ongoing visual interpretation was not likely to produce such pronounced effects.
    Global portability of semi-automated techniques depends on the maintenance of
    spectral characteristics and spatial resolution. Image segmentation and integrated
    analysis tolerate minor spectral variation in input imagery due to cloud cover,
    moisture, time of day and seasonality, because they incorporate fuzzy membership
    functions to accommodate uncertainty in sensor measurements (Benz et al., 2004).
    Image pre-processing (e.g. enhancing or suppressing earthworks using thresholding
    or contrast stretching) improves performance of techniques (Gopi, 2008). For global
    applicability of techniques, we suggest rapid visual assessment of imagery to
    ensure absence of floodwaters, cloud, shadow or canopy that may obscure earthworks
    and exclusion of floodplain lakes and aeolian formations not present on the Gwydir
    floodplain. Techniques developed for low relief floodplains are likely to be applicable
    in regions of diverse topography, provided shadows do not obscure earthworks (image
    segmentation and integrated analysis only) and earthwork relief is sharper than
    natural floodplain undulations (30 m; DEM analysis only). We recommend a rapid,
    post-classification visual assessment to confirm large earthworks (>3 km) were
    detected as models were calibrated to objects fitting within an envelope of 3 × 3 km.
    CONCLUSION Knowledge of the spatial distribution of earthworks is seldom available
    or incomplete because of prohibitive cost of mapping earthworks across broad extents.
    Floodplain development continues without adequate assessment of consequences for
    humans and ecosystems. We showed semi-automated earthwork detection techniques
    outperformed visual interpretation in accuracy. We recommend semi-automated techniques
    for ecological impact assessment, hydrological modelling, flood risk management
    and water security protection. Advances in earthwork mapping will improve the
    science and management of floodplain earthworks and their hydrological impacts
    in agriculturally and ecologically important regions worldwide. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

  description: 'Like natural ecosystems, the cyber ecosystem comprises a variety of
    diverse participants - private firms, non-profits, governments, individuals, processes,
    and cyber devices (computers, software, and communications technologies) - that
    interact for multiple purposes. Today in cyberspace, intelligent adversaries exploit
    vulnerabilities and create incidents that propagate at machine speeds to steal
    identities, resources, and advantage. The rising volume and virulence of these
    attacks have the potential to degrade our economic capacity and threaten basic
    services that underpin our modern way of life. This discussion paper explores
    the idea of a healthy, resilient - and fundamentally more secure - cyber ecosystem
    of the future, in which cyber participants, including cyber devices, are able
    to work together in near-real time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit
    the spread of attacks across participating devices, minimize the consequences
    of attacks, and recover to a trusted state. In this future cyber ecosystem, security
    capabilities are built into cyber devices in a way that allows preventive and
    defensive courses of action to be coordinated within and among communities of
    devices. Power is distributed among participants, and near-real time coordination
    is enabled by combining the innate and interoperable capabilities of individual
    devices with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies.
    To illuminate such a cyber ecosystem in action, one might look at today''s practice
    known as “continuous monitoring,” in which system managers use a variety of software
    products to automatically detect and report known security vulnerabilities in
    network nodes. In some cases, system managers further configure their systems
    to automatically remediate detected security deficiencies. To offer an analogy,
    continuous monitoring is to a healthy cyber ecosystem as smoke detectors and sprinkler
    systems are to a “smart” building. At the other end of sophistication in the orderly
    management of a complex system, we draw inspiration from the human body''s immune
    system. To paint a picture that mirrors the body''s ability to defend itself is
    complex. It might include layered defenses and countermeasures that work in tandem;
    specialized roles; powerful methods for rapidly identifying attackers; surge capabilities;
    and the ability to learn and rapidly adapt. A companion analogy may be made to
    the public health system and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    Here, cyber equivalent functions might include threat and incident watch, data
    dissemination, threat analysis, intervention recommendations, and coordination
    of preventive actions. Automation is one of three interdependent building blocks
    of a healthy cyber ecosystem, along with interoperability and authentication.
    Automation can increase speed of action, optimize decision making, and ease adoption
    of new security solutions. A healthy cyber ecosystem might employ an automation
    strategy of fixed, local defenses supported by mobile and global defenses at multiple
    levels. Such a strategy could enable the cyber ecosystem to sustain itself and
    supported missions while fighting through attacks. Further, it could enable the
    ecosystem to continuously strengthen itself against the cyber equivalent of autoimmune
    disorders. Interoperability can broaden and strengthen collaboration, create new
    intelligence, hasten and spread learning, and improve situational awareness. This
    paper posits three types of interoperability - semantic (i.e., shared lexicon
    based on common understanding), technical, and policy - as fundamental to integrating
    disparate cyber participants into a comprehensive cyber defense system. It examines
    how the cybersecurity community has achieved some early successes by explicitly
    separating the management of security information from the management of security
    functions in an approach called security content automation. Such successes include:
    developing naming conventions and shared lists and catalogs of the fundamental
    elements that we identify here as the ecosystem; creating and using machine readable
    languages and formats for expressing security policies or encoding security transactions;
    and developing and using knowledge repositories for best practices, benchmarks,
    profiles, standards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules and principles,
    among others. The paper also looks at some challenges associated with expanding
    this approach to ensure a widely distributed, automated, collective defense. Authentication
    can improve trust in ways that enhance privacy and decision making. It is integral
    to many capabilities beyond cyber defense, and the paper looks to the emerging
    National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), detailed below,
    to build a shared foundation. The paper calls for identification and authentication
    technologies that deliver across five operational objectives: security, affordability,
    ease of use and administration, scalability, and interoperability. Additionally,
    the paper calls for consumer guides that rate technologies across all five objectives
    and assist system developers and owners in making phased improvements and selections.
    For automated cyber defense, it calls for strong standards-based device authentication,
    including for software, handheld devices, and small, often wireless, devices composing
    massively scalable grids. The paper also draws on current research on network-enabled
    enterprises that is recasting traditional notions of command and control in the
    direction of focus and convergence. Focus provides the context and defines the
    purposes of an endeavor, but is agnostic regarding who might be in charge or particular
    lines of authority. Convergence refers to the goal-seeking process that guides
    actions and effects, but recognizes that control works in an unconventional manner
    in highly distributed systems. The paper presents a five-level maturity model
    for ecosystem focus and convergence that is associated with increasing agility
    and provides an approach for defining how to achieve and employ these various
    levels. Ecosystem maturity is further explored through a discussion of healthy
    attributes-eight for the ecosystem and eighteen for participants and exchanges.
    The paper concludes with a brief discussion of incentives and recommendations
    for the way ahead. It posits that the slow adoption of available best practices
    and technologies in the face of increasing cyber attacks indicates an imbalance
    of incentives and proposes that better and more widely disseminated aggregated
    and anonymized information about the frequency and actual harm of cyber attacks
    is needed. Despite the many open questions remaining, the field is ripe for planning
    and action.'
